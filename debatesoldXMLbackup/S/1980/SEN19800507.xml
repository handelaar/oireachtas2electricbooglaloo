      <P>I have notice from Senator Connaughton that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The streamlining of policies to secure uniformity of approach by the authorities involved in plans for slatted cow-houses.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>I should like to put on the record of the House that the practice followed when the House agrees to a motion is that copies of it are sent to the Secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach and to the Secretary of such other Department or Departments as have official responsibilities in relation to the subject matter of the motion.  In the debate on 16 April 1980 on a motion which was agreed to, welcoming the emergence of the Zimbabwean Republic in the names of Senators Keating and Robinson, the view was expressed that copies of the motion should be communicated to the Zimbabwean authorities.  In view of these remarks, the Department of Foreign Affairs, to whom a copy of the resolution was sent, were asked what action they would be taking regarding it.  The Department stated that a copy would be sent by diplomatic channels to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Zimbabwe, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, with a request that the text be communicated to the Zimbabwean Parliament.  It may be added that it is open to the House to direct the Cathaoirleach to communicate the text of a resolution, such as that on Zimbabwe, to the Parliament concerned.  The most appropriate way to do this would be to incorporate the direction in the resolution.</P>

      <P>The measure before the House is a short enabling Bill which proposes to increase by £25 million the amount of land bonds which may be created by the Minister for Finance.  The present statutory limit of £80 million has been reached and authority for the creation of additional bonds is now urgently required to enable the work of land settlement to proceed.</P>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, bonds are used by the Land Commission to pay for lands acquired and also to service the costs fund out of which vendors may be recouped the cost of the sale of lands to the commission.  Bonds are created by the Minister for Finance by periodic orders&mdash;usually on an annual basis&mdash;and these orders fix the rate of interest appropriate to each particular series.  The most recent order, made in January last, created bonds with an interest rate of 16½ per cent.</P>
      <P>Successive Ministers have expressed reservations about the use of bonds as a medium of payment for lands acquired. Similar sentiments were expressed by Deputies from both sides of the House during the passage of the present Bill through the Dáil.  As I said in my opening speech to that House, this is a view with which I have some sympathy since, to put it mildly, land bonds have not always held their value on the stock market.  However, the land bond system&mdash;though open to question nowadays&mdash;has stood the test of time and, since its introduction in 1923, has paid for some 1.35 million acres acquired for the enlargement and improvement of undersized holdings.</P>
      <P>It would, of course, be more universally acceptable if all acquired lands could be paid for in cash, but we have to be realistic and face up to the fact that this is just not possible in the present financial climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as I stated in the Dáil the present Bill is essentially an interim measure.  The general question of land reform has been under review and proposals for certain policy changes have been formulated for consideration <Col N="110" /> by the Government.  In the meantime, the existing programme of land settlement which, of course, operates primarily in the interests of smaller farmers in need of extra land goes on and it is for this work that the additional bonds are needed.</P>
    <P>Previous Land Bond Bills obtained a speedy passage through the Seanad and I would ask the House to extend the same courtesy on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have been given this opportunity to speak on the Land Bond Bill.  I note the reservations the Minister has about land bonds and I propose to dwell at reasonable length on the reasons why land bonds should be abolished.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about land bonds, Land Commission policy as we know it and the direction the Government seem to be going in.  It is not in the best interests of small farmers.  I am also concerned by successive statements made by various Ministers in the last five or six months.  These and the present Bill would indicate that the Land Commission acquisition policy seems to be on the way out.  It appears that there are a number of acres that have to be paid for. If one were to judge by the traffic in acquisition proceedings at the regional offices of the Land Commission, it would appear that we are now witnessing almost the last Land Bond Bill that will be before this House.  The very simple reason is that the Land Commission will not have land.  In other words, the land bank will be run down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, the Minister of State and the Minister for Agriculture are at great pains both in the Dáil and in the Seanad to say that the machinery by which land is given out to small farmers has been improved and that the tempo has been increased to get rid of land.  At the same time, they are saying publicly that the Government are not designedly running down the Land Commission and that the acquisition programme is still active and still going on.  As far as I am concerned that line of action and those statements are untrue.  I could give a hundred examples of where the Land <Col N="111" /> Commission would have been only too delighted, and it would have been within their brief to do so, in the last two or three years to take over land to relieve congestion and now they will not look at it.  Any politician doing any kind of constituency work will bear out what I have to say.</P>
    <P>We are told that we have to await the outcome of the Government's land policy and we all await that with great interest.  In fact we have been waiting for it now for a couple of years.  We had a change of Minister for Agriculture at the end of 1979.  It might well be that the new Minister for Agriculture and his Ministers of State might not have agreed with what Deputy Gibbons had in that package.  If I am to judge by so called leaks and rumblings, I hope the Ministers of today will not accept some of the items I believe to be in that package.</P>
    <P>It could be stated that the decision by the Government to run down the Land Commission in their acquisition proceedings might be to get farmers acclimatised to the idea that from now on they need not look to a Government agency to acquire land on their behalf. By the time the new land policy becomes law, they will believe that farmers will be so acclimatised to the idea that it will go through fairly peacefully.  I should like to put it on record that for as long as I represent an area of small farmers, there is no way I can accept that the running down of an acquisition programme is the right way to help them.  There are certain things wrong with the Land Commission. Every farmer knows that.  We know that they have been terribly slow in getting land through the machinery and getting it divided.  They have got a bad name for land bonds.  At the same time, the Land Commission, over the years, have been the only saviour a small farmer without money had against the hue and cry of people who were in a better position to make a living either as big farmers or as professionals or as both.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to reassure the nation that, for all practical purposes, any small farmer left to his <Col N="112" /> own resources will be in a position to obtain land at a reasonable price.  If that is not so I would appreciate it being said today by the Minister.  If the Land Commission machinery is being ground to a halt as far as acquisition is concerned the Minister should stand up and say so today so that no farmer will be under a misconception as to where he stands. There is not a day or a night in the year when constituents are not asking me to make representations to the Land Commission to get various estates acquired. The local offices are bombarded with such representations.  They do their job, they report to Dublin but we never hear a word about it.  This has reached serious proportions.  If nothing else comes out of this debate today, at least let the farmers know where they are.  We have had too much double-talk for the last eight to 12 months and it is time to clear the decks.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives us ample evidence that the Land Commission are getting out of business.  I understand that 23,500 acres were acquired in 1979.  The Minister is on record as saying that a further 40,000 acres are in the pipeline.  For the benefit of people who might not necessarily know what is involved, one could say that in a year when one had 63,000 acres on one's hands, the Land Commission had been very active from an acquisition point of view, but for anyone who understands the procedure it takes between 18 months and three years in some cases before the initial acquisition proceedings start and finish before a farmer gets the land bonds into his hand.  What we are talking about today and what the £25 million is earmarked for are lands that have already been acquired or are in the process of being acquired.</P>
    <P>I should like to be given the initial acquisition figures for the last six months. They would show a dramatic downturn. I should also like to bring to the notice of the House that we have now arrived at a limbo situation.  It is not alone theoretically possible but absolutely possible for a non-national, an Arab or an African, to purchase land, pay double the price for it, get his deeds and start farming.  Is that programme in the best <Col N="113" /> interest of Irish agriculture?  There is not much point in a Minister telling me that because there are so many land bonds and £25 million in the pipeline that we are progressing along that line.  We are not and it is important to realise that we are in a limbo situation.  On one hand we are told to wait for the new Government directive on land policy and on the other hand, we are finding out that we are paying for land which was acquired two or three years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Land bonds are unjust, unsocial and above all unfair. What other section of the community would sell their property to anybody for anything less than money into their hands?  There would be an absolute outcry if a person residing in a town was asked or commanded to sell his private house in return for building bonds, if there was such bonds.  People would not accept that.  Through the years, for some unknown reason, farmers reluctantly had to take land bonds.  How constitutional are land bonds?  When cases that have stood the test of time are <Col N="114" /> brought before the Supreme Court with devastating results, is the time now ripe for the Irish Farmers Association or any group of Irish farmers&mdash;it is something an individual could not do&mdash;to bring the standing of land bonds <i>vis-á-vis</i> property bought to the Supreme Court?  Land bonds have caused enough hardship over the years.  When money is so valuable a very good case could be brought to test whether they are constitutional or not.  I look forward to the day when a group like the IFA will come forward and do that.</P>
      <P>What about farmers who sold to the Land Commission through land bonds ten, 12 or 15 years ago?  Those people actually hold land bonds worth 5 or 6 per cent at present.  They are way below par when they are sold on the stock exchange. In other words, a man who would have got £20,000 for his farm ten or 12 years ago could, if he sells the bonds ten years later, suffer a loss.  Many people are in possession of what I would call toy paper money.  It is a sad day when this is allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>It is well to remember too, that this is not exactly a party political problem. Successive Governments and various Ministers for Agriculture and for Lands have said that they are not in favour of them.  Considering that we had several Governments since land bonds were introduced it would appear that there is some greater authority ensuring that the finance needed for land restructuring will not materialise.  It would appear that over the years the Departments of Agriculture and Lands were under the thumb of the Department of Finance. The necessary money to finance a proper land restructuring policy in this country has always been the Cinderella of every single budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To make a comparison, if there was as much thought about the Land Commission in years gone by, from a financial point of view, as there has been about CIE then there would be some restructured agricultural arena now.  The restructuring of land has always been regarded as a Cinderalla in that one came to it when every other Department was fixed up.  That goes for every <Col N="115" /> Government I can remember.  While we have the problem in rural Ireland of fragmented holdings and so on one will never get over the problem until there is enough money to put into the restructuring process.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the most maligned Government body of all time is the Land Commission and, in certain areas, I agree with this.  Their performance on occasions has been terrible. There is a great bank of expertise there at present but I believe it will be used in the wrong way.  In so far as it goes, we have no problem in allowing the extra £25 million through.  Whatever else can be done, this should be converted into legal tender so that from the recipient's point of view he will not lose money. From a legal point of view I do not know how one would go about it.  A man who is entitled to sell land to the Land Commission is entitled to be paid for it and when he redeems the land bonds he should get his money in full.  Over the years this has not happened.  It is clearly a business principle that the man who is selling should have the same rights as the person or the commission or authority who is buying.</P>
    <P>Elderly farmers traditionally have been the people who have been selling their land because they were coming to retirement age and so on.  Like those on social welfare they are the only lobby that have not a punch or kick in this day and age.  I have no doubt that if land was taken off the new aspirants into farming over the years and paid for in land bonds, if they were subjected to this sort of abuse, land bonds would have been finished.  There was not enough of a kick in the people who were getting out of farming. They were old and were not organised.  The first group to bring it to the Supreme Court will, by and large, be successful.</P>
    <P>The Minister, through the Department, should give some kind of undertaking that land bonds that are presently being issued will not lose their value, There should be a Government subsidy or guarantee to ensure that since we cannot <Col N="116" /> scrap land bonds altogether they will be as valuable to their owners as money would be in a normal deal.</P>
    <P>It has come to my notice on a number of occasions that people whose land was purchased by the Land Commission, because of title difficulties, had neither the land nor the value of the land bonds. I will give an example of a man who sold his place for £18,000 two and a half years ago.  He was credited with the land bonds in due course.  He was an old age pensioner and because he had to his credit somewhere in Dublin, in the Central Bank, or in the Land Commission, £18,000 worth of land bonds, the Department of Social Welfare saw fit not to give him a pension.  On the other hand, because there was a problem with the title of his place which took the legal people a long time to solve he could not get credit or the interest on the land bonds. Were it not for the Western Health Board who stepped in for five or six months to pay him a few pounds a week subsistence allowance, this man would have been in dire straits.  He had the galling experience on top of that of watching the local Land Commission office come down last year to set his land for 11 months, and he could neither get a pension nor credit from his land bonds.  I understand that that is not an isolated incident. One could argue that a man should not sell to the Land Commission until his title is in order but what can one do in the case of a man of that age?  If it is suitable for the Land Commission to acquire the land one would assume that their legal department would fix that up fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill.  Land has to be paid for but I make a very strong appeal that the value of those land bonds be held at the value of the day, irrespective of what happens in the stock market, and that this will be the last issue of land bonds, in other words that the next time we are dealing with this matter here there will be a proposal to pay farmers in money, which they are entitled to have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Senators in welcoming the Bill.  The increase by £25 million is conservative <Col N="117" /> in view of the present day price of land.  I would not go along with the gloomy predictions of the previous speaker and criticise land bonds and their value.  If we all played that record we could perpetrate serious injustice.  We should forget about the difficult history of land bonds because one can go into the difficult history of any other Government Department.  If we look at them on merit today, land bonds might have as high a value as the pound note or the dollar or the guilder or any of the other currencies floating about.  I would be very slow to criticise the land bond.  A properly organised land bond should retain its value and its interest and should be a solid investment.  We have very little knowledge of the future and perhaps it is reasonable to expect criticism and gloomy predictions from one who is in Opposition.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell the Minister and the Land Commission that there is a major role for the Land Commission to play in Ireland, especially in the west and the part of Ireland that I come from.  I should like to encourage them to investigate further the many holdings that they should be considering taking over and the many people who have kept themselves aloof from their land being taken over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very big bread and butter basic area.  The State is involved and so is the livelihood of our people. The people who depend on the land for a living are at stake.  I would like to encourage the proper financing of the Land Commission, to see it supported 100 per cent by the Oireachtas.  A serious injustice has been done to many of our people who have not enough land to eke out a living, and while we have that situation we should be actively pursuing and encouraging every conceivable support that we can muster for the Land Commission. They have not always done as good a job as they could have done.  I have seen many failures in the Land Commission and I would say that one has been their shortage of finance and accordingly they had to cut their cloth <Col N="118" /> like other Departments.  That would largely be the criticism that we could make&mdash;that they were always short of finance.  I hope the Minister will see that they still have a very big role to play in Ireland, especially in the west where we have people coming in who can invest money and acquire land at the expense of the landless people.  That land is outside the reach of those who have worked on the land for generations.  It is unnecessary to stress the importance of this aspect of the job the Land Commission have to do.  I sincerely hope that the previous speaker and his predictions are wrong, that this will not be the last such Bill.  New ways of financing and supporting the Land Commission in the ever-increasing importance of the role they have to play will have to be found.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a step forward.  There is a long way to go before we will have solved all of the difficulties attached to the allocation and the ownership of land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill, but I was nevertheless surprised at the brevity of the Minister's speech introducing it.  The purpose of the Bill is straightforward enough.  It would increase by £25 million the land bonds which can be created by the Minister for Finance to pay for lands acquired by the Land Commission.  The fact that we are being invited to consider increasing the amount that can be turned into land bonds calls in question the effectiveness of the system of purchase by land bonds and indeed the procedure of land restructuring under the Land Commission.  This is an extremely important area, an extremely important issue.  It is possibly one of the most important areas for economic and social reform in this country and one closest to the heart of every Irish person.  Even every city person would consider that the whole question of the use of our land is of vital importance to us as a nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are criticisms from two sides that can be made of the present system, and they should be made in the context of seeking to enlarge the fund from which to create land bonds.  The first criticism has been mentioned by <Col N="119" /> Senators.  It is that the value of the land bonds is very often, I think at the moment inevitably, less than the value would be if cash was paid at the time&mdash;if money was paid rather than land bonds issued.  That means that the person is getting less than the value stated to that person for the land being acquired compulsorily. Even if notionally the person may be able to redeem for full value in the future, effectively the person is not getting the full value, and this naturally causes a lot of resentment and criticism. That is one side of the picture.</P>
    <P>There is also, I believe, another problem on the other side.  It is one which should cause at least as much, if not in a sense more, concern and it is that the scheme is not working as well as it should be for the benefit of smallholders.  The Minister in his very brief speech referred to the fact that the existing programme of land settlement operates primarily in the interests of smaller farmers and as the need for extra land goes on it is for this work that the additional funds are needed.  I question very much whether the very high rent which farmers have to pay in circumstances where they take land which has been compulsorily acquired would allow smallholders to rent land from the Land Commission.  I have heard of rents of as much as £300 or £400 a year for such land and that is the kind of money which a smallholder cannot find and cannot commit himself to.  This is a very worrying deterrent to the genuine smallholder who needs the additional land in order to carry out reform and land development and land restructuring. He is prevented by the cost of the land from being able to avail of what would otherwise be a very desirable social policy.</P>
    <P>We have, then, a system which appears to be unsatisfactory in its operation from two sides.  In a way, the danger of this is that you have what might be described as a double deterrent because the person who owns the land which the Land Commission are seeking to acquire, if he believes that injustice is being done to him, if he has an aversion, as a <Col N="120" /> lot of people in those circumstances have to being paid in land bonds, will fight tooth and nail, to the last forum which he can go on the fixing of the price. Ultimately his appeal from the lay commissioners goes to the judicial commissioner and then it has to come back for the fixing of the price.  Years can pass while this procedure is in operation and quite often I believe it is because the person is not so much opposing the acquisition of the land as opposing payment in land bonds.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the possibility of constitutional action.  As I am sure the Minister is aware, a case was heard before the High Court last February challenging the constitutionality both of the procedures of the Land Commission and the payment by land bonds and I understand that judgment in the High Court will be given on this in the very near future.  Following that presumably, inevitably there will be an appeal to the Supreme Court.  The system of payment by land bonds has been sufficiently unattractive to one particular person affected by it for that person to institute proceedings.  Other proceedings have issued as well.</P>
    <P>Also there is a deterrent to the very people we should be most concerned about, the smallholders, who need help in restructuring and developing their land, who are very badly affected by some policies at the European Community level, particularly in relation to dairy farming, and are not helped to any considerable extent by other policies at the European Community level such as the farm modernisation scheme or other schemes which are pitched at a higher level that will not be of help to the smallholder.  So we should be ensuring in our approach to land restructuring to develop the full potential of our land, fair access to the resources of the land.  We should be striving for a very well defined and structured land policy to ensure that the people whom we want to see able to acquire land will be in a position not just to have it made notionally available to them if they could pay a very high rent but positively to encourage them by <Col N="121" /> providing interest free money so that they can acquire land and develop their existing holdings&mdash;people who have a healthy potential for the full use of the land to make a reasonable living for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred very briefly and obliquely to the general question of land reform which, he said, has been under review, and that proposals for certain policy changes have been formulated for consideration by the Government.  This is a matter of critical urgency.  If the decision in the High Court is to be to the effect that the particular procedures of the Land Commission in acquiring land compulsorily on the payment of land bonds is unconstitutional, then we will have another example of the courts making it necessary for the Oireachtas subsequently to come forward with proposals for reform.</P>
    <P>Recently, we have had a number of examples of this, most notably in the married couple's taxation case.  When are we to get the situation where it is the Oireachtas, and the Government of the day, that will give the lead in the kind of reform that is necessary?  The kind of reform we should be concerned about is one that ties in with the policies of the European Community level and that not only complements those policies but also redresses the imbalance in those policies. We should be thinking of a radical approach to land reform and to structural reform and land use which would place the emphasis on ensuring that the smallholder will have the reality of increasing his holding, of developing it and of being encouraged and assisted in doing this.</P>
    <P>What we are seeing in relation to land at the moment is not a very healthy development.  We should be deeply concerned about all the effects of land restructure in Ireland, not just the Land Commission and their procedures&mdash;they are only part of the whole approach&mdash;but the very high cost of land itself and the whole area of the uncontrolled price and speculative capitalists' profits on building land.  The conversion <Col N="122" /> of agricultural land into building land is another issue of direct and immediate concern, even as near as County Dublin, if one is to judge by the recent proposal in Dublin County Council to convert a large area of agricultural land into building land, and to do so for the profit of a member of the county council.</P>
    <P>The kind of approach to land reform and to the kind of structures which would release land to those who need it, who live in the area, who have a right to a fair standard of living in that area for themselves and their families, will not come about if it is surrounded by deterrents at both ends, as I have explained. If there is the deterrent to the person whose land has been acquired that the land will be paid for in land bonds of less value than the value nominally placed on the land for the purposes of acquisition, and if the land will not be made available to the smallholder, the person who ought to be put on priority as far as getting the land is concerned, because of the high rent involved and because of the high cost of money, the smallholder seeking to enlarge and develop what is still in fact a small holding, cannot find that money, cannot find that rent.</P>
    <P>I was surprised by the brevity and lack of substance in the Minister's speech.  Perhaps in his reply he might be prepared to give some indication of the Government's approach to land reform, what kind of approach they are thinking of adopting.  He need not reveal any secrets to us of the small print of any draft Bill which the Government may be contemplating.  This is an area where it is important for us to know that the Government appreciate the urgency of land reform and land restructuring so that we can monitor very closely what is happening.  Some of us have been aggrieved by the policies coming to us from the European Community level which undoubtedly help best those who are already developed or, in our terms, fairly modern in their approach to farming, keeping accounts and so on. We need to be extremely clear about where the priority should lie in relation <Col N="123" /> to our approach to land itself, to land use and to land structure.</P>
    <P>The Minister could have used the opportunity of this Bill to give us some indication of Government thinking on the matter and some idea of the time scale. Is there to be a measure introducing substantial land reform during 1980? Perhaps the Minister could indicate that in his reply.  This is a measure which has one specific aim in mind.  It is a very temporary measure and I would agree that it is on the cards the courts may declare it to be unconstitutional.  In any case, the whole approach has outlived its usefulness.  I do not believe the Bill is radical enough to achieve the kind of purposes that I have been talking about&mdash;genuine land reform and restructuring needed in order to develop the full potential of land and in order that those who have most right and most entitlement to land can acquire it and develop it for themselves and their families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill and I do not understand the expressions of panic and doom from the other side in relation to the Land Commission.  The fact that another £25 million is required to carry on the acquisition of land by the Land Commission is an indication that land is being acquired by the Land Commission. Listening to Senator Connaughton one would think that the doors are being closed and that the Land Commission have gone on a permanent holiday. I understand that they are still working in Davitt House and in every other Land Commission office throughout the country.  It might be well for him to remember that the land bond system was introduced by a Cumann na nGaedheal Government in 1923.  Many successive Governments had the option of changing the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not happy with the land bond system.  We should have an optional system of payment for land, but the abandoning of land bonds at this time would not serve any useful purpose.  A person selling land to the Land Commission should have the option of receiving <Col N="124" /> either cash or bonds.  Most people selling land to the Land Commission are people who are getting out of land and if they get money instead of bonds from the Land Commission their first chore will be reinvestment of that capital.  Where will they get 16½ per cent immediately in any other agency in which they could invest their money right away?  They are the reasons I would welcome the retention of the land bond system with an option to sell for cash if the person selling to the Land Commission required the cash for any other purpose.  Most of the people getting out of land will not be repurchasing land: they are people in the higher age group who will not be pursuing an agricultural future.  That type of person would welcome some type of system where his money would be assured and guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The cost mentioned by Senator Robinson of land to small farmers is governed by the amount of money paid in the initial instance by the Land Commission, plus the rearrangements of allotments, plus the fencing of that holding.  It all goes on to the rent and it is valued in an open market.  That is the reason for the high cost.  It is costly for people getting land today and indeed some people in receipt of social welfare may be considering whether they should avail of such land because of the high cost.  However, any productive farmer, regardless of the cost, welcomes any addition to his holding to make it viable because if he is on the 11-month grazing system it is costing a very sizeable amount of money.  No matter what it costs, if it becomes his own I think that it is more profitable to the farmer finally.</P>
    <P>I am sure there is a Bill in the pipeline&mdash;we do not know anything about it yet and the Minister may not know anything about it either at this stage&mdash;and I would welcome a restructuring of the whole system.  The delay between the Land Commission acquiring land and its distribution is something that we feel very strongly about.  Land, immediately it is taken over by the Land Commission, tends to deteriorate and by the time the farmer gets hold of it it takes <Col N="125" /> him years to get it back to any measure of fertility.  I would welcome the shortest possible period the land bank would be held by the Land Commission.  Its distribution should come as quickly as possible because of the vast deterioration. We had a policy in the past whereby land was in the possession of the Land Commission up to 30 years in places.  I know of cases where it was held for 27 years and 28 years.  I think that is disgraceful.  That system should be abolished.</P>
    <P>I welcome this short Bill to enable the Minister to increase by £25 million the amount available for land bonds to carry on the work of acquisition and disrtibution of land to the small farmer community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Government have found it necessary to introduce this Bill, not because I am opposed to the Land Commission but because I think that before the Land Commission can become really popular or acceptable or appreciated they will have to compete for land and buy land in the market place and for cash. Memories, especially in rural Ireland, are long and if you go back to 1923, as the previous speaker said, the 4 per cent land bond and, indeed, the five and the six per cent bonds by which property was acquired compulsorily were a grave injustice.  We have been looking forward to a new style effort by the Land Commission and I think land bonds are outdated. It must be disappointing for the many excellent Land Commission officers&mdash;I can only speak for those who work throughout the country, the inspectors in charge and the inspectors&mdash;whose work has been frustrated over the past few years because they find that they are not able to make the progress that clearly it was intended the Land Commission should make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the previous speakers mentioned the rent.  In the last two or three years rent has gone as high as £140 an acre.  I would ask the Minister to consider seriously looking at high rent to see <Col N="126" /> if it could be subsidised in some way because it is uneconomic and it is not possible to make a profit from such land at the present time.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Land Commission to update their policies and practices so that they could operate effectively in the interest of the ideals for which they were established is regrettable.  There is a tremendous amount of work to be done. Over the past 100 years successive generations of farmers have enjoyed the guarantees and the privileges of the three Fs&mdash;free sale, fixity of tenure and fair rent.  If one looks at the situation closely one finds that only in the Land Acts have there been transgressions against those great principles that brought so much peace and harmony to our country.</P>
    <P>The idea of compulsory acquisition of property, especially for land bonds&mdash;I am glad the land bonds have gone up to 16½ per cent, but one can get that from any of the ordinary commerical banking institutions at the present time&mdash;is unfair. If the Minister is bringing in another Bill&mdash;I hope this is a short-term measure&mdash;I hope he will try in some way to index the interest rate or the value over even a 15 or 20 years period, because the people who are paying the rents on the land, £140 an acre and over a 30-year period, certainly are contributing more than 16 per cent profit to the Land Commission.  I know the Land Commission are not in the profit business, but the people who are purchasing out their holdings or the additions to their holdings are paying much more to the Land Commission than the Land Commission are paying to the people from whom they compulsorily acquired the holdings.</P>
    <P>If the Land Commission were to embark on a policy of giving people the option to be paid or compensated for their property by cash or by bonds then land would become available for the purposes of the Land Commission much more readily and very much quicker.  It would ease the problem of redistribution in many parts of the country.  I hope that it is not this small Bill that is responsible <Col N="127" /> for the very few holdings that have been taken into the Land Commission system over the last year and a half.  The number of acres on stream has fallen considerably. The number of notices under section 40 that have been served in my own constituency in the past year and a half have been very few&mdash;you could count them on the fingers of one hand.  If the inactivity of the acquisition section of the Land Commission has been encouraged by this two-section Bill, then it is highly regrettable.</P>
    <P>I would just like to re-echo the point that I am very much against the entire concept of bonds.  I think that people who have property, whether they be rural or urban people, are entitled to be paid hard cash for that and as well as that I think the payments could be made a little more promptly.  The case which was mentioned by Senator Connaughton is certainly not an isolated case by any manner or means and since so many of the people who find themselves involved with the acquisition branch of the Land Commission are elderly farmers, senior citizens who have served the country well over the years, I think in fairness to them that they should be spared as much worry as possible.  One way of doing that is to facilitate the business transaction, to have the legal transfer completed as expeditiously as possible and it should be possible to do that in a matter of weeks or months and not have it dragging on for two or three years leaving people literally without any income whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister success in his role. I know he has been thinking about the land reform problem but I am disappointed that is was not a more comprehensive Bill he introduced rather than this very short stop-gap operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long on this matter, but I would like to bring to the Minister's notice the fact that the manner in which lands are acquired has been the cause of certain problems for people, would-be allottees and people who have had their land taken over by the Land Commission in circumstances where bonds have <Col N="128" /> been presented to them in payment.  The payment over a considerable length of time has not been anything near the face value at which the particular bond was priced on allocation.  In the early days of land acquisition you were dealing with a landlord's broad acres from which several reasonable-sized farms could be acquired and provided for farmers who were either losing employment in consequence of the land being divided and having the first claim on it, or people who were small, uneconomic landholders in the adjoining areas.  Now those days are gone.  I think the Minister will agree that in his county and in mv county, and in Connacht and Munster as well, the pattern of land acquisition is on the basis of two, three or four smallholdings becoming available either in consequence of the families having passed on or the retirement proposals that were initiated when we joined the EEC whereby old people took money and pensions and the facilities to reside in their home and handed their land over to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>That in itself had the intention of making land more speedily available to young farmers and to young people.  But in recent years, except for what was acquired in that manner, many of the holdings acquired by the Land Commission have been left dormant, so to speak. They are in the ownership of the Land Commission, not being allocated to anybody, being set on the 11-months system and the land is becoming more and more impoverished year after year.  I agree entirely with what Senator O'Toole has said, that if you have a long number of years of grass being let, so to speak, on holdings such as a rather wide ranging farm when a number of people have small areas of it, or where it is not in small areas but where the feeding is very poor for livestock, it is understandable that this land becomes impoverished and run down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the level of interest provided in the bond being sought at the moment.  These terms are reasonable in view of what the Land Commission would be considering as the setting value <Col N="129" /> of the land.  Nevertheless, if you go into any of the investment banks you will get 16½ per cent freely without any problem. As far as the Land Commission are concerned, when they hold this land for six or seven years it means that the money paid out by the Exchequer on this at 16½ per cent for seven years is greater than the principal.  In other words, this long delay in the division of land is a policy that is not expected to&mdash;nor has it been known to&mdash;have great benefits for either the people who give up the land or the people who expect to live on it and rear young families in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I would like to say that if the Minister could speed up the division of the land it would be far more beneficial to the people who would be allotted holdings.  I fail to see how it is that the Land Commission can provide a scheme in ten years' time to divide a farm and in ten months' time&mdash;and ten months might be as much as they might take to do any one farm&mdash;that they could not do the same thing.  It is very difficult to understand how in the early days when huge ranches were taken over from landlords that the Land Commission were able to prepare a scheme in less than two years.  Now, as I said, the areas are small; there may be complications and implications arising from the structure of the holdings and their locations at the present time that make this rate of progress not as readily possible as would be desirable.  Nevertheless, it is a situation where I think the Minister, a farmer from the west, having first hand knowledge of these problems, might be able to speed up the division of land.  I welcome the Bill and I wish him good luck with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the intentions of the Bill while I am equally in sympathy with what Senator Kilbride has just said and with his impatience about the difficulties surrounding the resettlement of land.  I think it is patently obvious to anybody who knows anything about rural Ireland that these problems are very difficult to solve <Col N="130" /> in a humane way.  When it came to the division of large ranches, those which had been vacated by largely absentee landlords, I think one could deal with problems of agrarian reform in a much more expeditious way than one can deal with the problems that now arise from smallholdings in congested areas where a great number of conflicting interests are at work&mdash;the desire sometimes of an older generation to hold on to the land, the impatience of a younger generation, perhaps in a farm next door, to acquire the land and the balance of sympathy between the desire to reform on the one hand and on the other hand the desire not to ride rough-shod over the emotional claims of people to holdings of that kind in that area.  The issue of bonds is by no means a perfect instrument in this connection, but it has one advantage in that it is piecemeal and patient, traditional, and that it has served between one reform stage and another reform stage to keep the process of land resettlement on the road.  It is in that modest sense that I welcome the measure and I think nobody is strenuously opposed to it.</P>
      <P>It struck me during the debate on the entry into the EEC that a certain crude impatience was sometimes expressed particularly from Europe itself and Brussels itself and it became embodied in the phrase &ldquo;transitional farmers&rdquo;.  As somebody who grew up in Leitrim, among farmers who were transitional and less than transitional in many-phases, it struck me that the phrase &ldquo;transitional farmer&rdquo; had about the same delicacy as the phrase &ldquo;terminal cancer&rdquo;.  When we talk about the resettlement of land, the taking over of land for redistribution, I think we should have concern with the feelings of people who have lived there from generation to generation and whose allegiance is to their profession as farmers and these feelings should be respected, and while the instrument envisaged here is not a very powerful or radical instrument, it has its own purpose and its own function while we wait for a more radical and a more far-reaching reform in the whole question of land settlement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is reasonably true that this business of acquiring and distributing land, since the foundation of this State, was operated on a basis of carrot and stick.  The stick was and is still being held out to prevent a landowner exercising his freedom of action with regard to the disposal of his land once the Land Commission put their eyes on his property.  The carrot was traditionally in the form that bonds which could have been, in the twenties, thirties and forties, regarded as a form of payment by a secure method in the sense that offering to landowners a form of security for their old days, would have been an attractive proposition for the acquisition of their land.</P>
      <P>We must look at this carrot and stick method first in its historical context and then in the circumstances of today. The first Land Bond Act was in 1923 in vastly different times from those of the present generation.  It operated in a system whereby landed gentry had an excessive amount of land which the State thought should be acquired from them and should be distributed to small farmholders who had a farm on hand or some property of their own.  The fact that landed gentry were being relieved of a certain amount if not all of their land, was something which did not attract a great amount of sympathy for them at that time.  The present system is a vastly different one, because we have now very complex and local characteristics in operation whereby a farmer who by no means can be regarded as having an excessive amount of land, may have his property sought by the Land Commission tor acquisition and allocation.  That, to me, would be the first reason why we should seek a fairer and more equitable system of compensation in such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stick part of the whole basis on which the Land Commission have operated has not changed.  The farmer is no longer, as he was then, once the Land Commission put their eye on his property, able to dispose of it in a free manner.  People can argue the pros and <Col N="132" /> cons of that.  I think it is always necessary to have some form of compulsion if people are to let their land go for socially desirable purposes.</P>
    <P>It is in regard to the compensation aspect that we must take a closer look.  If circumstances have changed radically since the first Act of 1923, we must also look at the radical change in the form of compensation to the landowners.  I believe that the Land Commission have operated rather well on this very confined basis and on the terms of reference which have been given to them by successive Governments.  They also had to operate in a rough and ready manner, not having any set or preconceived plan of operation for the different localities in the country as regards what land should be acquired at a future date, as regards whether there were progressive small farmers in that locality who might prefer to buy the land when it would come on the market and could be depended upon to utilise that land to its optimum capacity. Under the present system of acquisition by the commission the very progressive small farmer can be penalised; he is not free to acquire on the open market land which he is very capable and very desirous of developing as an extension of his own holding.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the system which we operate in this country is operated in any other country.  Could the Minister give us some indication as to whether other countries operate in regard to this matter of land acquisition and distribution on the same basis as we do?  I am firmly convinced that in our present circumstances, the way the Land Commission operate in acquiring land is not the best way to encourage people to give up land.  After all, we have had even the EEC operating a very attractive pensioning scheme in regard to old farmers. Elderly folk with property could get out of farming altogether and in return receive an attractive pension which they had earned over the years.  It is all very well offering, what is merely a paper figure, but I think people, if given the choice&mdash;I think somebody on the opposite side did say there should be an <Col N="133" /> alternative to bonds, namely, a cash option&mdash;of taking bonds or cash at the present time would go for the cash.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a feeling that the rent charged to farmers who have been allocated land by the Land Commission is regarded generally by these people as rather high.  A common statement that one comes up against is that land from the Land Commission is no longer cheap land.  Nobody expects land in the present situation to be cheap, but if small farmers feel that the rent that they will be asked to pay will inhibit them or will be a deterrent to expand their farms, then the Land Commission should look at this question of the rent that is being required of small farmers when they are given land.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to indicate to us whether the money that is now being given, the extra £25 million under this Bill, will be devoted to acquiring future properties for distribution, or whether it will be used to pay off on properties which have been acquired in the past.  I would also ask him if he could give some indication as to the level of voluntary offers of land by landowners.  Do we have, to any great extent people coming along to the Land Commission and saying: &ldquo;Here is my property; I will give it to the Land Commission if they are prepared to take it&rdquo;?  That could be a guide as to whether this whole system as it operates at present is moulded in the right way to make our system of acquisition and distribution of land the most attractive one that we can have.</P>
    <P>There is also a suspicion that the level of activity by the Land Commission in the distribution of the properties they hold is not as brisk as it was in the past. We find in response to representations that we make to the present Minister that lands are being held more or less in a state of limbo for a considerable period. It is unfortunate that in that lengthy state of limbo the land itself is more inclined to deteriorate in its intrinsic quality rather than appreciate.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say except that we should no longer look at the <Col N="134" /> operation of this system in the context in which it has operated since 1923.  The circumstances were radically different then and we should seriously consider overhauling the entire basis of the carrot and stick I mentioned earlier on which this socially desirable business of land acquisition and distribution operates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming as I do from a western county where the acquisition and distribution of land over the past 50 years has been a feature of farming, I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on this Bill.  The purpose of the Bill, as the Minister has told us, is to increase the amount of bonds that can be created by the Land Commission by £25 million.  Elsewhere, he has indicated that he hopes this will be adequate to deal with the situation which the Land Commission has to cope with over the next two years.</P>
      <P>I recall that on the last occasion in this House when we debated the creation of land bonds, which I think was the end of June 1978, it was indicated that the Government had looked at the question of land policy and that they were not committed to the continuance of the land policy that had prevailed up to then. The decision had been made in principle to have a land development authority.  They accepted the necessity for the restructuring of land and definite proposals would be before the Government by the end of that year.  The £20 million extra bonds we were creating on that occasion were simply a stop-gap measure to tide us over the situation until the new land development authority came into effect.  Now, two years later, apparently there is very little progress with regard to the creation of the land development authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, to deal with the present Bill and its proposal to get an extra £25 million worth of land bonds, I would like to quantify, to measure as I see it, the effect that £25 million is likely to have on the whole question of land restructuring. We are talking about viable acres.  A reasonable valuation on them at the present time is £2,500 each.  The amount of bonds we are creating in this Bill would <Col N="135" /> be sufficient to acquire about 10,000 acres.  When we are talking about a viable farm we are talking about 100 adjusted acres.  We are, in effect, saying, therefore, that we can measure the effect of this Bill as having the capacity to create about 100 viable farm units.</P>
    <P>This represents a very small dent on a vast problem, the question of land restructuring.  There are statistics to show that there are about 41,000 farms or holdings between five and 15 acres and a further 57,000 holdings between 15 and 30 acres.  Therefore we are talking almost of 100,000 holdings which are, by any standards of normal farming activity, uneconomic holdings and which require, if people are to obtain a satisfactory livelihood from them, adjustment upwards in their size.  There are a further 56,000 holdings between 30 and 50 acres.  Some of these are uneconomic and there is a necessity to provide additional acreage for these holdings if they are to provide a satisfactory livelihood to a family solely dependent on them for their livelihood.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that this Bill does not go any satisfactory distance along the road to providing solutions to that problem.  On the last occasion when we discussed the creation of land bonds there was general acceptance that the Land Commission was not suited in its present structure to meet the challenge of the years before us.  There was one significant difference between the conditions that prevailed then and those that prevail today.  Two years ago, the economic climate in agriculture was positive and progressive.  It was such as would encourage a man on limited acreage to purchase, and indeed to borrow to purchase, additional acres to provide him with a better living.  The situation has changed today for the type of people who are farming on the size of farms that I have mentioned.  I doubt if the circumstances that prevail in agriculture today would be sufficient to encourage them to depend on their own <Col N="136" /> resources entirely to acquire additional land for their holdings.  Therefore, the necessity of a State agency, be it the Land Commission or the proposed land development authority, to fill the vacuum in this situation.  It is only through a State agency that additional land can be provided for the holdings that require it.</P>
    <P>I regard the £25 million extra land bonds that we are creating as having only the capacity to create an extra 100 viable farm units.  We are talking in terms of 100,000 holdings that are uneconomic unless more land is provided for them.  In fact then we are talking of servicing just one person out of every 1,000 worthy applicants.</P>
    <P>Land restructuring had a social aspect also.  There is the need to arrest rural decline.  There is the need to deal with a situation, something that is rapidly taking place over the years in farming, and that is where the economic number of acres tends to rise steadily as time goes on.  More and more farms which a few years ago could be regarded as being of an economic size are now decidedly gone into the uneconomic bracket.  There is also a need to assist the progressive farmer on limited acreage.  Persons who have shown that they have the capacity, the motivation and the management ability to make a satisfactory job of the holdings that they have should be provided with additional acreage to assist them in the very worthwhile job they are doing.</P>
    <P>Many Senators referred to the unacceptability of land bonds and I share totally the views that have been expressed. Land bonds do not appeal to prospective sellers of land and they are no encouragement to land owners to dispose of their holdings for the purpose of distribution in the areas concerned.  No single issue of land bonds has retained its value.  The Minister stated that in January 1980 the last issue of land bonds was created at an interest rate of 16.5 per cent.  An interest rate of 16.5 per cent in May 1980, five months later, will not prove universally attractive to people whose land would be useful and <Col N="137" /> necessary to assist a land restructuring programme in any area.  The only way that the Land Commission can get land satisfactorily and readily is by paying cash for it.  Perhaps there are difficulties there.  When we realise the grave necessity that there is to deal urgently with the question of land restructuring, then we have to face squarely the issue that cash, and cash alone, is the method by which land owners can be best induced to dispose of land which is needed for distribution.  I pay tribute to the work of the Land Commission over the years. Perhaps we have from time to time criticised them, but in general they have done a satisfactory job.  Since 1923 they have acquired and distributed something like 1,350,000 acres and that is an indication of the contribution they have made to the land restructuring problem of the country.  However, I am disappointed at the lack of urgency with which land that they have acquired is distributed.  Other Senators have referred to this.  There is a decided slowness to dispose of land with the inevitable result that the property in question usually deteriorates in value, particularly in the case ot a dwellinghouse and farm buildings on land acquired by the Land Commission.  I hope the Land Commission will be influenced by the criticisms that have been made on that aspect and will ensure, in as far as they can, that the distribution of land and the re-allocation of dwellinghouses and farmyards on land acquired will be dealt with in a more expeditious fashion.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister when replying to the debate will give us a firm indication of the future land policy of the Government. I hope that that policy will recognise that the land of Ireland is our greatest natural resource, that it is far too valuable an asset to be mismanaged, as some of it has been over the years and that steps will be taken to ensure that its management and control will come into the hands of people who have the interest, motivation and ability to manage it properly and productively.</P>
    <P>One thing that has always concerned me is what I describe as the dormant acres, the substantial area of land in this <Col N="138" /> country that is under-utilised and badly farmed.  There is no sight more depressing when driving through rural Ireland than a landscape that is neglected and under-utilised, particularly when it may well surround the productive acres of progressive small farmer.  There are a number of reasons why we have this unproductive land.  It may be due in part to the subject we are talking about, land structure.  More of it probably is due to absentee ownership and perhaps more still to a lack of interest on the part of the people who own it.  It is a delicate subject but land is far too valuable an asset to be allowed to remain in an unproductive and neglected condition.</P>
    <P>One other aspect of land management or land restructuring that was discussed frequently a few years ago and then apparently pushed into the background is the question of long-term leasing.  The long-term leasing of land, perhaps even by a State agency, has merit.  If it is not possible for the Land Commission or a State agency to provide the additional acreage that a progressive farmer requires, and if it is not possible for him from his own resources to purchase that additional land, then the value of long-term leasing for that man is the only option remaining.  Therefore, I hope that the question of long-term leasing will not be pushed into the background.  It is a viable option and it should be pursued.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that, limited though its scope is, I welcome the Bill to the extent that it will help some limited number of farmers to acquire additional land.  I look forward in the near future to seeing a positive land policy and perhaps a State agency committed to a more dynamic and progressive approach to the restructuring of land in Ireland.</P>

      <P>First of all, I want to say how grateful I am to the Senators for their contributions to this Bill.  It is a short Bill, as I said at the outset, but it raises many questions.  I can well understand the anxiety of Members when it comes to discussing any aspect of land policy in this or the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the £25 million <Col N="139" /> which I am looking for here under this Bill is sufficient to carry on the work of the Land Commission for the next two years.  If there is a further need for additional money there is nothing to stop us from coming back here to look for more money, but for the present the £25 million is enough to cover us for at least two years.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the delay by the Land Commission in dividing the many estates which they have on hand, some of them being held for a long period of years.  We all know of the occasional case where lands are held for periods of from two to ten or 15 years. Very often in these cases it is not the Land Commission's fault.  We generally find, when we investigate the reasons for those long delays, that there may be something wrong with the title, or there may be a long legal wrangle with the owner before the Land Commission finally get possession.  In all cases it is absolutely essential that the Land Commission dispose of those lands as fast as possible in order to help the small farmers, for which purpose those lands were acquired in the first instance.  For that reason the Government, last October, directed that the resources of the Land Commission should be directed towards the speedy re-allocation of all those lands which they had on hands over a long period of years.  Last year schemes amounting to about 30,000 acres were prepared by the Land Commission and re-allocated.  This is the type of activity that I would like to see going on.  It is not true that the activities of the Land Commission are being curtailed. This allegation has been made both by Opposition Senators to-day and by Opposition Deputies in the Dáil.  The Government have directed that the Land Commission apply their resources to the re-allocation of land.  At the same time they are continuing to serve section 40 notices, maybe not as fast as they used to, but Senators will appreciate that it is not possible for them to pursue the acquisition of lands as actively as they had been doing over the years when the emphasis was not on the re-allocation.  It <Col N="140" /> is to be hoped that at the end of the two-year period we will have a new land policy in operation.  It is up to the Government when they are introducing this legislation to decide how the new authority are to be financed.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of opposition to land bonds.  We find the same opposition to every land bond Bill that is introduced. Still, successive Governments have continued to maintain this system. Even though the system might seem distasteful to many people, it has enabled the Land Commission to acquire 1.35 million acres of land since it was started in 1923.  The Land Commission could not have undertaken that massive acquisition and resettlement programme were it not for this system of land bonds which has been in operation.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the Land Commission were set up 100 years ago to do a certain job and that circumstances have changed since then.  It is only right and proper that a fresh look would be taken of the Land Commission to make it more suitable for present-day requirements.</P>
    <P>Senator Connaughton spoke about a need for a better bond.  He should bear in mind that when each series is created it must be at such a rate that it will keep its par value for a reasonable period after creation.  We cannot, of course, guarantee indefinite par value.  The interest rate and the ultimate redemption of bonds at par are guaranteed by the State, but the guarantee does not extend to day-to-day market price fluctuations.  This is something we should remember when we speak about those bonds and criticise them.</P>
    <P>Senator Connaughton also mentioned Arabs being able to buy up lands in this country.  An Arab or any non-national buying up land would have to get consent under section 45 of the Land Act, 1965 from the Land Commission.  That consent will not easily be given if the lands are suitable for an ordinary working Irish farmer.  Of course, citizens of the EEC are in a different category.</P>
    <P>As regards the £18,000 case which he quoted, I cannot, of course, comment on <Col N="141" /> the social welfare aspect, but the legal position is that when the Land Commission acquire compulsorily any land, they can move in and take possession and put the bonds to credit.  It is then for the owner to prove his title to the bonds.  This is important, because the law is that all charges and burdens attaching to land before acquisition attach to the land bonds after acquisition.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson and Senator McDonald mentioned the high charges on land allocations.  There is no cheap land any more no matter how one acquires it.  In general the Land Commission must try to recover what they pay for land.  Certainly high interest rate land bonds men higher rate of annuities on allotments.  In the final analysis it is for the Commissioners to fix these prices. We must remember the halving of the annuities in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>When Senators talk about rents, it is necessary to be clear that one can be speaking about two separate things, (1) the rent that the Land Commission will charge for the letting of the lands while those lands remain undivided and (2) the final charge, the annuity that the allottee has to pay when the lands are allotted.  In the case of (1) the rent will be determined to some degree by local rents and, in any event, the Land Commission must charge a sufficiently high rent to cover outgoings on the lands such as servicing those lands, bonds, rates, caretakers and so on.  In the case of (2) we are not really talking about rent, we are talking about a terminable purchase annuity, about 26 years or 16.75 per cent annuity.  The annuities can be high because a 16.5 per cent bond means a 16.75 per cent annuity. A policy of giving dear land out for cheap annuities would involve massive State subsidisation and we could not undertake this at this time.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson asked about the Government's general approach to the land policy.  I cannot, of course, give great detail, but the prime considerations would be encouraging rational land use, channelling land into the hands of really deserving and committed small and medium farmers.  Revision of the EEC <Col N="142" /> directives on farm retirements and modernisation will also be a help.  A revamped retirement scheme should help to unlock much land tied up in the hands of elderly farmers at present.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard mentioned the delay by the Government in bringing in a new land policy.  It is important to bear in mind that the Land Commission have now been in existence for 100 years. This is perhaps the most fundamental review of the policy and procedures of land reform that has ever been undertaken. It will determine the shape of land structure programmes for many years ahead.  For that reason it is important that consideration and consultation be given to all aspects of this new land policy.  It is going to affect a lot of people. We know that any changes that were made previously in any of the Land Acts entailed a lot of discussion both in this House and outside.  It is only right that full consultation would take place with all the interests involved.  Senators will realise that this is legislation which we cannot rush through the House.  It has to take time and there must be consultations. Nevertheless, I hope that that legislation will be before the House before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I have covered the main points made by the Senators.  I want to thank them for the contributions which they have made to this debate.  They all realise the importance of providing this money.  It is in order to keep the Land Commission functioning so that they will be able to pay for any lands they may be acquiring over the next two years.  We have at the moment approximately 64,000 acres on hands and about 40,000 acres at various stages of acquisition.  There is no question of running down the activities of the Land Commission.  The Land Commission have sufficient work to keep them busy for the next two or three years even if we did not acquire one further acre. That is not our intention, and we are serving section 40 notices.  Even though there has been a lot of criticism of the Land Commission for not issuing those section 40 notices, we must accept that the issuing of a section 40 notice does <Col N="143" /> not necessarily mean that acquisition proceedings are going to take place.  The notice merely gives the Land Commission permission to investigate and to see if the land in question comes under the various Land Acts.  We will proceed along those lines.  This £25 million which I am seeking here today will enable us to continue at least for two years and if it is found that it is not sufficient I or somebody else will be back here seeking a further allocation.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable number of amendments have been made to this Bill since it was last before this House.  Some of those amendments arose out of discussion of the Bill in the Dáil, others out of the discussions in this House that preceded the Dáil debates on the Bill, still others out of difficulties that came to notice since the Bill was last before this House or out of observations that were furnished by the Landlord and Tenant Commission on the proposals in the Bill.  In whatever way the amendments <Col N="145" /> arose I hope that Senators will, on consideration of them, agree that they improve the Bill significantly although, of course, some of the amendments bear on the 1978 ground rents legislation rather than on the areas principally covered by this Bill.  For the benefit of Senators, I now propose to outline the general purport and scope of the amendments, and if any Senator should require elaboration in regard to any particular amendment or amendments I will do my best to meet any such requirement when I come to make my closing address to the House.  In relation to every amendment that I do not specifically mention the House may be assured that a drafting amendment only is in question.</P>
      <P>The necessity for amendment No. 1, which widens the scope of the Title of the Bill, arises out of amendments Nos. 38 and 39 and will become clear when I come to deal with those amendments. Amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 5 are designed to resolve a difficulty that arose concerning the effect of the provisions in section 5 (1) (a) (iv) of the Bill.  The amendments are designed to ensure that oral lettings for temporary convenience may come within the scope of the provision as well as lettings of that kind that are made in writing and also to ensure that a successor in title is not prevented from relying, in any appropriate case, on the temporary convenience.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 arose out of an undertaking that was given by my predecessor in this House.  Senators may recall that an Opposition amendment to delete section 4 of the Bill, as introduced, was withdrawn on foot of an undertaking to re-examine the matter.  The amendment that was accepted by the Dáil arose out of that re-examination. The amendment is designed to meet a valid objection that was raised in the Seanad to the total exemption of the State&mdash;as lessor&mdash;from the code of landlord and tenant law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objection relates to the case where an occupational tenant finds that he has become a tenant of the State, possibly without either his knowledge or consent, having previously been a tenant <Col N="146" /> of a private landlord.  In such a situation the tenant would, apart from the amendment that is proposed, find that whereas he could have had rights against his landlord under the landlord and tenant code, those rights have disappeared where a State authority has taken over as landlord.  The amendment proposes that the tenant's existing rights should be preserved in that situation, that is, his right to a renewed occupational tenancy where that right has accrued, and his right to compensation for any improvements he may have carried out.  The right to a new tenancy applies on one occasion only in the circumstances catered for in the amendment.  Following on the grant of that new tenancy the tenant will thenceforth be in the same position as any other tenant of the State and he will not have a statutory right to a further renewal of his tenancy.</P>
    <P>The statutory rights that are being given are restricted to persons who are occupational tenants and are not being extended to ground rent tenants; those, for example, with which Part III of the Bill is concerned.  The rights of ground rent tenants whose landlord is a State authority are catered for separately-in section 70 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 6 is to restrict the scope of subsection (2) of section 5 so that the subsection will apply only where property rented for State purposes is occupied by some branch of the public service.  This amendment meets a point that was raised by Senator FitzGerald on Committee Stage debate.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 updates the original provisions of subsections (3) and (4) of section 5 to cater for modern arrangements involving a property-holding company and a trading company. Amendment No. 8 is a drafting amendment and makes it clear that the exemption of housing authorities from the obligations of the legislation is being preserved except only where business lettings are concerned.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 are of some significance.  Amendment No. 9 makes it clear that, provided there has been business use during a three-year <Col N="147" /> period, the right to a new tenancy applies in two kinds of cases under the provisions of section 13 (i) (a):</P>
    <P>(a)  where an individual person (or firm) has been the occupying tenant for three years, whether under one continuous tenancy or under a series of consecutive tenancies, and</P>
    <P>(b)  where the occupation has been by a tenant together with his predecessors in title, under a single continous tenancy.</P>
    <P>The amendment also rehabilitates a requirement in the corresponding provision of the 1931 Act, that the business use must be bona fide.  The Minister for Justice, on careful consideration of the views expressed by Senators FitzGerald and Molony, came to share their views in this regard.  Amendment No. 10 is possible only because of the redrafting of sections 13 (1) (a) that was involved in amendment No. 9.  Because section 13 (1) (a) now imposes separate requirements on a tenant as to occupation and as to business use for the purposes of acquiring rights under the Bill, a prearranged break in occupation, or tenancy, for the purpose of ensuring that a particular letting remains outside the Bill will still be possible.  At the same time, any break in business use, provided occupation is continuous, may be disregarded by the court if it considers it reasonable to disregard it.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 13, 14, 27 and 28 are designed to make it clear that the requirement as to planning permission in connection with a landlord's rebuilding or redevelopment plans, where that landlord is opposing the grant of either a renewed occupational tenancy or a reversionary lease, is satisfied only by possession of a current, valid planning permission and not by a planning permission that has lapsed.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 15, 17 and 19 arose from an argument put forward in <Col N="148" /> Dáil Eireann, and accepted by the Minister for Justice, that narrow time limits in section 20 could, in practice, delay rather than expedite proceedings in relation to a claim for a new tenancy and moreover could give rise to hardship, since a tenant who failed to serve notice in time would usually be constrained to seek an extension of time under section 83, whatever the expense involved.  The effect of these three amendments is that a tenant's right to serve a valid notice claiming a new tenancy will be preserved for a period of three months, instead of only one month, after service by the landlord of notice of the termination of the tenancy.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 21 and 30 are of some importance.  They make changes in the &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; formulae in relation to renewed occupational tenancies and reversionary leases respectively.  These changes arise out of the findings of the Landlord and Tenant Commission who had been asked by the Minister for Justice to re-examine the &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; formula in the light of the comments made by the Supreme Court in the course of delivering judgment in the case of Byrne v. Loftus concerning that formula as it stands in section 29 (f) of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  That re-examination was still in progress when the Bill was last before this House. The effect of the changes made by the amendments is that &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; will mean, in effect, the open market rent of the property, less the value of the tenant's goodwill.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 22 to 26 concern section 24 which provides for reviews of the rent in cases where the terms of the new tenancy are fixed by the court.  The amendments are of a technical or drafting nature, their purpose being to tighten up the provisions of section 24 in order to ensure that those provisions cannot be operated unfairly, by either landlord or tenant, by reference to the timing of applications for new tenancies and/or rent reviews, and also to clarify the date from which a reviewed rent becomes payable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> Amendment No. 31 is designed to ensure that&mdash;in view of the consideration that a landlord has only one month in which to respond to a tenant's improvement notice&mdash;full information concerning the proposed improvement is made available to that landlord.  The amendment therefore requires that the improvement notice should in every case be accompanied by that information.</P>
    <P>Section 64 was inserted in the Bill in the course of the Committee Stage debate in this House.  The amendment thereto, No. 33, that was made by the Dáil has the effect of extending the definition of &ldquo;lease&rdquo; so as to cover a statutory tenancy on less than a yearly basis that may arise on the expiration of a lease.  Accordingly, the benefit of Part V of the Bill is now extended to statutory tenants who hold over on the expiration of a lease, whether or not that lease was on a yearly basis.</P>
    <P>I now come to a number of new section that have been inserted in the Bill since it was last before this House. Amendments Nos. 35, 36 and 37 affect the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978.  These amendments add to the classes of persons who are given the right to acquire the fee simple.</P>
    <P>Part II of the 1978 No. 2 Act sets out in an intentionally simplified form the classes of ground rent lessees and yearly tenants who are given the right to acquire the fee simple.  Such simplification inevitably carries the risk of excluding unusual cases, cases such as have since come to light and are now catered for by these amendments.  These three amendments ensure that the right to acquire the fee simple is now given to every class of lessee and tenant that has, to date, been identified as having a ground rent-type relationship with the landlord.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 35 extends the right to acquire the fee simple, under Part II of the 1978 No. 2 Act, to a new class of ground rent lessees, that is those lessees to whom Part II of that Act would apply save that they fail to satisfy condition 5 in section 10 of the Act because in their cases the previous lease mentioned in <Col N="150" /> that condition did not expire or was not surrendered before 31 March 1931.  As amended by what is now section 71 of the Bill, condition 5 of section 10 of the 1978 No. 2 Act may apply regardless of the date of expiration or surrender of that previous lease.  This change was recommended by the Landlord and Tenant Commission.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 36 extends the same right to acquire the fee simple to a further new class of ground rent lessees. These lessees are those whose leases would satisfy the conditions in section 9 of the 1978 No. 2 Act and, in particular, condition 7 in section 10 of the Act, save that those leases are for terms of less than 50 years.  Amendment No. 36, however, requires certain other conditions to be satisfied and the effect of the changes made by the amendment is to ensure recognition as a ground rent lease for every lease made for a term of less than 50 years that would be a &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo; as defined by section 7 of the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958.  This change also was recommended by the Landlord and Tenant Commission.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 37 extends the same right to acquire the fee simple to any person to whom section 3 of the 1967 Ground Rents Act applied immediately before the commencement of the 1978 No. 2 Act, or would have applied had he served a notice under section 4 of the 1967 Act.  Section 3 of the 1967 Ground Rents Act, apart from subsection (5) of the section, is repealed by the 1978 No. 2 Act.  Amendment No. 37 restores the right to acquire the fee simple that was given by the 1967 Ground Rents Act in certain unusual types of cases that are not covered by the simplified categories of ground rent leases set out in Part II of the 1978 No. 2 Act.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 38 is one of the amendments&mdash;No. 39 being the other &mdash;that necessitated the widening of the scope of the Title of the Bill.  The purpose of the amendment is to regularise the position concerning certain interests in land that originated prior to the passing of the Renewable Leasehold Conversion Act, 1849.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> A common method of leasing property in Ireland up to the mid-19th century was by the creation of a lease for the terms of the duration of the lives of, usually, three named persons, subject to a rent and covenants, including a covenant by the lessor for the perpetual renewal of the lease for further lives.  The Renewable Leasehold Conversion Act, 1849, declared that any future such leases should operate as fee farm grants of the fee simple.  It also gave to persons then holding under such a lease the right to obtain a fee farm grant, normally at the same rent, in lieu of the lease.</P>
    <P>While many such leases were converted in accordance with the Act, it appears that a number were not so converted. The lessees under such leases have continued in possession and their interests may have become that of yearly tenants with a legal right to obtain a renewal or conversion grant.  A yearly tenancy, even if coupled with a right to obtain a fee farm grant, is not registrable in any of the registers of the Land Registry and although the persons in question have complete security of possession, their titles may not be readily marketable as they might not be acceptable to lending institutions, or to purchasers who might be depending on such institutions to finance the purchase, because of the prospect of the costs that would be involved in conversion or renewal proceedings.</P>
    <P>The amendment puts the parties to the lease on the same footing as if the lease had been converted under the Act of 1949.  It concerns only a lessee who has continued in possession without either conversion to a fee simple or renewal of his lease; such a person has an &ldquo;interest&rdquo; in the land and not an &ldquo;estate&rdquo;.  The new fee simple is deemed to be a graft on the previous interest and is subject to any rights or equities arising from its being such a graft.  This means that the fee simple is subject to the rents and covenants in the previous lease in the same manner as if a conversion had been effected under the Act of 1849.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> Amendment No. 39 is a new provision in landlord and tenant law and is intended to bring the rights of tenants of certain houses provided by public utility societies more into line with the rights enjoyed by occupational tenants generally.  Grants were paid under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 and 1962, to a small number of public utility societies in respect of the erection of houses for letting.  The grants, generally known as &ldquo;public utility society letting grants&rdquo;, were paid subject to a statutory condition that an undertaking be given by the recipient society that the houses would not be sold but would be let on a monthly or lesser tenancy to persons of the working classes or agricultural labourers.  The tenants of the houses in question are, therefore, precluded from purchasing the landlord's rights in their houses even where the landlord is willing to sell.  The general purpose of the amendment is to remove this disability by enabling the houses to be sold within the consent of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to express on behalf of the Minister his appreciation of the diligent consideration that this Bill has received in the Seanad and in the other House.  The Bill is, I feel sure, much the better for the time and energy that was devoted to it by both Houses and by the various professional bodies and individuals who took the trouble to examine its provisions and furnish their observations thereon to the Minister.  In particular, the members of the Landlord and Tenant Commission are deserving of gratitude for their assistance with this complex legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of regret to me and my colleagues that the diligent consideration the Minister mentioned that was given to previous debates cannot now be continued because of our rules and procedure.  The Minister has just delivered an eight page statement, every page and paragraph of which is highly technical in this area of highly <Col N="153" /> technical and complex law.  There were a large number of amendments dealt with by the Minister arising out of the debate in this House and in the other House. Many of these amendments are substantial and make very serious and major changes in the Bill since it left this House.  Quite obviously it is not possible for us to consider these amendments to the degree necessary to ensure a full debate and to ensure that we are satisfied that we fully comprehend the amendments and their effect.  It is not possible to do that having regard to the method of procedure that is open to the House.  I do not blame the Minister or anybody for that.  That is a matter for ourselves to change.  I suggest that the appropriate committee of this House might look at our procedures so that when a large number of technical amendments come back from the other House we will be able to deal with them one by one rather than have an omnibus statement by the Minister which we have to try to assimilate as he is reading it&mdash;an impossible task I must confess&mdash;and reply in a way that has any value or merit towards improving the quality of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the technical nature of these amendments and the number of them, we will have to devise a procedure for ourselves whereby the Minister can deal with each of them individually, give an explanation for it, put it in the context of the Bill and thereby provoke some sort of a worthwhile response from this side of the House.  Possibly I am doing my colleagues an injustice by suggesting that the response from them will be less than worth while but I feel insufficient as regards the response I propose to make.  I shall have to limit it to two matters that I can take up more or less immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first concerns amendments Nos. 9 and 10.  These are amendments to section 13.  Section 13 provides for a right to a new tenancy.  The first part of section 13 gives the conditions in which the new tenancy arises and the second part of that section, subsection (2), as originally drafted provided that an unforeseen <Col N="154" /> and temporary break in the use of the tenement could be disregarded by the court.  The section has been changed substantially as the Minister says.  There are now two conditions to be fulfilled as I read it, but without having time to consider this, my reading may not be accurate.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 13(1)(a) the tenement for the whole of three years had to be continuously in the occupation of the person concerned or his predecessors entitled and the second condition that they be used bona fides wholly or partly for the purpose of carrying on a business.  Subsection (2), which deals with a temporary break, only applies if the temporary break has not been in the occupation but in the use.  I wonder what is the meaning of subsection (2) in making the distinction between occupation and use because I fail to see how use can arise unless there is occupation.  I do not think one can have use without occupation.  One can possibly have legal possession without physical occupation but one cannot use a premises without having physical occupation.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how one can come to disregard use to any benefit of a person where there is a temporary break, which the Landlord and Tenant Commission had in mind, if the condition regarding continuous occupation is not also brought into the same category.  Subsection (2), as I see it, is meaningless because I cannot visualise a situation to which it could apply.  If I am wrong in that, and that is very likely, the question that arises under subsection (2) is that the temporary break in the use shall be disregarded if the court considers it reasonable to disregard it.</P>
    <P>As was raised on Committee Stage, I consider this to be an extraordinary provision.  We are asking the court, without giving it any guidelines to determine what is reasonable.  One cannot give guidelines in a vacuum or in theory. We have to rely on the common sense of the court in the particular case before it and the facts produced to it.  We rely on the good sense of the court to decide <Col N="155" /> what is reasonable between the parties. This seems to be putting an undue burden on the courts and an undue risk on the litigants.  Will the decision of the court with regard to what is reasonable or not be influenced by the standard of advocacy that is produced by either party?  Will it be affected by the court's view of the demeanour and nature of the evidence of either party?  I recall when I was a student studying jurisprudence and giving consideration to the sources of law, we were all very tickled when one theory in the source of the law was told to us.  It was produced by an Amercian school of jurisprudence which acquired the nickname &ldquo;the digestive school of jurisprudence&rdquo;.  It said that one of the main factors in creating law is what they called the inarticulate major premise that might be influencing a particular judge at a particular time.  As an example of what inarticulate major premise might be they said that the judge could be suffering from a severe attack of indigestion. Would such an inarticulate major premise be operating to decide what the court would find reasonable in a particular case?</P>
    <P>Some effort should have been made to give guidelines to the court.  The whole test of the greater hardship would have been an apt test to introduce in this regard.  That is precisely what is involved. The courts should have been directed to decide where the balance of hardship lay.  That might have cured that objection.  I would be glad to hear how the Minister foresees section 13 (2) operating in practice if it only applies to a break in use whereas the break in occupation is not permitted, because subsection 1, paragraph (a) quite specifically says that the occupation must be continuous. I read continuous to mean without a break.</P>
    <P>The other matter concerns the changes proposed in amendments Nos. 21 and 30.  These are the amendments affecting the basis on which a gross rent is to be decided on by the court.  As originally drafted, one of the matters to which the court had to give attention in <Col N="156" /> deciding a gross rent was that the circumstances would be such that there would be a supply of similar tenements sufficient to meet the demand for them and that competition for them would be normal.  That condition was repeating a provision in the existing landlord and tenant code.  The intention was to ensure that in times of abnormal demand or of inflation the court would preclude such abnormal conditions and would approach it on the basis that demand would be normal, supply would be normal and competition would be normal so as to prevent in a particular area the court being coerced by the existence in that area of inflated rents due to some particular circumstances pertinent to that area only.  That was the intention of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the case of Byrne v Loftus.  I confess that I am not familiar with what that case decided.  I seem to recall, but I am subject to correction, that this was a case concerning the fixing of a rent.  The court held that it could take into account the extraordinary situation that had arisen because of the failure to update the law up to now and that it could omit the words which are now proposed to be omitted by the definition and provide for a level of rent that would be out of line with what should be the normal commercial rent, if the law had been changed with the changing times.</P>
    <P>Now that the law is being changed, the circumstances which constrained the court in Byrne v. Loftus to find a formula to permit an unusually high level of rent should be now disregarded.  We should revert to the old formula which provides for equal demand and normal competition.  In excluding those words, we now have the worst of both worlds and we could be setting the renewal of rents at a much higher plateau than the market really justifies.  We all know when leases were renewed over the last number of years, the initial rent was pitched at an unusually high level to compensate for the fact that it was not going to be changed for 21 years.  That led to a great inflation in the level of <Col N="157" /> rents and has made many of them unreal.  We should get away from that because there is now provision for a frequent review.  I regret that that condition from the landlord and tenant code, which was in the Bill as drafted, is now being excluded.  It will lead to unjust and unfair situations between landlords and tenants in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill, which is possibly 20 years overdue, is now at its final stage.  The Minister in his speech made the point that, since the 1978 Act was passed certain matters have come to light which were not foreseen when it was going through the Houses.  He is using this, the earliest opportunity, to cure those matters.  I suggest to the Minister that when the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill, 1979 becomes law, inevitably in its operation there will be various matters which will come to light and showing inadequacies of injustices.  I urge the Minister to come back to the Oireachtas speedily, even frequently&mdash;it is better to have a number of amending Acts rather than have the situation that existed in the past where between 1931 and 1979 the law was not changed.  As the need arises, I urge the Minister not to hesitate to come back to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a number of matters which affect all the amendments and the Bill also.  I do not know whether I am in order in doing so, but perhaps the Minister would be willing to reply to me as it is a question of great importance which has been put to me by many of my colleagues in the legal profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>This would affect all the amendments as well, and the question is whether the Bill will be brought into operation immediately owing to the fact that there has recently been a judgment in the High Court by Mr. Justice McWilliams that large sections of the Landlord and Tenant legislation <Col N="158" /> are unconstitutional, and whether the Minister would prefer to wait to bring this Bill into operation until after this matter has been decided by the Supreme Court.  It is a matter that will affect all practitioners as to whether this legislation will come into operation rapidly or whether in fact the Minister will wait until the Supreme Court has decided on the appeal from Mr. Justice McWilliams' decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to re-echo some of the sentiments expressed by Senator Cooney with regard to our procedure.  I go so far as to say that I find it an offence to the dignity of this House that we have new sections brought in.  I do not suggest for a minute that the Minister is being offensive, but our procedure is such that it is offensive to the dignity of this House that there are new sections and new provisions introduced in this Bill and we cannot even discuss the purport or the content of these sections.  We have listened to the Minister's explanation as to their importance and the reason they have been introduced. I would like to thank him for the trouble he has gone to in producing this script because in very difficult circumstances it has helped us considerably, but it seems most unusual that the lower House could introduce new sections and new provisions into the Bill and that we cannot discuss them, only listen to what the Minister has to say and offer comment on them.</P>
      <P>There is another point that does not arise by way of procedure.  It arises generally in the way business is transacted between the Dáil and the Seanad and it is this: it is today for the first time that I discovered that the Landlord and Tenant Bill was coming back into the Seanad.  If I had known it was coming back I could at least during the past week have looked at the Dáil debates and seen what changes had been made. Before I came into the Chamber I obtained a copy of the Bill as passed by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The list of amendments was certainly very useful, but to try to put them all <Col N="159" /> together is very difficult indeed, particularly because the list of amendments, as always, occurs after Report Stage in either House, does not relate to the sections but rather relate to pages and lines in the Bill, so you are literally going through the list of amendments to the Bill and then you have to work out the sections.  You then look at the Minister's remarks and perhaps then you are going back to a Committee Stage discussion in this House.  It is a task that is almost impossible. I do not believe that it leads in any way to reasonable or proper consideration by us of the proposals that come before us.  There are a couple of points that I would like to make in relation to some of the amendments, and again like Senator Cooney&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That procedure was laid down by the House and not by the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that it has been laid down for years and that it is our own procedure.  I have been self-critical rather than critical of anybody else.  I want to re-echo what Senator Cooney said in relation to many of my remarks.  I do not feel competent to stand over everything that I say&mdash;I would rather like to ask questions.  In some instances where I feel that the amended Bill has not gone far enough and that the change is not entirely appropriate, I hope that any criticism that I imply or express will be taken in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I welcome the reinclusion of the words &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo; so far as business user is concerned.  That point was made here first and it is welcomed back into it.  The other point that has been conceded is a point made by Senator Alexis FitzGerald in the Seanad in relation to the exemption of the State as far as liability to tenants is concerned. The change now, if I understand it correctly, relates to tenants who after the passage of this Act become tenants of the State, but before this Act or at some stage in their lease or in their period of tenancy were tenants of a private landlord. <Col N="160" /> That is welcomed because people could never anticipate that they would become tenants of the State and it would have been unreasonable that they should suddenly lose their rights merely because the State purchased the land's interest.  I am not sure if I am correct in saying this, but I see that this is limited, and I quote from the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>The right to a new tenancy applies on one occasion only in the circumstances catered for in this amendment. Following on the grant of that new tenancy the tenant will thenceforth be in the same position as any other tenant of the State and he will not have a statutory right to a further renewal of his tenancy.</P>
    <P>That is only postponing the date of harshness to such a tenant.  Take the example of somebody who obtains a five year lease from a private landlord.  Under the Bill as it was drafted first, once the State purchased the landlord's interest the tenant would lose his rights to obtain a new tenancy.</P>
    <P>The amended Bill as it now stands provides that at the end of the five years, if the State has taken over the landlord's position, the tenant will be entitled to a 35-year lease.  But on the next occasion when his lease runs out he will not have that right.  If you accept in the first instance that when the tenant, having moved into the premises with a private landlord, looks for his first renewal, he should, because he had a private landlord from the start, be permitted to get his new tenancy.  I think it should follow right through his tenancy until the tenant himself decides to pull out of that particular premises.  It is being inconsistent to allow him only the right of business equity, as it is known, in relation to his first application for renewal.</P>
    <P>I expressed the view on Second Stage and Committee Stage in the debate in this House, and I still hold the view, that the State, except in so far as certain premises that perhaps relate to security matters or the like are concerned should be in the very same position as a private landlord.  If the State is going to engage <Col N="161" /> in investment of the nation's funds in investment property I believe that the tenants who occupy those investment properties are entitled to the very same rights and there should not be any exclusion. I regret very much that that amendment did not go as far as it could have gone.</P>
    <P>The next point I would like to make is in relation to one Senator Cooney made. It relates to amendments Nos. 9 and 10, the right of any tenant to a new tenancy. The Bill as it is changed is welcome to the extent that the word &ldquo;unforeseen&rdquo; has been dropped.  The position at the moment is that a tenant who obtains a lease for a period less than three years does not acquire any business equity.  In the past we had many situations where landlords would let a tenant in for two years and 11 months, would then break the tenancy and subsequently after a week or two let him in again to break his right to acquire business equity.</P>
    <P>During the past few years the courts have tended to question a landlord's right in this respect and an air of uncertainty has crept into the law.  When this Bill came to this House first I had hoped that what would happen would be that as a matter of policy the Government would decide, whether right or not, that a landlord would have the right, but I felt that the most important thing was that the position be clear and certain so that from the tenant's point of view he would know what his position was&mdash;when he went into a premises whether he would have a right to get a new tenancy at the end of the term.  That is important.  From a landlord's point of view it is important and fair and just that if he were to let a premises he would know whether at the end of the period of the letting the tenant would be entitled to renewal.</P>
    <P>What this Bill has done even in its amended form is merely to cloud the issue further.  The dropping of the word &ldquo;unforeseen&rdquo; is a help in that it appears that if a planned break occurred the tenant would not be entitled to have a new tenancy.  At least as far as the landlord and tenant are concerned, in circumstances when it was between <Col N="162" /> landlord and tenant that the break was intentional, the break was there for the purpose of breaking the period in which a tenant was in occupation, then the position would have been certain and the landlord and tenant could have been advised by their legal advisers and by whoever was concerned and would know what their position was.  They would not have to challenge something in court, incur legal expenses and with no certainty at the end of it.  But unfortunately the amendments in section 13 have gone further and the section now provides:</P>
    <P>(1)  This Part applies to a tenement at any time if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the tenement was, during the whole of the period of three years ending at that time, continuously in the occupation of the person who was the tenant immediately before that time or of his predecessors in title and <i>bona fide</i> used wholly or partly for the purpose of carrying on a business, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the tenement was, during the whole of the period of 20 years ending at that time, continuously in the occupation of the person who was the tenant immediately before that time or of his predecessors in title, or</P>
    <P>(c)  improvements have been made on the tenement and the tenant would, if this Part did not apply to the tenement, be entitled to compensation for those improvements under Part IV and not less than one-half of the letting value of the tenement at that time is attributable to those improvements.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purpose of subsection (1) (a) a temporary break in the use of the tenement shall be disregarded if the Court considers it reasonable to disregard it.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of taking out the word &ldquo;unforeseen&rdquo; was to ensure that where a planned break occurred the tenant would simply not be entitled to a <Col N="163" /> new tenancy and certainty would prevail.  The appearance of subsection (2) there, giving the court the opportunity to ignore a temporary break if the court considers it reasonable to disregard it, destroys the whole intention of removing the word &ldquo;unforeseen&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate that there may be unusual circumstances.  For example if there was a fire and it is unforeseen in that sense and people have to get out and the landlord is left to meet the obligation of the original lease to put the premises back in good repair that is fine and I would appreciate the purpose of subsection (2) for that reason.  But subsection (2) should have been spelled out to ensure that in relation to a break that was planned to break the tenant's use and occupation the tenant would not be entitled to a new tenancy.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong in my interpretation of section 13 as it now stands in its amended form, but it is open to doubt, and I think this whole question of uncertainty is about the worst thing you can have in this area of our law.  I hope the Minister is able to tell me that I am wrong in my interpretation.  If I am not wrong I would ask him to look at it and to improve it whether by a new Bill or whatever is necessary because the uncertainty in this is a burden to landlords and tenants.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to amendments Nos. 13, 14, 27 and 28.  These relate to section 17. Section 17 is concerned with the restrictions on a tenant in relation to his right to a new tenancy.  The old law, and the law that it is proposed to continue, enables a landlord to refuse a new tenancy where he has some major plan for the investment, whether he intends to redevelop it, put it into offices or whatever.  The idea is to ensure that in circumstances like that one or two tenants in ordinary premises could not stop a landlord redeveloping his property.</P>
    <P>That is a fairly good idea as it stands and I agree with the intention behind it, but all a landlord had to do under the Bill as it stood in the condition it left the <Col N="164" /> Seanad, was to have obtained planning permission for the development at some stage.  The amendment as it now comes before us improves that situation, but only to a limited extent.  A landlord must have current planning permission for the property.  It cannot be planning permission he had obtained over five years before he makes his application to court that would have expired under the 1976 Planning Act.</P>
    <P>What still has not happened, and it is something we asked for in this House, relates to a landlord who obtains planning permission but does not put the planning permission into effect.  We asked that a tenant be given some rights when a landlord has his planning permission, applies to court, obtains the leave of the court to refuse the tenant his right to a new tenancy and then leaves the court and forgets about planning permission and forgets the redevelopment.  You have a situation here where a tenant is thrown out on the basis that a landlord will redevelop, and what we asked for and what we have not got in the Bill is that a landlord may then ignore his planning permission, may ignore all his plans for redevelopment and the tenant is out on his ear because of it.  I very much regret that the Bill has not gone to the stage that we asked that it should go to, although I welcome the limited amendment that has been made.</P>
    <P>I would also like to welcome&mdash;this is something we sought in this House as well&mdash;the amendments Nos. 15, 17 and 19 to section 20.  There was a rather narrow time limit laid down for a tenant to serve a notice.  He was obliged to serve a notice within, generally speaking, one month of the relevant date relating to the determination of his tenancy.  That period has been extended to three months, and I think that is a very useful and good idea.</P>
    <P>The next point I would make is in relation to that touched on by Senator Cooney, and I tread very warily here. This is the case of Byrne and Loftus and rent review clauses and all the rest of it. It is complicated, complex, technical and difficult and I have just had a few moments <Col N="165" /> to look at it.  I fear that the Bill is inadequate as it stands and I fear, although I do not agree with everything that Senator Cooney says in relation to it, that problems will arise from it.</P>
    <P>Section 23 as it stands gives the court the right to fix the terms of the new tenancy.  There is no provision in that section that gives the court the right to insert terms in a tenancy agreement or in a lease providing for rent reviews, but section 24 provides that the parties to an agreement can apply to the court after a period of five years and ask the court to review the rent.  So far as that goes I have no complaint, but I think the decision in Byrne and Loftus, coupled with section 23 or particularly with the lack of a power in section 23 to enable the court to insert such a term, will create a complication.  If I can explain myself logically and reasonably I will try to do so.  The decision in Byrne and Loftus first of all referred scathingly to the concept of a willing lessor because properly, the court pointed out, that if a man were obliged to let a property for 21 years by law he could hardly be described as a willing lessor so far as the rent was concerned because he did not have any right to have the rent reviewed, and in inflationary times this presents great difficulties. The court pointed out that many judges around the country were ignoring that term in the 1931 legislation.</P>
    <P>The decision in Byrne v. Loftus went on to say that what would happen in the future so far as the law is concerned is that the court would have to consider that there would be no rent review, that some allowance would have to be made for inflation in determining the rent at the beginning.  In other words, the court would have to be aware of the fact that there would not be an opportunity to revert to reviewing the rent for a period of 21 years.</P>
    <P>Now what will happen is that the court will grant a new lease, but will not be able to insert a rent review clause in the lease, it will not have power to do so. Either party can apply after five years for a rent review, but because there is not <Col N="166" /> a rent review clause in the lease, I believe that the court will have to follow the decision in Byrne and Loftus and set a rent that presupposes that no further rent review will take place, which means that a court determining a rent will have to presuppose that there will be no further rent review for a period of 30 years.</P>
    <P>You can imagine the rent that would be imposed upon people if you try and set a rent now for an office building in Dublin for the next 30 years and allow for inflation.  I do not believe that the court would be able to look at the next section and say that parties will have the right to apply to the court after five years.  The reality is that the court will be dealing with a lease that has no provision for a rent review clause in it.  Even if the court looks at such a lease, it cannot presume that there will be an application.</P>
    <P>The only way out of this problem, and I will stress again that the problem would be resolved, would be if the court were given a right in section 23 to insert in every lease that it grants, a rent review clause.  I put that to the Minister for what it is worth and ask him to consider it.  I hope I am wrong, because I do not foresee another Landlord and Tenant Bill coming up in this House for a long time again, but if I am not wrong it makes a complete farce out of section 24.  This rent review clause is going to lose all its functions and all its importance if the court is going to have to follow the rules.  There is no provision in the Act that affects the decision of the Supreme Court in Byrne and Loftus.  So far as the Circuit Courts of this country are concerned, they must follow a ruling of the Supreme Court of that nature. There is nothing in the Bill that can tell them they need not look at this decision of Byrne and Loftus any more.  I do not think I am wrong in my interpretation of the position, and I would be very anxious to obtain some encouragement, some word from the Minister that I have been talking through my hat.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to place on the record of this House my regret that we had not an opportunity to look at the 39 <Col N="167" /> sections that have been amended, major amendments of great significance that have taken place, and to say that it is just not possible to give a Bill at this stage the proper consideration that it deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous speaker as regards the short time we have been given to consider all these amendments.  As one who is not a member of the legal profession I want to try to get a few points clear, in my own simple way, from the Minister when he is replying.  Amendment No. 9, in page 9, lines 29 to 31, deletes so and so and substitutes the following.  It deals with a tenement during the whole of the period of three years continuously in the occupation of the person who was the tenant immediately before that time or his predecessors in title and bona fide used wholly or partly for the purpose of carrying on a business.</P>
      <P>The question that I want to pose to the Minister is that where a tenant in a business premises has qualified under that amendment, the three years continuity in business, does it mean that the occupier or the landlord must in such a case then give a 35-year lease to that tenant, and can that tenancy, if it is written into the agreement, be subject to a review?  I felt before that it was three-yearly reviews but I suspect that it is provided somewhere in this Bill that it is five-yearly reviews.  A 35-year lease is a very long lease and if it is subject to review every five years there can be certain problems.  A person who is getting on in life and who is the landlord of a property would be in the position that all the odds would be against him still being alive when the 35 years would have run out, and may have arrangements made to pass on that property to somebody else.  As far as I can see that, the landlord or his successor can never come back to have clear title to that property.  At the end of 35 years, can the tenant seek a further lease of 35 years, or what number of years is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question I want to pose is that if the people concerned, the landlord <Col N="168" /> and the tenant, sign a 35-year lease containing a clause that at the end of that time the tenant will not look for a further lease, will that stand up in law even if one of the parties is still alive, or even if both of them have become deceased in the meantime?  In my own common or garden way I pose that question to the Minister.  What are the options open to a person when the property or the business premises have been occupied for three years or more years continuously?  Is there any provision in this Bill whereby a shorter lease, without a renewal, can come into operation, or are they completely tied by this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will first take Senator Cooney's comments on section 13 first, and I will try as far as possible to give a fairly comprehensive reply.  Under section 19 (1) (a) of the 1931 Act, the right to a new tenancy is given <i>inter alia</i> to a tenant where the tenancy is on a yearly basis at least, and where the tenement has been used for business for three years by the tenant for the time being.  In the 1931 Act, and this Bill, the relevant part of the definition of &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; is the person for the time being entitled to the occupation of a tenement.  On the basis that the right to a new tenancy is and was intended to apply where a tenant, with his predecessors, had used the property for business for three years, the qualification for the time being in section 19 (1) (a) of the 1931 Act was dropped. Section 13 (1) (a) in the Bill as it stands refers simply to the tenant.</P>
      <P>In their comments on the Bill, the Landlord and Tenant Commission recommended that the subsection be amended to make it clear that the reference to &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; includes a reference to the predecessors in title of the tenant.  Moreover, apart from this recommendation of the Commission, two cases have come to notice that bear on the meaning of that expression: O'Neill versus Whelan and Gatien Motor Company versus Continental Oil Company of Ireland Limited.</P>

    <P>The decisions in these cases raise a doubt as to the circumstances in which <Col N="169" /> the right to a tenancy arises under the relevant provision of the 1931 Act.  In particular they leave unclear whether that right applies whenever there has been three years business use, perhaps for periods of unrelated businesses, whether under a single tenancy or a series of different tenancies, provided only that both business use and the tenancies, if more than one, have been continuous.</P>
    <P>The amendment makes it clear that provided there has been continuous business use for a three-year period, the right to a new tenancy applies in two kinds of cases, where an individual person or firm has been the tenant for three years under one continuous tenancy or a series of consecutive tenancies.  A degree of uncertainty exists as to the intentions of the registrar as regards section 19 (1) (a) of the 1931 Act, section 13 (1) (a) of this Bill.  In the debates on the 1931 Act what was mainly under discussion was the question of the right to a new tenancy for a business tenant who had by three years business user built up a goodwill.  It is reasonable to argue that a tenant can, with his predecessors in title, build up that goodwill and thus qualify for a renewal of his tenancy.  This interpretation was implicitly adopted by the Landlord and Tenant Commission in the first report, paragraph 154, and explicitly in their recent comments despite the apparent distinction that appears in section 19 of the 1931 Act which refers in section 19 (1) (a) to &ldquo;the tenant for the time being&rdquo; and in section 19 (1) (b), (c) and (d) to &ldquo;the tenant or his predecessors in title&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, the recent court decisions of O'Neill v. Whelan and Gatien Motor Company Limited v. Continental Oil Company have further clouded the issue. The tendency, admittedly uncertain, of these judgments is that &ldquo;tenant for the time being&rdquo; in section 19 (1) (a) of the 1931 Act means, not a particular individual as tenant, but the opposite&mdash;the tenant at any particular time whether under one tenancy or a series of tenancies that might be quite unrelated to one another and that might be made to persons <Col N="170" /> having no connection with one another.  All that is required is continuous business user under some tenancy or tenancies.  If the interpretation of the two court cases referred to is correct then that is clearly not what was intended by the Oireachtas in the 1931 Act.  Since the tenant's commitment or goodwill is not involved, there could be no ground in equity on which to base that right in such circumstances.  The proposed amendment meets this point by providing that both continuous occupation as tenant and business user for the relevant period are required before rights under the subsection can accrue.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney's claim that the change in the &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; formula will mean rents above market rents can hardly be sustained.  Gross rent is the basis on which the rent to be reserved under either a new occupational tenancy or a reversionary lease falls to be calculated. The grant of a new tenancy is provided for in Part II of the Bill and the grant of a reversionary lease in Part III.  The formula for determining the gross rent in relation to a new occupational tenancy is set out in section 29 (f) of the 1931 Act. This formula was considered by the Landlord and Tenant Commission and in the first report, paragraphs 266 to 268, they recorded their conclusions.  The Commission recommended one change in the formula, and that change is proposed in the Bill.  This change permits a comparison to be made with the rents of similar tenements, whether or not these tenements are in the same vicinity, so long as they are in a comparable area. Apart from that, however, the Commission, while accepting that certain criticisms of the &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; formula were well founded, considered that except in a period of continuing inflation it had been possible to work the formula reasonably satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>On 28 July 1977 in the course of its judgment in Byrne v. Loftus the Supreme Court commented unfavourably on the provisions of section 29 (f) of the 1931 Act.  Arising out of this judgment the question of the &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; formula was referred to the Landlord <Col N="171" /> and Tenant Commission.  This re-examination was still in progress at the time the Bill was before the Seanad.  In consequence, although the &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; formula came under criticism also in that House, the Minister of State at that time was not in a position to introduce any amendment on your behalf to meet these criticisms.</P>
    <P>The views of the Landlord and Tenant Commission have since been received, arising out of their re-examination of the &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; formula.  The burden of their findings is that the &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; formula should be revised so that &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; would mean in effect the open market rent of the property, less the value of the tenant's goodwill.  The rent to be fixed on the grant of a new occupational tenancy should accordingly be that gross rent, less any further allowance for improvements carried out by the tenant that would qualify for compensation for improvements under Part IV of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendments now proposed are designed to give effect to the findings of the Commission.  They also meet the criticism of the 1931 Act provisions that was made in the Supreme Court judgment in so far as that criticism is relevant to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Cooney's comments on section 13 (2) and the word &ldquo;unforeseen&rdquo;, before this amendment section 13 (2) proposed that the requirement of three years business user in section 13 (1) (a) should be taken to be satisfied, even where there had been an unforeseen temporary break in the user for business if it would be reasonable to disregard the break.  The qualification that the temporary break should be &ldquo;unforeseen&rdquo; was added to take account of the fact that foreseen temporary breaks may be arranged under the law as it stands so as to ensure that a particular letting arrangement does not come within the scope of the landlord and tenant legislation.  The Landlord and Tenant Commission in their comments on the Bill as introduced, pointed out that a <Col N="172" /> break in business use to carry out improvements might not be &ldquo;unforeseen&rdquo; inasmuch as it might be provided for in the contract of tenancy.  Similarly, that contract might include provisions dealing with such matters as repairs, the occurrence of a fire and so on.  Any breaks in use associated with these could consequently be held to have been foreseen temporary breaks.</P>
    <P>The amendment of section 13 (1) (a) that is proposed permits the deletion of the reference to an &ldquo;unforeseen&rdquo; temporary break in section 13 (2).  This is because section 13 (1) (a), as proposed to be amended, imposes requirements both as to occupation and as to business use on a tenant for the purposes of acquiring rights under the Bill.  Accordingly, a prearranged break in occupation or tenancy for the purpose of ensuring that a particular letting remains outside the Bill will still be possible.  At the same time any break in business use, provided occupation is continuous, may be disregarded by the court if it considers it reasonable to disregard it.</P>
    <P>In relation to the concern expressed by Senator McGuinness I would like to assure her that the High Court decision has no bearing on the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In connection with the position of the State under landlord and tenant law, up until quite recently it was generally held in legal circles that the Landlord and Tenant Acts did not bind the State as lessor.  This view was based on a more general belief that the State would not be bound by a statute unless provision to the contrary were made in the statute either expressly or by necessary implication. In the light of that view section 4 of the Bill, as amended in the Dáil, can only be regarded as being in easement of tenants.  Up until now, tenants had no rights as against the State as landlord. As and from the coming into operation of this Bill, certain tenants of the State will be given certain rights as against the State.</P>
    <P>It is important to recall that, up until the present, leases have been made by <Col N="173" /> the State on the basis that the State is not bound by the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  It may, indeed, be assumed that some at least of these leased would never have been made had the question of rights under the Landlord and Tenant Acts arisen.  There could be no question of altering the position of the State under the legislation without first examining each of the leases that have been made by the State in order to assess the scope of such an alteration in the status of the State <i>vis-a-vis</i> its tenants.  No such examination has been undertaken to date.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister answer one question?  He may have the information at his hand.  He made the point that up until recently it was generally believed in legal circles to be the case that the State was not bound by the provisions of the landlord and tenant law and that the provisions in this section therefore only came to ease the position of tenants.  I believe that legal opinion changed before this Bill came before the House at all and that that was the reason for the insertion of the provisions of this section.  If that is the case I think what he is saying is slightly misleading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to deal with that .  With regard to the break in occupation referred to by Senator Molony earlier, it was always the intention that a planned break in occupation should exclude rights, and section 13 (2) deals only with a break in business use but not in occupation.</P>

      <P>I regret that the procedure, for which I have no responsibility, does not allow the opportunity that the Senator seeks.  For that reason I think we will have to make do with it this evening as the procedure stands.</P>
      <P>If a landlord&mdash;and this is in relation to Senator Molony also&mdash;does not redevelop he is liable for punitive damages.  This is in connection with the Planning Act, section 17 (4).  This would make it less expensive for him to let the tenant break in and compensate that tenant for disturbance.  We had also the case of the Byrne v. Loftus decision. That can have no bearing since section 24 of the Bill does not allow for rent reviews.  That decision could imply inflated rent only where rent reviews are not possible.  The rent review clause does not need to be in the lease; it is in the law.  This point was made to the Parliamentary draftsmen and they were satisfied about the position as is now proposed.</P>
      <P>In connection with Senator Governey's comments, the three-year continuous occupation as a business tenant of a tenement does not give the right to a 35-year tenancy with five-year rent reviews.  This is under section 13 of the Bill.  The question of the 35-year term, as against 21 years, does not arise on the amendments that are before the House. The change in the view about the position of the State is a matter of a change in legal opinion.  It has not been tested in the courts, and section 4 is simply a safeguard, not a change, in the light of the changed opinion.</P>

      <P>I accept that completely. The point I want to make arises out of section 13.  I want to clarify the position. If I understood the Minister's reply correctly he said that there was a very <Col N="175" /> great difference between somebody who was continuously in occupation of premises and somebody who was using them.  He said that a temporary break would be disregarded by the court if it considered it reasonable to disregard it. The only point I want clarified is this: suppose that a landlord and tenant enter into an agreement for a period less than three years and they then organise it, or the landlord says to the tenant &ldquo;So that you do not get or acquire the rights to a business, to a 35-year lease, I am asking you to vacate that property for one week following which I will give you a new lease for two years and ten months&rdquo;&mdash;a period less than three years.  I want to know whether by agreement the landlord and tenant can break for a week between two leases, each of less than a period of three years, and ensure that the tenant does not acquire a business equity.  I would ask your assurance on that and particularly for your assurance that under subsection (2) the court could not decide that that temporary break was unreasonable and could be disregarded.</P>

      <P>The House will recall that a Government amendment was introduced on Committee Stage to this section to provide that the Act would not come into effect until three months after its enactment.  Senators felt that three months was too short a time to enable the business community to revise their documentation and for everyone affected by the Bill to become familiar with its provisions, in particular the motor trade <Col N="179" /> with its international context.  Having reconsidered the matter, I have prepared an amendment which proposes to extend the period involved to six months.  I am doing this in particular in view of the fact that we are heading into a summer break when it is particularly difficult to redraft very detailed legal documents.  It is as well to provide for a specific period, as my amendment does, so that everyone affected by the Bill will know where he stands on its enactment.  If the alternative approach, which was proposed by the Opposition, were adopted&mdash;in other words giving the Minister an option to fix a date by order&mdash;this would lead to uncertainty on the part of all involved. That is the reason I am suggesting six months.</P>

In any case the Director of Consumer Affairs is drafting a booklet in layman's language but the type of people we were talking about, as having the specific problem, were importers dealing with international concerns, who had international rules and regulations and terms of contracts.</P>

      <P>Also of course matters like that may be raised at the stage when the Bill is received for final consideration.  But the Chair would ask for the co-operation of the House. Certainly as far as the Chair is concerned every opportunity will be afforded to Senators to deal as adequately as possible with the points.  But we must deal with the amendments in the order that they are before us.  Amendment No. 42 is related to amendment No. 3 and they may be discussed together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 37, to delete &ldquo;of a contract&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, agreement or provision&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>When section 2 and other sections were being discussed on Committee Stage Senator FitzGerald, in particular, made the point that section 2 (3) related to criteria to be used in determining whether a term of contract was fair and reasonable.  He went on to point that the fair and reasonable criteria were also used in sections 13, 31 and 43 but that these sections referred not to terms of a contract but to provisions and agreements and so on.  The Senator suggested that we should be consistent in the phraseology we use in the Bill.  I take the Senator's point and the amendment to section 2 seeks to get over the problem by referring in subsection (3) to all the words involved.  The effect of the subsection, as amended, would be that if a question arises as to whether a term, agreement or provision is fair and reasonable regard shall be had to the criteria set out in the Schedule in deciding it.  I think this meets the Senator's point.  The amendment to the Schedule is related to the amendment to section 2 and clarifies the meaning to be attached to the words &ldquo;term&rdquo; and &ldquo;contract&rdquo; where they appear in the Schedule.  The aim of this amendment also is to get over the difficulty raised by Senator FitzGerald regarding the use in <Col N="182" /> parts of the Bill of various words involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment arises from suggestions made on Committee Stage.  The Senators maintain that the section as drafted would create difficulties for the pursuit of their duty by such people as receivers and liquidators of companies, personal representatives of deceased persons, official assignees in cases of bankruptcy and so on.  It was suggested that it would be more equitable to provide that where such people were disposing of assets by way of auctions, a buyer at such an auction would not be regarded as dealing as a consumer.  The present Minister for the Gaeltacht was handling this section of the Bill in the House on Committee Stage and in reply to the points made indicated that she saw no particular need to protect the liquidator except in such circumstances and that, in any event, it was essentially the consumer we were trying to protect through this Bill.  She maintained that it would not be right to dilute this protection without compelling reasons.</P>
      <P>I agree largely with what the Minister said and, like her, I am not convinced of the need to provide an exception directly in the Bill for sales by such people.  If we were to so provide in this Bill there could well be other types of auction sales not mentioned in the debate which would be equally deserving of exceptional treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> In all the circumstances, however, I am prepared, as the amendment proposes, to give the Minister power to make an order to provide that in the cases of an auction sale by such a type of person the buyer shall not be regarded as dealing as consumer.  This is a reasonable solution which takes account of the points made by the Senators as well as enabling my Department to consider whether there are other cases which also warrant the same treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point.  It is an excellent amendment so far as it goes.  It gets over the difficulties that we foresaw in relation to liquidators, receivers and so on.  My main concern, which I expressed on Committee Stage, was in relation to certain types of auctions. I refer to bloodstock auctions, livestock auctions and the like.  The Minister indicated that she had had contact with the organisers of these auctions and they expressed satisfaction with them.  I have taken considerable trouble and discussed this proposal with many people associated with the bloodstock business since Committee Stage and I assure the Minister that all is not rosy in the garden as far as satisfaction with this Bill is concerned.  They did not believe that they had any option in regard to acceptance. I accept the Minister's general purpose here.  It is sensible, but there are many auctions which it would not be appropriate to include.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea behind my amendment was that the Minister, in order to include an auction in the provisions of this Bill, would have to take the positive step of making an order.  As it stands, the Minister would have to make no order. All of these would be included from the start.  The rights that the sales organisation have in relation to bloodstock sales and the rights that buyers have are very clearly set out in the conditions, which are the most detailed conditions of sale that you will ever get in relation to any auction sales.  They have a very special meaning in law, going back over very many decades of evolution of this law. Indeed, over the last couple of centuries <Col N="184" /> this law has developed, and it has developed to suit that particular industry.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a very, very big industry&mdash;a multi-million pound, very important industry so far as Ireland is concerned.  Apart from the expensive bloodstock that we come across&mdash;millions of dollars or pounds are paid now for only yearlings&mdash;there are many sales in Ireland organised by Bord na gCapall.  Catalogues set out in great detail the conditions and the warranties that will apply in relation to sales by auction.  It is lunacy to include those automatically because conditions have evolved and people who are in that business understand the conditions and warranties as they apply to those auctions and know they have meaning.  We are now introducing a completely different set of conditions that are not designed for horse sales at all.  They are designed for general consumer transactions. It is unnecessary that this Bill should intervene at all in this area.  If an occasion was to arise in the future where the Minister was dissatisfied&mdash;and he has not cause to be dissatisfied and I am certain no complaints have ever been made about this area&mdash;he could by order under my amendment say, &ldquo;Look lads, the bloodstock industry were dissatisfied now and we are including you&rdquo;. That would be a sensible, sane and rational approach.  In relation to the livestock industry the same rules apply.</P>
    <P>I am not competent to discuss other areas of auctions, but I imagine that auctions of antique furniture in the reputable salesrooms of Ireland are governed by conditions and warranties that are appropriate to that trade.  We are talking about a technical trade here.  For that reason it is regrettable that the Minister will not do as I suggest, that is let this Bill become law.  Let the Minister then look at various types of auctions that go on around the country and say that that and that and that should be included.  He will have six months after the passage of this Bill to look at all types of auctions. At least he should leave alone industries that have their own methods and their own reasoning and conditions of sale.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  With one exception the effect of this subsection is to preserve the sanctity of contracts entered into before the commencement of the Act.  The one exception arises in section 43, which restricts the capacity to exclude liability for misrepresentation.  The first line of section 43 refers to an agreement as distinct from a contract, the latter word appearing specifically in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 43.  This contemplates the situation in which the exclusion clause is embodied in a general agreement but is intended to exclude or restrict liabilities or remedies in connection with all future specific contracts entered into.  To make it clear in section 4 that the one area where the Bill will operate retrospectively will be section <Col N="186" /> 43, it is necessary to insert the words set out in the amendment in section 4 (1), as the amendment does.</P>

      <P>I move amendment no. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line, 43, before &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;wilful&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We discussed this on Committee Stage. It concerns members of corporations or companies if they are neglectful in any way being liable to criminal sanctions. We did not have an amendment down on Committee Stage but we expressed our concern that a member of a board of management or board of directors might fail to look at his minutes or to note a particular remark made at a board meeting and in committing an act of the slightest neglect might involve himself in liability in criminal law and be convicted of committing a criminal offence.  We suggested that a test as to whether a criminal offence would be committed should depend on his intentions at the time.  Therefore, we suggest that the words &ldquo;wilful neglect&rdquo; should represent the appropriate standard rather than mere &ldquo;neglect&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht, who responded to the debate on Committee Stage on this section, mentioned that this was the way it was done and had been done for years.  With every respect, I do not accept that that is a valid reason. For that purpose and to deal with that point I introduced an amendment to the Consumer Information Act that provides for change from mere neglect to wilful neglect.  It is an important point, and I ask the Minister not to fear the abandonment of precedent but rather to question it critically, and if wilful neglect ought to be the standard to apply the standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the word &ldquo;attributable&rdquo; to any neglect on the part of a director or responsible officer is to ensure that where his neglect is the real cause of the offence he also should be liable.  Subsection (2) is in common form.  The provision occurs, for example, in the Merchandise Marks Act, 1970, section 8, the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, section 22, and the Consumer Information Act, 1978.  Many other statutes have gone further in imposing criminal liability on directors and others. They go so far as to impose liability where the offence was merely facilitated by neglect.  Examples are the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938, section 6, the Auctioneers and House Agents Act, 1973, section 25&mdash;which Senator Cooney brought in if I remember correctly&mdash;the Employment Premiums Act, 1975, section 7, and the Occasional Trading Act, 1979.  It has, however, been accepted that such a provision goes too far and that formula is no longer followed.  I have to concede to the Senator that there are precedents for inserting &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; before &ldquo;neglect&rdquo;. They occur always in the context of the phrase &ldquo;facilitated by&rdquo;, evidently as a concession intended to mitigate the severity of that provision, a provision which has now been dropped.  I am, however, advised that the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; is tautological in this context.  Neglect or negligence is in law a breach of a duty to take care, and where that breach of duty is the real cause of the offence primarily committed by the company or firm it is proper that the director or officer who caused it should be liable.  It is a matter for the courts to determine the degree of his culpability and the extent of the penalty which should be imposed upon him.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the proposed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second proposed amendment to section 6 takes account of the fact that the terminology of section 6 (2) has precedent in statute.  It seeks to harmonise the Consumer Information Act and this Bill in relation to wilful neglect. <Col N="188" /> However, I must oppose the amendment also because it would affect only the tip of the iceberg and would create inconsistencies of interpretation as between the Consumer Information Act, this Bill and a large number of other enactments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by the Minister's argument in rejecting the proposal to change the neglect which supports a criminal offence from mere neglect to wilful neglect.  In this Act we are now for the first time introducing criminal sanctions into what has been essentially a matter of private contract between two citizens, and in making that significant change and importing the sanction of criminal law into the consumer area we should not go so far as to make mere neglect the factor which can impose criminal liability on such a wide range of persons.  This is not confined to directors.  All sorts of people can be involved through neglect.  A change of this magnitude in principle, should be approached very carefully and the criterion should be stronger than mere neglect. There should be an element of wilfulness or culpability about it.  I support my colleague in moving this.  It is not a good argument to say that other statutes merely refer to the word &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; without the qualifying adjective of &ldquo;wilful&rdquo;.  I do not see the relevance of that argument.  It may lead to a certain conformity in legislation but if, as in this instance it will, as I think, produce an unjust situation, it is wrong to rely on precedent.  Perhaps a further amendment to amend the Consumer Information Act to bring it into line with this one is desirable, but I support this amendment.</P>

      <P>I regret the position adopted by the Minister on this matter. From the number of Acts that he has referred to in his response to it I can understand the reason why it appears here at all.  This expression is a stock expression which has been used in Acts down throught the years and we are sticking with it.  I accept that the court has the discretion to decide whether to sentence a person to imprisonment or to fine him and in that sense the court can reflect its <Col N="189" /> own reaction to the culpability of someone regardless of whether the offence is severe.  I am not talking about that discretion that a court has.  I am talking about a situation in which a court will have to express regret and say, &ldquo;I appreciate that the defendant in this case was merely neglectful but I am obliged by the law to convict him&rdquo;.  It is most likely that in these circumstances a court would apply the Probation Act which it is empowered to do, but that is not good enough.  We are creating a criminal offence. We have come a long, long way from the days when we regarded criminal offences as matters that had to go beyond reasonable doubt and in <Col N="190" /> respect of which there were very difficult standards of proof.  Here we have a situation where a person who fails to read a minute after a board meeting or fails to respond to a question raised at a board meeing may be regarded as attributable. A certain event might have occurred because that person failed to do something.  It is mere neglect.  It is too low a standard and it is unfair.  The question of equity and justice should be the basis upon which we should assess the position here.  I regret the Minister's response and I am not seeking to withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>Before I make the argument in favour of my amendment, we have reservations about introducing a concept like the concept of durability, desirable and all as it would seem in certain circumstances. Given the fact that the Minister wished to include the concept of durability in relation to the definition and description of merchantable quality, we feel, for the sake of consistency, the concept of durability should also be used in the context of explaining and understanding the meaning of fitness for purpose.

      <P>Government amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 1 to 9 and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.&mdash;(1)  In a contract for the sale of goods there is an implied warranty that spare parts and an adequate aftersale service will be made available by the seller in such circumstances as are stated in an offer, description or advertisement by the seller on behalf of the manufacturer or on his own behalf and for such period as is so stated or, if no period is so stated, for a reasonable period.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may, after such consultation with such interested parties as he thinks proper, by order define, in relation to any class of goods described in the order, what shall be a reasonable period for the purpose of subsection (1).</P>
      <P>(3)  Notwithstanding section 55 (1) of the Act of 1893 (inserted by section 22 of this Act) any term of a contract exempting from all or any of the provisions of this section shall be void.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I undertook on Committee Stage to take a close look at the provisions of this section before the Report Stage with a view to tidying them up in the light of the views expressed by various Senators.  This I have done. While the intent and framework of this section remains essentially the same under this proposed amendment, I should comment on the changes it introduces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will note that the original order making power has been deleted.  I am satisfied at this point that this would have added little to the provisions of the section.  The new subsection (1) now takes account of a situation where an offer of spare parts and after sales service is made without reference to a specific time limit.  In such a situation, the implied warranty will be that the relevant parts and service will be available for a <Col N="194" /> reasonable time.  Subsection (2) enables the Minister by order to specify what shall constitute a reasonable time, and this power contemplates a situation where a problem arises in relation to a certain class of goods.  It would be appropriate in my view for the Minister to intervene in the consumer's interest to define reasonable in relation to fridges, foodmixers, motor vehicles and so on. The new section provides in subsection (3) that any contractual term attempting to negate an offer made in relation to parts or after sale service shall be void. This provision is self-explanatory and seeks to prevent retailers from giving with one hand and taking away with the other.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister's amendment is an improvement on section 12 as it stands.  As I understand it, it does two things.  Firstly, as the original section 12 did, where somebody advertises goods for sale and says that spare parts will be available for 12 months then that becomes an implied term in the contract.  Secondly, where a person advertises and states spare parts will be available and does not indicate a period during which spare parts will be available then the court can determine what was a reasonable period within which those spare parts would be available.  That is as far as it goes.</P>
      <P>This is a benefit in so far as it improves a situation that is hopeless at present. The whole question of spare parts goes to the very root of consumer legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already discussed at length on Committee Stage, and it has been mentioned in passing today, the concept of durability.  Many Senators have mentioned the difficulty of goods being produced nowadays that are planned to be obsolete within a very short time. Everybody appreciates the difficulties involved so far as manufacturers and suppliers are concerned.  At Committee Stage the point was made that one buys cars nowadays that become obsolete. They just cannot stand the pace as cars in the past did.  People made the point <Col N="195" /> about television sets, washing machines or whatever that they just do not stand up to the kind of treatment people expect them to stand up to.</P>
    <P>The difficulty involved as far as manufacturers are concerned is that if they are to provide, for example, a washing machine at a price that ordinary consumers can afford today, they cannot put in parts that are sufficiently durable to make the machines last as long as we would all like to see them last.  We are stuck with the problem of obsolescence and goods being produced that just do not last.  That is the difficulty we have over a concept like durability.  I can understand the Minister's wishes in introducing that concept.  The Minister is being entirely inconsistent when he refuses to do what we want him to do in this amendment.  All we ask the Minister to do is, in relation to someone who produces goods and puts them on the market, if he thinks fit and that it is appropriate in relation to a particular item, be it washing machines from Italy or China or any item that a consumer might purchase, that he may consider the matter and say that if the person is going to sell these goods in Ireland we will impose upon him a condition that spare parts will be available.  If the Minister takes that power on to himself he is obviously not going to be able to use it every time any particular item of new or old equipment comes on the market.  He will have to consider whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances that spare parts should be available.</P>
    <P>All we are asking the Minister to do is to take to himself the power to enable him, where he thinks it appropriate, to say to a supplier or a manufacturer or whatever, &ldquo;If you want to sell this item in Ireland you must make sure that spare parts are available&rdquo;.  It will be up to the Minister to say whether spare parts should be available for three months, six months or 12 months.  The Minister will have the power, and that is all we want him to take.  I was talking to someone today who was not from this side of the House who told me that he purchased a piece of equipment from a <Col N="196" /> Swiss international company. Unfortunately, that piece of equipment has now gone out of order and he cannot get spare parts.  It was a deep freeze and should last for a long time.  He has only had it in his possession for a year.  All he can do now is throw it out.  I am sure the Director of Consumer Affairs, particularly in relation to foreign manufactured equipment, would like to think he could examine these items of equipment as they come on the market and say to himself, &ldquo;This is a deep freeze; we have this American company or Japanese company who want to sell these here and it is only fair and reasonable that if they are going to come on the Irish market they should be able to stay on it for a sufficient length of time to ensure that spare parts and service are available&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation the Minister has no such power.  He cannot stop anybody selling a piece of equipment. The only power he has under the section as he proposes it is that if a person says he will provide spare parts, then he can do it.  But if the person refrains from saying anything about spare parts then the Minister has no power.  This goes to the very root of consumer legislation.</P>
    <P>We are not asking the Minister to introduce a blanket law or blanket regulation that could cause difficulties.  I accept and appreciate the difficulties that might be caused if that was the proposal.  But the proposal is a very limited one.  It is only to give the Minister power to introduce an order where he thinks it appropriate in relation to any particular item of equipment that he can say to a person: &ldquo;If you are going to sell this, you must provide spare parts&rdquo;.  The Minister has the right to say whether those spare parts should be available for any particular period of time that he thinks fit. This is vital.  I regret that the Minister has not seen fit to agree with it.  I would urge him to reconsider the point now.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that people from all sides of the House supported this idea when we proposed this amendment at Committee Stage.  The whole effort of this debate, both through the Dáil and Seanad, has been one where party <Col N="197" /> political differences have not arisen. We are concerned with providing a package for the consumer which is a good and useful one.  We now have established a Director of Consumer Affairs.  We have a person who will look at the consumer interest in the country.  If the Minister would take to himself this power he will ensure that the Director of Consumer Affairs will have power and teeth where the Minister chooses to use it.  I urge the Minister to change his view on this and to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I support what Deputy Molony has said.  It is quite reasonable to expect that the consumer would have this added protection.  I cannot see why the Minister refuses to meet his wishes in that regard.  It can happen that an article purchased can go out of operation after a relatively short time because of a faulty part.  It is reasonable to assume that the consumer would be given the right to expect that when he purchases an article spare parts would be available for a reasonable length of time.  I join with Senator Molony in asking the Minister to reconsider his decision.  To do as we suggest would give him an opportunity of coming to the relief of the consumer on many occasions when he might otherwise be victimised.</P>

      <P>This is a matter where, if the Minister looks back over recent years, he will find very serious situations arising with business people who installed vending machines and slot type machines outside their shops.  One firm placed about 20 of these outside their premises in the midlands and in the west. There was a court case brought against the people operating the machines.  The circumstances were that the guarantee that was given to the person who operated the machines said that everything possible would be done to provide parts and maintain the machines.  At one time there were two Circuit Court judges trying cases brought by people against the vendors, who were the shopkeepers, where machines had broken down.  The answer <Col N="198" /> given by the people involved, who were Canadians, was that the guarantee said that they would do everything possible to ensure that the machines would be kept in order.  People were sued because of the failure of these machines.  These were serious impositions on the people and they were involved in hundreds of thousands of pounds.  Imagine a person being confronted with 20 or 30 people who went to buy cigarettes and had put in money but got no cigarettes because the machine was not repaired or maintained by the manufacturers.  These are circumstances where the Minister would have the means and equipment at his disposal, if he accepts the amendment, to do something.  He would not be forced to do it but he would have the option.  It is a power the Minister should have to protect the interest of the people.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am delighted with the Minister's amendment to section 12, even though I feel that in introducing it at this stage of the Bill we are just getting out of town ahead of the posse.  The section as it stood originally was meaningless because it failed to define what an adequate aftersales service should be.  The Minister at Committee Stage gave a most sympathetic hearing to the various points of view that were expressed and he has come into the House with this most comprehensive amendment.  It defines a reasonable period and he has also ensured that there will be consultation with such interested parties as to what a reasonable period shall be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate in this section generally shows the lack of a well informed housewives' lobby.  Senator Molony's contention that the amended section can work only if the manufacturer offers to provide spare parts and an aftersales service could be dealt with if the consumer insisted that a manufacturer should so provide and should refuse to buy from anyone who does not provide such a service. The situation as it is now is that one is not offered any guarantee.  If one wants a guarantee one is given something in a plastic envelope which invites <Col N="199" /> one to sign away the rights one already has in common law.  Nobody wants to go to court to recover the cost of a washing machine because the legal costs would cost more than the machine. That is our only redress at present because we have no system of a small claims court where there could be arbitration and things could be settled without the expense of going to court.</P>
    <P>At the present it is up to the housewife to make her views known.  If she is content to remain isolated in her ignorance, if she does not join her local consumers' association whether it is the Irish Housewives Association or the Consumer Association of Ireland or the ICA, this situation will continue.  We see in other countries and in this country what an informed consumer lobby can do.  The motor traders association were able to put their views forward and their point of view across.  In Britain, for example, there is such a powerful consumer lobby that it was recently able to declare that British motor car engineering was inferior to Japanese motor car engineering and get away with it.  It is up to the housewife now.  The Minister has gone as far as we could reasonably expect him in providing for consultation with interested parties.  It is up to her to be one of the interested parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment because there is an important issue of principle involved.  I am in favour of the proposal to have an implied warranty where the seller has given an undertaking in relation to after sales service or the provision of spare parts, and where it is for a stated period that the implied warranty be for that period, and where no period is in fact stated that it be for a reasonable period, and that the Minister have some powers in relation to defining a reasonable period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed Government amendment to section 12 does not achieve an adequate result as far as ensuring that there is concern for after care and a spare parts service for consumers.  The danger is that if there is only an implied warranty where there is express <Col N="200" /> reference in an advertisement or offer to the question of after care and spare parts one could have the possible ill-desired result that manufacturers or sellers would not mention any after care service. If asked by the consumer if there is any after care service they will say: &ldquo;We will not discuss that at this stage.  It is not part of any agreeent with us.  We are not warranting out of it, we are just not discussing it at this stage&rdquo;.  There may or may not be some availability of spare parts afterwards.</P>
    <P>The danger is that the writing into this Bill of a partial security for the consumer, a partial protection in giving the consumer protection where there has been express reference to the provision of a warranty for spare parts and servicing and giving the Minister power to designate what would be a reasonable time for this if no time has been specified, does not cater for the circumstance where no mention has been made in relation to a particular product where it is reasonable and desirable that there be a warranty for spare parts and servicing.  I support the argument put forward by Senator Molony that if we have multinational companies distributing their products, they are sometimes very expensive consumer products, in this country they should be directed to include a spare parts and service contract as part of their service to the consumer, and as part of the condition under which they can operate on the Irish' market.  The same would apply to Irish manufacturers of these kinds of products.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be prepared, in the interests of the protection of the consumer, to take the power in the section to issue regulations directing in relation to what products and under what circumstances would there be a requirement for this implied warranty for spare parts and servicing.  I do not think that it will be adequate to argue that this can be left to private competition, that there can be competition between different manufacturers or retailers one of whom is giving an express undertaking in relation to servicing and the provision of <Col N="201" /> spare parts and the other which is not. We do not have that degree of consumer consciousness or that degree of choice for the consumer between products.  It is much more desirable that the Minister intervene positively in directing that in certain areas the consumer needs the protection of an implied warranty.  There would have to be a certain amount of judgment and discretion exercised in this area.  It would have to be in areas where it would be reasonable to provide for an after care servicing and spare parts availability.</P>
    <P>The danger of section 12 is that it will be possible for manufacturers and suppliers to avoid the implied warranty and that it will be in their interests to avoid it by not making any reference to a service of that sort.  Instead of having, as it says on the side of the section in the Bill, an implied warranty for spare parts and servicing we are very unlikely to have any implied warranties of this sort if they can be simply omitted.  In other words, the legal attempt to strengthen the protection may have the unintended result of removing the warranty that would be given at the time so that there cannot be any reading in of an implied warranty and the consumer would be left without that kind of service.</P>
    <P>In a Bill of this kind which has very desirable new protection for the consumer, this would form an essential part of it.  The appropriate way to extend the implied warranty in relation to servicing and spare parts would be for the Minister to do it in relation to specific products and items on the basis of a specialist knowledge and understanding of the particular field.  I do not understand why the Minister should resist the principle behind this.  It is important from the point of view of the protection of the consumer.  I do not see how it could have undesirable side effects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cassidy made the point that competition of guarantees to housewives would encourage them to purchase equipment&mdash;if they got guarantees from retailers that spare parts would be available.  I do not <Col N="202" /> think that is right.  We have to protect people within the State; if we do not, there is no other means of protection.  I know from being in the retail business&mdash;I said this on the Committee Stage of this Bill&mdash;that if a housewife comes in to purchase, say, a cooking range, at the moment she is faced with the fact that the Irish market is flooded with all types of ranges, from Goddens Hamcoves, which come from France, and brands which come from some other country. Against them, we produce here the Stanley range or cooker which in my opinion is as good as if not much better as the imported products.</P>
      <P>A housewife may have read one of the famous women's magazines or seen an advertisement on television that has publicised cookers which heat four or five central heating units and naturally she falls for this.  There is a guarantee for Stanley ranges that have been sold 10, 15 or 20 years ago: spare parts are still available for them.  There will not be spare parts, as far as we can find out, for the other cookers.  Not alone are we protecting the housewife by this amendment, but protecting what we are manufacturing within the country, our own manufactures.  We are also trying to protect consumers from themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can take fridges.  You get an imported fridge at a given price, anything from £200 to £350.  You might pay another £50 for an Irish one but you can get spare parts for it.  I do not know whether the people whose fridges we import give guarantees to provide spare parts, but they do not seem to be available.  Not alone are we trying to protect the housewife through this amendment, but we are also trying to protect the livelihoods of people who are employed in the manufacture of these articles within the country.  The same applies to lawnmowing machines and other items.  We must make every effort to protect the housewife and to protect our own industries.  We can do this by saying to the people who are flooding our market with this type of stuff: &ldquo;You will have to give us a guarantee that spare <Col N="203" /> parts will be made available&rdquo;.  A period of 12 months is not long enough&mdash;you would want to be thinking of years.  The Minister and his Department will have to have a very serious look at this.</P>

      <P>I support amendment No. 15 tabled by Senators Molony and Cooney.  Though accepting that the Minister's amendment goes some way towards relieving the problem, I am afraid it will make the situation worse because in amendment No. 14 to section 12 (1), the statement that the warranty applies only in cases in which the product itself advertises the fact that there is a warranty.  This will be a disincentive to manufacturers, because if they see that the Minister is not in the position to use the arbitrary power of suggesting that any product he arbitrarily decides is subject to guarantee, they are prejudiced if they put this on the label or on the documentation that goes on the sale of their product.  This will act as an incentive to manufacturers in some cases to delete warranties they may have been giving because by deleting a warranty of after-sales service they cannot be touched by the Minister or by his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the purposes of amendment No. 15, the latter part of which is the more relevant under paragraph (b), &ldquo;as the Minister shall by order direct&rdquo;.  It gives the Minister the power arbitrarily to decide in which circumstances there should be the type of warranty which we are seeking.  It is a reasonable amendment. The Minister's amendment is patently unsatisfactory for the reasons that have been pointed out by a number of speakers.  The better interest of the <Col N="204" /> public in this area would be served by the Minister accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>I regret that despite any personal sympathy I might have, which is considerable, for Senator Molony's amendment and the points made by other Senators in the debate, I am unable to accept it.  If we were to provide as Senator Molony suggests, the repercussions which such an order might have would be very far reaching indeed for the industrial sector, to the possible long-term disadvantage of the consumer.  I sympathise with the consumer, and I include myself in that group, who finds himself with an obsolete washing machine, motor car or deep freeze or whatever.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that when discussion on this problem gets under way at European Community level, Ireland will participate fully to make sure that this problem will be resolved in an equitable manner.  The Director of Consumer Affairs would be very interested in pursuing the area of codes of standards generally which would be very appropriate to this area of spare parts and after-sale service.  In the United Kingdom similar codes of practice have been worked out with the co-operation of the office of fair trading and the industries that are involved.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 14, I cannot accept that this is not an improvement. I feel that it is a considerable improvement.  This has been recognised by Senator Molony and a number of other Senators as a considerable improvement on the original Bill.</P>
      <P>On the whole question of spare parts, the offer of spare parts and after-sale service is, of course, a marketing device which a seller decides in his best economic interest to adopt.  If he does not advertise it, of course, it is unlikely that the consumer would not be aware of the availability of these spare parts in particular cases.  In other words, if there are to be spare parts, the seller will say so&mdash;it is in his interest to say so.</P>

I had no objection to them being taken separately at all but I did not agree to this procedure with any intention of abandoning a right that I would normally have to reply to an amendment I myself put down.  I ask the Chair to allow me to reply because there are very important points of principle involved in this.  It is a major point in relation to this item of consumer legislation.

They do not demand from a retailer: &ldquo;Where is the guarantee, what is the position about spare parts.&rdquo;  They do not think of it.  I agree with her.  I was particularly disappointed that Senator Cassidy on Committee Stage described this as a rather cynical exploitation of a very vulnerable consumer and asked the Minister to take the power I proposed. She actually spoke in favour of my amendment at Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This is the nub of the whole problem. The Minister himself in his arguments knocking my amendment made the point that advertisements for spare parts are a marketing device.  That is exactly what they are.  What we are doing here is stopping manufacturers advertising spare parts.  They will no longer advertise spare parts and what will happen now is that people will not think of spare parts at all.  It is because we have an uneducated consumer lobby, and I do not blame the housewives because we have not begun in this country to think like that.  Perhaps with the Director of Consumer Affairs and with all of this legislation we may succeed in building up a concern among housewives, a concern among consumers generally, and that in itself will bring us ultimately to the situation where one hopes consumers, when they are presented with an article will say to the retailer: &ldquo;What is the position over spare parts?  How long will spare parts be available to me?  Will you give me that in writing?&rdquo;  In that way they can guarantee and galvanise their position.</P>
    <P>I must refer to something Senator Cranitch said on Committee Stage.  He specifically asked the Minister to describe what the position was.  The Senator asked:</P>
    <P>Suppose that no description, offer or advertisement is forthcoming, does not that mean that the manufacturer is under no obligation, good, bad or indifferent <Col N="208" /> about any further service in so far as spare parts are concerned?</P>
    <P>The answer had to be yes.  It still is.  The Senator went on:</P>
    <P>That is positively alarming.  I appeal to the Minister to examine that again and see if some protection for the consumer or the buyer could be incorporated in this subsection.</P>
    <P>That is what we are here about.  That is all we seek to do.  Anything the Minister has said has not knocked any of the arguments we have raised.  He made the point that it could have great repercussions for the industrial sector.  I agree that it could have great repercussions for the industrial sector.  I agree that it could have if the Minister by blanket order insisted that everybody had to supply spare parts or if he said that everybody who sells washing machines must supply spare parts for five years, that could have such an effect.  It is for that very reason that we did not propose such an amendment.</P>
    <P>What we asked the Minister to do was to take the power to himself to decide, if he thought it appropriate having considered the circumstances, having considered the likely consequences so far as the economic industrial sectors were concerned to introduce this.  He has no such power at the moment and that is all we sought to do.  I accept that the Minister's amendment is a considerable improvement on the original section, but the original section amounted to nothing. It amounted to this, that if somebody came out and said &ldquo;I will give you spare parts for 12 months,&rdquo; he would have to give you spare parts for 12 months.  I do not consider that to be anything to anybody.  It is a technical change.  It means that instead of it being something you might be able to sue someone on by way of agreement that it becomes an implied term under the Bill.  It is a legal consequence. It is no more than that.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal is certainly an improvement, but it does not in itself do anything to improve the lot of the consumer in any real way.  The reality is that we will not hear much about spare parts <Col N="209" /> in television or newspaper advertisements in the future.</P>
    <P>If our amendment is not accepted the consumer will be in no better position so far as manufacturers and retailers are concerned who chose to exploit people by throwing goods at the market that they know well themselves they will never have spare parts for any period of time.  If the Minister had some point that I was convinced about, I would have given in on it.  There has been a lot of exchange over this Bill and we have had a lot of agreement on it.  I know that our intentions are all at one, but in relation to this section I am obliged to say that there seems to be some reluctance, there <Col N="210" /> is some hold on the Minister.  I do not know what it is&mdash;I wish I knew.  There is some other reason that we are not hearing about.  There must be, because no logical reason has been given.  It is not a matter of law but a matter of policy.  The Minister is refusing to take this right unto himself.  You can take it that from our side of the House we consider it a matter of policy and we consider it a retrograde step that a Minister responsible for consumer affairs will not take this power unto himself.  I do not know what is wrong.  I do not know what he fears. No good reason has been given.  It is something that we will look for and seek in the future.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 15 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 19, after &ldquo;vehicles&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and in respect of which contract the parties have entered into a written agreement&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises out of a comment that Senator FitzGerald made on Committee Stage.  Subsection (2) provides an &ldquo;out&rdquo;, in fact, for a motor dealer under section 13 where there is an agreement between the parties at the time of delivery and the person who is purchasing is in the business of motor dealing that the implied condition will <Col N="211" /> not apply.  The amendment seeks to alleviate difficulties that might arise later in respect of proving that if a dispute arises and the matter goes to court, and seeks to add to the section &ldquo;and in respect of which contract the parties have entered into a written agreement&rdquo;. Concern was expressed that dealers or indeed purchasers could allege afterwards that an agreement was made about something when in fact an agreement may not have been made.  In this subsection an exemption from section 13 applies&mdash;that in every contract for the sale of a motor vehicle, except in contracts in which the buyer is a person whose business is to deal in motor vehicles&mdash;there is an implied condition that at time of delivery of the vehicle under the contract it is free from any defect which would render it a danger to the public including persons travelling in it. We seek to add to that &ldquo;and in respect of which contract the parties have entered into a written agreement.&rdquo;  Amendment No. 17 arises on the same section and again it is with a view to clarifying the position under the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 16 seeks to extend the scope of section 13 (2) to protect certain buyers of vehicles whose business it is to deal in motor vehicles.  As I understand it, the Senators want the implied condition of freedom from dangerous defects applied to sales of vehicles from motor dealers where no written agreement exists.  I see absolutely no merit in this proposal.  I would like to remind the House of the rationale for the exception in brackets in subsection (13 (2).  I consistently held the view that when a motor dealer buys a vehicle the expertise inherent in his occupation is such that the principle of <i>caveat emptor</i> can apply without a need for statutory protection.  In addition, it is normally an imported, distributor or a private individual who would sell a vehicle to a motor dealer.  In the former case a written agreement would normally exist in any event whereas in the latter it may or may not.  I see no reason in this situation to place liability on a private person <Col N="212" /> trading in a vehicle in a buyers' market with defects which an expert examination by the buyer should reveal.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the proposed amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 18, 25, 26, 29 and 35 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 29 and 30, to delete paragraph (c) and substitute:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>These four amendments arise from discussions which we had at Committee Stage on the question of fair and reasonable exclusion clauses. The general thrust of the provisions in the Bill on such a clause follows the model of the United Kingdom Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act, 1973 which in general terms places the onus of proof in any dispute as to the reasonableness of an exclusion clause on the person at the receiving end of the clause, in other words the customer.  It was rightly pointed out to the House, however, that the United Kingdom Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 reversed the onus of proof in such cases, placing it instead on the person <Col N="213" /> seeking to use the exclusion clause.  I agree that it would be worthwhile to follow the line in this Bill, and these amendments positively place the onus of proof in such cases on the person seeking to use the exclusion clause.  It is not necessary to amend section 38 in the same way as the onus of proof in that section is already on the person using such a clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 36, to delete &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;order&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I resisted the temptation, with reasonably good cause, not to discuss in any general way section 13 again on this Stage because we have clearly come to a full stop as regards making any inroads on the view that the Minister had in relation to section 13.  It was not only for that reason that we did not dispose of them here; if we had the flexibility that we would like to have to have another go and oppose of some sections, we would have done so, but it would have denied us an opportunity to change a subsection if the Minister insisted that the subsection remain.  I would preface my remarks by saying again that we are opposed to the criminal liability in section 13.  It is still there, because so long as the certificate is there criminal conviction is quite possible under the Consumer Information Act.  I have gone through Committee Stage debate again.  I still say that where the certificate itself contains words that are found offensive under the relevant section of the Consumer Information Act criminal liability may ensue and that if there was no certificate criminal liability would not ensue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other points, we do not believe the motor industry should be separated for this sort of treatment.  This is a matter which should be dealt with by <Col N="214" /> an enactment from the Department of the Environment, whereby all motor vehicles after they reach a certain age would be tested for their road worthiness.  We also saw difficulties in relation to the onus of proof.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that simply by our not tabling amendments to that section opposing those subsections is not in any sense to say that we accept those subsections.  We do not; we oppose them, but we have to take the practical approach that if we did oppose them here we would be voted down as we have been on other sections.  We take that as best we can take it in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this particular amendment is to ensure that when the Minister sets about drafting the certificate and the matters to be contained in the certificate the Houses of the Oireachtas be given an opportunity to consider them.  This is the only single instance in this entire Bill&mdash;which is full of sections empowering the Minister to introduce regulations or orders&mdash;in the matter of delegated legislation that arises under this Bill where the Minister has chosen not to put his delegated legislation before the House.  In every other instance the Minister will, by order, introduce his regulations.  I accept that may be an incorrect description but he will by order direct in what detail powers and sections are to be applied.  In this instance the Minister retains to himself the power to introduce legislation, which means that the Matter will not come before the Houses.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister, through the Chair, that this section has proved so contentious&mdash;and it has proved contentious because so many people in this community are concerned about it&mdash;that he should respect the difficulties that people have and at least ensure that these regulations or these conditions that he intends to impose upon motor traders in respect of what goes into these certificates be brought into this arena so that Members of this House and of the Dáil would be able to comment and discuss the proposed certificate and the contents of it.  That is the only purpose of <Col N="215" /> the amendment.  I am sure the Minister would be anxious that everybody who has expressed concern&mdash;and many people have expressed concern about this section&mdash;would have an opportunity to consider the contents of the certificate and the detailed obligations that will be imposed on motor traders.  I have no doubt that the Minister's Department will consult with other people before they draft these regulations.  I should like to use this opportunity to compliment those trusted warriors the Minister has behind him in this House.  I think they have been very helpful to everybody interested in this Bill, whether they are outside interests, lobbies or Members of these Houses.  We, as Members have an obligation to consider the contents of the certificate and the obligations that will be imposed on motor traders in view of the representations that have been made to us.  I would ask him to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. I would reiterate what Senator Molony said.  This is a novel procedure, and it is one with consequences which have been spelt out in the debate on the section as a whole.  Because of the potentially serious consequences, the novelty of the procedure and the amount of controversy that has surrounded this section and particularly the certificate provision, I would urge the Minister to accept the amendment which asks him that when he comes to drafting the certificate he will come to the House to do it by way of order so that others can look at it and, if the fears which have been expressed turn out to be misplaced, let them be seen to be publicly shown to be wrong. It will be in great ease of the trade to know that the original fears were misplaced.  That would be the better way to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I hope I misunderstood Senator Molony.  I hope he is not suggesting that it is unreasonable to expect that when you go to buy a new car from a dealer he ought to be obliged to earn his substantial commission by being prepared to roll up his sleeves and get down under it to see that all the parts are <Col N="216" /> there.  As to the question of a certificate surely it can be resolved in a simple matter. A very simple certificate such as is required by an insurance company when one is insuring a car that is over a certain age should suffice.  If one wants to insure a car that is over a certain age one is required to provide a certificate from a reputable garage that it is safe.  This is a very simple certificate, a sentence or two.  I do not think there should be any difficulty or any fears in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, I appreciate, reflects a fear among Senators that the Oireachtas will not have an opportunity to vet what Senator Molony referred to on Committee Stage as delegated legislation.  I must point out that the power to make regulations under section 13 is an administrative power in effect because the policy in relation to certificates is firmly enshrined in the section itself.  If the section had read &ldquo;The Minister may make whatever regulations he considers appropriate in relation to defects in motor vehicles&rdquo; I could see the merit in the Senator's amendment.  We would then be clearly dealing with delegated legislative power.  To reiterate what I said on the Committee Stage, the regulations under section 13 will be matters of detail concerning the form of the certificate and will be made following consultation with the Department of the Environment, the motor trade and other relevant bodies.  It would be most inappropriate, therefore, to consume the valuable time of the Oireachtas for the purpose of discussing the ultimate form of the certificate when the Oireachtas will have agreed to a certificate of freedom from dangerous defects being given in accepting section 13 (3) in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mechanical and technical aspects of these regulations and the test to be applied before certification are matters in relation to which it would, in my view, be inexcusable to clog up the programme of either or both Houses.  I am obliged, therefore, to reject this amendment and reiterate that the legislating in relation to the certificate is being done now and that the administration will follow with consultation <Col N="217" /> with all parties and eventual regulations.</P>
    <P>Before sitting down I would like to thank Senator Molony and join with him in expressing appreciation of the efforts of the officials of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism who have been deeply involved in the drafting and at all stages of discussion in this complex piece of legislation.  I would also like to thank the Parliamentary draftsman and legal advisers who have also been very helpful.  I would like to express thanks to Senator Molony for his comments in regard to the approach that has been taken to this Bill.  I feel certain hope in so far as this can be done with the co-operation of both sides of the House and with all interested parties and&mdash;it is appropriate at this stage to mention them&mdash;the representatives of the motor industry whom I and my officials met on a number of occasions.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, I would like to straighten our Senator Cassidy on her doubts about my wishes.  I have no objection at all to the implied terms and conditions.  It was just the certificate. So, she can be reassured that it is not my intention in any sense that the consumer should be denied anything.  This, in fact, adds nothing to the consumer; it is a separate matter as I argued on Committee Stage.  In relation to what the Minister said it is simply because people on this side of the House, members of the motor trade who have been here right throughout this debate and other people who have expressed concern about section 13, are concerned about the content of those certificates that I ask that this amendment be accepted.</P>

There is no obligation on the Minister to consult with anybody and this is the only instance&mdash;I did not count the instances, but there are dozens of instances of orders that the Minister will introduce under this Bill&mdash;that is being separated.  On Committee Stage I pointed out one or two, if not more instances, where the matters to be introduced by order were of a very technical nature, were uncontentious and nobody was quibbling about them.  This is then the most contentious section, in so far as the business community and also in so far as this House is concerned, in this Bill.  It certainly was contentious in the Dáil; it is also contentious here.  I urge the Minister to be conciliatory in his approach to the amendment and to accept that we, too, as Members of this House, because of all the representations that we have received over this, are concerned to know what will be in that certificate and to have the opportunity of voicing opinions on it when it comes to pass.</P>
      <P>Question: &ldquo;That the word proposed to be deleted stand,&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>
      <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 53 to 56 and substitute:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;) A person using a motor vehicle with the consent of the buyer of the vehicle who suffers <Col N="219" /> loss as the result of a breach of the condition implied by subsection (2) in the contract of sale may maintain an action for damages against the seller in respect of the breach as if he were the buyer.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There was very little discussion during Committee Stage debate on the section as to the meaning and implications of subsection (6) and in particular to whom the phrase &ldquo;a person lawfully using a motor vehicle&rdquo; was intended to relate, Senators Molony and FitzGerald held the view that the phrase could cover any subsequent buyer in the chain of buyers of the vehicle.  My position was and still is that each sale of the vehicle involves a separate contract between, in most cases, one seller and one buyer.  In each such contract subsection (2) implies a condition that the vehicle is free from dangerous defects at the time of delivery.  What subsection (6) does in each of those separate contracts is to extend the right of action under that contract to any lawful user of the car, in other words, someone using the car with the owner's consent.  To avoid any further confusion in the matter, however, and to make assurances doubly sure I propose to spell out, as the amendment does, that the right of action in contract under subsection (6) extends only to a person using the vehicle with the consent of the buyer of the vehicle.</P>

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 56 and 57, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;) Notwithstanding section 55 (1) of the Act of 1893 (inserted by section 22 of this Act) any term of a contract exempting from all or any of the provisions of this section shall be void.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered the scope of this section further and I am <Col N="220" /> satisfied that a doubt exists as to whether the seller of a motor vehicle could exclude his liability for breach of the implied condition created by section 13(2). While it could be argued that since section 13 does not allow for the type of exclusion clause I have in mind, such a clause could not be used nevertheless, it is possible that the court would hold that section 55(1) of the 1893 Act, as amended by section 22 of this Bill, would enable to seller to evade his responsibility in this way.  What it boils down to is that where there is doubt about the matter and in order to avoid any future misunderstanding I propose in this amendment to provide that any term of contract excluding liability for all or any of the provisions of this section shall be void.  I should mention though, that this amendment will not affect an agreement of the kind referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) of section 13(2).  In such a case it the parties make such an agreement there is, therefore, no implied condition and no need to legislate against its exclusion.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 43, after &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(except a provision for referral to arbitration)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to a reservation we expressed in relation to rights under a guarantee.  Section 18, which we propose to amend, provides that exclusion clauses in certain circumstances will be void and we expressed fear in relation to this and other sections that there is the possibility that this would affect the legal validity of a clause that merely referred a dispute to arbitration.  I think the Minister took the point in relation to some other sections, if I judge some later amendments correctly, and in the circumstances I ask him to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>Am I right in thinking that the reasoning behind this proposed amendment is that expressed by Senator <Col N="221" /> FitzGerald, in particular on Committee Stage, that whatever we are doing in section 18, we should not exclude a proper provision for referral to arbitration in the event of a dispute arising out of a guarantee?  My argument was then and still is that there is nothing in section 18 which would prevent or restrict the referral of such a dispute to arbitration. We are, in this section, making two separate provisions.  Subsection (1) lays down the general rule that whatever else a guarantee does, including possibly providing for the referral of disputes to arbitration, it nevertheless cannot take away a persons right under common law or under this Bill.  The buyer retains these rights whether the matter is referred to arbitration or brought to court or whatever.  Subsection (2), on which Senator FitzGerald raised this point on Committee, merely sets out to prohibit the guarantor or anyone acting on his behalf from setting himself up as a judge in his own case.  The Senator, in tabling his amendment, may have felt that an arbitrator might in certain circumstances be acting on behalf of the guarantor.  I do not think, however, that such a construction can be put on the role of an arbitrator.  An arbitrator is simply a person appointed by both sides to decide between them as to a dispute and not to act on behalf of one or both.  I am, therefore, satisfied that there is no need to amend the section as proposed.  I would also point out that if the amendment were accepted the effect would be that a guarantee could, in effect exclude a person's common law or statutory rights and this, in my view, would be clearly undesirable.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's point in relation to subsection (2).  My amendment does not seek to alter subsection (2).  I considered the arguments that he made on Second Stage and I accept them.  I believe that a right, or at least a clause, referring a dispute to arbitration is a limitation of the right of a buyer at common law or pursuant to statute and it is for that reason that I suggested that this should go in.  Certainly, <Col N="222" /> where one is obliged to refer to arbitration before one goes to the court it is a limitation or a restriction on one's ordinary rights at law.  In relation to many guarantees it is more desirable from everybody's point of view&mdash;the manufacturer, retailer and the consumer alike&mdash;that they choose a cheaper form of dispute resolving forum and arbitration has that advantage.  I think the fact that the amendment we make accepts provision for referral to arbitration does not in any way affect the type of exclusion clause that the Minister would be concerned with and for that reason I would ask him to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>These are analagous to the amendments to section 10 of the Bill which we have already discussed. Senator FitzGerald suggested on Committee Stage that it would lead to convenience of operation if in this section we re-enacted section 34 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893 alongside the amended section 35 of that Act.

      <P>Senator FitzGerald made the valid point on Committee Stage that the use of the word &ldquo;unmerchantable&rdquo; in this section hung in mid-air as it were, since, unlike part 2 dealing with the sale of goods, the reference to merchantable quality in section 28 does not extend at present to unmerchantable goods referred to in section 29.  What the amendment does, therefore, is to extend the meaning of &ldquo;merchantable quality&rdquo; as defined in section 10 to the term &ldquo;unmerchantable&rdquo; which appears in section 29.  I am grateful to the Senator for drawing this point to my attention.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept the point that we made in relation to this general approach to some of these sections in amendment No. 28?  This is another instance where a protection given is limited to people who deal as consumer.  We have made the point on a great number of occasions on Second Stage and Committee Stage of this Bill that one big problem involved is the very narrow definition given to a consumer.  We feel that there are new rights given to consumers as defined by this Bill that could easily be extended to people other than consumers.  The right we are talking about under section 32 is a very major one.  It is the liability of persons conducting negotiations antecedent to hire purchase agreements.  The circumstances that I am concerned about occur very regularly in relation to hire purchase transactions.  Where a retailer of goods is anxious to complete a deal with a consumer, for example a person who wants to buy a motor cycle and cannot afford to buy it by paying the full price, then the hire purchase company are introduced. The hire purchase company buy the motor cycle from the supplier and they hire it, to the consumer.  In these circumstances the position has been to date that if the consumer's motor cycle went wrong he had no right of access in terms of seeking legal address.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing this question on the Adjournment.  I intend to be very brief as we have only 30 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this motion because we are encountering a tremendous amount of difficulty <i>vis-á-vis</i> planning and other matters relating to farm buildings.  I can speak only for Galway, but I believe the <Col N="225" /> same problems are in other counties also.</P>
    <P>In the last four or five years because of increased stocking rates and our increased use of fertiliser and so on, the farming community have become very aware of their responsibility in regard to pollution, and because of the increased number of livestock on our farms this has become a huge problem.  I assume that certain Acts were brought before the Oireachtas in 1977 with this in mind. I will give an example to illustrate my point.  I know a farmer in County Galway who decided last September to build a slatted cattle house.  He applied to the local authority for planning permission and was given exempted development permission, and he received a note from the local authority to that effect. This man brought this notice to the area offices of the farm development service, and said that if he built that house on the spot he had indicated to the local authority they would not give him a grant.  The matter was referred back to the local authority and the health inspector was then introduced to it.  Several months later we had no alternative but to apply for full planning permission for the slatted house.  It was the same as if he was building a new dwellinghouse.</P>
    <P>The Exempted Development Regulations of 1977 were introduced on the basis that because there were cattle houses of certain standards and certain types there would be no need to go to the expense and trouble of applying to the local authority for full planning permission as would be required for a dwellinghouse.  The original Health Act, 1878 and the Exempted Development Regulations, 1977 are in conflict.  When the legislators drew up the Health Act, 1878 there was no such thing as a slatted house.  The slatted house is a modern way of housing cattle on slats whereby the effluent is stored in a slurry pit under the house, and in 1878 one did not have that type of development.  The anomaly is that a cattle house under 400 square metres and less than seven metres high is exempted under the Exempted Development Act but a slurry pit under it is not <Col N="226" /> because that involves effluent and it is supposed to be 100 metres from the nearest road, neighbour's house, well, stream and so on.</P>
    <P>Under the original Health Act, 1878 that house without the slurry pit under it need be only 10 metres from these locations. I admit that in the sixties and seventies to put a huge complex like that within 10 metres of a road or a well was unthinkable.  I would have to agree with the planners in that case.  However, this 100 metres stipulation is creating havoc particularly for farmers with very small acreage.  There are certain townlands, as the Minister is very well aware, where if one had to go back 100 metres to build this type of a house one would literally end up in a neighbour's garden because there are so many small fields, fragmented holdings and so on.  A farmer looking for planning permission would want to be some type of professor to know were to go.  I could name eight or ten people who are totally unaware of where they will have to go to get planning permission for this type of a house.</P>
    <P>This is important for many farmers because so much money is involved in the grants.  It can be said that if we were civic minded we should not be worried about the grant, but financial restraints being what they are the grants are very important and most people would not be able to erect those buildings were it not for the grants under the farm modernisation scheme.  I will be extremely thankful to the Minister if we can tease out this mess.  I am very thankful for being allowed to raise the matter and I have no doubt that lot of people will want to read the Minister's reply.</P>
    <P>I support effluent controls, and we cannot have pollution all over the place. That is very important.  However, the time has now come for the Department of Health, the local county councils, the local authorities and the Department of Agriculture to sit down and draw up basic rules that all three will stand by.  If a farmer applied for full planning permission for a slatted house and in his wisdom decided to build it beside a road or beside a neighbour's house subject to <Col N="227" /> full planning permission, the Department of Agriculture would have to pay a grant for it.  At least that is the way our local authority interpret it.  The position with exempted development is not like that. The local authorities will give planning permission but with the farm development service, unless the Department of Agriculture rules are observed the grant is not given.  That is a peculiar arrangement, and the matter will have to be streamlined so that a farmer at least will know where to go to get planning permission.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating that every single development that takes place in a farm should be subject to full planning permission. We have enough trouble in the area of dwelling-houses, and a simplified system should be worked out on the basis of distances that would be reasonable and at the same time safeguard the entire area from pollution. In most cases the 100 metres is not particularly sensible.  If the building is near a water source there could be pollution and it is important that our water sources are not polluted.  However, when you consider this new, modern technique of housing cattle and the fact that the slurry is pumped onto the fields, this is more streamlined than if the cattle were roaming around the farm as they do in some places. This makes for good husbandry and good pollution control.</P>
    <P>We have a problem also if a farmer decides to build one of those slatted houses or a dungstead or so on near his own house.  Under the rule as it now stands, by virtue of a farmer's application to build a silage pit or cattle house near his own house we assume that he is accepting responsibility.  Some people in planning sections would say that their job is to save a man from himself, that people do queer things and that they might be sorry for it afterwards.  If a man applies to build a farm building on his own farm, so long as it does not interfere with anybody else and the problems involved are explained to him, I see no reason why he should not.  Obviously a silage pit or a dungstead placed near a <Col N="228" /> neighbour would raise an entirely different question because we have to take note of a person's individual right, and whatever new structure would be adhered to I assume that great consideration would be given to the third party.</P>
    <P>There are a number, of questions to which I would like answers.  Who is the overall authority <i>vis-á-vis</i> planning of farm buildings?  Is it the county council, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health, or a combination of all three?  Secondly, the question of a farmer deciding to build within 100 metres of his own house, I ask the powers that be to take into consideration that, once he is warned about the consequences, if he wants to build it within 100 metres of his own house he should be allowed to do so.  Thirdly, is it possible at this stage for the Department of Agriculture through their field men down the country, the Department of Health and the councils to come together to talk this out fairly quickly and have a single application form to the planning body&mdash;I assume it would be the local authority&mdash;so that the applicant would know where he stood straight away?</P>
    <P>To illustrate finally what I am saying.  I came across another constituent recently who decided to build a hay-shed which under the Act can be built within ten metres of a roadway subject to the county engineer's approval.  This person wanted to put a lean-to on to the hayshed in which he would put cows. Because cows would be housed there, there would have to be a dungstead. There was no objection to the cowhouse as such beside the hayshed, but the dungstead would have to be 100 metres from the road, and the farmer would need an aircraft to get the effluent from the cowhouse half day down the field to the dungstead.  That is not good planning. It could be said that the hayshed and the cowhouse are too near the road and the dungstead is too far away.</P>
    <P>This is important for many farmers because so much money is involved in the grants.  It can be said that if we were civic-minded we should not be worried <Col N="229" /> about the grant, but financial restraints being what they are the grants are very important and most people would not be able to erect those buildings were it not for the grants under the farm modernisation scheme.  I will be extremely thankful to the Minister if we can tease out this mess.  I am thankful for being allowed to raise the matter and I have no doubt that a lot of people will want to read the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>In relation to Senator Connaughton's motion the farm development service is the only authority involved in plans for slatted cowhouses. These plans are to standard specifications and are uniform for the country as a whole.  Under the Local Government (Planning and Development Regulations) 1977, planning permission was introduced for agricultural structures. However, a wide range of exemptions are granted where certain conditions are satisfied.  The main conditions are that the structure must be less than 400 square metres in extent and be more than ten metres from a public road. Structures for the housing of pigs and poultry must be more than 100 metres from any dwellinghouse and no effluent can be stored within 100 metres from any dwellinghouse except with the consent of the owner.  There are no special conditions in regard to slatted cowhouses.  Approval for grant aid in respect of buildings under the farm modernisation scheme can be given only where planning permission has been granted or where the conditions for exemption are clearly satisfied.  The field staff of the farm development service are fully familiar with these conditions.  Accordingly, when dealing with an application in respect of a farm structure the local farm development service officer decides, having regard to all the factors, whether the conditions for exception are satisfied.  If so, approval is issued without reference to the planning authority. Where, however, the stipulated conditions are not satisfied and where the officer <Col N="230" /> is in doubt, having regard to certain other aspects of the siting of the structure, he advises the applicant to apply for planning permission.  In these cases approval will not be issued until the planning permission is granted with any conditions being imposed by the planning authority clearly specified.</P>
      <P>In issuing approvals account must also be taken of pollution control and conditions may be inserted to safeguard against possible pollution from the discharge of animal wastes.  The procedure applied by the farm development service in regard to planning control is uniform thoughout the whole country and has worked very satisfactorily.  The need for planning permission has arisen in only a minute number of cases and these have not given rise to any particular problems.  I assure Senator Connaughton there is no variation within the farm development service in the application of the regulations and no divergence from the local authorities' planning requirements.</P>
      <P>Pollution control is an important consideration in the planning of farm buildings.  We all accept that.  Accordingly, my Department in consultation with the Department of the Environment, have drawn up guidelines to ensure that adequate precautions are taken in the siting and construction of structures for the housing of animals to safeguard against possible pollution. These guidelines are contained in a book entitled <i>Guidlines and Recommendations on Control of Pollutions from Farm Wastes.</i>  On the whole the guidelines are reasonable and have met with general acceptance.  A large measure of flexibility is expressed in their implementation to suit the conditions and circumstances met at farm level.  The requirements for storage and disposal are the minimum consonant with the obligation to ensure that the discharge of animal waste does not lead to pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With these few words I hope that in some way I can satisfy the doubts expressed by Senator Connaughton and that he will find the application of this particular regulation easier to follow.  It <Col N="231" /> is accepted by everybody that there has to be a certain degree of control in the siting of those silage pits, slurry tanks and so on.  We know the danger that can arise through polluting the environment and we know the hardship it can cause to people who have structures like this síted fairly adjacent to their houses.  We <Col N="232" /> have to consider those people just as well as the farmers who are applying for planning permission or applying for grants for the building of those structures under the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
