    <P>Government amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In page 4, Section 2, sub-section (2), line 26, to delete the word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;occupier.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>During the discussion in Committee it was suggested that the term &ldquo;owner&rdquo; used in the definition section in connection with agricultural land might have too restrictive a meaning.  I am advised that it was probable the term would be interpreted to exclude an occupier of agricultural land.  I do not see why we should have any ambiguity about it and, therefore, I am proposing to substitute the word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; for the term &ldquo;owner.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, Section 2, sub-section (2), line 33, immediately after the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;situated in a county borough or urban district.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a good deal of discussion on an amendment somewhat similar to this on the last occasion.  I took it that the Minister's objection then was that my amendment was not sufficiently specific and definite, and as the amendment was then worded it did not convey a clear meaning.  I assume the same objection cannot be urged against this amendment, because the term &ldquo;situated in a county borough or urban district&rdquo; is really a <Col N="906" /> well-known legal definition.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot do that.  My objection to Senator Baxter's amendment, moved in Committee, on the ground that it was ambiguous, was only incidental to the main objection, which was that it proposed to differentiate between workers not upon the basis of the work they did but upon the basis of the district in which they performed the work. My main objection to this amendment is the same as my main objection to the earlier amendment moved by the Senator and it is that the work performed by individuals who come within this definition should carry the same rights and obligations no matter where performed.  I submit that it would be unwise to provide for different conditions in respect of that work when performed in an urban district or when performed in a rural district.  If there is any case at all for the inclusion of these workers, they should be included no matter in what part of the country they do their work.  I am not prepared to accept the amendment.  I think these workers, who come within the definition which the Senator is seeking, should come within the terms of the Bill, irrespective of whether they do their work in an urban district or in a rural area.</P>

      <P>This amendment is in two parts.  During the course of the discussion in Committee I invited the views of Senators as to whether workers employed on land used as a market garden should come within the scope of the Bill.  I gathered from the <Col N="907" /> expressions of opinion that I received on that occasion that the general feeling of the House, with some opposition, was in favour of having an amendment of this kind put down, that is, an amendment to exclude from the scope of the Bill workers who are employed wholly or mainly in connection with market gardens.  I am strengthened in the belief that the amendment should be inserted in the Bill by the fact that such workers are, in any event, included within the definition of agricultural workers in the Agricultural Wages Act, and, as I indicated already, in framing this Bill we decided to leave outside its scope, in the main, the classes of workers who come within the Agricultural Wages Act, having the belief that any amendment in the laws relating to their working conditions should be effected by an amendment of that Act rather than by a Bill of this kind.  During the course of the discussion in Committee a question was asked as to whether poultry farming was agricultural work for the purposes of the Bill.  On looking into the point I found that possibly workers on poultry farms would not be classed as agricultural workers as the Bill stood.  I think they should be classed as agricultural workers; they are classed as agricultural workers under the Agricultural Wages Act.  Consequently, I am moving the amendment here to include poultry farming within the definition of agricultural work; that is, to exclude from the Bill workers who are wholly or mainly employed in connection with poultry farming.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill, as amended, be received for final consideration&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Bill passes I think it is only fitting that I should <Col N="908" /> again make my protest against this policy of the Minister.  I am not going to delay the House for any length, except to point out that there are two big problems before this country to-day.  The first and the biggest is to try to keep the people on the land, and the next is to put people into permanent employment. Now, this Bill is going to do neither one nor the other.  It is definitely, in my opinion, going to drive more people off the land.  The latest figures available from the Minister's own Department indicate that in 1938 there were actually 19,000 fewer people in male employment on the land than in 1937.  In this measure to which the House has been asked to agree you are definitely drawing a line between the people who live in the town and work in the town and the people who work in the country.  One will be entitled to have holidays and must have holidays, while the others cannot. I should like the Minister to tell the House, and to tell the country, how in face of such a policy as that he hopes to keep the people on the land. It cannot be done.  It becomes impossible, because what the Minister is doing is actually unnatural.  Another Minister has set up a commission to inquire into the whole situation regarding agriculture, and its future, production, efficiency, and all the rest of it.  My view is that no matter what that other Minister tries to do, so long as the Minister for Industry and Commerce pursues the policy which has been embodied in this and other Bills, it is quite hopeless to talk of bettering the conditions in agriculture. You are definitely creating in the minds of the people whom you want to stay on the land the feeling and the attitude that in the towns and cities they can, by the operations of the law, get something which will be denied them if they stay in the country. Now, that is all wrong.  As I urged before, if you want to better the conditions of the people you should begin in the country and, with the land as a basis, order and regulate your life. Let what you do in the cities and towns bear some relation to what it is possible to do for the people on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> The fact of course is, that our tillage area in 1938 was lower than it was in 1937.  Of course it could not be otherwise, with 19,000 fewer people working on the land in 1938 than there were in 1937.  You cannot work miracles on the land any more than in any other business or factory.  You cannot get the work done if the men and women are not there to do it.  While they are flying away you cannot hope to have increased tillage, and above all you cannot hope to carry out the policy which the Ministry and the Executive have been standing behind as a land policy for the last five or six years.  If one came to examine the position in the towns, I have not the slightest doubt that, while in certain industries the Minister might produce figures sufficiently convincing to make certain people believe there was a bettering of the position with regard to employment, there are other occupations and trades&mdash;like the building trade&mdash;where you could definitely trace a decline in the numbers of people employed there one year after another.  It will be seen, therefore, that although the Minister is legislating the Minister is not succeeding in solving or even attempting to solve the biggest problems which the country has to face.  In my view, the legislation which he is asking this House to enact is doing the very opposite.  I greatly fear that, if we want to get on, we should go back on some of the legislation which the Minister has been asking us to pass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, most of the Senators who have spoken on the Second Reading of this Bill have stressed the importance of Sections 12 and 13, and rightly so, because those sections mark one of those improvements all too rare in our legislative history, or in any legislative history, where the Legislature by taking thought of the well-being of the workers in domestic avocations have paid tribute to the essential importance of their role and their vital contribution to the common good.  The proposals of the Bill are not revolutionary.  They do not go beyond what is the common practice amongst good employers. When this was pointed out by Senator Counihan in the course of the debate, <Col N="910" /> it elicited from the Minister a very sensible remark, and one that is of great importance to all legislators.  He said that, in those matters, legislation should not ordinarily aim at going beyond the common standard of good employers.  It should rather aim at forcing the bad employers to keep step with the good employers, thus avoiding the danger of out-pacing what has been found practicable and advisable.</P>
      <P>I have yielded to a belated desire to intervene in the debate on this Bill for a few moments because I should like us all to realise that having taken this step forward on behalf of domestic workers we cannot free ourselves from the responsibility of trying to ensure that it will turn out for their good and not for their harm.  When this Bill becomes law there will be certain statutory periods of rest, recuperation and leisure for domestic workers, as for those in other occupations, but this will be a doubtful boon if there is no safe shelter in which those workers can take their holidays or can recuperate, and this brings me to a matter on which I wish to get the Minister to help, if he can do so.  Certain statistics which have recently been brought before Senators in this House&mdash;Senator Foran, Dr. Rowlette, and some others&mdash; reveal the remarkable fact that there is a very high incidence of sickness amongst domestic workers.  When an explanation of this fact was sought, it was pointed out that the conditions of their employment had a good deal to do with it.  Those conditions have been modified by recent changes in our people's social habits.  Instead of the old roomy houses, with big basements, middle-class people are more and more coming to live in smallish dwellings, and a great many of those have no room for domestic helpers.  In consequence, the custom of &ldquo;living out,&rdquo; coming in to work by the day has grown largely in Dublin and other cities, and in Galway I understand.  Many of the girls thus employed come from the country, and they are obliged to stay in lodgings, of which their modest wages limits the choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the girls are obliged to spend their leisure outdoors, and that has taken a sad toll of their health, as well <Col N="911" /> as other consequences that are deplored by social workers.  It has been pointed out by some social workers, who have had great experience in these matters, for instance, Miss Helena Moloney and Miss Elizabeth O'Connor and others, that a solution of this important problem might be found by the provision of a hostel for domestic workers, a home-like place where they could receive training that would enable them to hold on to their jobs and, at the same time, raise their status considerably by making them competent.  In these places mistresses and housewives might also find a solution of the difficulty they experience, as an arrangement might be made by which they could get at these hostels highly trained domestic helpers, by the day or by the half-day.  These hostels would also provide a solution of the problem we have set when we make it compulsory for these girls to get holidays.  Before the debate closes I should like if the Minister said something on this question to help a section of workers who are vitally interested. I know that this is not directly concerned with the Bill but, having gone from one Minister to another, and as it appears to be nobody's business, if we could get the Minister for Industry and Commerce interested in this aspect of the question, I think a very considerable advance would be made.</P>

      <P>I should like briefly to reinforce the general principles of Senator Baxter's remarks.  I feel that the Minister, in his attempt to give us a balanced economy, has given us an unbalanced economy.  He is beginning at the wrong end.  From the very laudable sentiments of the International Labour Office at Geneva, where this originated, he is giving us conditions, irrespective of the power of the country to carry them.  I think a very good line in that respect was the attitude taken up by the Minister for Agriculture when he stated recently that there was no use in having <i>post mortems.</i>  I agree with that.  We must put agriculture in the position of having increased production, reduced costs and improved rural conditions. The Minister, no doubt with the best <Col N="912" /> intention, wants to impose his economy on the country but urban conditions and rural conditions cannot be separated. All the increased burdens that his policy involves&mdash;this Bill in itself may not be very great&mdash;with increased labour charges and limited hours&mdash; make more difficult the recovery that the Minister for Agriculture rightly said must be brought about in agriculture, if the country is to get into an economic condition.  For that reason I should like to endorse the general principles of Senator Baxter's remarks. There is a legal point about which I may be unduly apprehensive, but I fear that a lot of litigation may arise out of the definition of &ldquo;market gardening,&rdquo;&ldquo;poultry farming&rdquo; and other things connected with the land. As they are not mentioned one would not know under what legal category they fall.  I am afraid there will be a lot of litigation.  Perhaps I may be wrong.  I hope so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always supported the principle of annual holidays, and though I think there is something in what was said that applied to other Bills, I do not think that applies to any great extent to this Bill.  If what Senator Mrs. Concannon said was true, I would not confine it to domestic workers.  Incidentally, I think the Senator was wrong in stating that there are compulsory holidays for domestic workers provided in this Bill.  I think they are the one class of workers that can be paid in lieu of holidays.  Unless there is co-operative provision, either through the churches or other bodies, about the provision of cheap and satisfactory holidays, you will only have added to the general cost of the community, without any substantial benefit to those concerned.  While I support the Bill, I think the Minister has gone too far with regard to the provisions in Section 16, as to the right of inspection of private dwelling-houses.  I put down an amendment on the Committee Stage and withdrew it, as I understood the Minister hoped to introduce a somewhat modified one.  He did not do so, and it was too late then for me to make any alternative suggestion.  I want it to be registered, even now, <Col N="913" /> that one person held the view that it is unnecessary, in order to have this Bill effective, to have a provision like that in Section 16, giving the right to inspect and to interview a person employed there.  The Bill provides that a person nominated by the Minister can, when he thinks fit, simply say that he received information, and may enter any premises where he thinks workers are employed.  That means that he can go into any room in a private dwelling-house if he has authority to do so.  I think that will not be used on normal occasions, but it is a very considerable power.  While we have not got to the stage in this country&mdash;perhaps, we did in the past&mdash; when that power could be abused, I think it is an unnecessary provision, and I am disappointed that the Minister did not see his way to modify it. I remind the House that any person who obstructs or impedes an inspector is liable to penalties.  Once an inspector has been given authorisation by the Minister, or by the official appointed by him, he can go into any place, which includes any part of any private dwelling-house, in which he thinks a person is employed.  That is far too much power, and I am sorry the Minister did not see his way to meet me. It is too late now but, as the point may arise again, I should like to be taken as protesting against that part of the Bill.  Otherwise, I support the general principles of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very difficult to follow Senator Baxter's line of thought.  He said that this Bill will not keep people on the land or will not put them into employment.  There is no possible answer to that assertion except that the Bill is not intended to do either.  He could have said that it will not guarantee fine weather every day and regulate the rainfall every night.  It will not do that either.  It it not intended to.  We did not introduce this Bill to keep people on the land or put them into employment.  It was introduced for the purpose of regulating the conditions applying to certain types of employment and ensuring that persons following those employments, whether in the towns or in rural areas, would be given certain <Col N="914" /> rights to an annual holiday every year. That is all we set out to do.  I say it is sheer nonsense to submit that this Bill would have the effect of driving people off the land.  I would like Senator Baxter to point to the particular section which is going to operate in that way.  This subject of the drift from the land, the movement of population from rural areas into towns has now, as always, aroused a considerable amount of public interest and has got a fair amount of publicity. I say that there is probably no subject upon which more nonsense is spoken by otherwise intelligent people since the economic war ended.  In a country of this kind there must always be a movement of population from rural areas into the towns.  It is inevitable. A farmer with 20 or 30 acres of land with a family of three or four sons can only provide on the land for one of them.  The others must go somewhere else to get an opportunity of making a livelihood.  In any country in the world where there is a 50 per cent. agricultural population there is a movement of population from the rural areas into the urban areas.  That is inevitable and natural.  It would be unnatural and unhealthy to stop it.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter spoke here about the decline in the number of people employed by agriculture.  The number of people employed by agriculture is not an index of agricultural prosperity. It is sometimes quite the contrary.  In the worst years of our agricultural experience in the past decade, and 1933 was probably that year, the year in which the economic war had its major effects, and before the measures taken to remedy its effects had come into operation, there was a considerable increase in the number of persons officially returned as employed on agriculture. There was no indication of agricultural prosperity.</P>

What prospect has the average agricultural worker or farmer's son who comes to Dublin except the prospect of being unemployed in Dublin?  That is his prospect, and if there is movement of population into Dublin it is not due to better economic conditions in Dublin.  Quite the reverse.</P>

Senator Baxter says it is quite hopeless so long as we are passing Bills of this kind. What on earth has this Bill to do with economic conditions?  In what way does this Bill propose to improve agricultural conditions?  I would like Senator Baxter to go away for half an hour and think and, having thought, try to develop that line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have based this legislation and all legislation of the same kind on forms of work, not the parts of the country in which it was done, and we propose to continue along that line.  We can have a discussion here at any time the Senators <Col N="918" /> desire upon the measures that might be taken to make life in rural areas more attractive and to arrest, to the extent we want to arrest the movement of population from rural areas. This is hardly an appropriate occasion for such discussion, but I do say to Senator Baxter and anyone else that these measures designed to effect legislative changes in the conditions of employment of certain classes of workers have no bearing upon that subject whatever and if he starts off thinking upon it on that assumption he is going to arrive at wrong conclusions. He would probably arrive at wrong conclusions in any event, but he is bound to do so if he starts along that line.</P>
      <P>I was astonished that Senator Sir John Keane, who usually shows some inclination to think in a logical way, should have thought fit to support Senator Baxter in his very unsound principles.  Senator Sir John Keane spoke about the additional burden which measures of this kind might put on agriculture and he, of course, begs the question by legislating for annual holidays or improving the conditions which the industrial worker can get are we increasing industrial efficiency or the reverse?  I assert on the experience of every major industrialist in the world that by measures of this kind you increase industrial efficiency rather than the reverse.  I invite Senator Sir John Keane to study the reports upon the subject published by very large employers of labour who carried out various experiments in the curtailing of hours of work and provision of holidays.  He will find that every one of them state they got a much better return in labour when they provided these amenities and facilities than before they attempted it.  If our experience is going to be the same as every other people in the world the enactment of these measures is going to increase industrial efficiency and consequently lighten the burden on agriculture and not increase it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid I cannot deal with the points raised by Senator Mrs. Concannon. They are outside the scope of this Bill and some of them are, I <Col N="919" /> think, likely to be mainly the concern of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, but I would be prepared to discuss them with her at any time.</P>
    <P>One other point was raised by Senator Douglas, who objected to the powers of inspection which were given under Section 16 of the Bill.  He misquoted. He said that as the Bill stood any person appointed by the Minister could, if he thought fit, walk into any room in any house for the purpose of carrying out an inspection. In the case of a private dwelling-house we curtailed the powers of the inspector to a very drastic extent. We provided that an inspector cannot exercise his powers in relation to a private dwelling-house unless and until he has got from the Minister a certificate to the effect that that Minister has good reason to believe that an offence against the Act has been committed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out that it was from the Minister or an officer appointed by him and that is exactly what is stated.  It is not the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For that purpose appointed by the Minister&mdash;for the purpose of giving such a certificate. I decided against any change in these provisions in the Bill, because I felt that if we were to change them the powers of inspection which it is necessary to have would be largely ineffective.  Some power there must be there if we are going to prevent evasion of the measure.  The powers given to inspectors under this Bill are much less drastic than those given to inspectors under the National Health Insurance Acts.  The average private employer and occupier of a private dwelling-house has had experience of the operation of the National Health Insurance Acts for something like 20 years, and I do not think that anybody can complain that the existence of these powers has proved onerous or enabled inspectors to act in a manner which might reasonably be resented by any householder.  I do not think that in the ordinary course the Department will undertake the enforcement <Col N="920" /> of the provisions of this measure in relation to domestic servants except on complaint received or upon some evidence being forthcoming that the provisions are not being observed.  If such complaint is forthcoming, or if there is evidence that in an individual case the terms of the Act are being evaded, I think the Department must have the powers of inspection so that it can fulfil its obligation and duty of enforcing the measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often been in better form for addressing the House, but I feel that there are certain points which have not yet been sufficiently stressed in this very interesting debate.  In particular, I think the point of view of the people who would be called &ldquo;na daoine macánta&rdquo; in the other official language&mdash;the plain people of Protestant Ulster&mdash;has not yet been adequately expressed.  I am quite aware of my own lack of competence adequately to express that point of view, because although I spent the first 16 years of my life among them and lived their life and thought their thoughts, it is now some 33 years since I emerged into, shall we say, the broader light of an Irish national outlook.  But still I feel that in the absence of any person better qualified than myself to express that necessary point of view, I must do my best to give expression of it.  Even if I must speak occasionally in inverted commas, at all events, I will try to give what I believe to be an honest account of the real feelings and sentiments of my Ulster co-religionists.  In doing so, I shall take an attitude of what I might call philosophic detachment both to their sentiments and feelings and to Irish national sentiments and feelings.  In taking that attitude I will depart from my usual custom, which is, to speak as a person who is fully a member of the national <Col N="922" /> household.  I prefer to speak from a more detached point of view and to exercise the privilege of being a somewhat semi-foreign element in the national household.</P>
      <P>I think that the question should be approached in as realistic a manner as possible and in doing so perhaps the best thing I can do is to give briefly some personal reminiscences, the application of which to the questions at issue will, I hope, become apparent in due course.  I was at school in Dungannon in one of the old Royal schools and in that capacity I had as school-fellows people coming from the same sort of people as myself&mdash;the &ldquo;daoine macánta&rdquo; of Protestant Ulster.  One of these people has since risen to high office in the British Treasury.  Another, who rubbed shoulders with me, is now British Consul-General in Tunis.  A third, who was at school with me, is now Governor of the Central Provinces of India.  And another family with which I am particularly well acquainted contributed three sons to the Indian Civil Service; two became medical men in England, and only one was able to pursue a career in Ireland. Now, those academic or scholastic or official distinctions were only possible for these school-fellows of mine because they had the invaluable possession of British citizenship. As to that I believe there is 100 per cent. opposition not only in Protestant Ulster but even in that part of political Ulster which is not Protestant to anything which would involve the loss or even the jeopardising of that substantial privilege of British citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people whom I have in mind, these school-fellows and college-fellows of mine, who have achieved considerable distinction in many walks of life, in their outlook on Irish affairs, adopted for the most part a liberal point of view and were, like me, in the fullest sympathy with the national ideal, in so far as it was a desire to obtain the completest possible form of national autonomy within the fabric of the British Commonwealth of Nations. You may, I think, divide the Protestant community roughly into two-thirds, who take a strictly sectarian <Col N="923" /> outlook on all questions of the hour, and another one-third, who are more representative of what I might call the Ulster liberal tradition.  But in this matter of British citizenship and of the value which they attach to it, the liberal one-third think and feel precisely similarly to the other two-thirds, whose outlook is much more sectarian and much more inclined to extremism.</P>
    <P>Now, if I understand the policy of the Government aright, it is that if and when we succeed in effecting the unity of all Ireland, on that day there will be declared a republic of all Ireland, and not until that day.  Now, if that means anything at all it seems to me that from that day this possession of British citizenship, which is rightly prized up there, will cease to be their possession, and it also means that so long as Partition exists and so long as no republic is declared, we here enjoy the <i>de facto</i> privilege of British citizenship which our Northern fellow-countrymen continue to enjoy <i>de jure.</i>  Now, Partition is a very high price to pay for anything, but it is, in my view, not too high a price to pay for the <i>de jure</i> possession of British citizenship up there and the <i>de facto</i> possession of British citizenship down here.</P>
    <P>I come now to what I might call the less rational grounds of objection to reunion on the part of my Ulster co-religionists, and, in doing so, I should like to analyse faithfully and truthfully the mentality and the outlook on life of my Ulster friends and neighbours, with, perhaps, occasional remarks, by way of levelling up the balance, not altogether complimentary to the outlook on life of some of my Nationalist friends.  The Ulsterman's mind proceeds by a kind of philosophic dichotomy to divide up everything into two classes.  He argues, rather illogically perhaps, that everything must be either white or black, or perhaps I should rather say that he argues that everything must be orange or green.  He does not readily admit any half tones or shades between those two extremes, and when he first takes a peep at life he is aware of a <Col N="924" /> great division of mankind into two, and only two classes, known in Ulster, frankly, as Protestants and Papishes. You will observe the preservation of the seventeenth century term &ldquo;Papishes,&rdquo; and that it is still the ordinary Ulsterman's term by which he describes his Roman Catholic fellow-countrymen.  I am using the term here in inverted commas, so to speak, by way of explanation of some of the things I shall say.  He finds it extremely difficult to use any sort of description other than Protestants and Papishes, or to recognise any other sort of division, but when the facts are too strong for him he will admit that there are such things as rotten Protestants.  I have the honour to belong to that category myself, and I think that some of my colleagues in this House and elsewhere would also be regarded, in certain Ulster quarters, as qualifying for that epithet.  In the matter of Papishes, I think, he does make a distinction between what I might call Papishes in the abstract and what he would call, although not so politely, epithetical Papishes.  Apart, however, from that tendency to divide things into absolutely two classes, he finds it extremely difficult to think in terms of half lights and shadows.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might illustrate that outlook on life by telling a story which may be already familiar to some Senators.  The story is connected with a certain Sunday school in Belfast, in which a teacher was explaining to these Protestant children that God had made everybody; whereupon one little boy piped up: &ldquo;Did He make the Papishes?&rdquo; The teacher had to admit, rather reluctantly, that He had, whereupon the small boy thought for a bit and then said: &ldquo;Well, He will regret it.&rdquo;  In other words&mdash;I am speaking now of the two-thirds of the common people of Protestant Ulster&mdash; they regard the Roman Catholics as rather a regrettable mistake on the part of the Almighty, and our real problem is to try to educate them out of that point of view.  I do not myself see how some of the methods which have been practiced are going to produce that desirable education.  In their present mentality, if you did succeed <Col N="925" /> in bringing them into a united Ireland, the effect would be somewhat similar to bringing a bag of weasles into a cage of canaries.  They would be most difficult and troublesome fellow-citizens, and I doubt very much if we would have a moment's peace if we did succeed in bringing them in.</P>
    <P>That brings me to one of the most fantastic of all the fantastic points of view expressed about this matter, and that is the view that the Northern people are puppets in the hands of their Belfast Government and that the Belfast Government is a puppet in the hands of the Machiavellian British Government.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  These Northern Protestants are essentially and fundamentally democratic and equalitarian in their outlook.  They have their political leaders, but they differ in their attitude to political leadership diametrically from what the attitude is here and, indeed, in other countries. Here, one's followers follow their leader, but up there the leaders must follow their followers, and the Ulster Protestants have a short way with leaders who try to lead them anywhere they do not want to go.  Therefore, if ever we are to make peace with Northern Ireland it will not be via the British Government or even via the Belfast Government.  It will only be by direct contact between the people of this area and the Protestant democracy of Ulster.</P>
    <P>Another point which was mentioned in the course of the debate rather roused my primeval Ulster racial instincts.  That was the view maintained that these Ulster people are foreigners.  There were some references to the brood of the settlers and the Ulster brood, and what not. Well, now, consider for a moment that if they were foreigners, if they were common or garden English people, for example, with their well-known English characteristic of complete indifference to their past history and their complete readiness to give and take and compromise on almost anything&mdash;if the Ulster Protestants were like the ordinary Englishmen, would they not have made accommodation with you long ago and have come in <Col N="926" /> and effected a reunion of Ireland? The Ulsterman's trouble is that he is not a foreigner, or, at all events, not English, but that he is more Irish than the Irish themselves.  For one thing, they share with you a belief in the sacred right of rebellion.  They are ready to believe that there are occasions when, in obedience to a higher law, men are justified in appealing to force and to resist the law of the State as it is for the time being. Now, I might illustrate that belief of theirs in the sacred right of rebellion in at least four instances.  After all, when they manned the Walls of Derry, were they not rebelling against their lawful sovereign, King Séamus II, and, as regards the people outside the Walls of Derry, were they not loyal subjects and soldiers of a king?  There were no republicans in those days, but the Ulster people in those days took the point of view that rebellion is sometimes justified and they fought for an ideal of a monarchy which should be in some respects a crowned republic and in which the king, in the last resort, should be amenable to the will of the people.  In other words, the men behind the Walls of Derry were better republicans than were the besiegers, whereas those resisting them at that time were defending a theory of kingship in which the king claimed the right to practise tyranny even in defiance of the will of the people. That was not the last and only time they rebelled.  The chief difference between Ulster and Irish rebellions is that the Ulster rebellions are generally so overwhelmingly successful that the rebels become loyalists and the loyalists become rebels before you have time to turn round.  Their cousins who emigrated from mis-government and commercial restrictions in Ulster, in order to form part of the American colonies, took part in the success of the rebellion which led to the freedom of the United States of America.  Coming down to the time of the Irish Volunteer movement, the Ulster people were prominent in that movement also, and although it gave rise to no actual violence, it was undoubtedly an exercise of the sacred right of rebellion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> But in our own day we have the example of the Ulster Volunteers, who claimed the right to resist by force the imposition of Home Rule.  It is not for me to say whether they were right or wrong on that occasion.  But it is a matter of historic fact that certain important consequences happened in Europe and in Ireland following on that Ulster threat of rebellion and one of those was the movement of the Irish Volunteers which culminated in the Insurrection of Easter Week.  So that you who represent the ideals and the spirit of the men of Easter, 1916, should look on those Ulster Volunteers as, in a particular sense, your spiritual progenitors, Because if they had not taken the line they did take you would not have taken the line you took.  And many of you owe your position in public life to the line they took under the leadership of Sir Edward Carson.  That being the case, I think you should in that event inaugurate an annual pilgrimage like the pilgrimage to the grave of Wolfe Tone, and that pilgrimage should be to the Cathedral in Belfast, where the body of Lord Carson lies.</P>
    <P>A second Irish characteristic of Ulster is that Ulster has a tendency to take a somewhat romantic view of things.  The tendency of Ulstermen is to dramatise the situation.  That is one of the things that makes them somewhat difficult to deal with and somewhat unreasonable at times.</P>
    <P>Ulstermen have a third characteristic which brings them close to you in their essential spiritual and moral outlook and that is their willingness to sacrifice their real material interests out of regard for some sentimental consideration or some principle which they hold is worthy of sacrifice.  That characteristic might be illustrated in your case by your otherwise unjustifiable economic war.  But in their case also their willingness to sacrifice material interests for sentimental considerations is shown by the fact that Derry City has preferred to remain in the Six-County area though everyone of their commercial interests dictated that she should form part and parcel of what is now Éire.  But Derry happens to be one of their holy cities, one of the <Col N="928" /> meccas of their faith, and they would lose a lot in real wealth before they would sacrifice Derry or Enniskillen for any material consideration.</P>
    <P>Another mental characteristic of my Ulster friends is their absolute refusal to accept even the evidence of their own senses if that evidence tells against what they regard as their principles or perhaps only their preconceived ideas.  That characteristic might be illustrated by the story of the Ulsterman who was visiting the zoo in Dublin.  He was looking at the cage in which there was a giraffe.  Someone near him heard him muttering these words: &ldquo;There is no such animal, there is no such animal.&rdquo;  He refused to believe in its existence in spite of ocular demonstration.  We might leave it to an Ulster person to retort that the Southern Irish are sometimes capable of somewhat similar behaviour. Senator MacDermot the other day stated what was the truth, that the mother tongue of nine-tenths of the people of National Ireland is the English language.  I could feel Senators almost squirming in their chairs with annoyance and indignation. They failed, like the Ulsterman on the subject of the giraffe to accept the evidence of their eyes.  They felt inclined to say that there was no such animal or that what in their hearts they knew to be the truth was not true.</P>
    <P>So much for similarities in temperament between my Ulster co-religionists and Irish Nationalists.  But perhaps the greatest similarity of all and the most Irish of all their characteristics is their downright refusal to be governed by other Irishmen.  That has been a characteristic and a most regrettable characteristic of Irishmen in all ages, that some of them have been willing to prefer foreign rule rather than the temporary triumph of a rival Irish faction.  They would not allow a rival Irish faction to rule over them.  So there have been Dermot MacMurroughs down through all the ages of Irish history.  Therefore, there is nothing very remarkable in the fact that these Ulster Irishmen refuse to be governed by other Irishmen.  So much for the similarities.</P>
    <P>We now come to the contrast between <Col N="929" /> Ulster and Ireland.  The most obvious contrast is the well-known loyalty to the Crown which the Protestant Ulsterman believes in and practices.  People have said that the Ulster people are equally loyal to the &ldquo;half-crown&rdquo; as they are to the Crown.  If you said that to the average Ulster Protestant he would probably not reject the insinuation; he would say it is only part of their typical Ulster sanity; that they are able to reconcile their material and temporal welfare with their feelings and emotions.  If the Ulsterman were historically minded he might retort that Irish Nationalists also were loyal to the Crown.  He would say that &ldquo;Ulstermen are loyal to the Crown, and it pays us to be, but you were only loyal to the Crown when it did not pay you to be loyal.  You were loyal to the Crown in the time of Charles I, and you lost two-thirds of your landed property because of this loyalty.  You were loyal to the Crown in the time of James II, and you lost the other one-third in consequence.&rdquo;  In fact, he might say that the tendency to regard monarchical institutions with veneration has been a characteristic of the Irish race for the first 600 or 700 years of Anglo-Irish relations. Ulstermen might and do say that it was they, in fact, who intruded republicanism into Ireland at the end of the eighteenth century.  But having no further use for it then, they passed it over to another section of the Irish, and in the common phrase &ldquo;sold them a pup.&rdquo;  You might perhaps say that Ulstermen found the monarchical institution a considerable political convenience. They value it and venerate it as such.  And they might retort that we down here are much more monarchical in our outlook than they are, and that we are much more hierarchical in our outlook than they are, but have not the sense to make the most of these loyalties and prefer republicanism as a political convenience.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter in connection with this real loyalty of Protestant Ulster to the Crown is this:&mdash; there is a certain sense of exclusiveness, a certain sense of being different, a certain sense of monopoly <Col N="930" /> about the Ulster position and the fact that they have reason to believe that they have that monopoly of loyalty to the Crown makes them enjoy that loyalty ten times as much as they would enjoy it if loyalty to the Crown were as common south of the Border as it is north of the Border.  They get a kick out of their loyalty to the Crown precisely because the other side at all events say that they are not loyal to the Crown.  If that be psychologically the case and if you want to turn the Crown from what it now is, a wedge of division between North and South, into being a bond of union, the correct way of doing it is for loyalty to the Crown to become general throughout the country.  In that case you would take the wind out of the Northman's sails so far as his loyalty to the Crown is a symbol of division, and you might get the situation in which the Crown would be what it was always intended to be, a principle of union.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I want to make a few brief remarks on what I may regard as the more recent history of this question of reunion.  I have been in personal touch with my own friends and relations in Northern Ireland most of whom, like me, belong to what they call the liberal tradition and are quite unaffected by a sectarian outlook, and what I have to say now will be based entirely on the impressions derived from conversation with such quite uninfluential people in Northern Ireland.  Undoubtedly, under Mr. Cosgrave's Government things were going well down here and the people up North were favourably impressed by the rapid improvement in the general economic situation which took place then.  I know that they were rather less opposed to the idea of reunion with us in, say, the year 1930 than they had been in the year 1921; but at the same time they have a natural instinctive caution, and they said: &ldquo;Ah, wait until de Valera gets in and then you will see what you will see.&rdquo;  Well, they did wait until de Valera got in, and in the first few years I confess that I consider that the effects of his general policy did much to widen the gulf that had been narrowing in the previous years, but it might have been worse. <Col N="931" /> I must admit that if we could divorce the personality of the Taoiseach from some of the policies associated with his government, then in my view that personality is not necessarily a liability, and may even be an asset from the point of view of this question of Northern reunion.  I think there is a kind of sneaking admiration for the personality of the Taoiseach, even in the most unexpected Protestant circles up there, and if I am right in that view it is at all events something to be set on the credit side of the account.</P>
    <P>I think this whole question of Partition should be approached now not in the light of past history, but in the light or, rather, in the shadow of the present international situation, and that being so, what our Northern friends should ask themselves is: would reunion, based on consent, tend to strengthen the cause of democracy and the unity of the British Commonwealth of Nations or otherwise: would it make it easier for Irish influences both at home and abroad to be exercised on the side of democratic nations whose future safety is now gravely imperilled; in other words, would it facilitate, or otherwise, Anglo-Irish-American co-operation in foreign policy?  Now, as I have said already, the Northman is capable of sacrificing material considerations for a cause which he considers sufficiently worthy. It is for us to prove to him that these causes&mdash;the cause of freedom and democracy in the world as a whole&mdash; are sufficiently worthy to ask him to make whatever material sacrifices may be the result of union with us, for the sake of those causes, but I can assure you that we have our work cut out for us.  In his reply, I hope that the Taoiseach will speak not at all as the leader of Fianna Fáil and not even as the head of the Executive Government, but rather as a distinguished President of the League of Nations Assembly, and, I hope, as a future President and Viceroy of a reunited Kingdom of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose the motion.  I congratulate the House on the patience and moderation it <Col N="932" /> exercised in listening to Senator MacDermot move his motion.  It was certainly a tribute to the House that it should have listened with patience to Senator MacDermot in expressing the views that he did.  When he was speaking, I could quite feel for Senator Hayes and other members of the House who had put a rifle on their shoulders in Easter Week and marched to the Post Office.  It was their efforts that made it possible for Senator MacDermot to be able to come here to this House and address it, and I repeat it was a great tribute to those gentlemen to listen with such patience to the speech that was delivered here by Senator MacDermot.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with some of the statements that were made by Senator MacDermot.  He said that, so far as Trinity College was concerned, there was no institution in this country which had a more immediate interest in Irish unity than it.  Well, if Senator MacDermot's statement is true, so far as he himself is concerned, I am very pleased indeed to hear it, but so far as I am concerned, I want to say that I have always looked upon Trinity College as a citadel of British imperialism in this the capital of our country.  While on that I want to pay a tribute to the speech that was delivered by Senator Alton.  It was a moderate speech and, in my opinion, if Senator Alton continues on the lines indicated by his speech I can well see him becoming a fully fledged republican one of these days as one of the representatives of Trinity College.  I hope that day will soon come.</P>
      <P>Senator MacDermot also said</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that the campaign at present being conducted by the Government and their supporters, for the purpose of getting rid of Partition, is being run on lines that make it do more harm than good.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what lines of policy the Government could put into operation to remove Partition that, at the same time, would satisfy Senator MacDermot.  I do not think it would be possible for the Government to do anything to please him.  He knows <Col N="933" /> very well that whatever the Government did it would not please him. Senator MacDermot also said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have a fairly wide acquaintance among British politicians of different Parties, and I have yet to meet a single one who would wish to stand in the way of an agreed settlement between North and South.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is quite easy for English politicians to speak of an agreed settlement, particularly when they know that an agreed settlement is not possible while Six Counties of our country are in the possession of a foreign army.  The Senator also said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Those who imagine that the British are going out of their way to stimulate opposition between sorts of Irishmen, to keep alive strife that ought to be allowed to die, are just showing themselves completely ignorant of British psychology.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the history of the British occupation of Palestine, Egypt and India?  There was to be a self-determination vote for Tyrone and Fermanagh according to the Treaty, but it was never taken.  Did Derry City get the opportunity of joining in with the Free State?  I think Professor Johnston said something about that.  Derry City never did get that opportunity.  Look at the position in Derry at the present moment where the Nationalist majority is in a minority on the municipal council. That is how the Nationalist majority is treated in Derry, and that is the sort of self-determination that they have there.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDermot also said that the</P>
    <P>&ldquo;British troops are regarded not as a foreign army but as a part of their own army in the North.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder do the majority of the people of Tyrone and Fermanagh regard the British Army as their own or 46 per cent. of the people of Armagh or 80,000 of Belfast's citizens.  I wonder <Col N="934" /> do they regard the British Army as their own army.  It is very difficult to know where Senator MacDermot gets his facts or how it is that he should come to express such views here.  Further on he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Secondly, there is the question of the Crown, allegiance to the King as the King of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Would the people of Ireland be prepared to regard the President as the representative of the King?  No, he is the representative of the people, and the President of Ireland without any King.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDermot said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A short time ago the Taoiseach made a speech in which he said that the British were foreigners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Senator objects to the Taoiseach calling these people foreigners, but is not any man who is not in his own land a foreigner?  I think the Taoiseach was perfectly right and justified in making that statement.  He also asserted that the British did some good work in this country.  If reducing our population from 8,000,000 to what it is to-day, if giving us the Black and Tans and if giving us Partition represents good work, Senator MacDermot can have it.  I do not regard it as good work.  The Senator also said that Gaelic is not our national language and that it has long ceased to be our national language.  This is a matter which I can leave to Senator McGinley because he can deal with it better than I, but the man who says that it is not our national language is hardly worthy of being a member of this House.</P>
    <P>He quoted Thomas Davis:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Who expressed the view that if Ireland were given freedom to manage her own affairs, it would be well to continue the link of the Crown.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that is Thomas Davis or not, but I can give the House something which is Thomas Davis. Thomas Davis said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And now, Englishmen, listen to us! Though you were to-morrow to give us the best tenures on earth&mdash;<Col N="935" /> though you were to equalise Presbyterian, Catholic, and Episcopalian&mdash; though you were to give us the amplest representation in your Senate&mdash;though you were to restore our absentees, disencumber us of your debt, and redress every one of our fiscal wrongs&mdash;and though, in addition to all this, you plundered the treasures of the world to lay gold at our feet, and exhausted the resources of your genius to do us worship and honour&mdash;still we tell you ... we would spurn your gifts, if the condition were that Ireland should remain a province.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We tell you, and all whom it may concern, come what may&mdash;bribery or deceit, justice, policy, or war&mdash;we tell you, in the name of Ireland that Ireland shall be a nation!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Senator said something about Parnell.  I do not think Parnell ever advocated physical force, but he never repudiated it, and physical force was one of the strongest points in the Parnell campaign, though he did not repudiate it.  I am afraid the MacDermots of Coolavin, if they heard the Senator's views, would not be very fond of those who had followed them.</P>
    <P>I oppose the motion.  I now come to the amendment.  I am not very much in favour of it either because it does not go far enough, in my opinion. It says that we are not to have any force.  I put it to the Taoiseach: if he goes over to England and interviews Mr. Chamberlain, and if Mr. Chamberlain says: This is a matter entirely for the Irish and you must settle it between yourselves, is the Taoiseach to come back and leave the matter there and are we going to have Partition for another 20 years?  There is no doubt that force will have to be applied.  It is a strange thing that when all the countries in the world are talking about force and building armaments, while pretending to desire peace, we should be the only people who do not want to apply force.  Is it not a fact that force has been applied to our people all over the North for the past 20 years?  Is it not a fact that force is being applied to them to-day and while I should like to see this <Col N="936" /> matter settled peaceably, I think force is the only thing.  The 1918 General Election gave Sinn Féin 72 seats and in January, 1919, Sinn Féin formed the First Dáil and reaffirmed the Declaration of 1916.  I think that step should be taken to-day.</P>
    <P>The 1920 Act, which put Partition into force, and for which not a single Irishman voted, was a British Act passed by a British Parliament and kept in force by a British Parliament. The British Prime Minister now has the audacity to state that the question is purely an Irish question.  In 1921, the Treaty reimposed Partition and it has since been maintained by the Army of England and nobody else.  If British statesmen are sincere in saying that they desire a peace with Ireland, all we ask is that they withdraw their army of occupation.  If they do, the question of Partition is solved.  If the army of occupation had not been in the North, this House and Eamon de Valera would not allow Eamonn Donnelly to remain in Belfast jail for a month for having the audacity to visit his own home.  It was the army of occupation which kept Eamon de Valera from acting in that matter, so that once the army is gone, Partition is settled.</P>

      <P>Senator MacDermot is well able to look after himself.  Some people say that we should not coerce the people of the Six Counties.  Let me remind the House that it is not the people of the Six Counties whom we are coercing.  They have been the subject of coercing for 20 years and there appears to be no hope of removing this coercing except by at least implied force.  There is no doubt in my mind about that.  The old Irish Party agitated for justice for 40 years, and while I do not say that they did not <Col N="937" /> do good work, it took the 1916 men and the 1920-21 men to bring about the position we have to-day.  We have now three-quarters of our country, that position being brought about largely by force, and I think a little force will bring us the other quarter.  If our Army walked into the North to-morrow, our moral and legal rights would be difficult to dispute.  I am satisfied of that.  Great Britain has asked that all Italian soldiers be withdrawn from Spain.  Why does Britain not take her soldiers from our country?  That is the first thing she should do.  Mr. Chamberlain could fly to Munich to settle European questions, but he forgot about the question of the North, which he had not settled and which was nearer his own door. He can give away other countries, as he did at Munich, but he keeps part of our country which does not belong to him.</P>
      <P>The amendment asks that we should negotiate with England.  What are we to negotiate?  Have we anything to give away?  If our Government negotiated, on what would they negotiate? We have nothing to give away.  There is only one matter of negotiation and that could be put on a half sheet of notepaper&mdash;to ask England to take her army of occupation out of our country and then the boundary question is settled.</P>

The late Government, we heard, made a very good bargain&mdash; the word was coupled with a strong adjective&mdash;but the last negotiations went on for a time, and when we came back, we gave Britain £10,000,000 of the taxpayers' money.  For what? For injuring, to some extent, our builtup industries.  I do not think it would be desirable that we should have any more negotiations like those.</P>

      <P>As I say, I do not think further negotiations like those by which we paid £10,000,000 would be desirable. We have nothing to negotiate in this matter.  What we have to do is to ask these people to get out, and when they do, I am confident that the position in the North will be easily dealt with and everything satisfactorily settled.  I have here a document issued by the I.R.A., in the form of an ultimatum to the British Government, and when the Taoiseach is replying, I should like to know what his view on it is, because I think it most important.  I have read the document very closely, and it harmonises very accurately with my view. There is only one regret I have in regard to it&mdash;that it was not the Government of the State which issued it, because if they did so, they would find the whole nation lined up behind them and there would be considerable force behind them.  I should like to know if the Taoiseach endorses this document or agrees with it.  If he does not, I should like to know what are the points in it with which he disagrees, and also his remedy for the present situation.  There is no doubt that Partition cannot go on for the next twenty years, and if it is not settled by peaceful means, it will certainly be settled by other means, because young men are rising now who will do it.</P>
      <P>The way they are going to rule the North is by building new Army headquarters, at a cost of £400,000.  That is the way they are going to leave our territory.  They are building new barracks for us when we take charge&mdash; I don't think.  Another matter with which the Taoiseach might deal is that of the twelve young men locked up in London&mdash;Charles James Casey, 23, a name which suggests an Irish origin; George Brendan Kane, 23; Daniel Fitzpatrick, 21; Jack Logue, 17; Francis James Burns, 17; Gerald Francis Wharton, 30; John Mitchel, 24&mdash;a very good name&mdash;James Michael Lyons, 26; Michael O'Shea, 24; Michael Preston, 23; James Stewart, 25.

If they carry on the policy that was successful in 1916, they will make another portion of Ireland free.  No man in Ireland has a greater admiration for the Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera, than I have.  He has made great sacrifices for his country, and brought us an unparalleled measure of freedom.  I hope he will take a lead in this matter, and not rule force out.  He has said he will rule force out.  But I hope he will recant, as he has done before, and go back to force.  Let him take a leading position in this question, and get it settled by peaceful means, if possible, but, if it cannot be done in that way, then let him not rule force out.  In that way he will get the people behind him.  If he does not settle this question, then the young men will.</P>

      <P>When I saw these resolutions and amendments on the Paper, I thought they would give an opportunity to the Seanad to express views which would be helpful to those in power.  The legitimate authority is the Government of the day.  In their hands, I take it, is the responsibility for dealing with and settling this question. Instead of helpful speeches, most of those we have heard have been quite the opposite.  Senator Johnston drew a pretty picture and treated us to an interesting psychological investigation <Col N="940" /> of the Northern mind.  He took our minds back to many good things done by the leaders of thought in the North.  He referred to the various rebellions and suggested that there was rather a mercenary motive for these rebellions, that they did it just because they got a kick out of it and that they stood for the Crown because they got a half-crown out of it.  I do not agree with Senator Johnston:</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator said something like it.  If I misinterpreted him, I withdraw.  I happened to live in the North in my early life and I met there the common, plain people for whom Senator Johnston professes to speak.  If the plain, common people of the North knew where they were being led in the past, if they had been educated in the national outlook, they &mdash;the common, working people&mdash;would not be led to-day by a group of political exploiters.  In my time&mdash; 30 years ago&mdash;men in this House and in the Gallery to-day were engaged in the work of teaching the national idea in the North.  I had experience of various schools there.  I know that when we were free in the South, under England's rule, to educate our children, the workers of the North were not free.  The wealth of the North was built up on a slave trade.  These boys and girls were taken at the age of 11 years and put to work in the mills and factories on alternate days. They were permitted to attend five days out of ten at school and the other five days they were working from six in the morning until six in the evening for a few paltry shillings.  The households were not supported by those who should legitimately support them but by the children and women. Thirty years ago, civilised conditions did not exist in Belfast, and that applied to the whole of Ulster.  The case was even worse during the South African War and the Great War. These children attended school on five days and worked on the alternate five days.  Children over 11 years of age went into the mills at 6 o'clock in the morning and worked until 8 o'clock. They went home and snatched a crust <Col N="941" /> and then ran to school, sleepy, tired and brain-fagged.  They made an attempt to study until 3 o'clock in the evening.  They resumed work in the mills at 4 o'clock and remained there until 6 o'clock.  That was Northern civilisation 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>Had these children been educated as freemen, had they been educated under a free and democratic Government we should not have in the North to-day the condition of affairs we have.  The mass of the people were brought up in ignorance.  The education a section of them did get was to hate those who had a religion different from their own. I speak from experience and I know that religious animosity and religious strife were kept alive there for political reasons.  If a youngster were playing in a pool on the street, he would be told that there were three Popes in the pool.  He would run from the Scarlet Woman and tell his mother that he threw a big stone at the Pope and that that finished him. That was the kind of education given there 30 years ago.  I am glad to hear from Senator Johnston that it is changed to-day.  Every reform proposed by the English Government for the last three-quarters of a century had to be forced down the throats of the section who governed the North and who were sometimes described as the Orange Lodges of the North because they pulled the strings and the political puppets act accordingly.  The political leaders were not the instruments of persecution; they were merely the puppets, the strings that were pulled by the Orange Lodges for political reasons and for economic profit. Every reform that was proposed by the English Government had to be forced on the leaders of the northern people and that lasted for a period of 75 years.  Even the disestablishment of the Church was not accepted without a struggle.  Force was threatened, threats of force were used.  When the Northern lodges saw that England was insisting, then, although protesting, they agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admire Senator MacDermot's optimism if he can overcome the prejudices that exist in the North against a section of our people.  He told us that 29 years ago he began his efforts <Col N="942" /> in the work of conversion.  He is still optimistic enough to hope that, if he continues on those lines, fruits may come.  I fear the fruits will not come; I fear that nobody can remove Partition, no advance from this State to the North can remove it.  I cannot visualise any set of conditions in this State, social or economic, that will cause the Northerners to change their attitudes towards the rest of Ireland. Senator MacDermot told us that some effort should be made.  Well, efforts are being and have been made.  Senator MacDermot says that if we abandon everything we have gained, all the measure of freedom we have gained, and walk back to where we were 20 years ago, then the path will be quite easy.  I do not think the Irish people are prepared to travel that path over again.  They have travelled it once and they do not want to do it again.</P>
    <P>Let me deal now with some of the things that were opposed by these people.  Take the days of the land agitation. The men of the North suffered equally with their Southern colleagues in the days of landlordism.  They were rack-rented and evicted, exactly the same treatment was received by them as was received by the people of the South, and what was their attitude? What was the attitude of the leaders of political thought in the North? What was the attitude of Protestants and Presbyterians?  They stood by the landlords and they opposed any measure of reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>History points it out, and there is no question that when evictions took place in the Free State the men who came to act as emergency men and to carry out the work of eviction were the sons of small farmers from the North of Ireland.  It was a rare thing in this country, so far as I know, to find a man from what we called the Free State acting as an emergency man.  When they wanted emergency men, they went to the men who were dragged at the tail of landlordism at the behest of the Lodges of the North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Senator MacDermot deny that they opposed the Act of 1898?  The Act of 1898 abolished Grand Juries.  It gave the people a measure of control through the councils. Will the Senator deny that they opposed that Act strenuously, but accepted it when they got the hint from England?  Will he deny that in the councils they opposed the building of labourers' cottages under the Act of 1883?  They opposed that vigorously in the House of Commons, and when the opposition was overcome there, will the Senator deny that they took the opposition into the county councils and, as a result, under some councils in the North not a single cottage was built?</P>
      <P>There has been reference here to Fermanagh, where the people are wedded to the Crown, definite in their allegiance to the Crown.  Enniskillen is somewhere in that place.  Are the peasants of Fermanagh aware that not a single cottage was built by the county council, which was controlled by the Protestant element, until investigations and sworn inquiries had to be made, and they were forced to build them?  They opposed the Act of Parliament that abolished the Grand Jury.  They took their opposition into the councils and, to a certain extent, did all in their power to make the Act unworkable.  When they found that England insisted upon the Act being made operative, only then did they obey.  Although they objected and protested, they fell in and obeyed their masters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A moderate measure of devolution was proposed by Sir Anthony MacDonnell, and even that was vigorously opposed by the Northern element, the ancestors of the very people who are there to-day and who would maintain Partition.  They threatened to line the ditches from Derry to the Boyne at that time.  They threatened all kinds of things if that measure of devolution were to go through.  There is another thing which will surprise some of you.  This is <Col N="944" /> modern history.  They opposed the granting of old age pensions.  I wonder has anybody told the men in the North that their masters of to-day opposed the granting of a few shillings a week to people who gave their lives in the service of the State?  That is the fact.  I wonder is the Northern mentality so much changed that the persuasive powers of Senator MacDermot can create a revolution in their minds?</P>

I would be rather disposed to refer to him by the more appropriate term, a political zebra.  I do not mean to be offensive, but the Senator told us that when he belonged to a certain Party, the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, he proposed certain resolutions in the Dáil, and when he was in the Centre Party he proposed resolutions there.</P>

Instead of helping the Irish people who are standing behind the legitimate Party which has this work in hands they have been throwing spanners into the machine.  I do not for a moment suggest that it was done intentionally, <Col N="945" /> but unfortunately it has been done. Now, the people who have resisted reforms for the last 75 years will continue to resist reforms, but, if they get a little hint from their masters, things may be different.  I do not believe that the Northern people are responsible for this.  I do not think at the same time it would be a tremendous advantage to get them in at the moment.</P>

      <P>I should say that the Government of Ulster at the moment is not in Belfast; the Government is from Westminster.  Those people who imposed Partition should remove it.  It is in their hands, and in no other hands.  Any movement for its removal will have I believe the support of 75 per cent or 90 per cent. of the people of this country.</P>

      <P>I have not been very anxious to intervene in this debate, and some of the speeches I have listened to have made me hope that anything I say will certainly not be as harmful as they were.  Personally, I regret that this debate was ever brought up, and I should imagine that the promoter of it must by this time also regret it intensely.  He indicates that he is gravely concerned about this fact of Partition.  I wonder if he thinks that that has been in any way ameliorated or given a more helpful aspect by the fact that in this House we got up and spoke about those people whom we are claiming should come within some jurisdiction of ours as the planters' brood, as the people who were wrongheaded all through their history.  I think the debate has only been harmful, and I can state quite sincerely that anything I have to say is very far from having any intention of making things more difficult for the Government.  I do recognise that the Government is the responsible body; that it is appropriate that the Government <Col N="946" /> should act, and that in a matter like this it is very easy to do harm.  I am quite satisfied that speeches like those of Senator Kelly, Senator Magennis, and other speeches too, have done harm and not good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise Partition as a fact, and I do not think in relation to this fact and our attitude towards it, and our proposals in regard to it, that any good is promoted by going into the history of it.  There is the fact of Partition. It is a physical fact.  It may be said to be a physical political fact in this country, and I do not think that that is what is so eminently regrettable. The fact is that, behind that, is a Partition in mind.  The fact is that that physical political Partition is the implementation of the desire of a large number of our fellow-countrymen to be in the Six Counties.  Mind you, our whole claim to the abolition of Partition is based upon the fact that those people are our own fellow-countrymen, and to claim that they should be brought in on the grounds that they are a lot of foreigners, planters brood, and all the rest of it, to my mind, vitiates the whole case that might be made.  It has seemed to me for a long time past that amongst ordinary people the greatest wisdom with regard to Partition is to remain silent about it.  I have very little criticism to make of the Government with regard to Partition. When I hear Senator MacDermot speak I often think that he ought to be very watchful and suspicious when he finds that the evidence so habitually proves what he wants it to prove.  He drags in the question of the Irish language, and a dozen other points in the Government's policy.  I am prepared to criticise the Government's policy in relation to its effect upon the people within the area of the Government's jurisdiction.  If its Irish language policy is calculated to improve the material or moral condition of the people for whom the Government is responsible, it should be supported on that ground, and if it is detrimental it should be opposed on that same ground, but the suggestion that the Government responsible for the well-being of the people in this State should, instead of directing their attention to that, constantly have in mind <Col N="947" /> a certain propagandist effect that might be got out of a contrary form of action with regard to people outside its jurisdiction, seems to me to have a completely wrong conception.</P>
    <P>Early last year the Government negotiated with the British.  I cannot give the exact words, but as far as I remember them the head of the Government announced that those negotiations would most emphatically take into account the question of Partition. I myself thereafter uttered no word of criticism of the Government on the grounds that it came back without having ended the question of Partition.  I felt that much which had been achieved there was highly worthy of commendation, and personally I had not anticipated, in the light of the surrounding facts, that the Government would come back and announce that Partition was at an end.  Again, I do not want to misrepresent the head of the Government, but my memory is that in 1921 he concurred with the proposition that coercion should not be used against the people of the Six Counties.  I think he has repeated that since, and that is a policy with which I entirely agree.  At the time of the Treaty the British Government agreed that if and when the majority of the people in the excluded area should desire to be united with us they&mdash;the British Government&mdash;would take no action to prevent that taking place.  I understand that that same assurance was given in the negotiations of last year.  Senator MacDermot proposed, as far as I can make out, that the whole policy in this State should be based on its possible effects on the inclinations of the people of the Six Counties. There I entirely disagree with them. I do not quite see why we should at this moment suggest that the Government, which only a few months ago was negotiating and discussing with the British Government the question of Partition, should be called upon to reopen those negotiations.  As a matter of fact I think this is a particularly inopportune moment.  Therefore, I am, on the whole, against the resolution and against the amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not even like Senator Quirke's amendment.  What does his proposal <Col N="948" /> amount to?  As an Ulster man put it to me when he saw that amendment, what Senator Quirke wants and what we want here is to use our influence to have the people in the North reduced to the miserable condition that we are in here.  I do not see why we should object to any prosperity that may be in the North, and that is my interpretation of the amendment which was put down by Senator Quirke.</P>

      <P>Yes; I am sorry.  I think that what is regrettable, as I say, is a fact of the Partition existing in the minds of the people in the North.  The historical origin of that is a matter we need not go into now. What should our policy be?  What should be the policy of the Government? The policy of the Government is to promote the well-being of the people within its area of jurisdiction. Can it go beyond that? Certainly, I think it can, but I do not like the method that seems to have been adopted since the Agreement with England early last year.  I think the method of what I call propaganda is undignified for an established State. We have a Government that is able to negotiate with other Governments, that is able, I suggest, even when negotiations fail, to wage war in what it considers a just end.  I am not saying that the Government has done that, but it seems to give colour to the assumption.  To start a type of propaganda with protest meetings and resolutions is undignified and unjustified, on the ground that it gets nowhere.  In fact, I wish it would get nowhere. What has happened?  We know that the moment a Government in this country expresses itself discontented with a certain position, certain criminal bodies use that sort of propaganda weapon.  The Government itself has protested against Partition.  These people say: &ldquo;Can you blame us if we engage in criminal activities?&rdquo; and were rather most disastrously supported, I think, by a member of this House.  At the moment the majority of the people in the Six Counties do not want to be with us.  I think the Taoiseach said quite truly that coercive <Col N="949" /> methods should not be applied.  Our claim that they should be with us is on the grounds that they are our fellow-countrymen.  The British Government has agreed that, at any time the majority up there wish to be with us, they will not put any hindrance in the way.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances we claim that these people are our fellow-countrymen, and it seems to me to be rather nationally degrading that we should go to the British and say: &ldquo;A large section of our fellow-countrymen who ought to know us better than other people refuse to be with us, and we want you to put the screw on them to make them come in.&rdquo;  That is really what we are asking, for external interference in our affairs.  At least, that is how I see it.  Meanwhile, the unfortunate people in the North are suffering under what we believe is an unjust régime.  I think the Government could act as one Government with another.  Although I admit that the Northern Government is only a provincial Government and not the Government of a State, we could establish relations with it, and the good offices of the British Government might come in, not by threat or otherwise, but by weapons not unknown in diplomatic negotiations, to relieve people, or a section in the North, from the tyrannical conditions under which they subsist.  The Government can do that. I could not set down now the exact programme, but it has often been done before by governments.  It can take steps to try&mdash;not immediately, and not with immediate success&mdash;to bring about better conditions for those most closely associated with us in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened with this propaganda business?  The moment you start propaganda you have these ill-conditioned, malicious people, who go there to make trouble.  We know that in the last couple of years outrages took place against Catholics up there, and it is, possibly the natural reaction that they should want to repeat in kind.  I am quite satisfied that people have gone there from here, especially to try to intensify the trouble up there. In the attempt at propaganda in the last six or nine months what do we see as a result?  Has the condition of <Col N="950" /> the people in the Six Counties been ameliorated as a result of that propaganda? I do not think so.  Senator McEllin saw a method by calling upon the British Government to cease giving financial assistance to the people in the North.  The effect was the blowing up the Customs huts which, I think, was not entirely disassociated with, but had some roots in the campaign of propaganda which has been launched.  The net effect has been an enormous increase in the number of &ldquo;B&rdquo; Specials, in which Catholics are not going to predominate.  That brought certain relief to the Northern Government in the way of unemployment. It brought more money from the British, and gave more popular assent to the Government, by a recognition that they were faced with a lawless element that must be dealt with in a way that possibly the ordinary law would not be effective against.  Consequently, I deprecate that type of propaganda which takes the form of protest meetings and resolutions.  I agree that you can have what I might call effective propaganda.</P>
    <P>If a statement that is clearly contrary to fact is put out I see no harm in enlightening any section of the people of the world or in letting the whole world have a clear statement of the facts.  But the other type of protest against Partition I do not think gets anywhere.  It only encourages the lawless element who are not concerned with the sufferings of the people in the North, but rather rejoice when that suffering is intensified, on the ground that it will possibly win them more recruits for their own diabolical methods.  That appears to have happened, even in the case of a member of this House.  I would like to see the Government taking steps towards rapprochement with the Government of the North.  I would like that the first direction should be to have an amelioration of the minority in the Six Counties.  I do not denounce the Government on the ground that during its period it has not made Partition cease to exist.  I do not like such a proposition as was put forward, that, somehow, if the people in the North would come in with us, they would retain their present Parliament, with present <Col N="951" /> local powers, and, at the same time, have representation in the Dáil and the Seanad as it is now.  I know that the Northern Ireland Parliament, and that the people in the North have, not only their local Parliament but, also send a few representatives over to Westminster.  The British may not mind a few people butting in on their peculiarly local affairs and, at the same time, abstracting their own local affairs from the control of the Westminster Parliament.</P>
    <P>Personally, I do not see why we should say to the people in the North: &ldquo;In all those spheres in which under the Act of 1920 your Parliament exercises control, it will continue to exercise that control, and, at the same time, you will be represented in the Dáil and Seanad of Éire, and be able by your votes to influence what will be done in these spheres in the rest of Ireland, while retaining your autonomy with regard to your own area.&rdquo;  That is my interpretation of what to put forward.  Personally, I would be behind that.  I want to see Partition ended.  I want to see it ended through a change of mind on the part of a section of the people in Northern Ireland.  You can say that you want that too, but that there is no means of getting it.  On the other hand, what is the other way?  Are we in a position to wage war upon them and force them?  I do not think so.  If we were, I, personally, would object to that being done.  I have always agreed with what the Taoiseach said in 1921, that we do not stand for coercion.  I rather dislike this little back-door method of coercion; that when we want to coerce them, we are to go over to try to get the British to put some economic pressure upon them, or protest to the British that they are not getting the full amount of the Imperial contribution that was laid down in the Act of 1920.  I cannot see that we are justified in going there, and saying that we insist upon them taking their pound of flesh under that Act from the Northern Parliament.  What we must aim at is a real union of heart and mind.  I do not think that is easily got, but there is an <i>interim</i> movement that the Government could take.  I am not trying <Col N="952" /> to dictate to the Government. They are much better able to judge the circumstances and the opportune moment than I am.</P>
    <P>I do say that the immediate thing that we might aim at is a rapprochement with the Government of Northern Ireland and with the British Government, directed to a rectification of those injustices under which the minority in the Six Counties subsist. That seems to me to be the immediate thing.  The Prime Minister, I think, and I do not want to misrepresent him, but just about this time, I think, two years ago, made a statement at his political organisation which I roughly read this way, that as far as Partition was concerned, the major factor in settling that problem would be the passage of time.  Those are not his exact words, but that was the idea I got from him.  I think that that is true, and I think that all the Government can do is that in its wisdom it should observe circumstances and direct its action towards the shortening of that time.  I am satisfied it is inevitable ultimately, and that during that time, short or long as it may be, the Government should use its good offices with the Northern Government and with the British Government to bring about an amelioration of the conditions in the North.</P>
    <P>I have only intervened because I did think it was definitely unhelpful to have the gibe at the people in the North&mdash;&ldquo;the planter's brood,&rdquo;&ldquo;the people in the North who resisted the improvement in the conditions of a farmer in this country, who object to old age pensions,&rdquo; and all the rest of it.  I must say that if I were a Northerner and listened to some of the things said here, I would say it was perfectly ridiculous for people who felt that way about me and my fellowmen to expect that we should come in under the rule of people who felt that way about us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, I have very few observations to make on this debate.  I was unable to be present at the earlier stages of the debate the week before last, but I have read carefully the speeches then made, <Col N="953" /> and listened very carefully to everything said to-day.  I had hoped to be able to make some statements or some propositions expressing unanimity on the part of the Seanad.  Naturally, any such propositions would be somewhat elementary if unanimity was to be expressed at all, but even in what seemed to be very elementary propositions, listening to some of these surprising speeches this afternoon, it would seem that it would be impossible to agree on any proposition unanimously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing I had in mind was, that we all wished to see Partition abolished.  I thought, coming into the House this afternoon, and I have always thought, up to within the last hour, that in this Seanad at any rate, one would not find anybody who wished to maintain Partition.  But, having listened to some of the speeches to-day, speeches which could only be interpreted as showing bitter hatred towards certain of our fellow-countrymen, I can only come to the conclusion that those who made those speeches were opposed to the union of Ireland into one entity.  I do not know how far that hostility to the North is felt throughout this part of the country.  I have seldom heard it as strongly or violently expressed as it was expressed in two speeches this afternoon.  I do not think those speeches are representative of the opinion of Ireland, but I regret them, because I think they will put an obstacle in what seems to me the only path.  I had hoped on this we might be unanimous that the only path to ultimate union of the country is goodwill between North and South and goodwill between the different people, people of different opinions, people of different convictions, of different prejudices&mdash;and prejudices have to be taken into account, too&mdash;and that it was only by establishing goodwill between those different groups on important points that we should get at the unity which I believe is still the wish of the great majority of the people of Ireland.  Such speeches as are devoted to attack of our Northern fellow-countrymen, however much we differ from them, going into their history, and garbled history in many <Col N="954" /> cases, with the view of prejudicing this Assembly, is mischievous not only in the Assembly, but in the country.</P>
    <P>I agree with many of the observations that Senator Fitzgerald made.  I do not agree with him in everything. It would be a dull world if we all agreed on everything, but there is no fear of that at present.  But he, I think, deprecated any very close study in such a debate as this of the causes which have led to Partition.  I agree with him there.  I think myself that Partition was adopted rather unwillingly by the British Government 20 odd years ago, as an easy if short-sighted way of getting out of a difficult position.  I do not think&mdash;I know others will disagree with me in this who think honestly and who have studied the subject better than I&mdash;that either then or now Great Britain wished or wishes to maintain Partition in this country.  I believe that the British Government, the members of it, the ordinary Englishman in the street who, after all, is the master of the British Government, would be glad to believe that we were living in peace with each other in this country, and, as a result, that we were not going to give them much trouble in the future.  I do not think there would be any opposition from Great Britain if we were able to agree on this matter.  As a historical fact, we can put the blame on Great Britain, but that does not help to a solution of the problem to-day.</P>
    <P>I have no solution of the question, but there are, I think, certain conditions which must be present before any practical solution can be attempted. The first of these I have already mentioned, that is, goodwill between the different parts of the country.  Without goodwill, if the North was to be forced into the union with this State, I think it would be a disaster.  I see nothing but friction if by force or even by economic compulsion the North was to be forced to join with the State of Ireland.  I believe it would be a disaster.  I believe it could help this State and build up a United Ireland only if the Northern people came in willingly, to work for the good of the country as a whole.  If they were forced in either by economic compulsion or <Col N="955" /> what has been suggested to-day, the use of physical force, I think we would be condemning this country to a generation of strife and establishing a bar to the progress that most of us long for. That seems to be an essential condition and I think we should be very careful not to use any language which would tend to create ill-will.  If we want to come to an arrangement with people whom we dislike we will have to silence somewhat the expression of dislike.  Very often it dies away when it is kept silent.</P>
    <P>There was no reference made to it in this debate but I was glad to see in the paper the other day that an association has been formed with the single and simple object of promoting goodwill between the people in the North and the people in the South of Ireland. It is a non-political association, as I understand, but an association which hopes to make itself active in the fields of culture, music, art, sport and social intercourse, any matters on which there can be common ground between the people of north and south.  It is not in one sense a very ambitious programme and certainly not a very dramatic programme but it is a programme which, if carried into effect, may be of very great use in this country in future.</P>
    <P>I have very little positive suggestion to make.  I am not going to suggest to this Government that they should abandon any principles that they consider fundamental, but I want to draw the attention of the Taoiseach in particular to certain conditions which, I think, are of some importance.  The Constitution which was adopted here a year and a half ago applies to Ireland. The Taoiseach recognises and has stated over and over again that we are not yet in a position to enforce it in the whole of the territory of Ireland. The position that he has taken makes it clear that he regards this Constitution as the Constitution that should be for the whole of Ireland, and I think it follows from that that in his outlook he should regard himself not as the head of a Party, not merely as the head of the Government of this State, but, in a sense, as the leader of the whole of Ireland.  I recognise fully <Col N="956" /> that the Taoiseach does consider himself not merely as the leader of a Party or the head of a Party.  He has, over and over again, impressed on all of us that his leadership is of the country, but I ask him to take a wider view of the country and in thinking out his policy ahead in his own mind and in the councils of his Party I press on him to consider the bearings of such a policy not merely on the people living within the Twenty-Six Counties of Ireland but on the people in the State that he would like to govern in the new future.  I find myself at variance with Senator Fitzgerald in regard to this. I understood Senator Fitzgerald to argue that the Government should consider the welfare and the interests of the people immediately under the Government and should not concern itself with the affairs and interests of people who are living outside the scope of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Senator Fitzgerald is not as far astray as I thought he was and I hope he will agree with my view.  I am not suggesting that the wishes of the people in Northern Ireland should count as so many votes as representing the opinions of the country, but I do suggest that the Taoiseach should give some consideration to their view and that in his policy he should consider how it will affect them, whether it is likely to give them more respect and desire for union with this State or to drift a further distance.  A former Minister, ten years ago, said we ought to cultivate our own garden in such an attractive way that our neighbours would like to come into it.  I think that is right.  I think we should make this State so attractive that those around us would like to come in as members and subjects of the State and, I think we ought, in the cultivation of our garden, to give some attention to what sort of garden these neighbours would like and, perhaps, even think of the flowers they might like growing in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My suggestion to the Taoiseach, which I make in all sincerity, is that <Col N="957" /> he should consider himself in a certain way as at the centre of gravity of national opinion, taking national opinion as a whole, and not the opinion of one Party, or one section of a Party.  I do not expect the Taoiseach will answer this in the affirmative.  I made a similar suggestion to him about two years ago in a debate on a similar subject in the other House.  But one knows that, though a suggestion made to a statesman is not always fruitful at the moment, it may be fruitful in the future.  I think we have heard from the Taoiseach himself on some occasions that, while he has rejected a proposal when put to him in public in the Dáil, he has considered it and gone some way to meet it in the future. I think that is an experience that any statesman would recall to himself if he looked back.  One does not expect him to commit himself, but I hope and I believe that he will consider himself as the guardian, while he occupies his present position, of the interests, not only of those of us who live in this part of Ireland, but those who are not yet with us and whom we hope to see with us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisMByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment of Senator O'Donovan, and I do so principally because embodied in it is what I consider the very generous offer made by the Taoiseach some months ago to the people who rule in the Six Counties.  The impression I got from Senator MacDermot on the last occasion was that the Senator's policy was not that we should ask the people in the Six Counties to come in with the rest of Ireland, but that we should submerge all Ireland in the Six Counties.  He told us that we are a mixed race.  I was very glad that Senator Johnston pointed out that the people in his part of Ireland are more Irish than we are ourselves. I do not want to elaborate this question, but I think that any student of history would tell the Senator that in the past here we had many races, that many people came here, but, with the wonderful power of our Gaelic ancestors, they were eventually absorbed amongst our people.  To-day I have no hesitation in saying that north, south, east, and west, the majority of the people are of Gaelic extraction&mdash;I <Col N="958" /> mean that Gaelic blood predominates. In saying that I realise that many men of other stock, not of the Gaelic stock, played a big part in Ireland and were amongst our best patriots.  Unfortunately, there were some Gaelic families who, in the course of years, for some reason or another, lost their Gaelic outlook, if you like, lost their contact with the Gael and, in many cases, became more English than the English themselves.</P>
      <P>Senator MacDermot also told us that our national language is English, not Irish.  I do not think we should worry a lot about that, but it should not be let go without being answered.  I am sure if the Senator was the student of history that he claims to be he would realise that the Irish language saved us in many periods of our history, especially during the long period of persecution in the Penal Days.  He should realise, and he will have to realise, that, so far as the Irish people are concerned, they are determined to preserve that language, to revive and restore it, because we realise that it is only on native foundations you can build up, and that this country can only be preserved and saved through the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to follow the Senator into his attitude about national ideals, but I think his reference to Wolfe Tone was very unfair when he took up a quotation from him at a period when Tone probably thought he could secure complete Irish independence by reforming the Parliament then known as Grattan's Parliament.  I certainly think that the same thing applies to Davis and to Mitchel, and, so far as Parnell is concerned, I would rather take Pádraig Pearse's conception of him than Senator MacDermot's.  The most amazing thing that struck me in his speech was his reference to driving in the people like cattle.  How can the Senator talk about driving in people like cattle when, in the Taoiseach's offer, which I described as generous, he offers to the people of the Six Counties to allow them their Parliament and the institutions they have, and that only the transferred services would come here? Does the Senator know anything about the people of Tyrone and Fermanagh? Is there no question of leaving them <Col N="959" /> to the wolves?  I am sure he is aware that, outside Belfast itself, the other five capital towns in the Six Counties&mdash; Armagh, Derry, Enniskillen, Newry and Omagh&mdash;have all anti Partition majorities.  Are they to be left to the wolves?  When he uses a phrase like driving in the people like cattle he should know that no one desires to do that.  He should also remember that there is a very big percentage of Irish nationalism in the Six Counties, a very big force, who want to come in here, and that we must consider them, too. If there is to be special treatment for one section, what about the other section?</P>
    <P>Another thing I would say to the Senator when he thinks we should try to attract the people of the North in here, is that there has never been a plebiscite to find out what the majority of the people in the Six Counties feel on this question.  If he thinks that he can bring in the people opposing Partition simply by asking us to surrender all our ideals and to abandon everything we stood for in the past, I think he does not know the psychology of these people.  I am certain that anyone that knows the psychology of these people will tell him that they would simply despise us and nothing else.  I have no solution of my own to put forward, but I do agree with many suggestions here and that Senator MacDermot's speech probably is more propaganda for the anti-Partition people than anything else.  I certainly do not agree with Senator Johnston in emphasising, as he tried to do, that one big thing in the Six Counties was their loyalty.  We know that in the past their loyalty was only conditional.  Anybody who has studied the history of the last 70 years knows that on many occasions their loyalty to Kings was only conditional, and very conditional at that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to stress these points, but these are the people, or a great many of them at any rate, who opposed everything that ever stood for progress or life in this country and as soon as the English Parliament of the time enacted it they accepted it and settled down.  That is why I should like to emphasise what has been stated here: <Col N="960" /> that the big cause of Partition is England, and the English are the only people who can settle it.  Nobody in this country ever asked England to partition it, and at the time that the Bill, or whatever it was, went through the House of Commons in 1920, no Irish representatives of any party or any section identified themselves with it.  If England chose to do so to-morrow she could end Partition, and, as I promised to be brief, I shall only say further that she has now a golden opportunity to do so by accepting as a solution the suggestions put forward by the Taoiseach and which are embodied in Senator O'Donovan's amendment.</P>

As I said, I am not in favour or enamoured of the motion, neither am I enamoured of the amendment, but of course the amendment arose because of the motion.  I must admit that I felt a sort of subdued impatience when listening to the speech of the Senator in proposing this motion on Partition. I have since read it in cold print, with pain.  In making a plea, like some special advocate for England's planted garrison in Northern Ireland, the Senator said that he had yet to meet a single British politician who would wish to stand in the way of an agreed settlement between North and South if one could be arrived at; regardless of the fact that a British Parliament, composed of British politicians and responsible to the British public, deliberately applied the Partition Act <Col N="961" /> of 1920 to Ireland without any solitary Irish representative identifying himself with it, and the Senator repeats that as if he were addressing a group of&mdash;well, silly people, at any rate.  I shall not say worse.</P>
    <P>The first piece of wisdom worth hearing, in dealing with the question, is that we have not to reckon with any opposition from any political party on the other side of the Irish Sea in arriving at a settlement with those in the North.  Now, without overtaxing my memory, I can recall that it has been set down again and again in the British Parliament, by responsible spokesmen of the Government like the late Premier Asquith, that to remove Partition a special Act of Parliament must be passed at Westminster.  I would impress that upon the Senators: a special Act of Parliament must be passed at Westminster.  If there is no opposition to be feared from any Party there, as Senator MacDermot has said, why does not the great peacemaker, Mr. Chamberlain, introduce the necessary legislation and let Westminster unanimously wipe out the boundary which one of his predecessors, Lloyd George, so treacherously helped to set up?  Such a step would meet also the third empty argument put forward by Senator MacDermot that, technically and in theory, Northern Ireland is still an integral part of the United Kingdom. It would even meet the fourth groundless argument put up, that, as long as Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, it is natural that British troops should be there.</P>
    <P>If some of us can listen to the Senator's empty arguments with amusement, it is hardly to be expected that we can listen in silence to insult, as when he said: &ldquo;If Northern Unionism is a plant watered with British gold, it can also be restated that Southern Nationalism is watered with British gold.&rdquo;  The taunt used to be about German gold.  On another occasion it was Prussian gold, and on another occasion it was the gold of the Irish servant girls of New York.  It takes the address that comes of calculated ignorance to assert before any body of adult Irishmen that Southern Nationalism is, or has been, watered with British gold, in face of the fact that <Col N="962" /> England has been openly robbing this country ever since the day her first adventurer landed on our shores&mdash; robbing us through rack rents, through landlords living in England, through quit and Crown rents, through tithes, through customs and excise and through over-taxation, which almost baffles calculation; through pensions to the offspring of the Royal House, pensions to the wretches who sold Ireland at the time of the Act of Union, and pensions to the ageing administrators, lawyers and informers&mdash;the whole spawn who maintained the British connection in this land; in a word, through sucking the national life-blood until Ireland was left like a corpse on the dissecting table&mdash;agus fagaimíd siud mar atá sé.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDermot spoke of what he called very real material difficulties that have to be taken into consideration in connection with this matter of the wiping out of Partition.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Answers have to be found for some questions that a reasonable Northerner might reasonably ask if we invited him face to face to-morrow to come and form part of our State. One question he would undoubtedly ask would be: &lsquo;What about markets for our shipbuilding and our linen? At the present time the British market is absolutely secure to us.  If we come in with you, what assurance have we that that state of things will continue?&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Replying to the suggestion that the Northern Parliament needs a heavy subsidy from England, the Senator said further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Would not the Northern administration if continued under our auspices need a large subsidy from us?  Are we prepared to provide that subsidy?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sé m' fhreagra do'n cheist sin mar adubhairt Seathrún Céitinn, that the Belfast shipbuilding and linen industries have been patronised by England, particularly the shipbuilding industry, in order to find permanent employment for her Orange garrison in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>England can show the world through the periodic outbursts of bigotry at <Col N="963" /> Queen's Island, that she, the virtuous Britannia, has the very unenviable task of trying to keep the wild Irish from virtually slaughtering each other.  It is clear that she has deliberately created this discord in Belfast for her own ends.  The linen manufacturers well knew during the Great War that England would exploit them as she has exploited everybody else that she can keep in her grip.  If the people of Belfast are the efficient business men that they are believed to be, why do they not take their chance in the world market with their ships and their linen as other people do?  Why, therefore, should they need heavy subsidies from as if Partition were ended?  They are said to get these subsidies now from England.  Why should they need these subsidies from us?  Generous, broad-minded merchants in other parts of Ireland put much business in the way of the Belfast linen merchants, and for this we are rewarded by pogroms and bigotry.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDermot, with his very deft touches, has contrived to make out that it was the other way.  The Senator says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a point on which you cannot from the point of view of statesmanship, or from the point of view of national justice, overrule and ignore the hearts and consciences of 800,000 of your fellow citizens.  Those 800,000 of our fellow citizens in the North have, I may say, close sympathisers of perhaps another 200,000 among the Protestants in the South of Ireland.  If we are going to reach our full stature as a nation, is it sense to attempt to overrule brutally the dearest sentiments of a quarter of our inhabitants, of 1,000,000 of our citizens.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then he went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A short time ago the Taoiseach made a speech in which he said the British were foreigners....  Is the Northern Irishman going to be content with that?  Is he going to be content to come into a State which is to regard as foreigners those who are closely akin to him across the Irish Sea? ... I think we will have <Col N="964" /> to alter our attitude if we want them to come in by consent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on he added:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That stock has been in Ireland now for centuries, and they have as much right to be considered Irishmen as we have.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sé m'fhreagra do'n chainnt sin&mdash;if the people of the four planted counties give their whole loyalty to the Irish nation, they will be treated like all the other citizens of the Irish nation.  But if they persist in giving allegiance to our only enemy, England, they can only be regarded as other garrisons of England are regarded at Gibraltar, Burma, Singapore and other places marked red in the map of the world. What would the United States of America think if the people who were born under the Great Bear gave their allegiance to Russia, and if the Germans in America gave their allegiance to the Fatherland?  England planted garrisons in the North of Ireland, and their allegiance is to her.  Why should they not transfer their loyalty unconditionally to the land that gave them a home?  Senator MacDermot, by his grouping of the people of Northern Ireland with cattle has aroused indignation which I have no wish to aggravate now.  But I do protest against his insidious comparison man by man of the personnel of the Northern Government with the personnel of our own Government here in Dublin, and his foregone conclusion, which I submit was out of order, that the balance of capacity, energy and ability was in favour rather of the Northern men than of ours.</P>

      <P>As I remarked in my opening statement, I said that I listened patiently to Senator MacDermot.  I have had some experience of public boards, and in every public board on which I ever sat I always listened patiently to people who have a right to make their case. If there was a case to be made, I answered it as best I could afterwards. At the time I was interrupted by the Senator I was remarking that he said that the balance of capacity, energy and ability was in favour rather of the Northern men than of ours.  I for one fail to see what right or qualifications, beyond the veneer which some of us do not grudge him, has Senator MacDermot to sit in judgment on his colleagues.  But since he has thought fit to sit in judgment on us, I want to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  He has been particularly voluble on the alleged advantages of British citizenship.  Is that in order?  He went on to point out to us that up there a large proportion of the young men who come from the Universities are unable to find positions inside of the country: that at the present time they have the whole of the British Commonwealth open to them as if they were Englishmen: that, in fact, like our youth in the South, they can go forth and get positions in various parts of the Commonwealth. They might ask what assurance they have that that state of things will continue. &ldquo;The North man is proud of his position as a British citizen.  If he joins with us will he be able to retain his British citizenship.  Everywhere else in the Commonwealth that is done. <Col N="966" /> The citizenship of the country is combined with a general British citizenship. The proportion of Irishmen, of Catholics and Celtic Irishmen, in the service of the Commonwealth and their position in the services, is outstandingly high, and I for one refuse to regard them as foreigners.  I have already answered most of those arguments.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British imperial machine, I readily concede, has given comfortable posts to many loyalists from Ulster, and will be only too glad to get ambitious men for such posts while the Empire lasts.  Now, are we to forget how often it has dragged the name of Irishman in the mire by associating regiments and soldiers bearing Irish names with her butcheries, from the days of Kitchener in Zululand to the present day of Black and Tannery in Palestine.  Catholic and Celtic Irishmen, instead of getting imperial favours, simply got what their inherent abilities entitled them to.  Catholic Irishmen exiled by England, reached the highest military and diplomatic posts in the leading countries of Europe, and Catholic Irishmen exiled by England to America reached a similar eminence in every walk of life. What they did before they can do again, if needs be.  Secondly, said Senator MacDermot in dealing with another aspect of this matter, there is the question of the Crown and of allegiance to the King&mdash;the King of Ireland. &ldquo;It is my view,&rdquo; said Senator MacDermot, &ldquo;that that is essential to the Northerner's outlook, that he is not disposed to throw that off, and that he will not be induced of his own free will to come in with us unless we restore that,... nor do I think that he will be persuaded to lose interest in the flag and in the national anthem that unite him to the rest of the British peoples throughout the world.&rdquo;  Surely we are not all so juvenile as the Senator thinks.  Who were the loyalists that more than once threatened to kick the English Crown into the Boyne?  I venture to say that the flag is respected mainly in Australia and New Zealand for the protection that it may be able to afford against invasion, in South Africa because of the fear which comes from having an antagonised Germany, <Col N="967" /> and in Canada just while it may suit Canada, but not another day! I have been at pains to quote Senator MacDermot very fully, even at the risk of exhausting the patience of Senators, because in his zeal as an advocate of imperialism he has repeated himself.</P>
    <P>Referring to the teaching of history in this country, he said that it consisted largely of stoking up hatred of England.  I do say, he said, that there are various palliatory features at certain stages of our history and these features are being suppressed.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we want to have an atmosphere in which it is possible for Northerner and Southerner to live in amity together, we have to teach history in a more objective spirit in all our schools... we want to get rid of the fog of hatred that hangs over the land, and we have to introduce a spirit of objectivity into our teaching.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I have shown that the sources of the fog of hatred were due to the methods the British employed to stir up the demon of bigotry among her garrison in Northern Ireland when imperial exigencies made the demand. Objective history, the Senator tries to concoct, by misrepresenting the outlook of Ireland's patriots&mdash;of Wolfe Tone, Emmet, O'Connell, Mitchel, Davis and Parnell.  The Senator said that Parnell accepted the Home Rule Bill of 1886 as a final settlement of the Irish question. As everyone knows, Parnell will be remembered for his famous declaration that no man dare set bounds to the onward march of a nation.</P>
    <P>I think I had better allow the worthy Senator to reveal himself as a teacher of objective history by some further quotations from his speech, and by his laboured presentation of what he called the thorny question of Gaelicisation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think there is very much difference of race between the English and ourselves&rdquo;</P>
    <P>he said.  He went on to say if</P>
    <P>&ldquo;it is a question of chemical analysis of the blood of any of us here or any Welshmen, Englishmen or Scotchmen I believe that you <Col N="968" /> would not find a very great difference.... I say there is very little difference in race, and that at present there is none in language.  But is that going to continue?  Are not our Gaelic enthusiasts down here preaching that we are to become a race of pure Gaels and that anything that is not Gaelic in this country is a foreign element?  Are not all our Gaelic enthusiasts down here preaching that the Gaelic language ought to become the national language? Are not they pretending that it has become the national language.... Gaelic is not the national language. Gaelic has ceased to be the national language for a very long time. English is now our national language.... The larger part of Irish culture is embodied in the English language....  Are we going to create a language barrier between ourselves and the North and to create a race barrier between ourselves and the North.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He made an appeal for magnanimity and a little Celtic imagination.  It is an appeal, he said, which I believe would be made by Tone or Emmet or Davis if they were present amongst us. That was the statement we had from the Senator who would have us abandon our native language and subordinate it to English, the Senator who would reject the language of our golden age when Ireland's famous schools welcomed scholars from all parts of the known world&mdash;the Irish language which was studied over a great part of Europe, the language of our Bards and Brehons and of our saints, the language of Sean the Proud, of Red Hugh O'Donnell and of all the other patriots who would not twist their mouths with English&mdash;ní cainfidís a mbeul le Bearla gall&mdash;the language of the exiled Irish soldiers who beat the English soldiers at Fontenoy and in the American War of the Revolution, the language of John O'Mahony, the founder of the Fenians, and of O'Donovan Rossa, our foremost Fenian type, the language beloved of Patrick Pearse and Cathal Brugha, the language which England has been trying to suppress by penal laws since the Statute of Kilkenny in 1367&mdash; General Maxwell tried to suppress the <Col N="969" /> Gaelic League in 1916&mdash;the language whose imperishable manuscripts adorn the older libraries of Europe as well as the British Museum and Trinity College, Dublin.  Senator MacDermot would have us abandon to England's planted Orange garrison in Belfast the historic province of Ulster where the Red Branch Knights had their home, where St. Patrick founded our Primatial See, where Columkille, Columbanus and Malachy were entombed and where Brian Boru, his son and grandson lie buried, where the Protestant United Irishmen took up the torch that dropped from the hands of Owen Roe O'Neill and so helped to revive our spirit of liberty.</P>
    <P>I have nothing but good will for Protestant patriots.  Forty years ago, I was closely associated with one of them, Dr. Heron.  He was a brother of Finlay Heron, who was then Secretary of the Blackrock Town Commissioners, and he lived in Dawson Court, 10 Cross Avenue, Blackrock, opposite the new convent school near the church.  I believe he was one of the most earnest workers in the language movement I ever met and, in his place, I first met three young Protestant Trinity College students named O'Connell, Cummins and O'Sullivan.  I was afterwards associated with O'Connell and Cummins in the Druids.  Mr. O'Sullivan and Mr. O'Connell became clergymen and Mr. Cummins a doctor.  I am stressing this point, Sir, to show that there was no difference of language between us Catholic and Protestant Irishmen.  Dr. Heron brought me to his place when I was a young lad endeavouring to study O'Growney's books and there I met those three young students.  O'Connell was afterwards Conal Cearnach, who wrote under that name; O'Sullivan was a clergyman who, I think, died recently, and Cummins was a doctor who died in Steevens' Hospital.  At his funeral at Mount Jerome cemetery, Eamon Kent, the 1916 martyr, played the Irish war-pipes. In the Republican movement, I had the honour of being associated with Countess Markievicz.</P>
    <P>I revere their memory one and all, but it does not follow that we are going to bend the knee to England's <Col N="970" /> planted garrison and bigots in Belfast, abandon the Tricolour and march under the blood-soaked Union Jack into Stormont to the strains of <i>Croppies Lie Down</i> and, at the banquet of joy there, sing England's National Anthem and, to prove our tolerance, join lustily in the strains of &ldquo;To Hell with the Pope&rdquo;.  No, I do not, and Ireland does not, intend to adopt Senator MacDermot's outlook&mdash;his national outlook and his political outlook, his economic outlook.  Our policy shall be the old traditional, national, reasonable, sensible policy that we are following.  So much for Senator MacDermot.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion, Senator McLoughlin made some reference to the time to settle the Border.  These people are all wonderful statesmen and I wonder why we have not all accepted them as our recognised leaders.  The game, of course, has always been to endeavour to place the blame for everything on what was, at one time, called the Anti-Treaty Party which has now practically become the Government.  He told us that the time to settle the Border was in 1922.  I have here a handbill and, with your permission, Sir, I will read it.  It refers to the Belfast boycott and sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Eireann has decreed that the imposition of religious or political tests as a condition of industrial employment is illegal.  Attempts are being made to impose such tests in Belfast and thousands of workmen and workwomen have been forcibly driven from their employment because they refused to submit to them.  Until this tyranny ceases and the expelled workers are restored, goods manufactured in or distributed from Belfast must not be purchased or received elsewhere.  Business must also be suspended with the Belfast, Northern and Ulster Banks.  No further deposits must be made with them pending the unconditional restoration of the employees and accounts must be transferred.</P>
    <P>Traders are warned that after Wednesday, 15th September, 1920, no goods manufactured in or distributed from Belfast are to be sold or exposed <Col N="971" /> for sale; and they are advised not to disregard this notice.</P>
    <P>With regard to a &ldquo;White List&rdquo;, a Committee with full authority has been appointed in Belfast, and pending issue of such a list by that Committee this notice holds good in every detail. I am sorry Senator McLoughlin is not here because I like to speak in a man's presence and I rather enjoy what I might term his brilliant sarcasm.  I suggest, Sir, it is not the Anti-Treaty Party which was responsible for maintaining the Border, that the time to squelch the Border was the time at which that handbill I have read was issued here in Dublin, and that it was the lifting of that embargo that caused sad days in this country.</P>
    <P>With Senator Douglas, I am in a certain amount of agreement.  He has stated that it would be wise if we associated with and mixed with the people of the North to a greater extent.  I have some experience in that respect.  Some years ago, I was in Belfast at a technical education congress. Senator Byrne was there on the same occasion.  We were treated generously and in princely fashion by the Belfast representatives.  There was no ill-feeling.  We were all Irishmen, and we discussed educational problems at our congress as we thought best for the country as a whole.  I was there again on a more recent date with the Dublin Port and Docks Board as the guests of the Belfast Harbour Commissioners, and we were received in like manner.  They came here to us, and we received them in a similar way. I am in complete agreement with the statements made by Senator Douglas that the more we come into touch with one another the better, or, in the words of the song, &ldquo;The more we are together, the merrier we shall be.&rdquo;  I should like finally to challenge the statement made over and over again, that we have only to endeavour to fix up matters with Belfast and everything is right.  Senator Fitzgerald used that argument a few moments ago.  I suggest that it will be necessary to pass an Act of Parliament in the British House of Commons to undo the Partition Act.  If anything has been said <Col N="972" /> here that should not be said, the fault must be laid at the door of Senator MacDermot who is responsible for tabling this motion which, in my opinion, should never have been tabled.  I look upon it as an attempt to dictate to An Taoiseach, our Minister for External Affairs, how he should conduct matters.  I presume, and every thinking person presumes, that he is doing his level best in his own way and in his own good time to overcome the problem.  I thank Senators for listening to me so patiently, but this thing of Senator MacDermot assuming leadership will not go down in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan2" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that neither the motion nor the amendment will serve any useful purpose.  The ending of Partition will not be brought any nearer by many of the contributions which have been made to this debate. Indeed, I might refer to &ldquo;most of the contributions.&rdquo;  Senator Counihan's amendment tries to make a very small matter of a very big question.  As compared with it, and with the motion, Senator O'Donovan's proposal has, at least, the merit that it recognises the viewpoint of the great majority of the people.  I hope his amendment will prove unnecessary, and that Senator MacDermot will decide to withdraw the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are often told that there can be no settlement of this Partition problem over the heads of our fellow-countrymen in the North.  Those who put forward that view seem to forget that there can be no settlement which does not commend itself to the majority of our people, North and South. Senator MacDermot has given us a long recital of the points of objection raised in the North to reunion, and he tells us that, even if we were to give way on all these points, it would be a long time before the North would be agreeable to join us.  If we were to accept his arguments, we should be putting ourselves back politically and nationally at least a generation, and, by relinquishing the independence we have won, we should be joining in with the North rather than the North joining in with us.  This conception of <Col N="973" /> unity reminds me of another scheme of unification:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was a young lady from Riga</P>
    <P>Who went for a ride on a tiger;</P>
    <P>They came back from the ride</P>
    <P>With the lady inside,</P>
    <P>And a smile on the face of tiger.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that were to be the only basis for reunion, the prospects of an undivided Ireland would be very remote.  But the price named by Senator MacDermot is too high, and our people would refuse to buy.  I do not suggest that consideration should not be given to the peculiar problems and outlook of the majority of the Six-County area, but the time for adjustments to be made is when the issue is ultimately joined, as it must be joined sooner or later. There is no point in naming your price until you can find a potential buyer at some price.  I am afraid that any Irish Government which would agree to Senator MacDermot's terms would receive from the people a very rude awakening.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of Irishmen of every shade of opinion to break down the barriers which divide us and which give British diplomacy an excuse to keep the country dismembered.  As individuals, we can all do our part. Senator Rowlette's speech reminded me that we are a sport-loving nation and that unity in the realm of sport could do much to emphasise the anomaly of a political boundary.  The regulations which control certain sporting activities&mdash;boxing, for example&mdash; know no boundaries except the sea which breaks on our island coastline, whereas in other schools of sport the insular outlook predominates and is contributing nothing to a solution of this problem.  In the professions, also, there are examples of unity and separation and here there are further opportunities for the private individual.  It does seem to me that the Government are fully alive to the problem and I agree with Senator Michael Hayes that they might well be left to direct their efforts to a solution without any urge or guidance from this House.  If, as Senator Baxter has suggested, a common policy can be devised, all the better.  In the meantime, let us, by helpful and constructive criticism and by our own individual endeavours, <Col N="974" /> hasten the happy day when the Government will be able to announce that the sundered province has been restored and that national reunion has been achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of what the last speaker has said but I should like to deal with a few points raised by the mover of the motion. Senator MacDermot's proposition, as he has explained it, is that the Government should retire from the political position which it has occupied, that the elected President of the country should be set aside and that we should now accept voluntary membership of the British Empire, same as the people of Canada, Australia, and the other colonies.  That is a staggering proposition to be made in this Assembly but I believe it has been made with all sincerity and because the mover believes that it would be for the good of the country.  The first argument he has advanced in support of the motion is that the historic Irish nation, as we understood it, never really existed, that it was simply a myth of the imagination. He said, in effect, that there was never any Irish nationality as distinct from English nationality&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understood Senator MacDermot to say that the Irish nation, as we understood it&mdash;the separatist nation&mdash;never really existed, that the outlook all the time had been more or less a Home Rule outlook. The answer to that is that Senator MacDermot forgot all the time the English invasion and the two Irelands &mdash;the Ireland of the Pale and the Ireland outside it.  It was in the Ireland of the Pale that he looked for <Col N="975" /> evidence of the existence of the Irish nation.  He ought to have looked outside it and he would have found that, all through the centuries, this idea of a separate and distinct nationality was held by the common people of the country&mdash;the farmers and labourers, the plain people of the hills and bogs and mountains.</P>
      <P>They never gave up that idea of a separate and a distinct nationality either by act or expression.  Their leaders were politically perverted, their literature destroyed, and they were made suffer in a variety of ways, but they never gave up the main idea of a distinct nationality.  Intense hatred of all things English has come down through the centuries to our day, and that is a definite proof that a separate and distinct nationality has lived in Ireland all the time.</P>
      <P>During recent years that separate nationality has been given a distinct expression, and in the Twenty-Six Counties we have reached a position of what we might call virtual and complete independence.  It is that which the mover of this motion asks us to give up, in return for the hope that at some future date the Six Counties may be restored to us.  It is a price which the Irish people could not pay.  If the Northern Loyalists will not give up the Crown in order to safeguard themselves and the Empire, if they think that that price is too big to pay for union with the rest of Ireland, we on our side are justified in holding that what is asked now of us is certainly too big a price to pay for the restoration of the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are unanimous in the hope that one day we will see the unity of Ireland achieved, but we have to be very careful what steps we take.  Our past history tells us clearly that every time we attempted to compromise with England we got the worst of it.  The Empire that we are now asked to compromise with is the Empire of which we have had bitter experiences in the past.  If Senator MacDermot will turn the searchlight of his mind upon that Empire, he will see that it is still unchanged, that it still has all its hidden traditions of tyranny, greed and <Col N="976" /> duplicity.  We have to be very careful. We know where we are.  We have achieved wonderful things within the last six or ten years and we should be careful not to endanger our position in the future.  I believe that the North will come in with us in the course of time.  We must have patience.  We have waited several hundred years for the restoration of the Twenty-Six Counties and it is worth our while to wait a little longer for the restoration of the remaining six.</P>
    <P>The way to win the North is not to compromise with or crawl to England but to build up a happy and prosperous State in the Twenty-Six Counties.  An Irish nation could be built up in one county and it might be lost in 32 if we accepted this union with the British Empire.  Our task to-day is to look forward and to visualise clearly what is to be the future of the Irish nation and lay our plans accordingly.  The future of the Irish nation is not within the British Empire&mdash;that is clear&mdash;and it must be developed as a separate and distinct nationality, free and independent and in union with the other nations of the world.  That may not be possible to-day or to-morrow.</P>

I am certain that the time is not far distant when the North will come in with us.  No man can forecast what is going to happen within the next 12 months.  The one thing we should be determined upon is to hold on to what we have got and await the day when we can claim the remaining six counties.</P>

      <P>I cannot say that I have very much heart in taking part in this debate.  As I told the Seanad on the last occasion they met, the Government was not consulted with regard to putting down this motion.  We have <Col N="977" /> no responsibility for it, nor have we any responsibility for the amendments. If the Seanad were to act on my advice, the motion would be withdrawn and so would the amendments. The mover of the motion made a speech which inevitably put the debate on wrong lines.  Something good might have come out of the debate had it been introduced in a proper way.  The Senator is one of a group that was referred to here to-day as having for their object the improvement of relations, not by political action, but by other methods, between the peoples of the north and the south. I was wondering, as I was listening to his speech, what particular type of technique he was developing.  I hope he has learned something from the debate that has taken place here &mdash;one of the things I hope he has learned is this, that there are two points of view which are definitely held, and held as firmly here as they are elsewhere, and that you have a very difficult task in adjusting these points of view.</P>
      <P>His motion was that the Seanad should advise the Government to take more serious account of the views of the people of the North in its policy.  One would expect that, having put a motion of that sort on the Paper, he would have tried to speak definitely of what our policy was.  Anybody who listened to, or read his speech, could only divine what the Government policy was by inferring here and there that it was what he was attacking. He chose in that way to allow to be attributed to the Government views which the Government does not hold, views which are held by some people, perhaps, but are not the views of this Government, and do not represent in any way the policy that is being pursued by this Government.  We have here in this country in regard to the matters that were discussed, the whole gamut, from those who hold the views which I take Senator Kelly to hold, to the views, if I take the country as a whole, which, let us say, Lord Craigavon has given expression to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be quite impossible in any community to get unanimity, and there are only two ways that I know in which <Col N="978" /> differences of opinion like that can be resolved.  One is the method of force, and the other is the method of agreement to accept the law determined by the vote of the majority.  I have said somewhere before this that I came into Irish politics on the Partition question. I had seen a generation of Irishmen who had struggled by peaceful methods to get a majority in the British Parliament to recognise that the Irish people wanted to govern themselves in their own way, to live a separate national existence, have a separate Statehood from that of Britain, and I saw these efforts of half-a-century brought to naught by force&mdash;by an appeal to force.  From that it was clear to me that this method of force was going to defeat any peaceful effort to secure what the majority of the Irish people wanted.  Although I was not too old, even then it was with reluctance that I came to that conclusion, and that I as an individual elected to act with those who were prepared to rely on force to try to win what had been denied them by peaceful methods.  Partition was brought in, and became an immediate and definite factor in Irish politics as far as I was concerned, about 1912 or 1913.  It seemed to me that no more cruel wrong could be inflicted on any country than to divide its national territory, and from that to build up vested interests and prejudices which were going to keep that country divided, and I can honestly say that in any thought that I have given to Irish political matters during the whole of the period that has elapsed since 1913 or so, I have always put one question to myself, and that is: &ldquo;Are we making towards having ultimately one State&mdash;one national State, or not?  Are the things that we are doing going ultimately to mean a national State or not?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, it is vain to think that one can transport oneself back into past conditions. The past is past.  The things that have happened in the quarter of a century or so that has passed since then have had their effect, and are going to have their effect whether Senator MacDermot or anybody else wishes it otherwise or not. It is possibly true that, had wisdom been shown by those who were <Col N="979" /> appealed to in Britain a quarter of a century or 30 or 40 years ago&mdash;had the wise appeals that were made at that time been listened to, we might not have had the position we are dealing with to-day.  Certainly we would not have had to deal with it in the form in which we are dealing with it now.  But it is foolish and vain to put one's head in the sand, and by that process try to get rid of things that are inconvenient for us.  We have a situation to-day which is the outcome of the past, and the future has to develop from the present.</P>
    <P>I can certainly say of myself that I have always realised that there was a difference of opinion between one section of the Irish people and the majority; that the section of the Irish people who opposed the majority view which wanted Irish independence had certain relations with Britain which made that relationship easier for them to bear, and which in fact, in some cases, made the continuance of that relationship a desirable one, but those views were not the views of the majority, and unless the minority is prepared to accept its part and to accept majority rule there is no way of settling that question that I know of except by force.  Force naturally suggests itself as a means of solving problems that seem to be intractable otherwise, but there is no use in appealing to force if it is obvious that force cannot be effective, and in 1921, when the matter came up for consideration before the Republican Government of that date, as the Seanad was reminded here this afternoon, we came deliberately to the decision that force was not going to be effective, and was not going to be appealed to as a means of solving this particular problem.  I think I can honestly say that I have adhered to that; I regarded that decision as a wise one at the time, and I have never retreated from that position in public yet, nor in private.  I think it was a wise decision, and I put to those who think otherwise the question: &ldquo;How do you think that the method of force is going to be effective for this purpose?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> I am not a pacifist by any means.  I would, if I could see a way of doing it effectively, rescue the people of Tyrone and Fermanagh, South Down, South Armagh and Derry City from the coercion which they are suffering at the present time, because I believe that, if there is to be no coercion, that ought to apply all round.  If we had behind us the strength of some of the continental Powers&mdash;I can say publicly what I have said privately&mdash;I would feel perfectly justified in using force to prevent the coercion of the people of South Down, South Armagh, Tyrone, Fermanagh and Derry City. Would I go further than that?  Remember, I do not think I would have solved the question of Partition simply by relieving them from coercion.  Even though I would feel justified in doing it, and probably would do it, still I cannot blind myself and could not blind myself to the fact that the problem of the partition of this country would remain, because a portion of it would still be cut off.  I think that the whole of this island is the national territory. I know that people sitting down calmly and thinking of the history of nations and national territories would tell me that national territories change from time to time; that there have been changes in the boundaries of States, in national boundaries in Europe, over the course of centuries; and that in the case of Ireland, too, if that happened, well, something had happened which was not unique. There is a certain amount of truth, we must admit, in that contention, but, as was said by Signor Mussolini in a famous letter which he wrote, I think it was last September or October, there is something about the boundaries that seem to be drawn by the hand of the Almighty which is very different from the boundaries that are drawn by ink upon a map:&mdash;&ldquo;Frontiers traced with ink on other inks can be modified.  It is quite another thing when the frontiers were traced by Providence.&rdquo;  It is vain and foolish, of course, to try to prophesy, or to look into the future, but I do not think that any generation of Irishmen living in this island would ever be satisfied&mdash;those of them, at any rate, who regard themselves as having <Col N="981" /> a connection with the historic Irish nation&mdash;as long as a single square inch of this island was outside the control of the nation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, even though we were by force to succeed in rescuing from the coercion which they are suffering, those who are the majority&mdash;as they are the local majorities in these areas &mdash;we would not have finished with the question of Partition.  If the argument I heard here did apply to the whole of the area cut off, in the way that we would apply it, say, to two counties round Belfast, then the story might be different as far as logic is concerned, or even as far as moral principles are concerned.  Clearly it does not apply to the rest of the Six Counties.  These counties were cut off, we know, deliberately, as giving the greatest area which the Partition Parliament could control&mdash;which the Belfast majority could control and have a stable majority there.  That was confessed at the time.  They were not cut off on the principle that the majority of the people inhabiting these areas wished to be apart from us.  In the area I am talking about, along the 300-mile artificial border put there, the people by a majority want to be with us, and are kept from being with us by coercion, and by nothing else.  There is feeling in this part of the country about that division.  I certainly do not want to intensify that feeling.  It is there naturally, and it is because I know there is that intensity of feeling that, as a member of a Government responsible for the State in this part of the country, I was anxious, as soon as possible, that the situation would be remedied.  It is a dangerous situation. It is a situation which ought to be remedied as soon as possible.  It was from that particular point of view that I went over to Britain in the negotiations a year ago, and I put the question of Partition as the foremost one which should be settled, in order to bring about good relations between our own people here and good relations between Ireland and Britain. That was the basis.</P>
    <P>I did not go over to ask them to coerce any section of the Northern people.  In fact, I think I made it quite clear that if the British Government <Col N="982" /> was going to use coercion against a section of our people, they would, probably, find us standing by other Irishmen against them.  Asking them to use coercion and asking them not to maintain by active effort, the present division, are quite different things.  I think we could ask them not by any action of theirs to help to perpetuate a division which is dangerous to us and dangerous to them.  That was the line on which I went.  The mover of the motion has found fault with us for our policy.  As I said, he has not defined any way clearly what our policy was, but he has spoken about people saying that the British were responsible for Partition, or solely responsible for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For the maintenance of it.  I do not think I ever said that they were solely responsible.  I do hold that they are responsible, but they could not have brought Partition about in this country if there was not an element here on which they could base their scheme for Partition.  If we want to look at this thing objectively, to try to see it straight, we have to recognise that there is a section in the country, that they are a majority in a certain small area&mdash;and it is only a small area &mdash;and that the people in it do not want to be with us in a unified State, and to accept the rule of law determined by the majority.  They say they would be a minority in such a State, and that they do not want to be in that position.  It was on that fact that the British based their Partition proposal, but they did not try to carry the proposal out logically on that basis.  They went very much beyond that.  They went a distance they would not have gone on principle &mdash;because they had no principle on which they could act&mdash;were it not for the fact that the people who held that particular view were influential with the particular Government of that time, and had powerful Party influence. There is no doubt that a very large number of people in Ireland believe that it was a definite part of British Imperial policy to divide us, and that <Col N="983" /> the British wished to have a part of this island still directly governed from Britain.  I have no means of knowing whether that was true or not, at that particular time.  It was not unnatural that the Irish people would have that suspicion, at any rate.</P>
      <P>As regards the setting up of partition, two facts were responsible.  There was first the fact of a dissentient minority, and then there was British action upon that fact.  If the majority of the British Parliament had not been particularly friendly with that small section, do you think they would have ever dreamt of proposing Partition as a solution?  Supposing it had been the other way round, do you think they were going to allow Irish Nationalists to cut themselves off, if they were a small minority?  The more people examine the transactions at that particular time, the more they will be satisfied that the British Parliament, at that time, did deliberately favour a particular section of the Irish people.  As far as local majority was concerned they would be relatively a small section and a small part.  The majority of our people naturally resented that favouritism, because they saw that something was being done, which would not have been done, were it not for the fact that there was a certain section in the British Parliament that took partial views, and wished particularly to favour their friends.  I am not saying that there were not historical reasons why they should be on that side, but that is what the average Irish Nationalist sees in the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the British Parliament that did it.  It could not have been done without the British Parliament. And they did it knowingly.  In order to get better acceptance of it from some of the British people at the time they did say that it was only intended to be a mere temporary affair, that it was the best way of bringing about ultimate unity.  If that be so, and if that were so, we would naturally expect that they should not have forgotten the things that they said at that particular time, and that, if there were other pledges and promises which were made in secret, which we hear <Col N="984" /> referred to but which we know nothing about, that those public statements which were made by British Ministers at that time would have some weight now.  It was on the basis of such statements in the British Parliament at that time that the British people were induced to agree to it.  So that, I think, as far as the responsibility for the creation of Partition is concerned, one can truthfully say that the responsibility, the major responsibility, was that of the British Parliament. I admit it was based on a fact here which was utilised by the British Government and the British politicians to the full and beyond the full because, if they were acting on principle, the portion that they would cut off would not be the Six Counties but a very small portion around Belfast.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the 1918 elections.  Those were elections for the whole of Ireland and in those elections my recollection is that 73 seats were secured by the Sinn Féin Party, six by Nationalists, which would be 79, and, I think, the rest was 26.  So that the majority against Partition was more than three to one in the whole of Ireland.  The majority in favour of the national policy, at that time, was three to one.  In the same elections, if you analyse them&mdash;it is a good while since I have seen them now&mdash;I think you will find that, if you exclude the County of Antrim and the City of Belfast with the university, at that particular time there was a majority in the province of Ulster, in favour of the national policy of that particular time which was, of course, for the unity of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope that Senator MacDermot and any others who were in favour of his point of view understand why we say that the British Government has the major responsibility for creating Partition and creating it in its precise unjust from.  I believe it to be wrong in any form but the British Parliament is responsible for creating it in the particularly unjust form in which it is at present, in which an area is included far beyond the area which any local plebiscites would give.  Again, I say that with full knowledge of the fact that there was a division here which was utilised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> Are the British responsible for the continuance of it?  I think I said in the Dáil that we must not forget, going back to the old riddle, that if humpty-dumpty is knocked off the wall he who knocks the egg off the wall is not thereby in a better position for putting it together again&mdash;the fact that he knocked it off the wall does not help him to put it together again.  It might be said in favour of the British Government, of those that have followed since, that the fact unfortunately was there.  The egg was knocked off the wall and, even if they wanted to put it back, they had difficulty in doing it.  I suppose there is a large element of truth in that.  The mover of the motion told us that, as far as he knew British opinion at the present time, the majority of the people in the island of Britain would like to see Partition ended.  I have no means of knowing definitely whether that is true or not.  I believe it to be true.  He went further than that and I think he said that he believed that the British Government would like to see Partition ended.  From my experience I think that that also is true.  I cannot say I am certain of it but I believe, if I were in the British Government myself, I would like to see it finished from a British point of view and, from that point of view, and because it would serve Britain's interests that it should be finished, I believe that the British Government would like to see it ended.  Can I go further?  I do not wish to pretend to quote the Senator when I am not actually using his words, but I think he gave the impression that there was no Party or no important group that would not like to see it ended.  I am not so sure.  I believe that if we could say that there was no British political Party or no important section of a British political Party which did not want to see Partition ended, we were certainly on the road to seeing Partition ended.  The Government policy, in so far as propaganda, which has been referred to here, is concerned, has been definitely this, to instruct the British people in so far as we could do it of the facts, not to beg them to do anything in the way of coercing those in the north-east who <Col N="986" /> do not want to come in with us but to cease actively encouraging that section to keep out.  If you say that that policy of instruction is wrong I have only to say that if force is going to be ruled out and if we have to appeal to common sense and to goodwill, then we have to inform common sense.  We have to give the facts.  We have to say to the British, as we say to our own people who may not clearly understand it, that there is an injustice at the present time being done to a large section of our people who are entrapped in that territory and held there by force.  If we do not make that clear, definitely clear, we are simply sitting down and being content with a position which is a dangerous position that ought not to be allowed to continue one moment longer than it can be helped.</P>
    <P>We have tried to inform British opinion on that particular matter, and we have gone further in so far as by public statement we can do it.  We have tried to inform our own people, not merely here, but our own people throughout the world wherever they might be, wherever they have a voice, and wherever they could bring influence to bear, that there is an injustice being done in our country at the present moment, an injustice which, I say, would justify the use of force if it could be effective.  I do not want, and I am not advocating, force &mdash;I hope that that is clear&mdash;because I do not think it would succeed.  I do not want it.  I do not think it would be right.  I think it would embitter relations which were improving.  I do not want it, but I do want the injustice to be known all over the world and to be removed.  I want to have the Irish people all over the world using whatever influence they have to try to bring Partition to an end.  That has been, in the main, the Government policy&mdash;to bring that fact home to the British Government, to ask them not to continue doing the things which they are doing in the way of perpetuating this division, for which the Irish people hold them responsible.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDermot, I think, made a point of the fact that those in the North got certain treatment <Col N="987" /> because they were part of the United Kingdom.  But is not that precisely our difficulty, is it not our whole cause of complaint? There is no use replying that they are in the United Kingdom and that, therefore, they must be helped in this way. It is precisely because they are in that particular State that they get this help. The two things are one.  We object to one as we object to the other.  Our complaint precisely is that they are a part of the United Kingdom joined to Britain.  We say that by Britain taking them over, and by helping in that particular way, while defending them, if you like, in various forms, she is preventing the ordinary natural laws from working, because the natural laws, in my opinion anyhow, would have brought the two sections of the people here together, accepting democratic principles, just as they bring people together in other parts of the world.  We say that everything that Britain does in that particular way helps to make the division more lasting.  What is the use of our holding out attractions to them if, when we offer something, twice as much is offered by the people who are competing?</P>
    <P>The Irish people wish the British, if they have no interest in Partition, not to give any active assistance in keeping people out who want to come in.  They are keeping people out who want to come in.  They are keeping out the people, again I repeat it, of South Down, South Armagh, Tyrone, Fermanagh and Derry, and all that area.  There is not the slightest doubt about it that if there were not British military forces in those areas, those people would move to come in with us, and we would certainly take them. Britain, then, cannot wash its hands either of the responsibility for enacting Partition or of the responsibility for keeping it, particularly in its present form.</P>
    <P>Now, because I say that, the mover of the motion will proceed to say that the present Government, therefore, is responsible for everything that may happen.  All right.  We have our responsibilities, and I hope we will live <Col N="988" /> up to them.  But, if I have to be silent when I think that right should be advocated, or face consequences which I may deplore for other reasons, I say I am not going to be silent&mdash;I do not think it is right to be silent.  I think this is a crying evil which ought to be remedied, and that all the parties to it have an equal reason for trying to end it quickly.</P>
    <P>Now, is it only the British who have a responsibility for the continuance of it?  I do not want for a moment to say that.  Again, if there was not this division here in our midst, the British could not use it.  There is, of course, and it is foolish to blind yourself to that, just as it is foolish to blind yourself to the other aspect of it. There are people here with a very different outlook from that of the majority.  They occupy a certain area &mdash;it is a small area in the country. Their ideals deserve the fullest possible consideration.  When we had, as the Government in 1921, responsibilities in that particular matter, we were prepared to go to any distance that was reasonable to give satisfaction to their point of view.  When Fianna Fáil became the Government, and we came to frame a Constitution, we kept in mind the possibility of making concessions to those whose outlook on certain matters differed from ours. But we could not proceed along the line that was proposed by Senator MacDermot. A minority has rights; a minority's viewpoint deserves careful consideration.  I think that, in so far as it is possible to meet them, an effort to meet them should be made.  But, again, I say there are limits to that and that the majority have their rights too.</P>
    <P>For instance, speaking for myself&mdash;I am not talking about Government policy in the matter, which has been largely embodied in the Constitution&mdash; I would not to-morrow, for the sake of a united Ireland, give up the policy of trying to make this a really Irish Ireland&mdash;not by any means.  If I were told to-morrow: &ldquo;You can have a united Ireland if you give up your idea of restoring the national language to be the spoken language of the majority of the people,&rdquo; I would, for myself, say no.  I <Col N="989" /> do not know how many would agree with me.  I would say no, and I would say it for this reason: that I believe that as long as the language remains you have a distinguishing characteristic of nationality which will enable the nation to persist.  If you lose the language the danger is that there would be absorption.</P>
    <P>One of the sad things for me all the time is that there has not been a fuller appreciation of that fact amongst the young people of the country.  I imagine, if I were a young man, that there is nothing to which I would devote myself so much.  I can say this, that, after the Treaty, when Cathal Brugha and I felt that there was an end as far as our efforts for trying to get the freedom we wanted at that particular time were concerned, the two of us came to an agreement that there was only one thing to be done, and that we should do it immediately, and that was, to try to bring about the restoration of the language.  I feel that to this day, and I hope that I am right in it.</P>
    <P>Certainly I do not think it is a point of view I am going to change.  I believe that the restoration of the national language is the surest guarantee that this nation will continue to exist. Much as I would desire to see unity&mdash;and I told you it was because of Partition I came into politics&mdash;much as I would desire to see that, which, as far as I am concerned, would be the crowning of anything I ever attempted as far as practical political action was concerned, I would not grasp even that at the cost of losing the opportunity of restoring the language. Therefore, I would not pay that price.</P>
    <P>There is another price I would not pay.  Suppose we were to get unity in the country provided we were to give up the principles that are here in this first Article of the Constitution&mdash; the &ldquo;sovereign right of the nation to choose its own form of Government, to determine its relations with other nations, and to develop its life, political, economic, and cultural, in accordance with its own genius and traditions&rdquo;&mdash;I would not sacrifice that right, because without that right you have not freedom at all.  Although freedom for a part of this island is not the freedom we want&mdash;the <Col N="990" /> freedom we would like to have, this freedom for a portion of it, freedom to develop and to keep the kernel of the Irish nation is something, and something that I would not sacrifice, if by sacrificing it we were to get a united Ireland and that united Ireland was not free to determine its own form of Government, to determine its relations with other countries, and, amongst other things, to determine, for example, whether it would or would not be involved in war.  Our people have the same right as any other people to determine these vital matters for themselves and they ought not to surrender them in advance to anybody or for any consideration.  Certainly, as far as this Government is concerned, we are not going to surrender that right&mdash;for any consideration, even the consideration of a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>We want to be on friendly relations with Britain.  There is not here, amongst our people, I believe, this hatred of Britain that we hear talked about.  There is hatred undoubtedly&mdash; hatred of the things that history has shown Britain has been responsible for &mdash;but I think we can forget just as rapidly as other people can forget, and once the evil is finished and done with, the resentment that follows will also cease.  As long, however, as there is something left to engender and to cause that bitterness, that bitterness and resentment will last, and if we are genuinely anxious, as I honestly am, to bring about good relations between the British and Irish peoples, the first thing to do is to try to remove these causes of resentment; and, just as I believe that, if the prejudices could be put aside, there are many things which bring us, the people of the North and South, together on a basis of common interest, so, too, the people of Britain and of this country have numbers of things upon which their common interest would bring them together.</P>
    <P>Our situation is that we are two islands off the Continent.  Our very geographical position suggests that there are relations which we have closer to each other than we have with other countries.  The history between the two countries, although it has not been a happy one, has undoubtedly begot certain relations which make it <Col N="991" /> possible for us to have closer contacts than we would have with other peoples.  The relationship, as I have said, has not been happy, but yet people from these two islands have gone out and lived in common home-lands in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere.  These are points of contact between Britain and ourselves, and these would develop, according to natural laws, if only the interfering hand of partisan politics was taken away.</P>
    <P>I have not tried to plan this speech in any particular form.  I did not care to follow the Senator in his various remarks, because I admit they were irritating to listen to, and in reading them since, I found, as perhaps other Senators did, that they were no less irritating.  They were irritating, not because they hurt prejudices in me or anybody else, but because they gave a wrong view of the situation&mdash;because they came at the present moment and at a time when it was essential that the truth in its completeness should be told.  It was irritating that anybody who professed to be doing that, should give a partial, one-sided picture.  Undoubtedly, the views of the minority of the nation, who are a majority in a small area in the North-East, differ from ours in sentimental directions.  They are attached to the British Empire.  We are not. I do not think that we have any feeling of affection for the British Empire as such.  We know that they have. They may have no affection for what I might call the historic Irish nation. Of course, somebody may ask me to define that.  Well, there are many things that it would be rather difficult to define, but we who believe that we represent, anyhow, the historic Irish nation in its present development have not the same loyalties and affections that they have.  Who is going to give way?  Is it the majority or is it the minority?  If the minority say: &ldquo;We will not have you,&rdquo; well, at least, they cannot say that they can take others with them.  I say that the majority in this particular matter&mdash;the will of the majority ought to prevail, with due consideration for the minority in so far as it can be given.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> They say that there are material interests which bind them to Britain. Some of these interests, it is true, affect us here, and we have certain material considerations, too, such as some of the material considerations they have in mind.  I think we have just as much hard-headedness down here as you have up in the North.  My own view is that we are on all-fours either as far as devotion to ideals is concerned or as far as stubbornness in holding to them or a fair appreciation of material interests is concerned.</P>
    <P>I think that we, both North and South, would be prepared to sacrifice our material interests for the convictions we have of a sentimental character. I think that is true of both, and it is one of the difficulties of the problem, and I wish that at least we would get this far: that each side would give the other credit for that. Unfortunately, that is not done.  We are foolish both here and in the North; foolish in attributing to the other side a certain amount of weakness which we pride ourselves upon not having ourselves.  I do not think that weakness exists at all.  I have never acted, at any rate, on that basis.  I always held that the people who differ from me held their views as tenaciously as I hold mine, and that if force is ruled out, I must try to meet them half-way.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution was designed to try, so far as it was possible, to reconcile conflicting views.  Under it it is possible for the people to continue to have association with the States of the British Commonwealth if the people want it.  If they do not want it, there is no use in trying to coerce them, because, if there is to be democracy at all, the people in the country must be free to change their Constitution from time to time as it suits them, and to change the laws of the country as it suits them.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to those who talk about such things as &ldquo;manly&rdquo; action, and that the manly thing to do would be to declare a Republic, I should like to say something.  I have not been able to put my hand on the exact quotation, but perhaps some of the classical scholars here may be able to tell me. However, I have an idea that it was a <Col N="993" /> case where Caesar induced the Gauls to attack him when he was in a strong position which he had selected and the suggestion was that it was not playing the game if these unfortunate people did not come in and attack him when he was in that strong position.  Senator MacDermot thinks that we are like that.  That sort of talk does not appeal to anybody, to anybody of sense anyhow&mdash;that kind of talk about doing the manly thing. What we have done, we have done with our eyes open.  We have done it as a compromise, if you like, but as a compromise which was possible and, in my opinion, as one who has studied the question very closely, the only compromise that <i>is</i> possible.</P>
    <P>We have given an opportunity to the majority of the people to have whatever form of Government they want. We have given an opportunity to continue relations and association with the States of the British Commonwealth if they wish to do so.  I do not believe that it is possible to get the majority of the Irish people to go farther to meet the minority in the North.  Of course, it is, if you like, a compromise and can be attacked by the extremes on both sides.  There is no use in blinding ourselves to the fact it gives us an internal Republic.  Some people may think that the word republic may connote different things for different people.  It was necessary for me from time to time because of my association with the movement to give my views. As far as I was concerned I think the majority of the Irish people knew what we were out to get, namely, the right of the Irish people to have any form of Government they wanted.</P>
    <P>We have in this State internally a Republic and so long as we have an Act of Parliament associating us in certain respects with the States of the British Commonwealth we will have that association, and no longer.  The determination of that association can take place at any time that the majority of the people wish.  I think that any attempt to go beyond that in the direction which has been suggested that we should go, would be sure to fail.  It would be upset by a revolt of the majority.  We cannot go that far to <Col N="994" /> meet the views of the minority in the North.  You know those toy puzzles in which a number of beads are to be put into holes.  One of the ways is to put in one first and then try to get the others in after. But there is no use in trying to get in the second and upset the first for you are then as badly off as before.  That is the point of view that it would be very important for people like Senator MacDermot to bear in mind.</P>
    <P>It has been my business to think about these things for 20 years and I honestly say that I do not believe the majority will go beyond what is provided in the Constitution.  That is the only answer I can give to those who want us to go farther.  I say this was designed as a compromise and as a compromise it was thought of at the very same time when we said we cannot coerce the Six Counties.  You go a distance to meet them.  There are differences from the sentimental point of view&mdash;from the different loyalties we have.  What we have done is the farthest we can go, so far as I can see, to get agreement.  People may say it is not far enough. We have only to wait our time.  Again to use the illustration about the beads, there is no use in putting out the first bead in order to get in the second one. The only chance you have is to keep steady and then, as circumstances may determine, try to finish the job.</P>
    <P>With regard to the material side I do not think that in respect of that there was a fair presentation of the case here at all.  Is it not obvious that if there was to be a conference&mdash; and I suppose it would finish with some kind of conference&mdash;that representatives from the North would come along?  In 1921, before I went to Mr. Lloyd George first I tried to get representatives from the North to meet me.  If I had my way the first conference would be with people in the North.  It is with them we should have the first conference.</P>

      <P>I assure you my hand has been out always and never for one instant, though sometimes we had to put up with a good many rebuffs, did I fail to have my hand <Col N="995" /> out.  It has been always there.  At no time did I refuse to have a conference with the people in the North.  I believe that is the way to do it and to try to get them to see our point of view as we see theirs, and to see whether we can get agreement with regard to the problem.  But as you know it would be necessary after that to get the British Government to agree.  There is no good in trying to pretend that the British Government is not responsible for the Government of that particular area.  They are responsible for certain aspects of the Government there and that would have to be settled then.  I do believe that if we could get a solution there would be no objection to that solution from the British side.  That is my belief as far as I can see matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in saying &ldquo;quite true.&rdquo;  I have no immediate and direct knowledge that it is the case but I believe it is.  That is the way we would naturally deal with it.  Further I want to say a word on this question about material matters and the question as to how business men would fare if there were agreement on the basis of this Constitution, so long at any rate as external association existed.  I do not see how any business man in the North would be in a worse position than he is to-day from the point of view of relations with Britain.  He would only be in a worse position if Britain, deliberately in resentment against any agreement come to here, would make it different.  Therefore, as far as ship-building is concerned, the Northern businessmen would suffer nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the linen industry is concerned, I was amused to read a few days ago in connection with the World Fair in New York, that Irish linen would be there to attract American maidens, and that the linen merchants would appeal on sentimental grounds to the Americans to buy Irish linen. I know something about America, and I can say that undoubtedly the sentiment there would be towards <i>Irish</i> linen, if it were not Belfast linen and &ldquo;Partition&rdquo; linen, and if it were really Irish, and in the Irish, not the British <Col N="996" /> Pavilion.  I think in that case there would be a different sentiment there. The people of Irish blood would be much more likely to buy Irish linen in such circumstances than they would under present conditions.  I say, therefore, that so far as ship-building and linen go, so far as the British market is concerned, the business man in the North of Ireland would suffer nothing, and his position would be no worse than at present.  I know that we cannot foresee or guarantee everything.</P>
    <P>I would like to say this to those who talk about taking a &ldquo;manly stand&rdquo; and who tell us that we want to have the best of two worlds, that there was a time, in 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1921, when we showed we were prepared to take that stand and its consequences. Let nobody suggest that, as far as we are concerned, there is pretence or that we are not prepared to act up to our professions. It was not we who prevented that solution. It was not we who prevented an Irish Republic being set up.  It was British force.  Later on it was Britain's threat of immediate war that prevented that policy being carried out.  Therefore, let nobody suggest that the Irish people here were not prepared to face the consequences.  Senator MacDermot said that if we had continued it longer we would find out.  The fact is we were prepared to do it.</P>
    <P>I would like to tell those who say how much we are gaining by association with the British that the British are also gaining by it.  I ask them not to forget that the British are gaining too.  On one occasion a colleague of mine, I think it was the late Arthur Griffith, the Lord have mercy on him, said to Mr. Lloyd George: &ldquo;We do not imagine that it is for our beautiful blue eyes you are taking our butter.&rdquo; Neither is it for our sake or for the sake of the people who have gone into the British service that they were taken on, but because England finds it to her advantage to take them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Now let me deal with that.  I admit that the people in the North have certain loyalties.  The majority here have not got these loyalties.  A compromise is necessary. <Col N="997" /> What we have to do is to recognise the mutual advantages proposed. In the Citizenship Act, or in the Aliens Act, provision is made for reciprocal citizenship rights.  We have given the British citizens certain rights in return for the rights we get from them.  This gives the material advantages the Belfast man desires.  But we are not prepared to go further and give up our Irish nationality and Irish citizenship for British citizenship.  Some people say that is a small matter and is one of those concessions that ought to be made.  I am pointing out the view of the majority.  The majority are not prepared to make that concession. They say: &ldquo;It is quite enough if we arrange for the material advantages the Belfast man desires on the basis of reciprocal citizenship.&rdquo;  Of course, Senator MacDermot can say: &ldquo;These are constitutional niceties and it is tweedledum and tweedledee whether you have a common citizenship or whether you have a reciprocal citizenship.&rdquo;  I say it is not.  One is completely consistent with the position that has been taken up as regards our independence, and the other is not consistent with it.  If we are trying to get practical results we ought to try and get the logic of the situation right.  I think reciprocal arrangements, or privileges, if you wish, will give us practical results.  If the people in the North are the hard-headed people we are told, then they ought to be satisfied, having regard to the fact that there is a majority here with different views, to face compromises of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with the case of ship-building and linen.  As regards the other sorts of business&mdash;industrialists of various kinds, I think that they have lost a good deal.  I think the business men in the North have lost a good deal by not being in this State for the last eight or ten years.  Of course, I will be met on the other hand with the question: What about the industrialists down here who have gained during that time?  Well, the Parliament or the State will have to settle these things.  These are things which we cannot have every way.  If we are going to have the people in the North, we mean them to <Col N="998" /> have equal rights with other citizens. They will have the right to compete, and the State or the Parliament of the day will have to settle these matters, and settle the policy which, in the whole national interest, is regarded as being the best.  But at any rate it is very doubtful whether the industrialists of the North&mdash;leaving shipbuilding and linen out of it for the moment&mdash;would not be better in a united Ireland than they would be in a partitioned Ireland. I think they would.  I think that using the old phrase they would, in fact, have the best of two worlds.  They would have here this External Relations Act which would give them the connection that they would require in order to have their external markets.  I do not think, therefore, from the point of view of the big industries, that they would suffer.  On that particular side it is probable that the industrialists in this part of Ireland would find that they had got the worst of the bargain.  It is possible.  I do not know.  It is a matter that would have to be worked out: one that would have to be taken into account when negotiations were taking place.</P>
    <P>I come now to the case of our farmers.  It is suggested here that the farmers in the North are very much better off than our farmers because they are relieved of the payment of rates on their land.  I doubt very much if there is any substantial difference between the position of the farmers, relative to the State, either in the North or here.  I think they balance very fairly.  Our people here get, in relief of rates on land, a sum of £1,800,000, and their annuities are halved.  If you add the rates and the annuities, as charges on land, I think you will find that, roughly, about half those charges are met from the Central Exchequer.  In the North, the farmers pay their annuities to the Central Exchequer. I think they get full relief of rates on agricultural land and buildings.  Therefore, as far as the farmers are concerned, I think it is 50-50.  It is a toss up which side has the advantage.</P>

I must say that, as far as I am concerned, and I think I am typical of the members of the Government, there is not one of us who does not realise that the best industry in the country is the farming industry, and, as regards life on the land, if I could put more people on the land than there are on it at present I would do so. There is not a section of the community but will have its complaint.  I suppose if I were talking to some industrialists they would complain that they were not heard.</P>

      <P>I know the farmers' position, and I should be very deaf indeed if I did not.  I sympathise fully with their situation, but the community as a whole has to be taken into account.  I know that the Minister for Agriculture is a fairly assertive member of the Government, and whenever the interests of the farmers are in question his voice is a strong one on their side. Senator Counihan has raised this question of fat cattle.  Is his point this: that the British are giving a subsidy at the present time, and is the suggestion that we would not do it?  I do not know what would be done on that by the Government of a united Ireland.  It is wrong to say that it would not be done.  I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" /> In the same way it is suggested that the workers in the North, by coming in here, would be making a very bad bargain: that they would only get such and such an amount of unemployment assistance.  To hear some of the statements made one would think that we had no social services, the fact being, of course, that in certain directions we are more liberal in our social services than they are in the North.  It is quite true that we do not give as much to those who are out of work.  I wish we had got to the point at which we had completely solved our unemployment problem.  I think there is nobody in the North who would not prefer employment to any unemployment dole.  What I would say to the workers in the North is this: look at the other social services that are here. This Government, in regard to hours of work and a number of other conditions of labour is in advance of your legislation up North.  We are in advance of you in certain directions.</P>
    <P>In a united Irish State, the natural effort of the Government would be to try to secure employment for all. Do not forget that, in Britain, there are 2,000,000 unemployed.  If they were able to say: &ldquo;We can give you employment in the North, and you will not get employment in a united Ireland,&rdquo; then there would be a strong case, but merely that the amount of unemployment assistance is greater in the North is not a very strong inducement, it seems to me, to the people of the North to keep away from the rest of their fellow-countrymen.</P>
    <P>However, these are things which people sitting down around a table would deal with.  Naturally, there would have to be a certain amount of negotiation about them, and it is not right to argue as if the existing situation would be continued in a united Irish State precisely as it is at the moment.  That is obviously a fallacy. It would not be.  I think I have covered enough to show the House what my outlook is, and I think it is the outlook of the Government as a whole. Certainly, so far as any policy had to be decided, we have worked on that basis.  Unless you can point out a definite method of solving Partition, <Col N="1001" /> you cannot point to any other way of proceeding than the way in which we are going.  If things happen which we do not wish, when we are trying to concentrate public opinion on this problem, we regret them and should do everything in our power to prevent them.</P>
    <P>The matter of certain prisoners and so on has been raised by Senator Kelly.  I am not going to say anything in regard to these matters as they are sub judice.  I think that is the proper thing for me to do.  I think we ought to have at least the same reserve here as is maintained in another place, so I am not going to speak about them. There was a matter, however, which he also raised and which has to be met, and that is a certain definite challenge to the Government here.  We have been elected in two free elections by the Irish people.  We are the rightful, lawful Government of this country.  No other body of people in this country has the right to talk for the Irish people.  I say this, that we, as a Government, are going to carry out our obligations.</P>
    <P>We are going to be the Government and we are not going to let a situation develop here such as has developed elsewhere and which has robbed the people of their freedom. We regard ourselves, as a Government, as trustees for the liberties of our people and I know no way in which the liberties of our people can be maintained unless we maintain the free, democratic institutions which we, and they, have set up. I do not want to say any more.  We have to do our duty and we will do our duty at any cost to ourselves, personal or otherwise.  That is definite, and it will be the duty of the Minister for Justice in the Dáil to-morrow to move the introduction of certain Bills dealing with that situation to give to the Government the powers that are necessary in order that the Government may maintain its position and its authority.  I hope, Sir, that I have not kept the Seanad too long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech to which we have just listened contains, naturally, several statements with which I strongly disagree, but, taking it as a whole, it is at least as far <Col N="1002" /> removed, not only in general outlook, but in statement of matters of fact, from the majority of the speeches made from those benches opposite in the course of this debate as it is from the speech by which I introduced this debate.  I have often heard the Taoiseach speak on Partition before and I should like to say that I consider this speech of his the most objective and the most valuable speech on Partition I have yet heard him make. I say that although, as I have said, I differ strongly from several things in it.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Seanad to recollect the circumstances under which this motion was introduced.  It did not come as a bolt from the blue. This motion was put down in reference to a particular campaign that had been started by members of the Government Party against Partition. Public meetings were being held in various parts of this country and in England, and very strong, very violent and very inflammatory statements were being made at those meetings. The Taoiseach suggests that I have been wrong in assuming that Government policy on this question was this or that.  He complains that I did not define more closely what my idea of Government policy was.  I confess that I regarded myself as justified in assuming that the sort of speeches that were being made, shall we say, by Mr. Eamonn Donnelly, in various parts of the country represented the mind of the Government, and it was on that basis that I put down this motion, and that I think I was justified in putting it down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach says he found himself irritated because in the course of my speech I did not tell the whole truth about Partition.  I did not profess to be telling the whole truth about Partition, and if I had undertaken the task of telling, in a single speech, the whole truth about Partition, I would have kept the House at least two hours instead of the one hour for which, in fact, I kept them.  It was the longest speech I ever made and, even so, I had difficulty in cramming into it all I wanted to say.  Listening to some of the speeches made in this debate, I really had difficulty in recognising <Col N="1003" /> myself.  I saw myself figuring as a kind of Orange agent.  Yet the fact is that I am a life-long Irish nationalist, and I have done more speaking against Partition in quarters where it is not popular to speak against Partition, than anyone in this House.  I have this advantage, or disadvantage, as compared with most members of the House, that I am familiar by experience, by the experience of having gone and talked to these people, publicly and privately, with the considerations that carry weight with them and the sort of arguments that can persuade them.  The Taoiseach has made a plea for propaganda for convincing the British people of the iniquity of the situation.  So far as I am concerned, he is spurring a willing horse.  I have spoken against Partition in the last few years in Belfast University, Oxford University, the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, and even to the Conservative back-benchers in a Committee Room of the House of Commons.  Nobody could feel more strongly the injustice of the present situation than I.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has referred to the position of the minority in Northern Ireland.  It is quite true that I said nothing about that in my speech, because that was not the particular thing which at this moment I wanted to ram home in this Assembly, but I have said plenty about it elsewhere. I agree that the situation is outrageous and that, even assuming that there had to be Partition for a time&mdash;and my own view is that, after 1916, there did have to be Partition&mdash;the boundary line was wrongly and unjustly drawn.  But can we marvel at it that the British, as the Taoiseach says, showed some favouritism in the matter?  After all, on one side there were men who&mdash;you may laugh at it and say it was lipservice&mdash;were loudly and constantly professing their love for and devotion to the Crown, Flag and Empire.  On the other side, you had people who had been in open revolution and warfare against the British.  Can you wonder if there was a certain favouritism? I regret and deplore it.  I think injustice is never right, and I think this was <Col N="1004" /> injustice.  But I do not think it is anything to be astonished at.</P>
    <P>The speech of the Taoiseach seemed to be unfair to myself in suggesting that I had left certain elements out of account.  I left these elements of the situation out of my speech because I came here to support a particular proposition which seemed to me to be lost sight of and which, it has been amply proved by the speeches of 90 per cent. of the Fianna Fáil Senators who have spoken in this debate, had been lost sight of.  That is that Partition cannot be cured without taking full account of the sentiments and interests of the majority of the people in the North. How far that taking of account is going to lead you in the way of concession is, of course, a disputable matter.  Quite frankly, I would go further than the Taoiseach would.  But what is not disputable for anyone who has the right idea about the Irish nation is that the only one way to tackle this question is to try to get inside the minds of the people in the North, to be interested in what you find there, to give weight to it and to see what you can do about it. Until you start doing that instead of rushing up and down the country abusing the English, you are not making a start towards healing this disease.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made certain statements of the utmost value.  He said that, in his opinion, the British Government would be glad to see Partition ended.  He said that, in his opinion, the British people would be glad to see Partition ended.  I want to emphasise these points, and I hope they will sink home in the breast of everybody in this country.</P>

      <P>I think that the Senator might have spared us that interruption. At the same time, the Taoiseach does say that the British Government is to blame at present for not leaving undone certain things they are doing which, he says, are encouraging the North.  What are these things?  The financial assistance that is being given to the North during the distress of their industries.  The Taoiseach says <Col N="1005" /> that when I reply that that is due to them so long as they are members of the United Kingdom, I am making no answer.  I am making an answer.  I am making this answer, that, at any rate, this is not pure, interfering malevolence on the part of the British. We may resent these counties being part of the United Kingdom, but what is being done for them flows naturally from their situation as part of the United Kingdom and you cannot justly attack the British Government for acting in that way.</P>
      <P>With even some of the strongest things the Taoiseach said, I warmly agree.  He said that if, by the use of force, we could release from the Six-County Government those areas which would wish to join us, he would be in favour of doing it.  So would I.  But, like him, I consider that that is impracticable. On the score of justice and right, it would, however, be a proper thing to do.  I am tempted, then, following on that, to ask&mdash;I do not suggest that the Taoiseach will give me an answer now, but I cannot conceal a certain amount of curiosity on the subject&mdash;whether, in his dealings with the British Government on the question of Partition, he has ever put to them the proposition that, at any rate, the boundary should be revised, because that is a proposition to which any Government would find it hard to give an answer.  Obviously, it ought to be revised.</P>

      <P>If the time has come when we ought to do the thing properly&mdash;and, God knows, I am at one with that&mdash;there is no getting away from the fact that we have got to choose between two fundamentally different philosophies.  The device of the Taoiseach&mdash;external association&mdash;is no good as a solution of that choice.  It is a piece of &ldquo;escapeism&rdquo; which gets us nowhere.  We have got to choose between the British connection and getting rid of the British connection. We have got to choose between the British connection in the form which <Col N="1006" /> will enable the northerners to have their flag and their anthem along with our Irish flag and our Irish anthem, so that their sentiments will be satisfied. It is not the constitutional niceties that will interest them.  It is the feeling of forming fully a part of the British family of nations and having their symbols available to them, as we have our symbols available to us.  That is one choice, and it does not involve the sacrifice of independence, because there is not a single self-governing part of the British Commonwealth which has not a right to go out of it to-morrow if it wishes, and which does not claim and exercise full independence both in domestic and external affairs.  Now, we are told that that is asking the Irish people to sacrifice all their ideals.  It is not.  I refuse to believe that the ideals of the Irish people began in 1916 or 1918.  Have we not got a broader outlook and a longer view of history than that?</P>

      <P>I merely ask the Senator to put himself in this position &mdash;that he does not represent a single Irish constituency, and that I do.  I have done so for a long time, and I only ask people who are going to judge of what the Irish nation is likely to be to take my word against his.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I represented an Irish constituency.  I have twice been elected to represent that constituency&mdash; the second time by a largely increased vote.  I expressed my opinions as plainly and as strongly at every chapel gate I went to in my constituency as I am doing here to-day, and I did not find that the reaction I got was the kind of reaction I got here from Senator Kelly and Senator Healy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are not prepared to do that, we must say, in my opinion, that Davis was a bad Irishman, that O'Connell was a bad Irishman, that Parnell was a bad Irishman&mdash;Parnell, who declared that we would cheerfully accept the duties and responsibilities and justly value the position given to us in the imperial system, provided we got the management of our own affairs.  It is nonsense to pretend that, by adopting that philosophy and by meeting the northerners in that way, we should be <Col N="1007" /> throwing away all the historic ideals of the Irish people.  But it may be, as the Taoiseach says, that it is too late for all that.  We are committed, it seems, to new ideas, but do not let us forget they are new ideas.  If we are committed to a new philosophy and new ideas, then for heaven's sake let us give them their logical fulfilment.  Do not keep this nation in a permanent state of frustration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>If you feel as Senator Kelly felt, then carry your philosophy to its logical conclusion and give this country a republic.  It is forgotten that some 20 years ago so unexpected a person as Lord Balfour urged that what should be done in Ireland was what he described as a bold piece of surgery.  I have heard that speech referred to on the assumption that when he said that he was referring to the setting up of the present system of Partition.  He was not; he was referring to something quite different.  The bold piece of surgery he advocated was that the northern counties should remain a part of England; that there should be no separate Parliament in Belfast and that the rest of the country should be allowed to have an independent republic.  It might have been much better if that proposition had been accepted.  I would see some <Col N="1008" /> hope of unity for this nation, some hope of the ideal of a united Ireland being on the way to fulfilment if we did declare our republic and took the consequences.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach appears to suggest that there is some kind of a trap in this and that it is a particularly bad moment to deal with this matter.  I would have thought that it was a particularly good moment.  There is never likely to be a time when our food supplies are, from a military point of view, more important to the British than they are at present or than they are prospectively over the next few years and, that being so, there is never likely to be a time when there was less danger of the British taking retaliatory action.  I do not believe they would take retaliatory action. The only thing that would follow would be that we would, of course, lose British citizenship, which at present the Taoiseach says we have not got, but which the British treat us as having.  We would lose those opportunities for young men that are at present very largely being taken advantage of by Catholic families in Southern Ireland and not only in the North.</P>
      <P>It would surprise me if there were not some Senators who have relations who are taking advantage of these opportunities&mdash;it would surprise me greatly.  The result of going out of the Commonwealth would, no doubt, be that loss for a start, but then we would have the advantage of retaining more talent at home, and in a number of years the people of the North would be able to see for themselves what we were able to make of our independent republic outside the Commonwealth, and we would be taking what seems to me to be a respectable position.  The present position fills me with shame for this country.  I think it is altogether unworthy of us, and we ought to decide for the British connection or against it.</P>

      <P>Possibly if the people of the country were given an opportunity to choose they would choose the British connection.  I would not like to say what is in the Taoiseach's mind in regard to that.</P>
      <P>I think this debate has done good. It would have justified itself if it had done no more than produce some of the statements that the Taoiseach has made.  I would like to say this to some who criticise me for introducing this motion and who state that my own speech could do nothing except contribute to the maintenance of Partition, that I invite them to put the question to any single Protestant in the North of Ireland who is in favour of unity, who wishes it to come&mdash;and there are some&mdash;I would invite them to ask any such Northerner did he think my speech had done good or not.  If I were to disclose the contents of my mail-bag for the last week to some Senators, it might surprise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view is that you have not a hope of making any headway in getting on to the decent terms that are necessary with the people in the North of Ireland, the Protestant majority, unless you show them that you appreciate their point of view and their difficulties; that you give them their full importance, if not more than their full importance.  Nothing puts people off so much or antagonises them as to feel that you do not really trouble to understand their point of view.  I do not think the wild and whirling statements made by Senator Kelly are going to do any harm because the Northerner thinks, or tries to think, or at any rate says, that we are all Senator Kellys, and no such statement will come as a shock or as a surprise to him.  It does give him a certain amount of comfort <Col N="1010" /> and reassurance, if he is a reasonable man&mdash;if he is an unreasonable man he does not like it&mdash;but, if he is reasonable, it comforts and reassures him to find there are people here who are prepared to consider what his sentiments and interests are.  Therefore, it is not at all my opinion that this debate can have done harm.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald seems to dislike in principle taking any notice of the sentiments and wishes of the people in Northern Ireland.  He seems to think that we should keep our eyes within the narrow boundaries of our own State and not do what he calls propaganda in order to attract the people in the North.  What I am advocating is not in the nature of propaganda at all.  It is, as Senator Rowlette says, that the Governments of this country should take a larger view and should consider themselves as being custodians of Irish nationality, in its broadest sense, that has in the past included the North and that we hope will include the North again.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about the Irish language.  I am not going at this time of the night, especially as I am already awaited in another place, to enter into a debate on the Irish language. But I will say this, that if I considered that the attempt to make Irish a universally spoken tongue in this country was a way to get a more Irish Ireland than we have already, and if I also thought it was practicable, I would support it.  But I do not think the one or the other.  I do not believe that pidgin Irish is going to make an Irish-Ireland.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because it is the invariable practice that the mover of a motion has the right to reply. That right of reply I am exercising, and I am doing no more than replying to statements which have been made in the course of the debate.  I just wish again to emphasise that those of us who disbelieve in the language movement do not disbelieve in it because we wish Ireland not to be Irish; quite the contrary.  I hold by the principle laid down by no less an authority than Thomas Davis, that in the true conception of Irish nationality Ireland must be neither Gaelic nor Saxon, but Irish.  The next few years will show <Col N="1012" /> whether this Irish language movement is really doing what is claimed for it or not.  I dare say that we shall have to wait a few years more before that particular obstacle to union with the North is removed.  Meanwhile, while I value fully the immense devotion that has been shown on behalf of the Irish language, and the amount of idealism that has been put into the movement by the workers in it&mdash;I have the greatest respect and admiration for them&mdash;I believe it to be misguided, and I believe it is one of the ways in which we are setting up barriers between ourselves and the North at the very time when we should be pulling them down.</P>
      <P>I have but one word to say in conclusion. There has been a certain amount of heat in this debate because I suggested that the nationalism which we have known from 1918 to the present day is not the only Irish nationalism deserving of respect, and because I am not prepared to give it primacy over all others.  Some Senators have been inclined to take offence and say &ldquo;How dare you say that sort of thing in the presence of survivors of the Rebellion of 1916?&rdquo; I do suggest to Senators that we have got to be tolerant in these matters.  We have got to be indulgent towards each other. Our views about the past are very different. My mind goes back to 1916 too.  My mind goes back to a spring day in 1916 when I was in the orchard of a monastery a couple of miles away from Ypres, and when I heard for the first time what seemed to me the shameful, the unbelievable, the heart-breaking news of the Rebellion of 1916. I believed then, as indeed I still believe, that it was a frightful blunder. I believed then, as I still believe, that John Redmond took the right line.  I believed then, as I still believe, that it was an appalling responsibility for any man to take, to come out at a time when tens of thousands of Irishmen were risking their lives in so many parts of the world as a result of John Redmond's appeal to the Nationalists of Ireland.</P>

I suggest that we be good-tempered about these things; that we recognise there are differences of opinion about the past, and that such differences do not make any one of us less patriotic in the present or less eager to do whatever we think best for Ireland's future.</P>
