      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, Section 11, sub-section (3)  after the word &ldquo;board&rdquo; in line 27 to insert the words &ldquo;and shall in the case of a situation of an administrative, inspectorial or clerical character&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is not as wide in its scope as an amendment which was moved by me in Committee and which was defeated.  The amendment moved in Committee contemplated making it compulsory upon the tourist development board to fill any situation in its gift through the machinery of the Local Appointments Commissioners. This amendment aims at having only a certain class of appointments filled through that machinery: that is, appointments of an administrative, inspectorial or clerical character.  The amendment, therefore, is less wide in its scope and more definite and particular than the amendment rejected in Committee.</P>
      <P>The objections taken in Committee were of two characters, and perhaps I might deal with these first.  The Minister, speaking in Committee, as reported in column 329 of the Official Debates, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am quite prepared to agree that, in the case of this type of organisation as in the case of the Electricity Supply Board, there are certain types of appointment in respect of which the machinery could be used.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> I am suggesting that these are the types of appointment for which that machinery could be used.  Further on in the same column, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will not have them at the beginning.  It will merely have a few typists, a few inspectors and general staff, until its activities begin to grow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I have translated typists, inspectors and general staff, used in the debate, into words suitable for insertion into an Act of Parliament: that is to say, administrative, inspectorial or clerical appointments, and, in the light of what the Minister said in Committee, I feel there will be no objection taken now to having appointments of this type filled by public advertisement or by any machinery which may be suggested to the board by the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    <P>May I deal at the outset with another objection that was made?  It was said that if the machinery of the Local Appointments Commissioners were used to appoint the staff of the board, the board would, in some way, lose its power to dismiss its staff.  That, of course, is not so.  The Local Appointments Commissioners, like the Civil Service Commissioners, are merely a recruiting body.  They recruit civil servants or the servants of local bodies, but when these servants have been appointed they are dismissible in the ordinary way.  This particular tourist board would not be subject to the restrictions which are imposed upon the Executive in dismissing civil servants.  A servant appointed through the machinery of the Local Appointments Commissioners may be dismissed the following day or the following week, if found unsuitable.  There is nothing in the amendment which will in any way take from the board power over its own servants.</P>
    <P>It was stated in Committee that this board was going to be a business concern, and that it could not appoint its staff in any other way but in the way in which an ordinary business appoints its staff.  The chairman of an ordinary <Col N="699" /> board of directors invests his own money, or some of his own money, in the company.  This particular board will be working with public money, and not with money belonging to the board or to the chairman of the board, nor will the board be responsible to a public meeting of shareholders, as the boards of public companies are.  It seems to me, therefore, that since they will have public money, and since that public money will be used to pay the staff, the machinery which offers competition should be used as distinct from appointment merely by the particular circle in which the chairman or members of the board may happen to be moving, without putting it any worse than that.  The people who give their children education at the present moment are entitled to a fair run for jobs in the Civil Service&mdash;whether of the lower character, or of the higher character in the administrative grades. That applies also to positions under local bodies.  There is no reason why the same people should not have a fair run for positions of this kind.  What is going to happen however, is that, while we have the principle of &ldquo;no patronage&rdquo; applied to entry into the Civil Service, to a very large degree, we are&mdash;under this board and under other boards of the same character&mdash;creating a service the same as the Civil Service but reserving the positions for patronage and not for competition.</P>
    <P>We are spending a good deal of money in granting scholarships from the primary schools to the secondary schools and from the secondary schools to the universities: we are spending a lot of money in grants to schools and in grants to universities.  The least we might do, I think, is to allow the people who come out from these schools and those universities a fair run and no favour for posts under this Bill and under Bills like it.</P>
    <P>I would like to see, further&mdash;though it is not in the present amendment&mdash; the names of persons who are appointed under this board published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> so that it will be possible for them to be copied in the usual way into the ordinary newspapers <Col N="700" /> and the public may know exactly who is being appointed.</P>
    <P>I can see no difficulty which would prevent the board obtaining its staff through the Appointments Commissioners. The headquarters' staff will be people who will need to have administrative experience and there is no difficulty in the board stating what they want to the Local Appointments Commissioners and getting what they need without any undue delay.  The same applies to the inspectors.  With regard to the clerical and typing staff, it would be simple and cause no delay whatever to take those people from the lists available to the Civil Service Commission.  As is well known, when the Minister for Finance issues a notice regarding examinations for clerical officers and typists and says that there are, say, 30 posts, the number called up is very often increased to 40 or 50.  Those who are unsuccessful, however, include a very substantial number of persons who are absolutely first class.  There is no doubt that some of these could be taken and given positions under the tourist board, rather than some person who never competed before and whose competency is in doubt.  I feel that the objections which were made in Committee to the wider amendment do not apply to this one and I am confident, therefore, that the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  It is similar in intent to the amendment which was rejected in Committee. Underlying this amendment is the suspicion that the board to be appointed is going to act in an irresponsible manner.  I do not think it will.  I think that if we can get a board to which we can entrust the expenditure of large sums of money, we can trust it also to make appointments to posts under the board in such a way as to enable it to fulfil its work in a satisfactory manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made by the Senator who moved the amendment to a desire on my part to reserve the <Col N="701" /> posts available under this board for patronage, for particular appointments. The statement that we should allow university graduates a fair run, and the suggestion that the public should become aware of the names of the persons appointed&mdash;indicate the suspicion he has in his mind that this organisation is being created for some purpose other than that which appears on the face of the Bill.  We are setting up a business board, we are going to get businessmen on that board, and we propose to give them the same powers and authority in relation to its staff that any business concern would have.  I have no objection to the board's availing of the machinery of the Appointments Commission if they wish to do so, and if they consider that the efficiency and organisation of the board would be increased by doing so.  I have put in a section enabling them to do that and it is a section similar in form to that which appeared in a previous Bill in regard to a similar board.  I do not propose to accept an obligation to use that machinery and no other.  I think it would be unwise to do so.</P>
    <P>If the board consider the machinery suitable they can use it, but to put a statutory obligation on them to avail of that machinery would be unwise and would interfere with the efficiency of the organisation and possibly prevent it carrying out its duties properly.  It would probably prevent getting the right type of people for the board, because it would be a declaration in advance that we will not trust the board to do its work properly.  If we cannot get a board to take on this work and appoint its staff on the basis of merit, if we think that those whom we appoint are going to neglect their main work for the purpose of exercising patronage, then I think that we should drop the whole thing.  Because it is my belief that we can get a board of competent people who can be trusted to do this work properly, I think that this amendment should be rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister depresses one when he takes up the attitude which he has taken up on this amendment. <Col N="702" /> He makes the case, towards the end of his remarks, that if this amendment were inserted in the Bill he was going to be prevented from getting the right type of men to come on to the board.  Surely he does not argue that seriously.  If that were his argument, the Minister himself should not have taken the Ministerial post which he has, as he has to take the selection in staff passed on to him by the Civil Service Commission and he has no right to object.  He is expected to get the work done with that staff, which has been selected by the people whom he regards as not competent to select staff for a board which is subsidised by the State.  I do not think that argument can hold water.  The Minister should not seriously contend that the justification for the rejection of this amendment is that he might be prevented from getting the right type of board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate, the same class of person will be available to be drawn upon, to do the work of this board, by the members of the board if they are to make a selection or by the Appointments Commissioners.  The board when set up will not be able to go to a different type in order to make their selection; they will have to make it from those who would have been applicants for these posts under the Appointments Commissioners if they were making the selection.  It convinces one that the Minister takes up the line that he is setting up this board&mdash;which is going to be subsidised by the State to a very considerable extent, which is going to expend £600,000 initially and £45,000 a year on administration&mdash; and he is going to find money for that, and they are going to be put there to do the work in the way they will, or, perhaps, to a certain extent, in the way he wills.  One cannot argue that as suitable people will not be available through the Appointments Commissioners to do this work as would be available through the board making the selection themselves.  When I hear an argument like that, I feel&mdash;from my own experience in life&mdash;that the policy of the Government, as enunciated by the Minister perhaps more frequently than anything else, bears a very <Col N="703" /> striking resemblance to the philosophy of Herr Hitler in Germany.  The Nazi cry is &ldquo;Ein Reich, Ein Völk, Ein Fuhrer&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;One Parliament, One People, One Leader.&rdquo;  That to a very great extent seems to be the philosophy of the Government Party: they are the National Party and all ought to belong to it; those who do not are not National.  The Party, the State, and the Leader are one and the same thing, and we have to accept that point of view; unless we are prepared to accept that there is no place for us at all in the State.</P>
    <P>With all respect to the Minister's point of view, he would have very great difficulty in convincing me that, whatever the qualifications of my child for a post under this board, that child would stand an equal chance with the child of other people whom I will not mention.  I have very grave doubts, from my own experience, that the competence of the particular individual would be the determining factor.  All the citizens are equal before the Constitution.  They have equal rights, and so have their children. As taxpayers, they are making their contribution towards the common fund from which this board is going to be paid; but when it comes to giving service, or getting a chance to give service, to this board, in the judgment of quite a number of people, there will not be an equal chance for some as against others.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes' amendment simply asks that instead of this board being entrusted with what some people, even on the board, would regard as a rather invidious responsibility, the filling of these posts themselves, and the making of the selections in the way they must be made because of who they are, there should be another way which would be fairer and which would convince all the citizens that their children would have an equal chance.  That is what the amendment asks.  The Minister says that these people may do that, if they like.  If the Minister would say that they may do that, if they like, and that he would tell them to do it that way, it would <Col N="704" /> put a rather different complexion on the matter, but that is not going to happen.  With the experience we have had in the past, we know that people are treated differently because of the political views they hold, and for no other reason.  Competence, efficiency, good service or other qualifications which ought to be essential will not be weighed fairly.  I think the sooner we get rid of that atmosphere in this country, the better, and you cannot get rid of it until you demonstrate to the citizens, all and sundry, that they are all going to get a fair chance.</P>
    <P>There are many strong objections to the setting up of this board and to the spending of this money, but when it is decided to do it, at least it ought to be made possible for the citizens to have their hearts and souls in it, and to wish it well, that it should get a fair chance, that we should all know that it would be composed of the best people the Minister could get, regardless of political affiliations, either in the past or in the present, and, in addition, that, when it is set going, the best people available to staff and man that board would get a fair chance to present themselves and to get there by the fairest means possible. Whatever the Minister's views are, he will have very great difficulty in convincing a great number of people that he is not deliberately taking a line which will exclude a number of admirable people from the chance of a place on that board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who supported the principle of the Bill and who long since visualised the urgency for Government intervention if the development of Irish tourism was to march along progressive lines, the attitude which the Minister has taken up in regard to these appointments is inexplicable.  I can assure him perfectly honestly that this Bill and the appointments to be made are being watched with critical eyes throughout the country.  We have had very dangerous experiences with regard to the disbursement of public money for which the public had to pay. Here is a colossal sum of public money, £600,000, with an annual payment of £45,000, and we are told by the Minister <Col N="705" /> to-day that the personnel of the board whom he may, or shall, select will be above reproach.  Granted that they may, he must not forget that we know that these people are made of the same clay and subject to the same weaknesses and shortcomings as other people, with, in many cases, as we have had evidence in recent times, a particular political sympathy and outlook.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the Minister is in complete and direct opposition to an order issued by another Minister, which, I presume, was the considered opinion of the Government, and which was sent out to all public bodies. It was a carefully-though-out, documented matter which was binding upon every public body in the State, the terms of which were that all appointments made by them, under whatever head, from the smallest typist to the person in executive authority, must and could only be made after a severe and competitive test, giving everybody a fair and decent opportunity, irrespective of political affiliations and irrespective of social distinctions, so that the child of the worker, being gifted with the brains which God gave him, and being assisted by vocational and technical training, would have an equal opportunity to contest one of these positions with other children.  That was an order given to all public bodies under the authority of the Minister for Local Government.  It seems strange that to-day we have here a new departure. We have the disbursement of £600,000 of public moneys and the Minister says that these five or six white men will be so much above reproach and so immune from the weaknesses of human nature, and from the influence of political expediency, that they will override all the traits of human nature.  I totally disagree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of this House must know that the public distrust not alone of the Government but of all public institutions of democracy in this country is growing.  Notwithstanding all their clamour, the public look for efficiency in government, and some of them say there is only one way to secure that.  There are sinister <Col N="706" /> rumours abroad, some of them indubitably false, that appointments have been given to friends of Ministers and that from these appointments these friends are drawing stipends not from one but from many sources in the way of public funds.  In my opinion if there is nothing else that will defeat democracy, this will, and these things will inevitably lead this country to a form of government which will be a denial of social justice.  It will bring about a position which will be the very antithesis of democracy and which will establish here the sort of government that is termed by Mussolini, Demo-Plutocracy. I would appeal to the Minister to bear in mind that if this venture is to succeed he must enlist public confidence behind it.  Even on reading to-day's papers I see that an important public body in the South on which there were present ardent supporters and friends of the present Government, has severely criticised its action in giving £600,000 for the purpose of this Bill while denying even a pittance to the fundamental industry of this country&mdash;agriculture.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the Minister to that critical issue and I warn him that severe criticism will be forthcoming if the attitude he has adopted in the selection of the personnel of the staff, which is completely at variance with the policy enunciated by the Executive Council, is persisted in. I presume that the order issued by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health was the result of a well thought-out plan of the Executive Council.  Of course, I know the Minister will assume airs of omniscience and omnipotence, but he ought to remember that he is dealing with public money and not with his own money.  I warn Ministers that the provisions made by them for themselves in after years may not be paid by the form of government which may succeed the present Government&mdash;a form of government they are helping to create.  I appeal to the Minister to rise to the occasion and do his utmost to create the confidence that is essential if this industry is to be progressive and prosperous.  But if the <Col N="707" /> Minister adopts an attitude that is completely at variance with social justice and is at variance with giving every boy and girl to whom God has given brains and education, the right to compete for every position which is paid for out of Government funds, he is doing a bad day's work for democratic government in this country.  The Minister should not leave these appointments to the five white men who are going to be above the very laws of nature, above the past experience of every member of this House and against the experience of every public institution in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this amendment and I hope the Minister will not be swayed by any statement made by Senators in support of it.  I am sure the Minister will not believe what has been said by the last speaker.  If we were to accept that we should be getting ready at once to pack up and get out.  I refuse to believe that the country is in the position stated by the Senator.  I refuse to believe that there is distrust of public institutions in this country.  We have not got that far.  I believe the Senator has allowed himself to be unduly carried away by the remarks of Senator M. Hayes, though I do not want to pay Senator Hayes that compliment.  Senator Madden seems to have been completely swept away in connection with this amendment and indeed with the Bill in general.  The whole gist of the arguments used by Senator Hayes on every occasion when this Bill was under discussion was that a principle of political bosses was being set up by the Government, and that all their appointments would definitely be made on some basis of a political bedrock.</P>

      <P>If Senator Hayes is prepared to get up and apologise for what he said I would be prepared to accept his apology, but I am not sufficiently broadminded to accept his statement that because he did not use the exact words used by me just now that he did not make the statement to which I am objecting, but at all events that is how I interpreted his statement.  The Senator said there ought to be a fair run and no favour for anyone and that that is not going to be the case under this Bill.  I suggest that the first time people of this country got a fair run was since the present Government came into power.  This was the first time that the people of the country got a chance.  There was a fair chance given to everyone after the Fianna Fáil Government got into office.  Up to that no such rule existed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I again say that the first time the people of the country got a fair run and no favour was since Fianna Fáil got into power.  Since then there has been no preference because of any political colour.  The politics of applicants do not interfere with their appointments and politics will not influence appointments as long as this Government is in power. Senator Hayes said that the Minister had stated that this was a business concern.  That is no reason why appointments should not go to the Local Appointments Commissioners.  I refuse to believe that this country has gone to this pitch or that we have such a remnant of the old political bitterness which existed in the days when all public companies were run on the lines suggested by Senator Hayes.  I know several business concerns here in the city run by people diametrically opposed to the Government and in these concerns the first person you meet is a prominent supporter of the Government. There are numerous concerns here under the control of Fianna Fáil <Col N="709" /> supporters and when one walks inside the door the first person he meets is someone who is definitely and openly opposed to the Government.  I oppose the amendment because I believe there is in the Bill provision made for the board if they so desire it to apply to the Local Appointments Commissioners. That was already pointed out by the Minister and somebody tried to misinterpret what he said on that occasion.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter said that the Minister said he was not going to prevent the board from getting the right type of person.  What I understood the Minister to say was that for a certain type of person, the board would need to use its own discretion, but that generally the board would take advantage of the Appointments Commissioners. Anybody here who might imagine himself in the same position as a member of that board would follow the line of least resistance.  This board will be faced with thousands of applicants.  The members of the board will be no different from anybody else. I believe, however, that their hands should not be tied, and if they want a certain type of person the board will be the best judges of that.  They should have the right to select that certain type of person.  The Senator said, &ldquo;An ordinary business board deals with its own money, but the chairman of this board will be in no such position.&rdquo;  The chairman of this board will be no different from the managing director of several other businesses.  I can see no reasonable argument put forward in support of this amendment to which I am definitely opposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Committee Stage of this Bill the Minister made a very strong case for excluding members of the Dáil and Seanad from being members of the tourist board.  His attitude on this amendment when contrasted with his austerity and zeal on that question seems to me to be very peculiar and illogical.  The conclusion that comes from these two attitudes would seem to be that the Dáil and Seanad are unique sources of corruption in this country and that once you succeed in eliminating the possible <Col N="710" /> influence of the Dáil and Seanad you have then made the board so impartial and watertight in its attitude that it comes second only to the Executive of the Fianna Fáil Party, which, according to Senator Quirke, is the most ethical body in existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's whole attitude on this matter is really rather extraordinary.  I could understand it if he had not been so adamant on the question of membership of the Dáil and Seanad on the Committee Stage but, when he goes to such lengths to exclude members of the Dáil and Seanad from membership of the board, I fail to see why he should not take a further step and make it mandatory on the board to make these appointments in these special cases&mdash;appointments of an administrative, inspectorial or clerical character&mdash;through the body which exists for the purpose of being used in the making of such appointments. Not only county councils but county managers and city managers that are appointed all over the country&mdash;men chosen in an impartial way for their excellent character, administrative experience and administrative ability&mdash; are prohibited from making appointments of this kind except through the Local Appointments Commission.  The more you have of these boards of a <Col N="711" /> semi-Civil Service character, expending a great amount of money and playing a considerable part in the life of the country, the more necessary it seems to me to be, for the sake of the members of the board themselves as well as for the sake of the service, to make sure that not merely will they make these appointments in the fairest possible way, but that all danger of suspicion falling on their actions or motives will be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As everybody knows, there has been a considerable amount of canvassing in connection with this board and in connection with the positions under it.  I have heard at some time that the corridors of Leinster House were thronged with prospective candidates for the various positions under this board from the highest to the lowest. That being so, it is quite evident that these appointments have been widely discussed up and down the country. There can be no doubt about it, in spite of Senator Quirke's denials, whether we like it or not, whatever our opinions about the whole policy underlying this Bill may be, there will be suspicions and allegations of favouritism, not necessarily always political favouritism but personal favouritism, personal pull of one kind or another. Allegations of that kind are more likely to be made in connection with any this board than in connection with any other board which the Minister or the Government has set up in recent times. The whole matter has been surrounded by an atmosphere of that kind, not, I can well believe, through any fault of the Minister, but inevitably there has been a tendency to believe that here is a vast prospect of new jobs for all kinds of people whether they are qualified or not.  In justice to the future members of the board, certainly in its earlier years, I think it would be a very good thing if Senator Hayes' amendment were accepted.  I do not desire to discuss another aspect of the question which has been mentioned, but I think there is a great deal to be said for the point to which Senator Hayes referred, that something should be done to ensure that our own educated people, on whom we are <Col N="712" /> spending a great deal of money, should be afforded a chance of employment under bodies like this and that there should be no possibility left open that they might be deprived of their rights or of a fair chance of employment in cases like this.</P>
    <P>The reason that seems to be operating in the Minister's mind is that in all these matters there should be an analogy between this Bill and the Electricity Supply Bill.  To my mind that is a most unfortunate analogy and it is a great pity that the vision of the Electricity Supply Board was floating before the Minister's mind at all in connection with this matter because there could be hardly any two enterprises so different in character as this enterprise and the Electricity Supply enterprise. The officials of this board will not require special qualifications, but they will require a high degree of education, of taste, judgment and administrative capacity.  They will not require that technical knowledge or training that had to be part of the equipment of persons seeking positions under the Electricity Supply Board.  This amendment affords a method of securing for these posts officials of the highest standards of education, and it is for that reason I support it.</P>

      <P>I do not understand Senator Quirke's attitude in regard to this Bill.  The words of this amendment, to my mind, do not imply any particular suspicion, but in our system of government we went to great expense and took considerable precautions, not necessarily to prevent corruption or jobbery, but to assure the public that nothing of the sort could arise.  You have the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee to watch expenditure and to see that no money is expended except for the purpose, and according to the forms set out when it is voted.  I remember when I was Minister for Defence in the previous Government somebody would come to me and say that a certain person was offering what seemed a very big sum for something like an army hut and that if it were put up for auction we would not have a chance of getting <Col N="713" /> that price for it.  I said that everything offered for sale in that way must be put up for auction, that even if we were not to get £1 for something for which we had been offered £50 before, at least the public would know that the thing was being fairly run.  The whole Government machinery is arranged so that the public, through the Dáil and other institutions, will be able to see that their money is being spent exactly for the proper purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are cases when such a body as the Public Appointments Commission might not be a very apt means of filling an appointment.  There are occasions when it might be desirable to go outside this country to get a person for a certain post, but here in this amendment there are definite categories of possible employees named. Senator Quirke seemed to think that the whole point of the amendment was to see that political preference does not enter into these appointments and he talked about business houses.  The ordinary business man wants to see the work of his business carried on properly and I think it would be perfectly ridiculous to imagine that he would be influenced in his appointments by the political opinions of applicants for employment.  If I were running a business house, I would not care whether an employee of mine were Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil so long as he attended to his work, but I think if the Senator will go into a business place, he will find that a distinguished employee in the firm might be the owner's nephew or the owner's son.  It is perfectly right, of course, that he should give a preference in the chief appointment to his own family.  With regard to the Shannon Bill, it was arranged that the enterprise should pay interest and sinking fund charges on the capital which was advanced to it by the State.  In the case of this board, it is a question mostly of spending. Nobody can demand the production of the balance sheets of this board to see what is being spent and that an adequate return is being given for it.  Nevertheless, as I said on an earlier stage, the action of the board is due to be criticised as it is financed out of public funds that have to be <Col N="714" /> voted.  It is going to be criticised by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of canvassing, the first advertence that I had to this Bill was meeting a man in this House and I said to him, in an attempt at heavy humour: &ldquo;What are you doing in this haunt of iniquity?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;An awful job&mdash;canvassing.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;What are you canvassing for?&rdquo;&mdash;because I had not then realised that these jobs were going to be filled by the board.  He said: &ldquo;I am canvassing for a position on the board under the new Tourist Bill.&rdquo; That is a fact and, if the Minister likes, I can give him the name.  I think he either was hoping to be, or actually was, a Fianna Fáil candidate in an election.  I am not going to say that everybody who gets a job under this board will be appointed for his politics, but I do say that when we set up the Civil Service Board and the Public Appointments Board it was not entirely from high moral motives on our part; it was in the interests of efficiency.  When you are a Minister, or an ex-Minister, and your post is mostly from people who want jobs, or want loans of money, and so on, there is a certain pressure brought to bear on you.  If a man who was in gaol with you, and had seven children, tells you he has not had work for the last year, it is very hard to say to him: &ldquo;I do not regard you as absolutely the best man for this job. Get out.&rdquo; It is a protection to Ministers to be able to assure everybody who comes to them that they have no power whatever in the matter.</P>
    <P>If I may digress, I remember getting a letter from a well-known man in Cork, saying he understood there was going to be a vacancy for a typist in my office.  I had never heard of it.  I asked my secretary, and he had never heard of it; nobody had heard of it.  It turned out that a typist in the office was going to get married, and the rumour had already got down to Cork.  A Minister who has been in office for some time, and has a sense of responsibility, does, you might say, harden himself, his life is so much made up of telling people they cannot get what they want him <Col N="715" /> to give.  But here you are bringing in a new body, a board&mdash;all their personal friends may be strong supporters of Fine Gael&mdash;and they are going to have no protection whatever in regard to the giving of jobs.  It is not their money that is being spent. It is public money, voted by the Dáil. The public who are providing that money have the right, to some extent at any rate, to have a fair assurance that there is a machine so operating that those appointments will be made according to the suitability of the people for the posts available, and that no unworthy consideration is going to be brought in.  As I said earlier, a tremendous lot of the machinery of government is really for the purpose of letting the public know that if anything of an untoward nature is being done it is possible for it to be brought into the light.</P>
    <P>The amendment refers to three types of appointments&mdash;those of an administrative, inspectorial or clerical character.  The appointments board we already have are in the habit of considering just such appointments.  We are now going to have the Minister appointing certain people.  I have referred to the man who was here canvassing&mdash;presumably canvassing the Minister and the Minister's colleagues &mdash;to get a job on the board, and a newspaper in the constituency I used to represent has definitely given the name of a man proposed to the position of chairman of this board, although the law has not yet sanctioned such a board at all.  Personally, I cannot suggest anything better than the Minister himself appointing the board, but when it comes to the board operating in regard to those comparatively subordinate appointments it does seem to me that the public, who were going to pay are entitled to some assurance. The man who is giving the jobs will not feel that a certain profit has to be made, as in the case of an ordinary business.  He can almost create jobs. I do not say he is going to do it.  All the amendment asks is that the ordinary type of machinery which applies to Government expenditure shall, in a very mild way, apply here. <Col N="716" /> This is not nearly as drastic and does not indicate nearly as much suspicion of the unworthy humanity in the country as the existence of the Public Accounts Committee.</P>

      <P>I only wish to say one word with reference to Senator Quirke's remarks about the practice in commercial companies.  It is characteristic of Senator Quirke that when he intervenes he rather spoils his own case instead of improving it.  If he had made further inquiries he would have found that most of the commercial concerns of any size make their appointments by public examination, and by special interview for the candidates. They do not simply go out and appoint people without any preliminary test.</P>

      <P>Tá sean-fhocal ann &ldquo;Annlann don ghé isé annlann don ghandail.&rdquo; I hope the Minister will not accept this amendment.  We all have sufficiently long memories to remember the days when the forerunner of Fine Gael was in office, that is Cumann na nGaedheal.  We remember the liberality with which they treated their opponents in regard to any position that was going.  We remember when the Dublin Commissioners were in power nobody would even get a job sweeping the streets if he were not a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  They come in here now telling us how sincere and anxious they are in the interests of fair play.  In my opinion, the present Government are acting too liberally with the opposite side.  If they followed the example of the Opposition they certainly would not have acted at all as liberally. Take, for example, the position of Vice-Chairman of this House.  The Government could have elected anyone they liked&mdash;anyone of their own Party. It is very hard to have to sit here and listen to the Opposition making statements of the kind which we have heard.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to discuss the merits of the amendment at all.  I will confine myself to answering some of the remarks made by other speakers.  It is very pleasant to hear, even at this stage, the genuine faith <Col N="717" /> which our friends on the left have in the impartiality of the Local Appointments Commission.  Here in this House, of course, there is no such institution as a political Party, but, in the case of appointments by the Appointments Commissioners down the country, if a known supporter of the Government happens to be chosen that appointment is invariably decried by the Opposition political Party, who say that the Appointments Commissioners are under the influence of the Government. On the other hand, if a supporter of the Opposition is appointed, it may be said by the Fianna Fáil Party that the Appointments Commission still consists of most of the old crowd.</P>
      <P>Examinations in themselves are no criterion of suitability for the appointments to be made by this board.  You will find people who can pass examinations to beat the band, professors who can talk to the moon, but there are many of us who would not accept the statement that their judgment or their energy is any better than that of most of us who never pass an examination. For the business to be done under the institution about to be formed, the people who should be appointed are those of character and experience, those who are most likely to fill the posts efficiently, and not necessarily those who pass the highest tests at an examination.</P>

I am not interested either in the board or in any appointment they are likely to make.  I am pleased to say that I have not been canvassed, by anybody to use my influence.  I am sure that canvassing is not much good where the Minister is concerned, because I have known him to be canvassed on several occasions before, with very bad results.</P>

      <P>I approach this amendment with an open mind and I find myself in the curious situation that a number of speeches made in favour of the amendment have made me inclined to vote against it, and that a number of speeches made against the amendment have made me inclined to vote in favour of it.  But, after consideration to the best of my ability, I have come to the conclusion that the amendment is, on the whole, a bad one.  Had it been confined to clerical positions, I think it would have been satisfactory; but I think it goes too far in seeking to compel the board to make use of the Appointments Commission for all administrative and inspectorial situations.  Some such situations would be of very considerable importance in the board's work.  I cannot accept the view of Senator Tierney that all that is required of people to do the work satisfactorily would be a good general education or even ordinary general intelligence. It seems to me that as in the case of the Electricity Supply Board, technical skill will be required, perhaps not quite as technical as for the Electricity Supply Board, but still special experience in this sort of business will be highly desirable and it would be a great mistake if the appointments were to be filled on the principle that anyone of ordinarily good education and ordinarily good mind could fill the positions.  Senator <Col N="719" /> Fitzgerald himself has alluded to the possibility of importing people from abroad to fill some of these positions.</P>

      <P>My impression, right or wrong, is that it would not, and that those who seek to guard whatever may be the appointing authority against criticism on the ground of the appointments made are trying to do something which is impossible.  There always will be criticism.  There has been plenty of criticism of appointments made, as Senator Honan pointed out, and appointments made even by the Appointments Commission, and criticism of the kind that implies favouritism, dishonesty and so-forth. Disappointed candidates and the friends of disappointed candidates will always say such things.  If we feel that this board is going to be so untrustworthy that we cannot give it the right to appoint persons to important positions under it, I do not think we ought to set up the board at all.  We do provide it under the Bill with the power of making use of the Appointments Commission when it wants to. It seems to me that is a reasonably satisfactory solution of the question.</P>

      <P>It has been stated here that the Government are always inclined to favour the members of their own organisation.  I wish to point out that the Government some short time ago had the nomination of 11 Senators. If we look up the matter we will find that a number were nominated who were certainly not in favour of the Government, and to my mind&mdash;I do not want to be personal&mdash;were not very favourable to Irish aspirations.  That does not show that the Government were keeping positions for their own friends or for the men who support their organisation.  The Government set <Col N="720" /> up a Banking Commission on somewhat similar lines.  Then we come to the Agricultural Commission which was set up to deal with the question of agriculture.  We had Senators speaking this evening about the criticism in the country on account of the members appointed to commissions of this kind. I certainly say that the criticism is entirely against the Government, because people feel that certain members put on commissions are totally against the Government.</P>

      <P>Senators stated that people in the country were criticising the Government because they give posts to members and supporters of Fianna Fáil Clubs.  I say that that is not true; that the Government are prepared to take a liberal view of the position in this country and to give everybody the right to sit on public boards and to administer the affairs of the country honestly.  This amendment is criticised by certain members of the House, on the ground that the Government have the right to make the appointments, and that the people to be appointed belong to Fianna Fáil Clubs.  That is not true.  The Government is justified in their attitude in connection with this Bill, and if the matter is left in their hands, people will be appointed who will be able to do the necessary work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose there is very little use in discussing this matter, as the Minister has indicated that he is <Col N="721" /> not prepared to accept the amendment. However, I may be allowed to offer a few arguments in favour of it.  It is toned down considerably compared with the amendment dealt with on the Committee Stage.  The Minister's argument then was that this was a business concern and that the appointments to be made were not of the same nature as appointments made in other institutions. He instanced the hotel &ldquo;boots,&rdquo; chefs, and people of that description. It appears to me that such appointments do not come under this amendment, and that it is considerably limited as to the posts to which it should apply.  I am not at all in agreement with Senator MacDermot, that it would be like passing a vote of want of confidence in the board if the Appointments Commissioners were asked to make appointments.  If one were to argue on that basis, one might say that the fact that the Act setting up the Appointments Commissioners went through the Oireachtas showed want of confidence in public bodies. Surely that argument cannot stand examination.  Now we have it from official sources that the Civil Service is not a business institution and that public bodies are not public institutions. I should like the Minister to indicate the difference between getting a good typist for a county council or an urban council and getting a good typist for this board.  What is the difference between getting a good accountant or an inspector for a public body and getting a good accountant or a good inspector for this board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand what the Minister meant by a reference to tying his hands with respect to this board.  I am not prepared to go to the extreme length with some people, who say that we are going to have absolute favouritism in these appointments.  I do not know who will be on the board, but I do not believe it will be an absolute refuge of sinners for Fianna Fáil people who have fallen out of other positions. There is no evidence that that will be the case.  The fact is that if they had to be put into positions there would be a charge of endeavouring to make jobs for friends.  Senator Healy said that Fine Gael filled every post with <Col N="722" /> its friends.  Surely his Party would not follow that bad example.</P>

      <P>Surely the Senator's Party would not follow that bad example.  It has followed in the steps of Fine Gael so often, and has slipped so often where Fine Gael slipped, that they should not fall where Fine Gael fell.  As to business concerns filling positions in their gift by competitive examination, I wonder if the Minister could say if the railways are business concerns, and if they fill positions by competitive examinations.  The Minister has some acquaintance with the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and, if I am not mistaken, I have seen advertisements on several occasions indicating that positions were filled by competitive examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is of sufficient importance to justify spending some time discussing, even though we may not have much hope that the Minister will change his mind.  He does not often change his mind in these matters.  I find myself in agreement <Col N="723" /> with Senator MacDermot in one respect, when he thinks that there will be criticism of the appointments, no matter how they are made.  Beyond that, I totally disagree with the attitude the Senator took up towards the amendment.  He said that if we had not got confidence in the board, why have a board at all?  You might as well say that if you had not sufficient confidence in the Government to enable them to appoint civil servants, why have a Government at all.  You might equally say that a Government that brought in proposals for the appointment of a board had no confidence in itself.  Much of the discussion as to the relative impartiality of political parties has very little to do with the matter.  The question is: what is the best method that we can so far devise for making appointments?  No Party and no Government has devised a perfectly sound method.  As far as I know, no business has devised a sound method.  The practice, particularly in larger concerns, is more and more to seek methods by which there will be an element of competition, and to reduce appointments made simply by personal choice to the minimum.  I think it is a wise step on the part of the State to adopt that with regard to the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was exceedingly doubtful about the amendment proposed on the Committee Stage.  I was impressed by the argument of the Minister that there were certain appointments under the board that conceivably could not be dealt with by the Appointments Commissioners. The amendment before the House now definitely limits it to the kind of people that the Minister rather favoured the board should appoint through the commissioners, even though he does not favour compelling the board to have that done. In the Civil Service you have an administrative class, inspectors and clerical employees, all chosen in this manner, and I cannot see why these appointments could not be chosen in the same way.  I believe the time will come, before very long, when both political Parties, instead of comparing their relative merits or demerits, will <Col N="724" /> set out to find the best method of making appointments, and to remove, as far as possible, Party considerations no matter what Government is in power.  I suggest that, while this is by no means an infallible way, it is the best way so far and should be extended.  There is an impression, judging by the speeches of some Senators, that if the amendment is passed the board will have no say in the choice of personnel.  I am satisfied that is not the case. They can have a representative on the Appointments Commission when the appointments are being made.  They can consult or make suggestions with regard to particular types that might be required for certain hotels, such as bringing in a foreigner.  They are not obliged to keep anyone appointed.  They can sack them if they are unsuitable.  It is not a question of a Department as in the Civil Service or that the tourist board will be out of touch when appointments are made, or of having unsuitable people pushed on to them.  If the appointments system is not as good as we would wish, let us concentrate on making it better, and not scrap it by going back to the other method.  For that reason I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to support the amendment.  I supported a similar amendment on the Committee Stage. I think it necessary to say that I am supporting this amendment because Senator Hayes, when the previous amendment was defeated last week, thought fit to make some remarks that I think he should not have made.  He said that it was the Minister's intention to appoint hangers-on of his Party. I do not believe that at all.  If Fianna Fáil partisans are selected for membership of the board I believe they will not be selected on that account.  I believe the Minister will have some advertence to the fact that these men, if he does select such, will be qualified to fill the positions he wishes them to occupy on that board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am voting for the amendment because I believe in the principle of appointments to these boards being made by the Appointments Commissioners and for no other reason.  Hearing <Col N="725" /> Senators on this side speaking, one would imagine that they were the only pure-souled politicians actuated by high moral principles.  When they were in office I do not think they were too backward in making appointments solely on political grounds.  The only people who suffer in that respect are the group of people to which I belong and which, so far as one can see, never can hope to obtain power in this country.  It is the only group one needs some degree of virtue to be a member of.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane has stated that the big companies make their appointments by examination.  I wonder is that true?  I should imagine some of the big appointments on the boards he would be connected with would be made by reason of membership of a house across the road, our next door neighbours.  I think that is what would actuate them.  The Senator says that all the big companies make their appointments by examination. I am sure that he is referring only to the minor positions.</P>

They may be satisfied that they are fooling themselves, but they are not fooling the people as a whole I intend to vote for the amendment, but I do not believe all the things Senator Hayes alleges against the Minister.  I do not think those things he spoke of are going to happen when the Minister comes to appoint the members of the board.</P>

      <P>I am a woman first and a Party politician afterwards and, if I speak as a Party politician, I do not at the same time lay aside the sense of reality and common-sense which is my purpose as a woman.  Speaking as a Party politician, I can imagine nothing more disastrous to the Party to which I used to belong&mdash;I am not political now, but I was born out of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;I could imagine nothing more disastrous to its prestige, or to the prestige of the Minister, than to choose persons for their Party history. I think the Minister is a very up-to-date, go-ahead Minister and he likes to make a success of any job he takes in hands.  He will see that he will have to get a thundering good board to make a success of the big job he has taken in hands.  Therefore, I think the personnel of the board he selects will have special qualifications. To my mind the most important of these qualifications is to be able to pick out a staff in all departments capable of making a huge success of the job they have undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards a knowledge of people's qualifications and the kind of work that has to be done and the kind of people that they will seek to do that work, every member of the board must possess that knowledge in a pre-eminent manner.  If not, they will not make a <Col N="727" /> success of their work.  That work demands a tremendous knowledge of the country, of its needs and the material that is likely to make a success of the thing.  I deduce from that that the board itself&mdash;I have no idea who they are going to be, but knowing the Minister, I am sure the selection will be a good one&mdash;will be a much better judge of the sort of people they need to make a success of the job than any Appointments Commissioners.  At the same time, they may like to have the help of the Appointments Commissioners and so far as I know they will have that.  I do not think it would be wise to bind them too much and we should give them a fair chance.  We all hope that this will be a tremendous success and that it will benefit the country. We hope that the money we are going to spend will give large returns to the country.  It would be much better to give the board a chance of making their own selections, if they think fit to do so.</P>

      <P>Much can be said in favour of the argument advanced by Senator Mrs. Concannon.  In regard to the other arguments, I do not think they carry much conviction. Senator Hayes made a very good case for the acceptance of this amendment, a remarkably good case.  I have seldom heard him making a better case than he did for the acceptance of this amendment.  I quite realise the selection of a board of management of such an institution as the Minister is setting up is a very difficult undertaking. I quite see that there may be difficulties in appealing to the Appointments Commissioners in the case of every appointment.  I should say that the administrative work would be a matter that would present considerable difficulty.  I expect that difficulties will present themselves in the making of appointments.  At the same time, the Minister has in his hands the nomination of the members of the panel and it is within the compass of his power to put on that Appointments Commission men well able to form a judgment on the soundness of an application for a position <Col N="728" /> under this board.  I am sure they would be equally competent to do that as the members of any other organisation.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Appointments Commissioners for whom the Government have fought so hard throughout the country will take every opportunity of informing themselves of the qualifications of the candidates who apply for important positions.  I should say that no Appointments Commissioners would in a case of this kind make any appointment without due consultation with the board which the Minister sets up.  They would be in a position to call the members of that board before them and ask them the necessary questions so as to produce for them the information that is necessary to guide them in making an appointment.  It would be almost fatal to the progress of the project if the Appointments Commissioners, entirely apart from this board, took it into their hands to make such appointments.  I am sure they will do nothing of the kind, seeing that the Minister has power to appoint very competent men for that purpose on the Appointments Commission and I do not think there is any danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the principle of the Appointments Commissioners should be preserved.  It would seem that the attitude of the Government in this case would appear to be a vote of censure and a lack of confidence in the work of the Appointments Commissioners.  If that is so, you should repeal the Act setting up the commission and let each Department be free to choose its own personnel.  The principle, however, should be maintained, if it were only for the one purpose, and that is the purpose of giving the country confidence that there is no political bias, no political prejudice, or no political favouritism exercised in making these appointments.  I do not suggest for a moment that that will be the case, because I believe that any board that will be set up will appoint the most competent of the men who come before them, but I do say that the Government, in their own interests as well as in the interests of democratic rule, <Col N="729" /> should maintain this principle of using the Appointments Commission in connection with these positions, and the Appointments Commission, when it comes to the question of making an <Col N="730" /> appointment, can take into consultation the members of the board.  I wish to say that I am in support of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, to add at the end of Section 11 the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6)  Before making an appointment of an administrative inspectorial or clerical character the board shall issue a public advertisement inviting applications for the post and setting forth&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the qualifications required for the post;</P>
      <P>(b)  The remuneration and conditions of employment for such post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment provides that before making an appointment of an administrative, inspectorial or clerical character the board shall advertise the post setting out the qualifications, salary and terms of employment and proceed to fill it upon the applications received.  I feel that that is nothing else but fair and good public policy. No suspicion of any board is implied if you say to them, you are dealing with public money and you must give all the people in the country who have the kind of qualifications that you want a fair do and fair play for the post. It was suggested at one time that the board had a number of appointments which could not possibly be made on any other than a personal basis.  We heard to-day from the Minister that he is not prepared to consider any kind of compromise.  He is not prepared to consider anything except that the board shall make the appointments on its own lines and in its own way.  Apart altogether from politics, and apart altogether from political pull and influence, it is objectionable in this particular instance or any similar instance that an appointment should be made on a personal basis.  I would be entirely opposed to a person getting an appointment in this board, even if he were exactly of my politics, if he got it&mdash;as can easily happen in this country&mdash;because the chairman of the board was a relation of his or because he had business connections with the chairman.  In other words, <Col N="731" /> the appointments made by this board, which will be remunerated out of public money, should be on neither a personal nor a political basis.  They should be on the basis that everybody gets a fair chance to have his merits recognised.</P>
    <P>I see no reason whatever why in the case of ordinary clerical or administrative appointments it should not be done by the machinery of advertisement and examination.  What is suggested in this amendment would, I think, be more expensive than what was previously suggested because the board would have to make its own arrangements, but, I think, if this procedure is not followed, even putting it at its very best and eliminating all question of political suspicion, what will happen is that those who are known to members of the board will get a post.  For example, a girl who has failed to get into the Civil Service, as you can even though you get 75 per cent. of the marks in the examination, might not get a post in this board, but a girl who was far down the list who got only 25 per cent. of the marks might get the post for personal reasons.  That, to my mind, is a mistake.  We all know that the board will proceed to appoint people in the beginning on a temporary basis.  If they are going to be appointed on a temporary basis that is no argument for not having an advertisement and a competition because nobody needs to be told that those who go in this year, let us say, on a temporary basis will stay and will eventually become permanent and pensionable. Whether they are hangers-on of Fianna Fáil or not, they will remain and will become permanent and pensionable. Therefore, I suggest that no argument at all has been given for leaving this board completely in charge of every possible kind of appointment. As has been suggested here already, great public corporations have endeavoured to dissociate themselves from appointments of nearly every character except the very highest.  All we are asking here is that this board, since it deals with public money, should advertise when it requires candidates <Col N="732" /> and that its appointments should be made in the light of day, that we should know who are the competitors and who are the successful candidates and that there is no suspicion on the board or anybody.</P>
    <P>We are spending, as I said before, a great deal of money on education, giving scholarships to secondary schools and universities and I would like to see the position where a boy or a girl, a man or a woman who had the necessary qualifications should have the same chance of getting the post as a person, let us say, living in Dublin, near the members of the board, or living in Cork, near a member of the board, or living anywhere you like, near a member of the board.  Therefore, I press this amendment.  I do not want to waste any further time on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this amendment principally because, as far as I can see, it could not serve any useful purpose. The amendment suggests that before making an appointment of an administrative, inspectorial or clerical character, the board shall issue a public advertisement inviting applications for the post and setting forth (a) the qualifications required for the post and (b) the remuneration and conditions of employment for such post.  If we are to believe all we were told here to-day, there is no scarcity of applications; we have been told that the board has been canvassed already before they are established at all; but it is quite obvious that if they need people to fill any particular kind of post they will, in the ordinary way, advertise and fill the appointment by somebody suitable for the job.  At the present time they would possibly promote somebody from one position to another and, therefore, they would not need to appoint new officers.  It is a great pity that Senator Hayes insists on this sort of political speech.</P>

We are quite prepared to get away from that and eliminate all this political bitterness, and as far as we possibly can, we will do so.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce more than any other Minister in the Government has done that.  I can say that.  I can see no advantage whatever in insisting on this amendment.</P>

      <P>These things do not happen and there is no necessity for taking all the precautions that are suggested should be taken.  The whole purpose behind it is to prevent any possibility of anybody who would be slightly tainted with politics of a particular kind from becoming a servant of the board.  I do not believe that there is the slightest danger.  In fact, I would like, if I could, to create the feeling down the country, that it was giving a chance to Fianna Fáil supporters to get jobs.  But the fact of the matter is that the people down the country know perfectly well that the administration under this will be the same as the administration of everything else that the Government are responsible for&mdash;that is to say, that it will be on the fairest possible basis. At the same time, I say that there should be no regulations to exclude a person because he happened to be a supporter of the Government.</P>

      <P>Senator Quirke can sometimes make a contribution to a debate that has some meat in it, but the speech he has just delivered was really the weakest that I have ever heard him make in the House.  His attempt to defend the attitude of the Government with regard to this was really very weak, very halting and most unconvincing.  I am satisfied, having listened to the Senator, that he did not even convince himself, and when a speaker fails to do that he naturally fails to convince his hearers. The Senator, so far as I could understand him, took the line that he wanted us to believe that the Minister is going to be so impartial in his appointments to this board that, in the case of appointments to be made under it, everyone is going to get a fair run for any posts that are vacant.  Let us <Col N="735" /> take, for example, the nominees of the Minister on many of the existing boards.  If some member of the House opposite will get up and tell us that they are not supporters of the Government, then we will have some evidence that what Senator Quirke says in regard to the tourist development board is likely to happen.  I do not think that I need go any further into that.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Industrial Alcohol Board, it may be, because of the fact that it was such a futile effort from the beginning, that the Minister could not get supporters of his own to go on that board.  Certainly, no supporters of ours would go on it.  Senator Quirke is a member of the board of an institution that has already been referred to.  He is on the board of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I was his predecessor on the board, and during my time all vacant posts under it were advertised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But there was nothing in the Act to say that they should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but you had fair men on the board.  At any rate, every vacant post was advertised.  I do not know what is happening now.  Presumably, the same thing is happening, but I am simply telling what was the procedure and practice in my time.  It was considered fair by the members of the board that everybody should be given an opportunity of applying for positions when they became vacant.  Most of the members of the board were not politicians <Col N="736" /> at all.  They were nominated, but they were not politicians.  We need not go into the case of the man who got the highest post on the directorate, but, anyhow, if he was being taken on his politics and connections, another decision might have been made from the beginning.  What was the practice there is all that Senator Hayes is asking should be done in the case of appointments under the tourist board.</P>
      <P>Now, there is no smoke without fire, but the Minister's line is that he does not care; that he does not mind what the people think.  He does not mind whether they are convinced or not; it is quite immaterial to him what the people say about those boards.  That kind of thing can go on for a while, but, as Senator Madden has very well pointed out, men in public positions cannot go on disregarding public opinion in that fashion.  I would remind the Minister that in taking up that attitude he will not even satisfy all his own supporters.  You will have thousands of them out through the country saying that they were just as well qualified for the posts to be filled as those who got them.  The only way to give satisfaction is to advertise those posts and leave them open for public competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about jobs.  There is nothing discreditable in looking for a job.  I think it is a commendable and a worthy thing.  Boys and girls have got to live, and if positions are vacant in the country then, obviously, you are going to have many applicants for every vacancy that arises.  When, however, you have 100 applicants for every vacant post, it is obvious that you cannot satisfy all the applicants. The situation in the country is such that we cannot employ all the people who are looking for employment.  In view of that situation it is surely not too much to ask that when appointments under boards such as this are to be filled, an open competition should be held.  Senator Quirke spoke of promotions that will be made by the board.  My answer is that all these posts ought to be open to the public. It is only in that way that satisfaction <Col N="737" /> can be given all round.  It is better, I say, that the board should not start out under the shadow that it is only certain people will get appointments under it.  If that feeling gets abroad, and if, later, posts should be advertised, people who think they are competent will not apply for them, because they will have the feeling that there is no use in applying.  They will feel that they would not get a fair crack of the whip, so that if an advertisement is issued they will not send in an application.  I know that may be done but, on the other hand, it may not be done.  At any rate, what would the point be in issuing an advertisement saying that you proposed to fill five out of, say, 25 or 30 appointments?</P>
    <P>I am not arguing this just for the sake of argument.  I am arguing it because I believe in it, and because I have had personal experience in the past that merit, service, record and all the rest is not a consideration when the filling of posts is in the hands of the Government.  If we are ever to get away from that we ought to do it now. Personally, I would like to see the House and the country getting away from it quickly.  Until we do, we cannot put our minds to doing the really constructive things that need to be done.  You cannot get anywhere unless the people feel that things are being done on a basis of justice and equity as far as the staffing of these institutions is concerned, thereby ensuring that the best boys and girls will get whatever posts are available quite regardless of their political affiliations.</P>

      <P>It was not put into the Electricity Supply Act because the members of the Seanad, having a certain amount of responsibility and anxious to get a job done, set out to do it without regard to the absurd principles which are now being advanced here for the amendment of this Bill.  The arguments that have been put forward have no meaning whatever.  A provision of this kind was not considered necessary when the Electricity Supply Act was being framed.  Senator Hayes, who is much cleverer in the art of innuendo than most other members of the House, tries to create an atmosphere of suspicion without making definite charges. Senator Baxter is much more crude and lacks Senator Hayes's skill.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter put the case which is in Senator Hayes's mind, although Senator Hayes was careful enough not to say it.  This Government is corrupt: it will always take every opportunity that offers to it of appointing its own political hangers-on to any post in its control.  That is its natural form.  They cannot be trusted to appoint this board, or, if they are to appoint this board it will be as corrupt as themselves.  That is Senator Baxter's argument.  Senator Baxter wants us to come in, in sackcloth and ashes, admitting our past sins and promising not to sin in the future, and even then we are not to be trusted not to sin in the future, but there must be an amendment put down to make sure of it.  That is the purpose of his amendment.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes was annoyed that his amendment on the Committee Stage was defeated.  He has decided that the poor man's son was to be given no chance.</P>

      <P>His annoyance takes the form set out in this amendment, which is of no practical use whatever. The sole idea behind it is to draw an admission from the Government that they have sinned in the past and a promise that they will not sin any more.  What value is there in such an amendment?  If this board appointed a clerical officer so stupid as to draft an amendment as impracticable and incomplete as this one, I can say he would be open to criticism.  The board must advertise every post.  What happens if they do not?  Put that in the Bill and what difference does it make. They can say: &ldquo;It is only Senator Hayes's little joke; forget about it.&rdquo; What happens then?  Nothing happens. His amendment is incomplete and it would be only a waste of printer's ink to put anything like that into the Bill.  But, even if you do get it in, what is the advantage of having a statutory obligation placed on the board?  They advertise, they get applications: they can ignore them, and there is nothing in the amendment to say that they must even consider them. Yet it is sought to put all this in because Senator Hayes chooses to be suspicious about the manner in which the board will be appointed and the manner in which it will exercise its functions.  If this board is to be given very wide powers in relation to an important industry in the country, if it is to be entrusted with £600,000 as a capital sum and £45,000 annually out of public money, is it not to be trusted to carry out its ordinary routine and to devise a satisfactory manner of recruiting staff without having a statutory obligation placed upon it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane has said that the banks are able to appoint their staffs through competitive examinations.  What is the extent to which that is true?  An examination is held for the purpose of securing staff for the lower grades in the service of the various banks, but after appointment promotion is made on <Col N="740" /> merit.  This amendment would prevent that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing of any value in it at all.  It does involve this: if the board do what they would have to do under this amendment and recruit their staffs through a competitive examination, they cannot proceed to promote any of them without declaring that there is a vacant post and inviting applications from the whole country from persons who want to fill that post.  Does any member of the Seanad who has given a moment's thought to the administrative problem that this board has to face so that they can function properly think that this board can be tied down with ridiculous and stupid regulations of that kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This board&mdash;like the Industrial Credit Board, the Agricultural Credit Board and any other board of which Senator Baxter may have experience &mdash;will, in the ordinary course of events, advertise their vacancies.  I cannot recollect any case of a board established by the present Government or by the previous Government recruiting staff of the ordinary class &mdash;that is staff not requiring very special qualifications&mdash;or any Government Department recruiting temporary staff that did not do it through the medium of advertisement and by public applications such as are suggested here.  It may be a good method by which to get staff for this tourist board and it is probably the method they will adopt; but it is for them to decide.  I am proposing to set up a board here which the public can trust.  The suspicious in the minds of Senators Hayes and Baxter have no foundation in fact or in experience. I do not know what the Senator's is.  I think if he will take the trouble to examine the records regarding the appointments to any board under the present Government or to the staffs of any board since this Government came into office, he will not find an iota of justification for the suspicion he has.  I am not saying <Col N="741" /> that because I want to justify myself to the Senator, because I do not care what he thinks.  The Government are prepared to trust the board, and the public are prepared to trust us; and I will lose no sleep over remarks of the kind that have been made.  If there is anything in Senator Baxter's allegations or in Senator Hayes's innuendos, I invite them to examine the personnel of any board set up by the Government and examine the lists of those appointed to the staffs of those boards.</P>
    <P>Some Senator objected to my quoting the example of the Electricity Supply Board in relation to this board, stating that the functions of the Electricity Supply Board as set out in the Electricity Supply Acts are different from those proposed in the case of this board.  That is all very well; but, knowing the arguments that would be raised, we have taken this section of this Bill word for word from the Electricity Supply Act.  There is not a comma of difference between this section and the corresponding section of the Electricity Supply Act.  Therefore, we have, for ten years, the example of a board in operation which had, in relation to its appointments, the same statutory powers which we propose to give to this board.  The Electricity Supply Board was appointed by a Government of which Senator Fitzgerald was a member.  I wonder did he go to the Executive Council of the day and say: &ldquo;It is not merely necessary there should be no grounds for suspicion, but the public should be convinced that there is no possibility of suspicion arising,&rdquo; and, therefore, urge that an amendment like the one that is on the Order Paper to-day should be inserted. Of course, he did not, he realised then, having responsibility in the matter, his colleagues could be trusted to act in a proper manner.  He realised that, if the board was going to function properly at all it would have to be free from finicky restrictions and red tape regulations. It was a board to be trusted.  He realised that if men capable of directing a gigantic enterprise of that kind could be trusted to be sensible and reasonable in relation to major matters <Col N="742" /> they could also be trusted in relation to minor matters.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board, in fact, never availed of the Local Appointments Commissioners.  Is it suggested that that was due to political bias or to the desire to give patronage, or the desire to exclude the poor man's children who had obtained a scholarship in the University?  Of course, not. I am making no allegation in relation to the manner in which they chose people for appointment before this Government came into office.  I do not know if any allegations have been made since this Government came into office. The fact is that the Electricity Supply Board has secured an excellent staff&mdash; in many cases by personal selection, and where that was not, in their opinion necessary or practicable they adopted other devices; they chose clerical workers on the result of the Leaving Certificate examination and took those who got the highest places. That method was one that worked satisfactorily in relation to that board, and a similar method would work in relation to this.</P>
    <P>There is no point in comparing the activities of this Government in the past.  It is realised by most sensible people that, in order to have public institutions functioning properly, they must be free from suspicion of patronage. I object strongly&mdash;and members of the present Government have a right to object strongly&mdash;to being lectured on this matter by members of a Government which did not observe that principle when they were in office. I admit that lip service is now being paid to the idea of no preference by those whose idea of it was to give preference to ex-members of the National Army who in those days were all supporters of theirs.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, Section 14, to delete paragraph (b), lines 8 to 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> I am afraid that, after the heat occasioned by the last amendment, this amendment may seem rather in the nature of an anti-climax, and I am not sorry for that, because I hope that it may be debated in a calmer atmosphere.  I put down this amendment again because, on the Committee Stage, the discussion became a little heated, and I felt that the matter was not being considered with the deliberation it deserved.  There is a very considerable feeling that this venture is largely of a speculative character and the Minister himself has, I think, almost admitted that.  He said&mdash;I hope he will not ask me for his words, but he can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;&ldquo;we do not look entirely for a direct return from our money.  A lot of the return will be indirect,&rdquo; presumably, in an increased tourist traffic, so that, on the face of it, from the Minister's own admission, you cannot apply a strict business test to this enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that this body is to encourage as far as possible private enterprise, and I certainly commend that, largely because of the speculative character of the whole business.  Tourist traffic, as I think everybody will agree, is a most uncertain thing.  Our climate is not very much in its favour.  Leave aside certain things that are happening elsewhere, which, if my information is correct, tend to ruin our tourist traffic for the season.  That will pass over, I hope, but, apart from that, it is a very uncertain enterprise and I think the Minister is right in postulating, that as far as possible, it shall be dependent on work through the medium of the private enterprise.  For that reason, I see no justification at present, when there are ample powers for indirect assistance to various tourist enterprises, for taking these powers of direct operation.  They are very hazardous; they require very special knowledge; and I think the Minister himself will admit that a board of this kind is the last one to undertake work of a highly specialised character like that which is set out in paragraph (b) of Section 14.</P>
    <P>The operations which I hope the House will exclude, are those which <Col N="745" /> empower the board &ldquo;to build, establish, equip and operate hotels, guest-houses, holiday hostels&rdquo;&mdash;whatever they may mean&mdash;&ldquo;holiday homes&rdquo;&mdash;and the difference between a holiday hostel and a holiday home is a matter of words and nothing else &mdash;&ldquo;youth hostels&rdquo;&mdash;they have a more or less understood meaning and they are at present efficiently handled, so far as resources allow, through the medium of An Oige&mdash;&ldquo;holiday camps or to assist, financially, including by way of loan or otherwise in the building&rdquo;&mdash;a very hazardous and costly operation&mdash;&ldquo;establishing, equipping or operating thereof&rdquo;.  I ask the House to take the view that, under the other sub-sections, there are ample powers to do all that is reasonable.  Under sub-paragraph (a), there is power to assist financially, including by way of loan or otherwise, in the provision, extension or improvement of accommodation for tourists.  I think that is comprehensive and wide enough without specifically mentioning these other operations.</P>
    <P>I am not approaching this in any spirit of hostility, but I am asking the Minister, as the guardian of public money, to take all due precautions to safeguard the public money.  There is no necessity whatever to speculate, as these operations in paragraph (b) allow, when there are ample powers of indirect assistance in the other provisions, and it is to remove this temptation from the board and to protect the revenue that I put down this amendment.  I hope the Minister will not put up the argument that the board is competent and &ldquo;why have any control over them at all?&rdquo; If that general argument is applied to all our Government service, why have an Oireachtas or any control of finance?  Why not appoint a Government on the totalitarian principle and say: &ldquo;You are competent and honest men; you can do what you like, and we know you will do what is best.&rdquo; The whole machinery is designed to provide safeguards which experience has shown to be necessary and which are part and parcel of the democratic system, so will the Minister refrain as far as possible from telling <Col N="746" /> us what he has already told us, that this board is competent and that no restraint should be put on them?  I hope he will limit the operations of the board, and exclude from their powers all powers directly to operate hotels and other similar establishments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will undertake not to assure the Senator again that this board will be comprised of reasonable men, if he will undertake not to assume the contrary.  On that basis, I think we can argue.  I am quite certain that the Senator, many times in the past, in one capacity or another, had occasion to concern himself with the formation of a new company, and when the articles and memorandum of association of the company came before him, he found therein that the company was taking power to do a whole lot of things which, in fact, its promoters did not intend to do.  When the Senator was reading through the papers and found that the company was taking power to do all the variety of things usually set out in such papers, he did not say to the other promoters, or to those directly concerned in the venture: &ldquo;Look here, limit yourself to the particular things you propose to do and do not go one step beyond the limit of your immediate intention.&rdquo; On the contrary, I am sure he said to them: &ldquo;My advice to you as businessmen is to make sure that no matter what circumstances may arise or in what way your business may develop you are now to draw up your memorandum and articles of association so that you may not be subject at any future time to any legal disability in carrying on your business.  Therefore, see that your memorandum and articles of association are drawn sufficiently wide to give you ample power of developing and carrying on.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what we have here.  We are drawing up the memorandum and articles of association of this tourist board.  We are setting out its powers and functions and in this section we are taking care to ensure that in any set of circumstances that may arise the board will not find itself up against any statutory limitations.  Nobody contemplates <Col N="747" /> that the board is to rush out, buy sites and start building hotels. There is no such intention.  But there are circumstances which might arise in which the board might find it good business to build a hotel for the purpose of operating the hotel itself or it may build one to lease it to somebody else.  I mentioned a lot of circumstances in which the board might find it advantageous to operate a hotel. They might find themselves in the position that a loan advanced to the hotel proprietor was not being repaid. They might find it necessary to take over the hotel and run it themselves. They may find the hotel on their hands and they may find it good business to run it until the loan is paid off.  If this section were not in the Bill that is a thing that the board could not do.  The hotel would become derelict.  Presumably a hotel proprietor could apply under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act at the present time for a loan.  I think there is nothing to prevent a hotel proprietor making application for a loan under that Act but I would consider it bad policy to encourage hotel proprietors to avail of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  I think the type of committee set up to deal with loans under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act is a committee which would not be likely to be successful in the matter of running a hotel.  But this board will be competent to run a hotel and the board should have power to assist financially in these operations. If the amendment were carried they could not do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear that they have powers under paragraph (a), and it is because I am not clear on that that I want paragraph (b) in.  It is to make it clear that the board has powers to do what it may think best in the course of its business.  The board will not do much in the way of building hotels with this £600,000.  If they act unreasonably they will soon find themselves <Col N="748" /> at the limit of their activities. In any event I can assure the Senator that if they go to the Government under the appropriate section of the Bill for the purpose of borrowing almost entirely or mainly in order to build, establish or equip hotels they will not get the money.  It is not intended that the board will operate hotels at all except under very exceptional circumstances.  The main function of the board is to assist and stimulate private enterprise, not to compete with private enterprise.  This board will be free to assist private enterprise to enable them to get better business and to do some more business.  I am astonished that so much concern has been expressed here on behalf of hotel proprietors whose enterprises might be affected by the Bill.  The hotel proprietors as a body welcome the Bill and they assured me that it would get a free passage through this House.  However, they were wrong there.  At all events the hotel proprietors have no misapprehension that the Bill will work out to their detriment.  This section has been put into the Bill to enable the board to assist them.</P>

      <P>In the matter of trade loan guarantees the Government does not lend money but it guarantees the loan made by a bank to a manufacturing concern.  If that concern fails to make good, the bank takes up the guarantee and approaches the Government for the full amount due under the guarantee.  The Government could protect its own interests by putting in a receiver, taking over the assets of the company and carrying on.  However, in case the concern is wound up, the difference, whatever it may be, between the amount realised by the sale of the assets of the company and the amount claimed by the bank has to be voted by the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole answer to my question is in the last sentence. The money has to be voted by the Dáil. In essence it is the same.  In both cases, in the case of a guarantee, Parliamentary control is established. In the last resort the money to be found under the guarantee has to be voted.  I say the same principle should apply here&mdash;that where the money has to be written off, the consent of Parliament should be obtained.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce led me to believe that the Minister for Finance had power to waive the capital lost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He mentioned the Electricity Supply Board.  I do not blame the Minister. <Col N="750" /> He has a right to quote things in support of his case, but this does not support his case.  The trade loans guarantee is a very close analogy, but that does not support the Minister's case.  I ask the Minister&mdash;I do not ask the House because that would be automatic&mdash;to accept the amendment. There is an apprehension in certain quarters that one of the reasons why the amendment should not be accepted is that the Dáil would have to be brought back.</P>

Now surely this is a dangerous departure that we are asked to vote for now in the matter of the control of public finances.  Here is a board set up to carry out a certain enterprise.  Public money to the extent of £600,000 is to be operated for this tourist enterprise.  To safeguard the well-established traditions of finance that money should ultimately be under the control of Parliament. Let us not quibble about what that means in detail&mdash;let no one try to prove that because the money is voted in the first instance by Parliament that that is sufficient.  The money should be under the control of Parliament in all its stages.  Whenever money is written off, Parliament should be consulted. That is why I am pressing this amendment.  It is a fundamental departure from what has been proved by experience to be sound finance.</P>

      <P>In this matter I feel that I hold a watching brief for the Minister for Finance who is on holidays.  Nevertheless I must support Senator Sir John Keane in this amendment. I did not oppose the Bill, as the Minister seemed to think, on Second Reading.  I should like in fact, to see tourist traffic a success in this country, more particularly as I come from a county which is largely dependent on tourist traffic.  On the previous stage the Minister said that in this section we are giving power to waive repayments, not in the case of individuals to whom the board lend <Col N="751" /> money but to release the board from the obligation to repay advances to the Exchequer in certain cases.  If it is known that there is a chance of getting away with money, the board, I suggest, will need police protection, if they attempt to enforce repayment in cases of default.  On the occasion of the last debate the Minister took us up very quickly with the analogy of the Electricity Supply Board.  He has used that analogy again to-day but, so far as this waiving of the repayment of advances to the board is concerned, no parallel at all is afforded by the Electricity Supply Board.  In one case the service was offered for the convenience of residents of this country and if the charges were not paid for that service the supply would be cut off and consumers of electricity would find themselves going to bed in the dark. Here we are contemplating something quite different.  We are contemplating an experiment which we hope will succeed, but it is an experiment which is loaded in many ways.  An Senator Sir John Keane has said just now, the expenditure is almost entirely for profit but, so far as outside traffic is concerned, we have got no control whatever over it.</P>

    <P>The Minister mentioned on the last occasion that one reason for introducing this Bill and for spending money in this way was that it was necessary to provide amenities for internal holiday traffic.  That is a very sound plan, now that we have got holiday legislation, but so far as the first object which the Minister put forward is concerned, namely that of bringing money to the country, internal traffic will bring no grist whatever to the mill.  It might bring money to the Exchequer in the form of additional taxation on hotel proprietors and other people but the Minister does not want to do that.  I think possibly the right way to handle this matter is to add to the annual advance of £45,000, a definite sum each year for unremunerative expenses.  I think that would probably be a better way of achieving the object which Senator Sir John Keane seeks to attain by this amendment. <Col N="752" /> Finally, it would put this whole question of the financing of this board in its correct perspective.  A sum of £600,000 is practically equal to 1/- on the income-tax of this country.  I think that is a very considerable sum for this country and I suggest the Minister should safeguard himself and safeguard the members of the board by making some alteration in the proposed method of financing this board.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes, would he be good enough to say how exactly, when the repayment of a sum is waived, it will be shown in the public accounts because, to my mind, that is really a matter of importance.  The Minister has power to make these payments out of the Central Fund.  This is giving him power to make payments out of the Central Fund in order to meet losses. If a loss is incurred, the Dáil can deal with it, but what is of vital importance is that it will be shown somewhere in the public accounts.</P>

      <P>Clearly it must be shown somewhere.  I cannot help Senator Douglas by telling him where exactly he will get that information in detail.  If the Minister for Finance loses money the Dáil eventually will have to vote it, in whatever form it may be brought before the Dáil&mdash; whether in an Estimate, under a trade loans guarantee or in the annual Budget of the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume it must be shown in the publications of the Department of Finance.  They show all items of expenditure, receipts and losses, Exchequer assets and so forth. However, the alternative to the Bill, in my opinion, is not Senator Sir John Keane's amendment but Senator The McGillycuddy's suggestion.  We could have set out to deal with that matter in that way, namely, by providing an additional subsidy for this board for the purpose of making advances for non-profit earning schemes, but we decided that this was the better <Col N="753" /> system, to keep power in the hands of the Minister for Finance to exercise a discretion in individual cases.  The type of case where this power may have to be exercised is twofold.  If the board, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, makes an advance for an entirely non-profit earning purpose&mdash; the building of a swimming pool for the public for which no admission fee will be charged, the putting up of public conveniences, the building of a promenade open to the public or the provision of some other non-revenue producing asset&mdash;clearly no revenue is coming in and the board will not be able to repay whatever advance they get for that purpose.  I do not want to convey the suggestion that the board are in fact going to make advances for that purpose.  They may possibly give loans to local authorities for these purposes, loans on which the local authorities will have to pay interest.  The actual cost of these schemes in that case will be borne by the local authorities and they may find it cheaper to borrow money from the board than from any other source.  If the board decide to make an advance for non-profit earning purposes of that kind, this power must be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other case is more analogous to a loan guarantee where, say, an advance is made to a hotel proprietor to reconstruct a hotel and the hotel afterwards fails.  There is no option but to waive repayment there.  That is precisely what would happen if we were administering trade loans through a board instead of through the Department. At present the gurantee is given through the Department.  If the undertaking in respect of which the guarantee is given fails, the Department would have to make good the guarantee.  The Dáil may vote the money long after the failure has taken place and the amount has been made good to the lender.  But as soon as the Minister, exercising the power given to him by Statute, gives a guarantee, then the obligation to meet it in the event of failure rests upon the State as a whole, and, without destroying the credit of the State, the Dáil has in fact no option but to vote the money.  If we were administering that Act <Col N="754" /> through a board, we would have to have in the Bill establishing the board precisely the same section that is here. We would have to take power to waive the repayment by the board of the amount which the board were themselves unable to recover from the borrower.  That is, in fact, all we are doing here.</P>
    <P>We are not empowering the board to lend money to somebody who will not repay it, but, if the board lends money in a <i>bona fide</i> way, for a purpose which they think will be profit earning, expecting to get that money back and to get interest on it until it is repaid, and they find that the event is different from their expectations and that they have lost the money, then in fact the Minister has no option but to waive repayment by the board, because the board cannot possibly repay it if they cannot themselves collect from the borrower.  The power must be there, and I think it is better to have it in that particular form, so that the individual item will be subject to the supervision of the Minister for Finance, rather than that we should decide out of the blue on a certain sum, as Senator The McGillycuddy suggests, and vote it every year &mdash;a sum that may in fact not be required, or, if given, might tempt the board into doing things which they would not do if they had to meet this supervision by the Department of Finance in individual cases.  I think, therefore, that the words should stand.  I think we have no option but to let them stand, if we are going to function on those lines at all.  The only point on which I want to satisfy the Seanad is that however it is done, whatever machinery is devised for the purpose, any money which the Minister for Finance may have to make good by reason of a default of this kind will have to be voted by the Dáil.  There is no other source from which it can be obtained.</P>

      <P>I had an opportunity recently of spending a few days in the North.  There is always a slight tendency, when you go into the North, to feel that you are advancing into a hostile country, but when you hear remarks like: &ldquo;This year the hay is bad,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The turnips are not so good,&rdquo; you very quickly realise that you are practically at home.  It is the same landscape, the same people, the same climate&mdash;only perhaps sometimes a little more so.  I had an opportunity of seeing some hotels in the North. They were not very large hotels, but they were perfectly furnished and fitted.  They had every modern <Col N="756" /> convenience.  The staff were courteous and efficient, and I think the terms were reasonable.  In my opinion, those hotels were a great advance on many hotels that I know in the South, where the charges are similar, and which obviously cater for a similar type of tourist.  I quite understand, of course, that, unhappily, this Bill does not apply to the North, but I think we ought not to be too proud to study Northern methods and Northern tourist facilities.  I think we ought not to be too jealous; I think in the case of visitors who come to the South we should encourage them to visit the North also; we should give them help and advice, and praise Northern scenery.  I hope the board will use all its influence to see that there is the closest co-operation between tourist associations in the South and tourist associations in the North.  It is not often that a voice crying in the wilderness can make itself heard above the battle cries of the market place, but I am sure Senators will realise the advantages that may accrue&mdash;small advantages perhaps, but still very important&mdash;from such co-operation.</P>

      <P>In connection with this proposal to assist financially the provision of hotel accommodation and the equipping of hotels, I trust that the Minister will use all the influence he can with the board when it is set up to ensure that, wherever articles necessary for these hotels are made in Ireland, the board will insist on their being purchased in this country.  I refer to that because recently there came to my notice the case of a hotel in Dublin which was reconstructed at a cost of £80,000 and whose trade was built up on the custom of supporters of the G.A.A., the Gaelic League and, at an earlier time, Sinn Fein.  The proprietors, to give them their due, equipped that hotel with Irish furniture, but when it came to providing the table ware and cutlery they went abroad for these articles.  I think that where money has to be expended in this manner the board ought to insist that all articles procurable in this country should be procured here, and I hope the Minister will use his influence with the board in that respect.  I have a considerable file of correspondence in connection with the matter here, but, as it is confidential, I do not intend to refer to it.</P>

It has always been a great misfortune for this country that we have been so cut off from <Col N="758" /> Continental civilisation as we have been, and therefore, I hope that a real attempt will be made to attract Continental visitors, and that amongst the employees of this board there will be many equipped with a knowledge of foreign languages.</P>

      <P>I wish just to make a couple of remarks in case it may be considered that all of us Gaelic Leaguers are unanimous on this question.  I wish to say that we are not.  So far as I am concerned, I have no fear that the passing of this Bill will in any way injure the Gaeltacht or the Gaeltacht areas.  There are a number of hotels in the Gaeltacht areas in the South which are doing well and, if money is spent in these hotels by visitors, there are a number of employees in these hotels who are Gaelic speakers, and I have no fear that it will have any adverse effect on them.  I am sure Cu Uladh will give me the freedom of having my own opinion, just as I give him the right of having his opinion and, in my opinion, the passing of the Bill will not injure the Gaeltacht, but rather will assist it.  After all, the people in the Gaeltacht&mdash;the parts of it with which I am acquainted, anyway&mdash;have a certain spirit of independence and it will not in any way overawe or influence them to see foreigners coming amongst them.

      <P>I do not know that it is necessary to refer at any length to the remarks made by Senators on this stage of the Bill.  Senator Robinson spoke about the desirability of co-operation with the tourist development authorities in Northern Ireland. There is, I think, at the present time very close co-operation between the <Col N="759" /> Tourist Association here and the corresponding Tourist Association in Belfast, and I think that, whatever difficulties there may be in effecting coordination of effort in relation to other matters between the two parts of the country, the advantages of having that co-ordination in matters relating to tourist development are so obvious that it should be possible to achieve it. This is an island and persons coming here from abroad for a holiday are, I think, not likely to confine their travelling activities to any part of it. Whatever success, therefore, attends the effort of this tourist board in bringing visitors from outside to this country will benefit Northern Ireland, just as whatever efforts are made there to attract visitors to that part of the country will benefit the rest of the country as well.  I do not think it is necessary to reopen the question of the controversy concerning the reactions of this measure upon the Gaeltacht.  Personally, I think it will be wholly beneficial. I do not know that Senator Campbell expects me to deal with the particular matter that he raised, but I should imagine that the board will use its influence in the direction he desires, and, if they fail, we will have tariffs and quotas to back them up</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator MacDermot was quite correct in emphasising the possibility of developing holiday business with people from countries other than Great Britain.  I should say that the primary function of the board will be to improve holiday facilities for Irish people in Ireland, to get them to take their holidays here, and to make it possible for them to get enjoyable holidays within their means.  I should say that next in importance to the people living in Ireland are those with whom we have racial associations, whether they are in Great Britain, America, or other parts of the world.  From a purely business point of view, I should say that they are the people most likely to respond to the tourist propaganda that the board will undertake; but there is no reason whatever why the board should confine its activities to these <Col N="760" /> two classes, if there is money to be made out of any other class.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if any consideration has been given by his Department to the question as to whether the basis of giving relief of rates could not be measured somehow in accordance with production. The main problem before us on the land in the future is to have greatly increased productivity.  I can see the burden of rates increasing with no corresponding assistance from the Exchequer, and I do not know how the burden can be carried one year after another unless there is greatly increased production.  I put it to the Minister yesterday that, in my judgment, the present scheme does not increase production.  I may say that I have given a certain amount of consideration to this aspect of the problem, and while I have no very pronounced views, I think that what ought to be examined is this, whether the relief of rates now and in the future could not be distributed somehow on the basis of production.  As I pointed out before, the present scheme makes provision for relief on the basis of the number of people employed.  You could have a situation whereby a small farmer gets relief because he has sons. While he gets that relief because his sons, apparently, are with him, they are, probably, working here and there with neighbouring farmers, rather than on the particular farm for which relief was given, and if the productivity of that farm could be examined, the Minister would really discover that relief given in that way was not yielding anything at all like the return to the nation that should be expected from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Elsewhere we are going to be up against the whole question of derating, and a demand for greatly increased sums for the relief of rates.  All sorts of arguments could be used as justification for an increased amount of relief for farmers.  It seems to me that the aim ought to be to get increased production from the land.  Whatever scheme of taxation is devised in relation to local authorities, as far as the Department of Local Government is concerned, the Minister ought to devise <Col N="762" /> it in such a way as to ensure that there will be greatly increased production. Apparently, increased employment may not guarantee increased production, because what might appear to be employment might not in fact be employment at all.  As I indicated yesterday, and as is known to Senators in every part of the House, many farmers employ a good deal of casual labour without getting any relief.  If we could examine the possibility of relating relief to production, money would flow where it really ought to flow.  Relief should be given to people who are worth relieving, and who work for it.  It is true, of course, that if farmers have increased production they are better able to bear the burden, but to increase production it is necessary to stimulate productivity in various ways, psychologically as well as financially.  There is no scientific basis about the present method, and I am not at all satisfied that it is bearing the fruits I should like to see coming from it.  If the Minister went down the country and saw things as they appear to other people, he would realise that the present scheme is not a good one.</P>
    <P>In the future we should endeavour to get the best value possible for this money.  That is what we ought to get. I think even the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance urged it as a slogan which ought to be shouted from the housetops by everybody, that what we want is to get better value for our money.  If the Minister were in the position to judge this problem for himself, if he could judge the effects of this legislation, he would be satisfied that he is not at present getting the best possible value for the money.  A county like mine might be benefiting, perhaps, to a greater extent than certain other counties.  It is at the moment because of the figures of population and the position in regard to employment.  I do not say that under my scheme of things it would not continue to benefit. The people who produce would benefit. These are the people we ought to encourage and stimulate.  When we are giving relief, that ought to be the aim.  I put it to the Minister that that <Col N="763" /> is an aspect of this question which he ought to have examined.  With a little more experience he would be quite convinced that this is not working out according to plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot compliment the House or the Minister on the proceedings here.  We have spent the best part of three hours discussing tourists coming into Ireland, and when we have our hand on the most vital organ of Ireland itself we do not spend as many minutes.  This relief amounts approximately to 9d. per man per week. I think that speaks for itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Baxter that it would be a great idea if the Minister could do something such as the Senator suggests.  It would be one way of getting greater productivity from the land.  But Senator Baxter has not told us how that desirable situation is to be brought about.  If increased employment does not mean increased productivity, I do not know by what other way you get around to increased productivity.  If I were working on the land for a day, I might produce more than Senator Baxter, or <i>vice versa.</i>  You cannot lay down a hard and fast rule by which that thing can be judged and by which these results can be brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present system is the best which has been put up so far.  If Senator Baxter or anybody else has a better system, I am quite sure the Minister will be delighted to consider that system or to get any scheme whereby he will achieve better results. Under the present system the people with valuations of £20 and less, and those are in the majority in every county in Ireland, are benefiting to a greater extent than are the people over that valuation.  In Senator Baxter's county the number of people under £20 valuation is 81 per cent. Those people are gaining because of this legislation.  There was another scheme which certain people stood for up to a short time ago and which seems to be dropped of late.  That was the only alternative we have heard of so far.  If that scheme of <Col N="764" /> derating agricultural land were put into operation, all the people under £20 valuation would lose.</P>
    <P>The other people to whom Senator Counihan has called my attention&mdash; himself and his followers, people of that type&mdash;would gain to this extent, that out of every £, 10/- would be divided amongst 8 per cent. of the people who are the big landholders, and the other 10/- would be divided on a <i>pro rata</i> basis amongst the remaining 92 per cent.  The only policy for the Government in existing conditions is to try to bring about a scheme which will do the greatest good for the greatest number and give the greatest amount of employment.  That has been done under this scheme and it will confer benefit in every county.  People with £20 valuation and under will gain and these people are the backbone of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDoyle" hpid="Dr. Doyle Dr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Doyle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We all want to increase production on the land, but to abolish this scheme would not help us in any way.  The principle of the scheme is excellent and, as Senator Quirke pointed out, it is of great benefit to the men under £20 valuation.  At the same time, this is not quite fulfilling all the things the Minister wanted to do, for the reason that the man who does not employ labour gets too big a show under this Bill.  In my county it works out in this way, that if you get a certain amount for employing a man, if you do not employ a man you also get a certain amount.  After portion of what is allocated is distributed among the small holders and those who employ men, the amount left is distributed over the land not previously relieved, with the result that the difference between the man who employs labour and the man who does not amounts to 25/- in the year.  That is not anything like the encouragement that the energetic man should get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> I suggested earlier that the Minister should give serious consideration to dividing the allocation over all the land.  Probably, the Minister may say that it will not amount to a lot, but it will be a help.  There is no reason why the man who employs labour should be penalised to help the man who does not.  It would also help the small holders.  We have heard from time to time many methods of increasing work on the land and helping the farmers.  If this scheme could be extended, if there was money available, it would be one of the best ways of getting people to live on the land and to work it.</P>

      <P>I have nothing but approval for the idea that Senator Baxter has put before us about getting increased production, and anything that I could do in this Bill or in any other Bill that I might have before the Oireachtas, dealing with agriculture, I would be only too happy to do it.  I would be pleased to have any Bill so worded and the principles enshrined in it such as would secure the increased production that not alone Senator Baxter but everyone in the Dáil and Seanad would desire.  As a matter of fact, the idea that was in the minds of those of us responsible for the introduction of the change in the distribution of the agricultural grant was that of getting increased production.  The other system was in operation for a long period, and there were many complaints about the distribution of the agricultural grant.</P>

      <P>There will, I am sure.  I do not know if one can judge whether there are more complaints about this method, but no matter what method you adopt it will be regarded as unfair by somebody.  This method has been in operation for some years. Every time I have had a Bill in the Oireachtas I have heard complaints, and if ever I bring in a measure of this kind again I am sure I will hear complaints. But no better scheme has been put up yet.  There is at present an Agricultural Commission sitting, and I <Col N="766" /> think Senator Baxter is a member of that Commission.

If the Agricultural Commission finds it possible to consider the problem and put up any scheme, I can assure Senator Baxter that any scheme that would be deemed more equitable in the distribution of this grant by the agriculturists of this country represented on the Commission would be seriously considered.  If they put up any scheme that seems feasible to secure increased production and be fairer to all concerned, it will receive most sympathetic consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, on this amendment, yesterday evening, we were attempting to meet the point made in defence of the Minister in his attitude that this amendment should not be accepted, when it was being argued that this amendment, if accepted, would mean the holding up of land division. Now, I am quite convinced that Senator Counihan has no such intention in his mind, and I think that the House, having accepted the principle, and having accepted the Second Reading of this Bill, must recognise that there is no point whatever in <Col N="767" /> adopting such an attitude as that. This Bill is going to be the law, and there is no justification for an attempt to frustrate what the Oireachtas will have done.  The real point to be made is whether or not the Minister's argument is sound: that this is going to hold up land division if this appeal be granted.  I say that nobody could stand for that, and that it might be possible, if the Minister were prepared to come, even some of the way, to meet the case that has been made, to have such an amendment moved as would prevent, for instance, any sort of vexatious appeals to the Judicial Commissioners.  It is conceivable that certain individuals, for the purpose of delaying time, might make an appeal that would really not be justified on the facts, but I think it ought to be possible to meet that case if the Minister were prepared to go any distance on the road the other way. I am satisfied that the Minister and those who support him do not realise fully the disturbance that exists in the minds of a great body of our farmers about the possibilities of the operation of this clause, and, as Senator O'Dwyer said, and rightly said, if the Minister could make this concession, or even a lesser concession than that for which Senator Counihan is asking, I think the whole problem of land division would be faced up to by all the people in this country with a goodwill which is not being demonstrated at present; and the position is like that because people are really fearful of the consequences.  It is not a question of people subscribing to the taking of somebody else's land, when the possibility is that it will be their own turn next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I gathered from what the Minister said on the Second Reading of this Bill, or on some other stage since the introduction of this Bill, that he indicated that the amount of land which he visualised as being, probably, the limit which would be available for distribution, was not a very great total at all.  We are going to come to the end of the problem some time.  Some, indeed, may say that the sooner we come to the end of the problem the <Col N="768" /> better, and that the more quickly we divide the available land the sooner we reach the point of stability with regard to the ownership of land, and that the sooner that happens the better it will be for the position of the farmers generally. If, however, the area which is available for division is a comparatively small proportion of our total area, out of 12,000,000 acres of arable land, obviously the number of our people who are going to be affected, and the total area of land which is going to be made available for subdivision, being small, the position with regard to the relief of congestion is not going to be altered to any considerable extent.  There is no possibility that all our people, or one-third of them, or even one-tenth of those who desire land, are going to get it, and there is no strength, therefore, in the case that is made, that, unless this be tackled immediately and with courage, we are going to have disturbance and trouble and the sort of situation which Senator McEllin discussed last night. I do not think that case can be made at all, because the total number of people who will get land and the total area available for them is very limited indeed.  The truth is that we are going to leave ten times as many people without land, who want it but who cannot get it because it is not available for them, as will have land provided for them.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long the Minister thinks the distribution of the available land will take, but it seems to me that it ought to be possible for the Minister to have an appeal to somebody other than the first court.  It ought to be possible to have an appeal, perhaps not on all points but on certain points of fact.  If the appeal were a vexatious one, the individual making the appeal might be penalised.</P>
    <P>I was trying to say last night that the people of this country have waited for generations for the liberty and the right to handle the land of their own country in the way they think best. There is no justification for rush now, at the eleventh hour.  We can wait a year or two or three, if we are going to finally solve this land problem in a sensible way.  It is better that we <Col N="769" /> should go slowly and gradually, but go wisely, than to rush, even rush in the matter of legislation, and take powers in a Land Bill which, as somebody pointed out last night, might be used later in a way neither the Minister nor any member of this House would desire. Somebody&mdash;I think perhaps it was Senator Johnston&mdash;pointed out that you could easily, later on, have a Government much more to the Left than the present Government.  My own opinion, indeed, is that there are not many people&mdash;perhaps not one at all&mdash; in this House very much to the Left. Probably all of us are very close to the Centre.  Senator Sir John Keane may be somewhat more conservative than I am, but, taking the House generally, I think that there is very little difference. The difference between us as to what we deem wise in this matter of the distribution of land and how it should be done, coming down to the facts of the situation, would be rather difficult to see.  We ought, I think, take our stand on this, that whatever we do in the matter of taking land from those who own it ought to be done in accordance with laws that would be just, and the method of taking should be such as to give the people confidence, whatever their position and whatever the past may have been.  It ought to give them confidence that they are getting a fair opportunity to defend their rights because this land is theirs anyhow. The laws of the land have protected them in holding it up to the present time.  To take it from them is to take something away which they have held equally with other citizens under the protection of the law of the country, and they hold it to-day under the rights given them by the Constitution. When you begin to discriminate between your citizens there is a minority. The people from whom land is to be taken are the minority, because you cannot take land from the majority: the majority will not stand for it. Minorities, in that sense, for that reason, are entitled, because they are minorities, to even greater consideration than might be given to the great mass of the people.  Minorities have a right to protection, and in order to be fair it sometimes happens that you have to go to greater extremes in the <Col N="770" /> protection of rights of the minority than perhaps you would feel justified in doing.  But, beyond doubt, the citizens from whom land is to be taken ought to get every opportunity to defend their rights to that land.</P>
    <P>The Lay Commissioners, coming to decide whether or not it is justifiable to resume occupation of land for distribution, will have to consider quite a number of matters which will arise in the determination of that question. There is ample evidence that there were difference of opinion in the courts in giving decisions with regard to land, the right to take it, the justification for taking it, and the price of land, in the past.  Because of that, and because you are doing something here which you regard as sound national policy, something which you are justified in doing, something which you think ought to be done, because of the past, to some extent, and because of the internal economic situation of the country, you ought, on the other hand, realise that when you determine to take property from some and pass it over to others under the authority of the State that that law, operated by sensible, just and practical people to-day, will remain the law for their successors.  When you decide to take land from the man who has got several thousands of acres, to distribute amongst others, you are taking that under the authority of the Oireachtas but you are leaving that law there and passing it on to your successors.  Who would suggest that if a situation developed to-morrow in this country that the hundred thousand people who have left Eire in the last four or five years came back here again that you would be able to stop with the man with the thousand or two thousand, or three thousand acres?  Who would suggest that there would not be very great pressure exercised to come down the scale, far down, to the man with very few acres, indeed?  We all know how these agitations start.  Some members of this House may have led in the campaign to distribute land.  I do not know that they have, but generally what happens is that this idea takes root amongst the people in a district. Indeed, a local agitator can start it. <Col N="771" /> Then the man who is supposed to be the leader might not be quite satisfied about it, he might not be too satisfied even about the justification for it, but it is rather difficult for him to hold his place as leader and stand against the stream and current of local opinion. That is how these agitations start. Other leaders, not to be outdone, acquiesce and concur, so to speak, in the application of this policy.  While the point of view expressed by Senator MacEllin may be true, that you are going to have dissatisfaction bordering on disturbance, if these powers are not there for the Minister to exercise in this fashion, that ought not to be the justification for the operation of those powers.  If they are to be operated it should only be done, in my opinion anyhow, when calm consideration has been given as to the justification for it and when the owner of the lands, the aggrieved person&mdash;and he is an aggrieved person&mdash;has been given every opportunity to defend his right to hold his land.  A great many of those people do not think that they can defend their right adequately before the Lay Commissioners and although, as I argued yesterday evening, the decision may not be altered in the next court, nevertheless the fact that there is a court of appeal gives the man the feeling that he is getting fair play.  That is what all citizens want.  The psychological effect created by the feeling that he is being given fair play and justice is a very great factor in the sort of loyalty that the people give to the Government of the country.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking from any practical experience of the operations of the Land Acts in my own county but I am speaking because of my contacts with a great many people up and down the country who are disturbed by this. People are not disturbed if there are not reasons for disturbance and whatever Senator Quirke or indeed the Minister himself may argue&mdash;I am quite satisfied that the Minister in his mind has no desire to do anything that is unfair&mdash;nevertheless, the owners of land feel that if you have even one individual in a position to start a local <Col N="772" /> agitation about the taking over of land the consequence will be that land may be taken which otherwise would not be taken.  Many such agitations have been started in the past, and that has been the consequence.  We have had quite a lot of agitation, disturbance and upheaval in the past which the country would have been the better without.</P>
    <P>In view of that, I suggest to the Minister that he should be prepared to go some distance to create a feeling of security and stability, not only actual and physical, but psychological stability on his policy of taking over land.  I believe that he would be well repaid by doing so.  Therefore, I think that he ought to grant the concession which Senator Counihan is seeking in his amendment.  The Senator is not seeking it for himself personally, but rather for people up and down the country who want to live within the law and would like to have its protection: people who would like to live under such conditions that they could regard the law as fair, even though its administration might press hardly on them.  If the Minister were prepared to make that concession I believe that this problem of land distribution would be accepted in an entirely different spirit.  I cannot believe that there would be any grievances, nor would we have conditions operating where you would have the taking over of an estate held up for six or 12 months.  I do not see why the Minister, in that atmosphere, should not, if he considered it necessary, set up some sort of an <i>ad hoc</i> court in addition to the Judicial Commissioners to clear away arrears.  Finally, I want to say that in my judgment no assurance which the Minister can give with regard to his intentions about the taking over of land is likely to give the same confidence to the people as the acceptance by him of Senator Counihan's amendment, and its insertion in the Bill.  Surely, its acceptance is not going to make any great difference to the Minister's policy with regard to land distribution.  Therefore, I would urge him to give consideration to that side of the case because it is all important.</P>

      <P>I was amazed to hear some of the statements made by Senator Baxter, because I have always regarded him as a fairly sensible man. I have heard him make some wild statements now and again, but I think the wildest statements that he has ever made he made here this evening.  Not only were they wild, but, to my mind, they were very dangerous statements. Dealing with the amendment, he suggested that a terrible situation of anxiety exists throughout the country in connection with this Bill: that it has caused terrible fears in the minds of large numbers of people whom he knows through the country, and that they are dreading what may happen if and when it becomes law.  I wonder where the Senator met this large number of people.  The thing that I principally object to in his statement was his reference to the minority.  I would like to know from him if he would find this minority in his own county or in a neighbouring county.  He talked about taking land off the minority, and said that the minority have a right to certain protection from the Government. But surely the Senator knows very well that definite provision has been made to protect the minority in every piece of legislation introduced in this or the other House.</P>

      <P>There is the right of appeal to the Lay Commissioners and to the Appeal Tribunal.  Senator Baxter went on to say that the Government would not perhaps take land off the majority because they knew that the majority would not stand for that. I want to describe that as a ridiculous and dangerous statement.  There is no suggestion to take land off the majority, and why?  Because the majority of land owners are people with valuations of £20 and under.  In Senator Baxter's county the majority of the land owners from whom it is not proposed to take land, and whose valuations are £20 and under, represent 81 per cent. of the total.  In the County Monaghan they represent 75 per cent. of the people.  Does the Senator suggest that, in order to show that we are not biased as against any minority, class or creed, we should proceed to take land off this 75 per cent. in the County Monaghan.  In my own County of Tipperary, 65 per cent. of the farm holdings are under £20 valuation. Does Senator Baxter suggest that we should take land off them?  The Senator should keep to realities.  He should realise that under this, as under previous land measures, the proposal is to take land from those who have big estates and who are not working them.  The Minister has already given the assurance that where an estate is being even moderately well worked there will be no interference with it under this measure.</P>

He said that he did not know of any case where a man, who was working his land according to proper methods of husbandry, was interfered with.  That was the state of affairs that he found even before this Bill was introduced, and before the Minister's statement was made to which I have referred.  Senator Baxter has raised this question of special provision being made for the protection of the minority.  Of course, <Col N="775" /> that is a thing that cuts both ways.  If one class is to get more consideration than another, surely to goodness the majority should be considered before the minority.</P>

I was brought up in the Fenian tradition upon a 66 acre farm in County Tipperary.  I was the son of a farmer, the son of a Land Leaguer and the son of a Fenian who did his term in jail in the Land League days.  I regret having to make such a personal statement, but it may be useful for Senator Baxter's guidance in future debates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quirke said that he is a descendant of a Land Leaguer.  According to him, I am a descendant of a land confiscator. However, I think one aspect of the question has been overlooked.  We are rather inclined to look at this matter from the analogy to a court of law.  If action is taken under the common law <Col N="777" /> or statute law on some question, it can be based on some legal custom or usage; but, in this case those considerations do not apply at all.  As I understand it, the Land Commission have power to take land for a number of reasons, and the appeal is not on anything analogous to a legal dispute; it is on the question whether they are exercising those powers harshly or not. The Land Commission can always find a reason for wanting to take land.  If they have got no congestion to plead, they can say they are relieving congestion elsewhere or they can say that we have landless men, though I do not know where we can produce a crop of landless men.  I notice considerable apprehension that the number of landless men is increasing, to the detriment of the proportion in which it is going to relieve congestion.  However, I will let that pass.</P>
      <P>As I see the work of the Commissioners, they&mdash;for some reason or other; I think very often in response to local agitation&mdash;are asked to take over the land of So and so.  When they come down to do that, what are the considerations that must influence them?  They must, and should, have regard to the social value of the person whose land they are going to take. There is the question of fact there&mdash;a rather vague question, not a precise one, of fact&mdash;whether that person is an essential asset, a civic asset, or not, whether he is working that land for the benefit of the community or not.  Surely there could be nothing more difficult to determine.  I do not know what goes on before the Commissioners, but I suppose they say: &ldquo;We are taking this land; we do not consider you are working it as you should.&rdquo; Presumably, he will then say how he is working it or may give reasons why he is not working it up to its maximum capacity.  It may be shortage of capital, or his having a young family and very little home help, or there may be other misfortunes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On questions of that kind, the decision vitally affects the whole economic existence of this land-holder, considering the miserable prices that are paid for the land that is taken over.  By the time the compensation is apportioned <Col N="778" /> there is practically nothing left for the miserable owner who may have been generations on the land.  I feel, in justice, decisions of this kind should not be left to one body of men alone: there should be a rehearing on the facts, and not on law exactly, as to whether these powers are exercised harshly or not.  We have heard a good deal in this debate.  The Minister has challenged anybody to bring forward a case where anybody who worked land had been dispossessed.  I heard of a case&mdash;and I can get him the particulars &mdash;where land was the property of a person who was away and whose mother lived there.  This man was in the service of the Crown&mdash;I do not suppose there is anything wrong in that&mdash; He was away serving his country in the bigger sense.  The Minister smiles when he hears that, but, after all, we are members of the British Commonwealth of Nations; he was serving the British Commonwealth of Nations&mdash; perhaps that will satisfy the Minister's political outlook in the matter&mdash;serving in the British Commonwealth of Nations, of which our common King is the head.</P>

      <P>At any rate, the property had been in the family for generations, and he was looking forward to coming back and living on that land.  I admit that the lady was old, and was not working the land to the best advantage, but it was occupied and was adequately stocked.  Yet now the Land Commission can come in and take this land&mdash;and take it at the price of a mere song&mdash;as untenanted land. That person, when he came back, having served the Empire, was a valuable social asset to the country in every way.  He was socially prepared to live there and add to the amenities of the place and to the general development. He was a cultured element in the district. That is a case of which I know.</P>

      <P>No.  I am prepared to admit that possibly as much employment was not given as if the owner had been living there himself; but are we going to have land taken away on the employment test?  That was a case where I think there might have been an appeal to some other body.  I am not wedded to the Appeal Tribunal, because this is not law at all&mdash;it is the question of human values.  An umpire &mdash;any man in the world&mdash;would probably have been better able to determine whether the Lay Commissioners were acting justly or not.  It is awfully hard to discuss this matter, as people seem to fly off the handle and say that the country must have this, that there is only one side of the story, that land has to be taken away whether one likes it or not, that the big men must be put out somehow or other.  The big men are of value in this country: everybody knows that.  If the country is to be divided up until there is nothing but small holders, look at the effect on the income tax alone.  Everybody knows that substantial people in the country are necessary to create a social balance.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Hogan when he said that one may have all kinds of trivial matters brought forward to delay land acquisition.  I do not object to provision being made for a substantial deposit which the Appeal Tribunal could order to be impounded if the appeal proved unreasonable; but it is most unfair that the disposal of a person's whole property which has been in the family for generations should be left to the arbitrary judgment of one body of men.  There may not have been a very big revenue from it; it may even have been run at a loss, but look at the value of the home where previous generations of a family have lived.  Surely it is most unreasonable not to allow a rehearing in a case of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quirke spoke of how the minority here were protected by this power to appeal on questions of law, but it is really no protection whatever. I set no value by this appeal.  The appeal on a point of law would be against the decision of the Appeal Tribunal, and what happens is that every time a decision is given against <Col N="780" /> the Land Commission, a Bill is brought in and the matter put right.  There is no safeguard whatever in that respect, but there might be some safeguard on equities and on facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not very much to be said without repeating what has already been said, but I should like to assure Senator Quirke that there are no landlords in the country now.  They are all done away with and are all big farmers or small farmers.  He says that, when the division on this matter takes place, we shall see ranged, on one side, the people in favour of protecting the landlords and big farmers, and, on the other, the people in favour of protecting the landless men and the small farmers.  What the Seanad is supposed to do is justice to all parties, even though Senator Quirke says that there are only 20 per cent. of a minority who could possibly be affected by this Bill.  Even that 20 per cent. deserves some consideration. These statements of Senator Quirke will not tend to allay the fears which this 20 per cent. minority has as to the effects of the Bill.  I ask Senators on the opposite side to read the amendment and to read the section.  The amendment seeks an appeal, not to a British judge, but to a tribunal set up by the Government, of two Lay Commissioners and a High Court judge. Is it unreasonable that there should be an appeal on questions of fact and questions of law to such a tribunal? I cannot see that it is, unless, as Senator Quirke says, that they do not want to do justice to the 20 per cent. for which he has such disregard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that the Land Commission is an independent body of men.  I have the greatest respect for the Land Commission, but we must remember that they are civil servants, that, as civil servants, they carry out the wishes of the Government and that the wishes of the Government are the wishes of the Árd-Fheis of Fianna Fáil. The Land Commissioners are entirely independent of the Minister on these questions because the Minister cannot do more than lay down policy.  He is precluded under the 1933 Act from interfering in any question of acquisition <Col N="781" /> or division.  I agree that they are quite independent, but they are only civil servants who can be dismissed at any moment at the whim of the Government, and we have had experience already of quite as important Government officials being so dismissed, without reason given.  In one case, I think there was the reason given that the official had not the confidence of the Minister.  It looks like getting into politics to talk like this, but we have an Appeal Tribunal set up by the Government who are quite independent of everybody and who can be removed only by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>If this 20 per cent mentioned by Senator Quirke had the option of an appeal on questions of acquisition, price, or any matter on which they are aggrieved by the decision of the commissioners&mdash;as every citizen, I contend, has a right to appeal to a court of justice when he feels that he is aggrieved&mdash;it would go a long way to allay the fears of the 20 per cent who may be affected.  I appeal to the Minister, at this eleventh hour, not to use his majority in this House to steamroll these amendments which we are seriously suggesting for his consideration. If he thinks that my amendment is going too far, I appeal to him to consider some amendment which would meet the case and which would allay the fears of the 20 per cent. who Senator Quirke says, are afraid of being affected.  It is worth while to do it, and it is worth the Minister's while to spend another two or three days considering the matter, because there is certainly unrest and a feeling of insecurity amongst the farmers, even though they represent only 20 per cent.</P>

      <P>As a matter of explanation, I want to point out&mdash;I am sure that Senator Counihan did not deliberately misrepresent what I said&mdash; that I referred to 81 per cent. of the land holders in County Cavan as being below £20 valuation.  I did not by any means suggest that the remaining 20 per cent. were big land-owners.  I did not suggest anything of the kind, and I did not suggest that Cavan was all Ireland, as Senator Baxter may have had in mind.</P>

      <P>I have not much to add to what I said last night.  I did not approach this question with a closed mind.  The whole matter was debated for quite a long time, and I think it was the one point that got more consideration than any other in the Dáil. I examined the matter from all angles. This principle was discussed in the Dáil on Section 39, and I did admit there that, as the section was originally drafted, it was objectionable.  I amended it by bringing in this section. Senator Johnston asked me if the Minister's assurance would have any effect in a court of law, but, in Section 39, I did introduce an amendment which will have effect.  Some Senators are seeking to amend that sub-section, although it was introduced specifically and definitely as a protection for the farmer who is unvested and who is working his land properly.  That is a definite amendment that was brought in to this Bill, which does several things to improve the land code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of them. The section was also amended to provide that, as required by the court in the Potterton case, the power under which we are acting and the purpose for which we require the land shall be stated.  These were two decisions of the court and we are simply legislating to fill up the deficiency which the court found.  I decided on consideration that we would abide by what was decided there in the country and we did in that Section 39 actually provide for stating the purpose for which we required the land and the power under which we were acting which was required by the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a point mentioned by Senator Sir John Keane about the <Col N="783" /> person who is abroad.  Probably that case did happen but the circumstances are what should count.  I have personal knowledge of a similar case where a man was abroad and there was great pressure brought to bear on the Land Commission&mdash;as far as pressure could be brought&mdash;and they decided to leave the land in the owner's possession.  I am aware that there are several cases where there is a prospect of the owner coming back. If there is such a prospect, there is, I am satisfied, no intention to hunt people out of the country in that fashion.</P>
    <P>I am taking my stand against this amendment very largely on the grounds mentioned by Senator Hogan last night.  He said it was not unprecedented to have an appeal on the question of fact.  He mentioned cases under the Workman's Compensation Act and I mentioned another.  We know that jury cases where a man's life is at issue are left to laymen to decide on the facts.  A man may be tried for his life, the facts are found by a body of laymen and they are accepted as unappealable.</P>
    <P>There is an indefinite hold-up.  We have been held up already.  I am quite satisfied that the remainder of the land there for division shall be acquired. There are about 600,000 acres in question.  We do not know whether that will all be taken but most of it will be required for the relief of congestion. According to the recommendations of the Commission on the Gaeltacht arising out of the disaster in Scotland a couple of years ago a commission over which Deputy Seán Moylan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce presided, it is clear that while some of the land must be given to ex-employees, the greater proportion of it will be devoted to the relief of congestion. I am quite satisfied that there will be no undue delay.</P>
    <P>In these cases the hearing is in open court.  The person from whom it is proposed to take the land gets every opportunity to present his evidence. The statement we had last night from Senator The McGillycuddy supports <Col N="784" /> that assertion.  He had one case and though he knew there was local pressure sought to be brought on the Land Commission, his objection was upheld.  That has happened in a great number of cases.  I might remind the House that the Land Commission are not confined to taking large farms of land off people who misuse it or abuse it.  No matter how small the holding it may be taken over.  A 30-acre farm that is not properly worked, or if the land is misused, can be taken over by the Land Commission just as well as the 600-acre farm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any 30 acre farm been taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; it is not a question of the size of the farm at all.  It is a question of whether the land is being properly worked.  Now on that question as to the rights of property, I want to say that there is undoubtedly a difference between property in land and any other property.  There is a difference which has been recognised by this Government, by the Government of which Senator Fitzgerald, who spoke on this matter, was a member, and by the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It does make it right; what I mean is that a Government would not act in that way if it were not right.  Governments in democratic countries, elected as Governments are elected, will not fly in the face of natural justice.  There is, I am quite satisfied, a fundamental difference between land in a country and ordinary private property in a country.  It is quite unnecessary to contend now that there is.  On the Second Reading Senator Johnston made the point that the amount of employment given on the land should not count, that it was the <Col N="785" /> good that might be made or got out of the land that mattered.  He said that even if it were a grass farm, if it were essential or was being worked properly in the national interest, that is, in the way of producing food for cattle, that that should count.  These are the things on which I insist.  So did the last Government, and any Government in the future will have to do it.  I am digressing, but I naturally have to follow others who digressed also.</P>
      <P>On the question of appeals, I am fully satisfied that there is no need for anxiety.  I know there is anxiety in certain places, but I know why there is.  People in this House are elected on a different franchise from those in the other House.  There are, unfortunately, people who go around trying to disturb the country, telling them that they have no chance of holding their land if this Government is returned. We might be saying something of the same kind ourselves if we were in Opposition.  That sort of thing is not confined to any Party.</P>
      <P>A case was mentioned here last night, and I am almost satisfied that it is the same case as that to which I referred.  The facts I mentioned are real facts, not such as those disclosed by the Senator.  I tried to find out in that area another case that would fit in with the cases I had been given, and I could not discover it.  I have not yet been presented with any such case.  As far as the example given by Senator Sir John Keane is concerned, I know that there are several cases of that kind where the persons have been allowed to retain the land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>The tone of the Minister's reply is something that is very encouraging.  At the same time, there were two statements made by him that I think should call for some little comment. Where the Minister erred was when he stated that every opportunity <Col N="786" /> was given to persons whose lands were to be taken over.  But in the tribunal of the Land Commissioners the valuer for the Land Commission is absent and there is absolutely no chance of giving to the person or to his counsel whose land is to be taken an opportunity of cross-examining that valuer.  The valuer may be anything.  His status may be nothing.  To my own knowledge in one instance he himself was a broken-down farmer.  I think the Minister should give some consideration to this fact.  Much of the discontent and much of the non-stability which I am satisfied the Minister is anxious to remove would be removed if an opportunity were given of cross-examining the valuer.</P>
      <P>I do not know that any Senator is entitled to imagine that he himself is to give the Land Commission the law for Ireland.  Nobody should think that because his Party is in the majority they are going to remain in that position. The pendulum swings very often, and in a Christian country and under a Constitution which is supposed to be a Christian Constitution, there should be some clear idea as to what the Government of this country stands for and the valuation that should be set upon any person's property.  All of us are interested in the future of Ireland.  All of us have our children to look after, and we here on this side are as interested in the future of the country as the people on the other side of the House. Christian charity demands that some little consideration should be given to people's property and suggestions for the protection of people's property should not be brushed aside by any Government.  For my part I hold 200 acres of land; I work 500 acres, and I defy any representative on any side of the House to come down there and show me where there is one sod of that land waste or lying idle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been listening to what the Minister said.  He tells us to-night that money in land is not to receive the same consideration as money on deposit in the bank.  The Minister for Finance stated here some time ago that, under a Catholic Constitution, we could not see property confiscated.  But there is wholesale confiscation of land.  I have <Col N="787" /> the facts before me.  I have been a valuer before the tribunal ten or twenty times.  It is most encouraging to go there and to see the conscientious countenance&mdash;I had almost said the sweet countenance&mdash;of Mr. Justice Maguire and the conscientious manner in which Mr. Brown and Mr. Mansfield discharge their duties, but the valuer is not there.  He is absent.</P>
    <P>Supposing to-morrow I have made a decent harvest, and I try to make as decent a harvest as I can.  I work at it as hard as I can, doing my level best. On that farm there may be two or three miles of drains.  In face of the instability that exists in land tenure, am I well advised in cleaning these drains?  Shall I let them corrode? Would any citizen be justified in face of the statement, made here for the first time, that land has no relation to money and that this Government and the last Government started to commandeer land &ldquo;any place, anywhere, any time&rdquo;, in the words of &ldquo;Peggy O'Neill&rdquo;, in expending money or labour on his farm?  This whole system has killed the enthusiasm of our best farmers.  It is all right saying that I am doing my utmost.  It is all right to say that my father was a grand Irishman and a decent Irishman, and that he went out with a gun.  That is away altogether from the practical point of view.  The difference in political outlook of various citizens has nothing to do with the economic position. The economic position and the stability of the State demand that land be held as a sacred asset.  In my opinion, it is the greatest asset which the country has.  I know the whole system of land rule in this country is rotten from top to bottom.  I know that the day when the State abandoned the local Land Court, where a man could be brought in and put on his oath to say what he was doing with his land and where a man who was looking for land had to show what right he had to get it, was a bad day for this country.</P>
    <P>At the present time the methods by which land is acquired have corroded <Col N="788" /> the whole system.  I saw where one Fianna Fáil Deputy in the Dáil&mdash;I think his name is Childers&mdash;had the courage to state that he was appalled when he went down the country at the present system.  There is a system under which, if you happen to have any trouble with an individual in the district, it is possible for him to get up an agitation, and as soon as the Minister or the local T.D. visits that district he is approached to get the land divided.  The moment that that is published in the Dáil or anywhere else, can you tell me what bank manager is going to make any advance on that land?  There is widespread instability, and that instability need not exist if a proper tribunal examined this question of the acquisition of land.  I know places in which there is plenty of land available for sub-division.  I can see people crying out for that land, men with families who, if they got possession of this land would be an asset to the country, but everybody seems to be waiting for something to turn up.</P>
    <P>The great proposal here is that we should go to the Lay Commissioners on questions of fact.  That may have some good effect, but it may have the effect of delaying sub-division.  We have Senators on one side of this House who say that they want progress on this question while everybody on the other side says, &ldquo;Stand back.&rdquo; I think that is wrong.  I think the question is one which the Minister should have appointed a commission to consider instead of appointing a Banking Commission and a Commission on Agriculture. This is a question which should have received prior consideration by the Government.  The most terrible statement of the many we have heard is that if you have money in land to-morrow, it is absolutely and entirely on a completely different basis to money invested in any other property.  Yet land is supposed to be the biggest asset and the bishops of Ireland were supposed to have looked through the Constitution and the Constitution rules. That is a very serious statement.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the obligation on allottees to take over the dwellings within a reasonable time. That is fair enough, but the Minister, in the exercise of the powers he already has, should see that in cases where dwellings are proposed to be provided those dwellings will be built within a reasonable time.  I think he has the power to see that the contracts are fulfilled.  I know cases where the land has been allotted over 3½ years, and I know ten buildings on one estate which are in various stages of construction. In some of them the roof timbers have been rotting all the winter, and there is no sign of those houses being completed. I can give the Minister the name of the estate if he wishes.  This delay is a particular hardship on the people concerned.  When they were allotted the land, some of them got married, on the understanding that houses were being built for them.  Their families will probably have grown up and emigrated before there is any sign of the houses being completed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4, standing in the names of Senator Crosbie and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  In any case where a landlord has failed to comply with the provisions of the Land Act, 1923, regarding the furnishing of particulars of rentals, etc., such tenants shall be entitled to all the benefits of the Land Acts to which they would have been entitled had the landlord complied with the provisions of the said Land Act, 1923, as from the date when the tenant made a claim to his landlord to be entitled to the benefits of the said Act or instituted proceedings to have his holding declared entitled to such benefits, and such claim was upheld by the courts, and, accordingly, the Land Commission shall include such lands in the list of vested holdings made under Section 9 of the Land Act, 1931, as extended by sub-section (1) of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is moved with the object of correcting an omission in the 1923 Land Act.  That Act compels every landlord in the State to make a return of the land let to tenants, and on failing to do so, is liable to a fine of £20.  On the passing of the 1923 Act many landlords obeyed the law and many did not, and by ignoring the law they enjoyed their full rent, which they <Col N="792" /> would not have done had they obeyed the law and made their returns, because on vesting the tenant was entitled to a reduction of at least 33? per cent. After the passing of the 1933 Act, the tenant would have received a 50 per cent. reduction on the remainder, proving how unjust it was to the tenant when the landlord failed to make his return.</P>
    <P>Tenants, when they found their landlords had not made their returns, usually proceeded by refusing to pay their rent in an effort to make their landlord do so, and after considerable delay, in which every obstacle was placed in their way, had to bring the landlord into court to compel him to make his return.  When the tenant got judgment and the court made the order, he usually found himself with five or six years' rent due at the full rate, because, under the law as it stands, he was not entitled to any of the benefits of the Act of 1923, no matter what efforts he made to get them, until the law compelled the landlord to comply with the Act.  Clearly it is to the landlord's advantage not to obey the law, even if there is a fine of £20 provided for in the Act.  That is a small sum in comparison with what the landlord has made and the tenant has lost.  In justice the tenant should be entitled to the benefits of the Act from the date on which he took action to compel the landlord to make his returns.  It is for that purpose that Senator Crosbie and myself have tabled this amendment, and I feel confident that the Minister and the Seanad will accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, that is the position, that the landlord was required to return these particulars.  But the Land Commission could not be expected to get after every landlord in the country.  The tenant who is paying the rent surely ought to have looked after his own interests.  If he did not do it, the blame cannot be left on anyone but himself.  He might not have been paying the full rent if he had taken action under the 1923 Act and compelled the landlord to lodge the particulars.  He did not do that, and, therefore, we cannot go back on it. What we are doing in the section is, we are making provision that, where particulars are lodged, the compounded arrears of rent will date from the date of the lodgment of the particulars by the landlord.  I think that is as much as can be expected.  It is a matter between the two individuals concerned. If the landlord did not comply, as I say, you could not expect the Land Commission to go round the country looking for people who were not availing of the rights given to them.  That is what happened in one case that I happen to know of.  I do not think it happened in many cases, because most tenants were well aware of the benefits that the 1923 Act conferred on them and took advantage of them.  From now on the date will be from the lodgment of the particulars, and I could not accept the amendment for that reason.</P>

      <P>There was one point made by the mover of the amendment, that the tenant had endeavoured to get the landlord to make this return and the landlord deliberately evaded the law and did not make the return.

If I were the tenant and I knew I had the right to get the benefit of a 75 per cent. reduction of arrears and then become an annuitant, I certainly think I would not have let the grass grow under my feet.  Very few people did it.  A particular case gave rise to the other amendment.  It cannot be done in this particular case retrospectively, and the provision made in the section is quite satisfactory for future cases.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (a), page 21, to delete paragraph (a) and to substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the arrears of rent payable by the tenant or owner in respect of such holding, part of a holding, or parcel which accrued due prior and up to the gale day next preceding the date on which the said particulars are furnished or the said application is lodged, but not exceeding three years of such arrears, and in addition all arrears of such rent which accrued due after such gale day up to, and which are unpaid on, the appointed day, together with an apportioned gale of such rent from the gale day next before the appointed day, shall be compounded by the addition of compounded arrears of rent to the purchase money of such holding, part of a holding, or parcel;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment raises a point of some considerable importance, and the intention is to repair a very palpable injustice that will be done unless the <Col N="795" /> Bill is so amended.  It applies only to fee farm grants and long leases. What happens is this: a tenant of a fee farm grant abstains from paying. Payment is made once a year, and the first year is gone by before the landlord knows that the rent has not been paid.  He then may proceed and have recourse to the courts.  It may be conceivably another year before the case is heard, and another year's rent may be due before then.  The tenant then says: &ldquo;I intend to apply for the redemption of this fee farm grant under the Act,&rdquo; and the judge says: &ldquo;Oh, very well, in that case I will not give an order for payment,&rdquo; and the matter stands adjourned.  Then the tenant proceeds to lodge particulars and, conceivably, three years' arrears might have accumulated before they are lodged.  The date the particulars are lodged is the date from which no rent can be recovered at all.  The rent then runs on and becomes subject to the rules for compound arrears, and from that on the delay is entirely due to the authorities because of administrative causes.  I do not know what they are, but my information is that as many as four years have gone by until the appointed day.  On the appointed day payment of the moneys is brought to credit of the vendor and the matter is closed.</P>
    <P>The House will thus see that possibly seven years' arrears may have accumulated, none of which have been recovered.  Under this Bill the vendor is entitled to the whole of the arrears, during the period between the date of the application and the appointed day, but he is entitled to nothing previous to the date of the application&mdash;there may be three years' arrears&mdash;unless the arrears after the lodging of particulars are less than three years.  There are two periods, the period prior to the date of lodging particulars, during which arrears have accumulated, and the period subsequent to the date of lodgment during which arrears continued to accumulate.  If in the latter period only two years have accumulated, then one year can be given on account of the arrears previous to the appointed day.  If three years' arrears had accumulated between the date of <Col N="796" /> lodging particulars and the appointed day, nothing can be allowed in respect of arrears prior to the appointed day. That seems manifestly unjust.  These head rents are well secured, and it is only due to the one cause, the recalcitrance of the tenant, that arrears have been allowed to accumulate, and the power of the judge to adjourn on account of the promise to lodge particulars. After the lodgment of particulars, the arrears are entirely due to administrative delays.  The effect of the amendment is to secure that all arrears, whatever they may be, shall be recoverable.  I need hardly tell the tenants that the full amount is not recoverable.  They are only recoverable as compounded arrears&mdash;75 per cent. is recoverable&mdash;and the amount is added to the purchase money.  It seems manifestly unjust that the owner should suffer at all, and I am sure the Minister is prepared in this matter to recognise the injustice, and to recommend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane is not correct in saying that this only applies to fee farm rents and long leases.  The amendment would apply to tenanted land also.  There is nothing in the Land Act, as we heard in the last case, to prevent a landlord getting a decree.  If a landlord had moved in the matter and got a decree, there is nothing in the Land Acts that could prevent him exercising his rights. The only conclusion that could be come to, if considerable arrears have been allowed to accumulate, is that the landlord must have thought he could get them, but for some reason he did not do what the man in the other case did.  That man proceeded to get a decree and the Land Acts did not interfere at all.  It was a personal debt of the person whom a decree was given against.  What this proposal amounts to is, that what the landlord failed to try to do, and had every power to do under the existing legislation, we are going to be asked to do for him.  That would mean putting goodness knows how many years' arrears that he let accumulate on top of the purchase price, and would make the annuity something that, perhaps, the land would not be security for. <Col N="797" /> That would be the effect of the amendment. What we are doing is, we are allowing all the period that may elapse between the application being lodged, or particulars furnished in the case of tenanted land&mdash;because both are included up to the appointed day, and if there are not three years in that period, then to go back to such date, previous to the lodging of the application and the furnishing of particulars, as will allow three years.  As the landlord did not exercise the rights he had, that is as much as could be expected from the Land Commission, having regard to all the circumstances. Senator Butler's amendment set out to do something the reverse of this.</P>

      <P>My impression is that in practice it only applies to fee farm grants.  It may apply in law in cases of ordinary tenanted land.  I may be wrong, but I have to act largely on information given me in these cases.  Is the Minister aware that it has been the practice of the courts not to give decrees?  Where the tenant has said: &ldquo;I am going to lodge particulars,&rdquo; the case is adjourned, decrees are not given and the landlord cannot get a decree, however much he may try.  The process of law will not give him a decree.  Is the Minister aware of that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the Supreme Court has decided that the owner may claim up to the actual appointed day.

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>The process of the courts ceases as soon as the particulars are lodged, and then arrears are running and they are given on the compounded basis.  Does the Minister not see there is an indirect injustice?  It is entirely in the hands of the Land Commission how expeditious they are after the lodgment of particulars.  If they were really expeditious, it could be done in one year, and two years would be available for the throw-back, as it were, in respect of arrears prior to the date of lodgment.  If not done in a year, it drags on until there is no surplus left to apply to the arrears prior to the date of lodgment.  I think there is a grievance in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>These delays may be occasioned, as we have seen in one case, by the tenant not exercising the rights he had and the landlord not furnishing the particulars.  There is no undue delay unless for such a reason. I am informed definitely that the right is there, by the Supreme Court decision, to the landlord, up to the appointed day&mdash;not up to the day on which the application is lodged or the particulars furnished, but up to the appointed day.  People might not have bothered, possibly for the reason that they thought they could not get the money and that it would not be worth while going after.

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is misinformed.  There is no obligation, in these cases of fee farm grants, on the landlord to furnish particulars. The initiative comes from the payee. It is quite different to the Land Act of 1923.  Under that Act there is an obligation to furnish particulars, as Senator Butler told us.  The person who pays the head rent makes the application.  The rent continues and the particulars have got to be furnished on the application of the person who pays the head rent, the tenant.</P>

      <P>The tenant makes the application and lodges the particulars, but the delay comes in the landlord's reply.  The delay occurs where landlords, I daresay for their own reasons, have been known not to reply in time <Col N="799" /> and to cause delay in that way.  I am acting on definite information that that is the thing that happens.  Undoubtedly the application is lodged by the tenant, not by the landlord, but the delay is caused in replying when the landlord is requested to say whether the particulars furnished by the applicant are correct or not.  That is where he comes in, and that is where he has delayed.</P>

      <P>I have four amendments to this section and, as they all aim at the same thing, to restrict the power given in the Bill, power given hitherto to the Land Commission to deal with tenanted land, I would like, with the permission of the House, to argue them together.</P>
      <P>I, therefore, desire to move the following amendments:&mdash;</P>
      <P>8.  To delete sub-section (1), and substitute the following sub-section:</P>
      <P>(1)  It is hereby declared and enacted that the Land Commission have and shall have power to resume, in whole or in part, any holding vested under the Land Purchase Acts in them or in the late Congested Districts Board for Ireland for the purpose of relieving congestion as defined in sub-section (4) of Section 73 of the Land Act 1923.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> 15.  To delete the section.</P>
    <P>The first amendment cuts out paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) in the Bill. The second one refers to the desirability of increasing the production of food supplies.  That has been included in various Bills up to now, but it is an extremely vague term and it goes from mushrooms to mutton.  With the change in policy of any Government the farmer would not know where he stands on the question of food supplies. The third amendment is a simple one, and the final one tries to limit the acquisition of tenanted land.</P>
    <P>In his reply to the Second Reading debate the Minister made a very reasonable and very moderate speech, and, although I do not agree with a great deal of what he said, I must admit there was a lot of common sense in it.  I propose to deal with him in exactly the same way, although he may not agree with some of my arguments.</P>
    <P>There are three reasons why I want to limit this question of the acquisition of tenanted land.  The first one is the 16 millions of deadweight debt which we are already actually carrying in respect of the activities of the Government in the matter of land legislation. In this there is no consideration for the further four millions of practically irrecoverable debt which we have contracted by estate improvement.  The second is that we have already over one-fifth of all the agricultural land in the country divided, and the third is that&mdash;although it has been mentioned already&mdash;so long as the original mistake of destroying fixity of tenure is continued, particularly in the case of tenanted land, so long will there be a sense of insecurity among those who conduct the only industry which supports the credit of the country and incidentally makes possible our industrial experiments.</P>
    <P>There are several other matters of major importance, but I think that these three will suffice entirely for my argument, with the exception of one other to which I should like to draw attention, and that is the very large amount of money which we expend, not entirely on the acquisition and sale <Col N="803" /> of land, but on the staff of the Land Commission, both senior and junior members, amounting to 1,112, at a yearly expenditure in salaries and wages of £378,000.  Although this sum is not all attributable to this particular item, I suggest that a curtailment of the Commission's activities would release a considerable amount of money for the relief of congestion and for the provision of holdings of untenanted land elsewhere.  According to the last Land Commission report&mdash;admittedly a year old, but the latest report we have &mdash;there are in the hands of the Land Commission 1,454,000 acres of untenanted land, and the report goes on to say that a large area, in addition, is under preliminary inquiry with a view to inspection.  That means that, in the pockets of the Land Commission, so to speak, there are very considerable quantities of untenanted land, but at the same time there has been division of tenanted land to a very considerable extent.  Now, Sir, I cannot see why this has been.</P>
    <P>If you examine this report you will find that 390 holdings, amounting to 62,541 acres, have been already acquired, and the serious thing is that, if you take the average size of a farm, according to these figures, it works out at an average of 160 acres.  That is one point, but it goes a bit further.  It is under contemplation to acquire another 392 holdings, which average 90 acres. Now, as a number of large estates are included in these figures, it is obvious that there must be many of these holdings which do not reach the average, and it is the farm of between, say, 80 and 110 acres, which an ordinary man with his family is capable of running with very little outside labour&mdash;all the labour, practically, being done by the man and his family&mdash;which, as a general rule in this country, is worked the best and to its absolute capacity.</P>
    <P>Now, although the Minister has assured us that the holdings in question are derelict or badly worked and that nobody has been disturbed who, you might say, has been guilty of good husbandry, one cannot but have a feeling of insecurity, when you think of those figures, and especially when, in <Col N="804" /> this Bill, all remaining legal safeguards of land legislation are taken away from us, as they were just a few minutes ago.  But, Sir, supposing for a moment &mdash;but only for a moment&mdash;that I accept that there are no cases whatever of the compulsory acquisition of tenanted land except where a farm has been found to be badly worked or derelict, the time will come when all these bad or undesirable farmers&mdash;the fellows who let the thistles grow, who neglect drainage, and so on&mdash;will have been deprived of their land, and all their land will have been absorbed, and yet there is still power given to the Minister in this Bill, without going to the Oireachtas, to go on further and further and acquire all the tenanted land in the country.  There is nothing to stop him.  For one reason or another, he has the power to do so, but surely there should be some statutory limit to the power of disturbance other than the opinion of a Land Commission inspector, because that is what it really amounts to.  What it amounts to is, that it depends on the opinion of a single Land Commission inspector who goes down and inquires into the circumstances, and, probably, only is informed of half the circumstances, and in many cases, probably, is given wrong information.  Of course, we all know that the Minister himself cannot go down and inspect these lands, and I am quite satisfied that, if it were humanly possible for him to do so, it would be all right; but the Minister cannot do that.  Well, now, although in 1923 figures were given showing that there were 100,000 congests, the fact that, since then, it has become known that tenanted land would be made available both for the relief of local congestion as well as for migration, has produced something like five times the number of claimants for land. Now, that has a most unsettling effect, and I think that the Minister, or the Government should make a definite statement as to the amount of land available in this country and the numbers who can be accommodated on it. There should be a definite statement of that kind made, and let it be definitely known what is going to be the finish of it, and I think that if that <Col N="805" /> were done a great many people would feel very much better about the whole thing.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to digress for a moment.  Notwithstanding the two remarkable cases which the Minister gave us the other day as to the profits that were made by migrants, I am afraid that the Minister may have been informed, possibly, only of the good cases, and that there are a great many other cases which have not come to his notice.  In anticipation of this debate, I took advantage of the Press and made inquiries as to how these lands, which have been sub-divided amongst the various migrants, are being used or misused. My inquiry was published for one day only, but I got a pile of letters which showed that there was a widespread interest throughout the country in this matter.  These letters cover, practically, the whole country, and they deal in detail with thousands of acres, and I am sure that they deal with cases that do not come to the notice of the Minister or his inspectors.</P>
    <P>Now, although I divided the value of these letters by about 50 per cent., because I realise that a great many of these people, naturally, would have an axe to grind or might be acting on insufficient information, I am still satisfied that a good number of them would be genuine cases and that there is real ground for inquiry by the Minister or his Department as to how this divided land is being used.  One enthusiast from Cavan gave particulars of the use that was being made of certain lands down there, and I can give the Minister the particulars afterwards, but the general gist of all these letters is that the misuse of this land consists generally of setting the land to graziers and letting the houses which have been built.  It would appear that setting is very general amongst the migrants; in some cases because they are too idle to use the land, in other cases because they have not the necessary money to use the land properly, and in other cases because they have been able to let the turbary rights.  I understand that there are also cases where land has been distributed to men who have <Col N="806" /> other occupations and who have no claim to the land.  Some of the people, it would appear, to whom this land has been granted, are actually drawing the dole, and others are not paying the rates.  My information is that some of the land is being allotted to improper persons, and I am informed that there is actual sale of allotments.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not want to make too big a case of this.  I only wish to mention the different things which I feel require examination.  Of course it is a great bribe, in the case of these claimants for land, to be told by somebody who wants to seek favour, &ldquo;Oh, you can get 22 acres in Meath, and a big grant to make it worth your while to establish yourself there,&rdquo; and that is made absolutely full use of.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading, Senator Baxter made possibly the two most important remarks in the debate.  He had the courage to say, first of all, that the ideas which he had absorbed as a young man with regard to the division of land had changed very, very considerably as a result of the knowledge he acquired of actual conditions in the country, and he went on to say that much of the money spent in migration would be very much better spent locally on the migrants' farms at home. Really when one looks at the Land Commission report, it is almost incredible to find that the average cost to the nation of settling migrants at Rathcarron is £1,410 each.  If you took that same money and spent it amongst five or six holdings in the migrants' own part of the world, you would make those people perfectly happy without any migration whatever and with less expense to the State.  A small farmer in the West has got an uneconomic holding because the land requires improvement. He requires a house, manures, labour, drainage.</P>
    <P>Imagine what could be done with £200 or £300, locally.  Without increasing State expenditure, it is really incredible what could be done with a subsidy of ten barrels of lime and a little artificial manure which they could provide out of their own pockets, and reclaiming bogland, and draining.  One would hardly believe it until one would <Col N="807" /> see it.  If you took all these moneys together which we are spending in taking up tenanted land which has already amounted to £566,000, add half the value of the Land Commission salaries and add on the improvements, there would be about 1½ million pounds to spend on the improvement of uneconomic holdings.  In that way you would change the face of the country and make the people perfectly happy without the frightful disturbance which is going on at the present moment. Sooner or later this will have to be done, and I urge a stock-taking and a slowing down so far as the tenanted land is concerned should operate at once.  Meanwhile, you have got all the untenanted land you require and you could utilise the money in improving holdings in the localities where the congests are.</P>
    <P>I have only a few more words to say on the bearing of the fixity of tenure on the question of tenanted land.  In my young days the term was almost a sacred one.  Now I find, although times have not changed a great deal, that the term is almost anathema. This view which embraces probably the greatest fact of our modern history is a very important one, but there is also the economic aspect of the unwisdom of destroying with undue haste what very wise men in their generation gave their time and their lives in obtaining for the people.</P>
    <P>I do not like to support a banker. I admit that he keeps my money safely but he charges me for it and only does it in order to make a profit, and when I get into difficulties he immediately asks for more cover.  But be fair to the Irish banks on this question of lending to the farmers.  At the present moment their total loan investments given out to farmers is 26 per cent. of their whole, and every penny of that is not lent out on the land because as a security at the present moment it is valueless, but is lent out on the personality of the farmers themselves. They go to a farmer, they judge him on his record for fair dealing and they say &ldquo;Yes, we will lend you the money,&rdquo; but were there fixity of tenure they could go to that same <Col N="808" /> farmer whom they knew to be a fair dealer and they could say, &ldquo;Yes, you have this collateral security in your land.&rdquo; They would increase their advances, for one thing, and the terms on which the advances would be made would be very much easier.</P>
    <P>I think that until the Government change their policy on this particular question of tenanted land and at the same time make it clear that they are not going to stand for organised holdups, supported by the Land Commission on many occasions whenever sale is contemplated, they will continue to keep in cold storage what is our greatest asset for getting credit in this country&mdash;and that is the main point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one remark to make in connection with Senator The McGillycuddy's statement.  He referred to his letter to the Press inviting complaints as to the way in which the land given by the Land Commission was being used in various towns, and he informed the House that he had received numerous replies telling him that this land had been very much misused, that people who were given holdings under the Land Commission schemes have been letting those holdings, and that the people who have been given turbary have in fact been selling that turbary.  We had similar statements from the Minister for Lands and it is interesting to find Senator The McGillycuddy, like Napoleon, standing up, wrapped in the isolation of his own originality, telling us such a story.  The House seems to be more or less divided between the representatives of the landlords and the representatives of the tenant farmers.  I make no apology for being on the side of the tenant farmers, and I am sure that Senator The McGillycuddy makes no apology for being on the side of the landlords.  I say that while there may be certain grievances&mdash;and there are grievances&mdash;as to how these lands are being used, that the last man who should stand up and criticise the way the small farmers are using their land is the representative of the landlord element in this country and an unapologetic representative of the class who have absolutely and recklessly misused their land, not over years <Col N="809" /> but over centuries.  I think it comes very badly from Senator The McGillycuddy to be trying to make capital out of the fact that certain lands have been re-let.  The Minister has already made that statement, and he has assured the House on more than one occasion that wherever he found such a thing had been happening those lands would be taken back from those people and reallotted to other tenants who, we hope, would be more successful farmers.  That is all I have to say on the matter.</P>

      <P>There are just one or two questions I would like to put to Senator the McGillycuddy in regard to the letter which he had published in the Press calling for information as to how the land of Ireland was being used.  Did he receive any reply from any person interested in this division, particularly with regard to migrants, informing him of the number of those people who have taken conacre from their adjoining neighbours who have tilled and put to good use the 22 or 22½ acres, as the case may be, that have been allotted?  A number of those people not only have done that, but have gone out and taken what we call conacre, that is, land from year to year, and have used that land to the best interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation.  I do not think the Senator could quite have caught what I said.  I said I did not want to make too much of this case, but that there were a good many cases of misuse of this land throughout the country which I would be glad if the Minister would look into, and I gave him the types of cases there were.  I do not wish to make a big question of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to know from the Senator, in his compilation of how the land was used, did he find out how many large farmers let the greater portion of their land to people for conacre, tillage and every other purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that in my part of the country those people who have holdings of land of from 100 acres to 300 acres use 50 <Col N="810" /> acres themselves and let the rest out in conacre from year to year, or for grazing purposes to other farmers around.  The Senator stated that instead of transferring these people from Connemara to Meath, it would be much better to give them a sum of money, £200 or £300.  I wonder does he understand their position.  If you were to divide £200 or £300 amongst them, how long would it last?  Is it his suggestion that there should be a lime subsidy of ten barrels, together with £200 or £300 for them?  If it is, I would like to see him go down to Connemara and explain that policy to the people.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the report of the Land Commission.  In that report it is stated &ldquo;that the migrants generally are doing well in their new holdings, that they have adapted themselves to their changed environment, to modern farming methods&rdquo;, and that they were raising excellent crops of potatoes, corn, etc.  The report states that each migrant is tilling more than a fourth of his holding.  I would again impress on the Minister the necessity of getting his Department to continue the good work they are doing despite any opposition they may meet with. What we in the West of Ireland and in other portions of the country feel is that the Land Commission are going too slowly.  We think there is no necessity for the Minister to insert any further provisions in the Bill on the matter of appeals, because, as things are at present, from the date an estate is acquired by the Land Commission, it takes about five years before it is divided.  The great complaint through the country is that people do not see why the Land Commission should not get ahead more quickly with its work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart altogether from the merits of the amendments before the House, I should like to take exception to the attitude of Senator Quirke on this whole matter.  I know the ill repute and the ill flavour there is about the word &ldquo;landlord.&rdquo; I heard a great deal about it in my youth.  Nobody belonging to me ever had as much land as Senator Quirke told us he was reared on.  I do think that we ought to consider these amendments on their merits without bandying <Col N="811" /> about the word &ldquo;landlord.&rdquo; The main feature in the changed policy of the Land Commission, through legislation, since 1923 is that the Land Commission now have the power to take tenanted land.  That is to say they have the power to take land from a tenant purchaser who is not a landlord in the old sense of the word.</P>
      <P>Any man who is a member of this House should be given the right to state his views.  It is good from the national point of view.  It is surely of great importance that since 1922 people who represent a particular class of any kind can come in here and state their views.  They should be allowed to state them.  Any man is entitled to his view on this question of land distribution and to state it, even Senator Quirke, but I think we should have the matter discussed without bandying about terms which, in reality, are terms of abuse, although I know they are within the limits of parliamentary language.  But why not discuss the merits of the amendments without using particular epithets which, historically, are very offensive. I do not own any land.  Senator Quirke does, and has a good deal more of the goods of this world than I have.  I am not complaining of that, and I am going to let him state his views in spite of that, but I do think we ought to have these things discussed on their merits.</P>
      <P>I know a good many small farmers who, I think, would not be quite in agreement with Senator Hawkins.  I think if you went down to Connemara and told some of the people there, in good Irish, that you were going to give them a certain number of things and £200, and leave them where they are, that they would have a welcome for you.  They might, indeed, be very enthusiastic if you knew enough Irish to explain the matter clearly to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very complicated problem, and, mind you, there is something to be said for it. <Col N="812" /> From the point of view of economics and of the Irish language, which I do not want to go into at all, I do want to say, because I know a little about Connemara and other congested areas where there is Irish, that I feel if you went to the people there with such a proposal there would not be such a <i>doicheall</i> for you.  They would have a good welcome for you.  In so doing they might not be acting in their own best interests, and it is quite conceivable that the Minister may well be doing what is best for them.  But the suggestion made by Senator The McGillycuddy is not the outrageous one that it has been represented to be, nor is it one that would be entirely rejected by congests in Connemara or Donegal.  We have now reached the stage when there are really no landlords. In our inexperience and when we had not the power we believed that the dividing of the land was a certain remedy for every ill that Ireland was heir to.  Some of us, including I imagine the Minister, believed so in our callow youth.  We have since discovered that the problem is not quite so simple.  We now have the power to divide the land, and surely that is a question that is capable of being discussed without the bandying about of abusive epithets.</P>

      <P>This is a very important section, and I hope the House will not consider that the time devoted to it is being wasted.  I am glad that Senator Hayes, who is not one of the discredited class, challenged and took Senator Quirke to task for his inability to get away from this bugbear of landlordism.  Senator Quirke is not satisfied in making landlordism a corpse, but must keep on kicking it. The Senator is for ever making those attacks when one stands up to defend security, to argue about it and about the perpetual unrest that is involved in this power of resumption.  He seems to be obsessed with an anti-landlord bias, so much so that he cannot give credit where credit is due, particularly as regards the past.  I remember well, when I was a boy, that the whole countryside came in and discussed their family affairs with their landlord. Before a marriage was arranged they <Col N="813" /> came and discussed it with him and asked his opinion.  He was looked upon as a sort of father by the whole countryside.  That was so in the case of many landlords.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about individual cases that I know of which present a very different picture indeed from that painted by Senator Quirke. At the present time one may go round the country and see in many parts fine slated dwelling-houses which were built by landlords of an earlier day.  One may realise from that that they were not quite as iniquitous as they have been represented here.  However, what we are debating here is the perpetuation of this unrest that is caused by this power of resumption.  The spirit of envy, hatred, malice and all uncharitableness has been engendered in this perpetual seething pot involved in this legislation.  The Nationalists of old&mdash;Davitt, Dillon and Parnell&mdash;I am sure some of them said so, looked forward to the day when, land purchase having been completed, there would be finality.  There is no finality, because you cannot get people to work at this business unless they know where they are.  When we see in this section the power of resumption it means endless unrest.  Everybody is looking jealously for an opportunity to get something that somebody else has already got.  It would not matter&mdash;I would not mind&mdash; if there was prospect of any satisfaction for the vast majority of these people who are looking jealously at their neighbours, but there is none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make the suggestion to the Minister that if we could get this whole question of land division cleared up it would save a great deal of money.  They should put all the strength behind the land Commission and say: &ldquo;We are willing to divide 600,000 acres, and we are going to finish it at that, and after that we are going to allow people back to the system of free trade and market values and so on.&rdquo; But they are not.  There is a large host of civil servants who are perpetuating the present state of affairs <Col N="814" /> and who are keeping this cauldron boiling all the time.  As long as that goes on there will be all these difficulties of finance and so forth attaching to this whole problem.  Would the Minister consider that that should be cleaned up, that he might spend even £2,000,000 a year on the Land Commission for the next two or three years and then let us know where we are and let us settle down to some sort of security?  The present state of affairs only means a perpetuation of the unrest and of these difficulties of credit that we are hearing about.</P>
    <P>I do not want to raise this question of credit again, but everybody knows why this is going on.  The fact is that credit on the land is disastrous.  Going back to this question of resumption under this section I see the four subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d), under which land can be taken.  Where is the power to take land if it is not being put to proper use?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>This has practically the same effect.  Land can be resumed if it is being improperly used, as well as for these reasons.  I would like the Minister to say what is meant by those words: &ldquo;The Land Commission shall give, in the prescribed manner to the person appearing to be in occupation of the holding&rdquo; and so on.  What is the meaning of the words &ldquo;the prescribed manner&rdquo;?  Will the occupier be told that the land is to be taken for the purpose of (a), (b), (c) or (d), or if it is to be taken on account of its not being properly used.  I cannot see how, unless full particulars are given of the reason the land is going to be taken, the occupier can enter into a defence.  Then, what is the procedure under which this petition is heard?  Is all the protection of the courts of law allowed, is counsel allowed to appear, is the valuer or the person who makes the charge allowed to state his reasons, and are they tested in cross-examination, and are all safeguards given to the occupier before his property is taken away?  I consider unless all those safeguards are <Col N="815" /> provided, there is liable to be great injustice in the resumption of land. Senator the McGillycuddy has rather suggested that we should go slower in resumption, and that only untenanted land should be distributed quickly.  I think, on the whole, that it would be better if we went very quickly and finished the work, and got back to sanity and fair dealing and security in the holding of land.</P>

That was the final figure in the end of the column, but that is the total amount of land to be acquired, and in respect of some of it there are still proceedings going on.

      <P>There was a general debate&mdash;and there was bound to be, I am sure, on a question like this&mdash;on credit and other things.  In the first amendment we are dealing with, it is proposed only to have power to acquire land for the purpose of relieving congestion. If we had got only that power a lot of hardship might be inflicted. The case of employees, evicted tenants and so on, could not be considered. I am sure the Senator did not realise that when putting down the amendment.  If the amendment were accepted that would be one of the effects.  We intend, so far as we possibly can&mdash;as I said on a number of previous occasions&mdash;to devote the remainder of the land which the Land Commission may acquire to the relief of congestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Very largely.  Where the land is required to be resumed, they <Col N="816" /> will be put into economic possession, or where there is congestion some of them will be induced to relieve the congestion and come on to the new estates. I think the Senator might withdraw the amendment in view of that.  I do not think that he would want to restrict us entirely to migration with these people.  There may be people losing their employment, representatives of evicted tenants, prevented from getting justice.</P>
      <P>The next amendment proposes to delete the reference to the food supply. This is one of the circumstances which are taken into consideration when the Land Commission is proceeding to acquire or resume land.  It is one of the points on which there will be a defence for the land owner, if he is able to show that the land is producing food &mdash;an adequate supply of food&mdash;for the farm.  That is a good defence, and it means that the land will not be taken from him.  I do not see what is to be gained by deleting that.  It is one of the considerations&mdash;an important one&mdash; that will have a bearing on whether land will be acquired or not.</P>

I think if he went to a small Kerry farmer and said: &ldquo;Now, I have men here and materials to build a new house and to drain the land and to make it productive,&rdquo; I think he would kiss him.  I raised the question of food supplies only because, by reason of the varied policies of Governments&mdash;one day, the bullock and grass and another day, tillage&mdash;the farmer does not know where he is.  The phrase &ldquo;food supplies&rdquo; is extremely vague and it never occurred in legislation before.  I suggest that it should be more clearly defined.</P>
      <P>The third amendment dealt with school playgrounds, and I think that if a village, or town, wants such things, they should be bought in the open market, in the same way as housing plots are acquired.  Do I gather from the Minister that his policy in the future is going to be congests, first of all, and landless men after?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (1), to add the following words: &ldquo;paragraph (c) of this sub-section shall not be applied except with the concurrence of the Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment provides that the resumption of a holding by the Land Commission for the purpose of increasing the food supply of the country shall not take place, except with the concurrence of the Minister for Agriculture. I should like the Minister to give it favourable consideration because the primary function of the Land Commission, in my view, is to divide land. The division of land is their scheme of things.  The function of the Department of Agriculture, obviously, is to have the land of the country used as well as it can be for the production of the greatest quantity of food, and, as I said on Second Reading, there is not, in my judgment anyway, that coordination of thought and effort between the two Departments that will give the best return from the land. That ought to be the aim because, collectively, the people of this country will be well-off or poor, in proportion to the total production we get from our land.  It does not matter a pin's point whether that production is on the hills of Kerry, or in the County Meath.  My view is that if you abandon lands in Kerry and allow them to go back to the wilds, the total wealth of the country will drop to the extent to which these lands were in the past used for the production of food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister for Agriculture were discussing this entire scheme, he would look at the policy from a rather different angle from that of the Minister for Lands and I should like to see some effort at a co-ordinated policy particularly when you are going to consider the resumption of lands merely because the lands are deemed not to be used in such a way that the greatest possible increase in the food supply of the country can be obtained. There are two points of view expressed about this.  One is terribly incomplete and very uninformed, and it is expressed, <Col N="819" /> strangely enough, by people in the towns who go out to the country now and again, look at grass and abuse it when they come back.</P>
    <P>It is quite conceivable that it can be argued that land used in a particular way is not producing as much food as it would if used in another way.  When we come to that point, I prefer, and I think it would be better, even from the point of view of the Land Commission, that reference should be had to the point of view of the Minister for Agriculture as to whether or not land is being used as it ought to be used for the purpose of increasing the food supply of the country.  I do not think the men whose main responsibility is the division of land are the people to pass judgment on whether land is being efficiently used or not.</P>
    <P>I am quite convinced that the best use being made of some of the land of the country is in the production of good grass and the fact is that by far the greater area of land in this country is under grass.  Eight million acres out of about 12 million acres of arable land are under grass.  There must be very considerable wealth coming from those eight million acres of grass land or the people could not continue to live on the land.  From my point of view, we are not getting as much from our grass land as we might.  I am not going into the difficulties that stand in the way, but it is frequently held as a justification, particularly by those who demand the distribution and breaking up of land, that the land is under grass. There could be no greater fallacy put forward by anyone who understands the economics of agriculture.  I can understand an individual member of this, or the other, House, or some person outside, who knows nothing about land, who has never worked it, and indeed who has very little sympathy with the men who have to struggle through trying years, with summers, winters, harvests and springs that go against them, enunciating a policy which is contrary to all the known laws of economics in the running of a farm, but amongst men who understand the handling of land none of these can be found.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> I have no need to argue that land under grass cannot be as efficiently and as usefully employed in the production of food as land otherwise used.  What I fear, Sir, is that there will be a case made and a great deal of pressure exercised on the Land Commission under the plea of getting a greatly increased food supply for the country, and that the way to get that increased food supply is by going in and taking land that is under grass so that it may be put under the plough.  In this I am not thinking of people with large estates at all.  I am thinking of people who have holdings vested under the Land Purchase Acts which the Minister is taking power in this clause to resume and he is seeking to justify it under all these separate clauses.  I am thinking of it under that head.  Hence it is that I am arguing that it would be a very good thing for the Land Commission to be able to refer the question to the Department of Agriculture and to the Minister for Agriculture whose primary function is to look after the land, to get the most out of it and to instruct the people how they are to get the most out of it.</P>
    <P>Senators can see the advantage there would be in having the concurrence of the Minister for Agriculture when it is proposed to resume land because it may seem necessary to do so for the purpose of increasing the food supply in the country.  I have not put the amendment down for the purpose of restricting the Minister in his desire to resume possession of a particular holding if there is justification for the Land Commission doing so.  But there can be differences of opinion.  In my opinion anyway, the point of view of the Minister for Agriculture ought to be a sound one.  There are those who say that if the point of view and the opinion of the Minister for Agriculture was available as to the type of applicants and their suitability to be put on particular holdings, a much better type of agriculturist would be selected by the Land Commission for holdings of land.  I am not going to go into that now for I want to keep close to my amendment.  If the Minister is prepared to accept the amendment I am satisfied it will be a safe <Col N="821" /> guard to him against the sort of campaign that can be so easily and ill-advisedly started.  As far as the economics of agriculture are concerned terribly unbalanced and ill-informed campaigns are often started.  We have the case made that because the land is used in a particular way it is not as good for the country as if it were used in another way.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister ought to try to meet my point of view on that.  I think, in view of the attitude and general outlook of the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Lands can be quite safe in feeling that no obstacle is going to be put in his way. It is a good thing to have a second point of view about these things.  Once a deed is done it is done, and injustice can easily be done.  I am talking about farmers, and if farmers feel that the Minister for Agriculture can be consulted in a matter like this they will feel a confidence which I believe is lacking under the sub-section as it is.</P>

      <P>I am not going into the various points made by Senator Baxter during debate on this amendment. I quite agree that we require a lot of land in the country under grass, but I would be prepared to maintain that there is really too much grass land in this country.  The Minister has emphasised here that the idea of this Bill is to increase uneconomic holdings to an economic size.  If there is anything to be done that is necessary in that direction, I have no objection, whether it is done under the Minister for Agriculture or under the Minister for Lands, but I do not see any great necessity for the amendment.  The object of the Bill is to do that work&mdash; to increase the size of uneconomic holdings.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. The Minister has said here and in the Dáil that any land fairly well worked and used for the production of food will not be acquired by the Land Commission.  Who is to be the judge of that?  Is it the Land Commission or the Department of Agriculture?  If it is the Department of Agriculture, I think the suggestion in the amendment <Col N="822" /> is a very sound one&mdash;that the land cannot be acquired without the approval of the Minister for Agriculture. Senator Baxter has made a case that I think is irrefutable.  I really cannot see why the Minister should have any objection to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I cannot see how I could possibly accept the amendment. I would like to point out that even the concurrence of the Minister for Lands is not required.  Section 6 of the 1933 Land Act takes the question of the resumption of land, the price to be fixed and the people who are to get the land entirely out of the province of the Minister for Lands.  How can I, in this Bill, give power to another Minister which the Minister for Lands has not got?  The Land Commission are entirely independent in this matter. Senator Douglas asked me in what respect they were independent.</P>
      <P>Some one did mention here to night that the two Appeal Commissioners were irremovable except by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas and the Lay Commissioners are irremovable except for misconduct. They can be removed without the approval of both Houses.  There is no Minister in the matter at all.  That is one of the things laid down under the Land Act of 1933.  I would say that there is no question of Departments of State working in a sort of watertight compartments.  There is consultation. The Land Commission officials are constantly consulting with the officials of the Department of Agriculture. That happens all through the services. Any information that can be got or that is in the possession of one Department is available to the officials of the other Department.  It would be out of the question to bring in the Minister for Agriculture where the Minister for Lands has nothing to do in this matter of land acquisition and distribution.</P>

      <P>That particular point was debated but it opens up another question.  That point was vigorously raised when the 1933 Land Act was going through.  We had all this thing about pressure being brought to bear on Ministers and Deputies.  There would be no confidence if the Minister for Agriculture had a say in the matter.  Deputy Cosgrave suggested the same thing in the other House and I had on the Fifth Stage there to remind him that that was a thing I insisted on.  This body which is semi-judicial ought to have the last say and if they have the last say the matter is safe in their hands.  The Land Commission are not going to take grass lands simply because they are grass lands.  They are not going to take over a 500-acre estate or 1,000-acre estate simply because of that.  They must have regard to the use to which the lands are put.  I would say that in view of the actual position, to do what is proposed here in this amendment, would be perfectly ridiculous.</P>

      <P>During this debate here I understand the Minister gave a number of assurances as to what the Land Commission will do; now we have his statement that he has no say whatever in the matter.  That is what has been puzzling me&mdash;the two contradictory statements.  It seems to me that all these assurances given by the Minister ought to be in the Bill.  The assurances we have heard are quite valueless in view of the Minister's own statement that he had no say in this.  He has told us so repeatedly.  How can he give assurances then when, as he says, he has no real say in the matter?</P>

      <P>He has.  That is a different matter from directly interfering <Col N="824" /> in the work of taking land from a particular person and deciding the particular person to whom the land is to be given.  The Minister can say that migrants must be given precedence or that uneconomic holders must get precedence or that ex-employees on an estate must get preference before others.  He can lay down a general lands policy.  But, undoubtedly, his concurrence in the acquisition of land, in the resumption of land which is the work here, is a matter on which he has no say at all.</P>

Is this, or is it not, a matter in which the Minister can see that his assurance is carried out?  It seems to me that if he gives us that assurance, he must have power, if any case arises in which an attempt is made to take land that is being properly worked, to stop that, otherwise his assurance is of no value.</P>

The people to say it, in this instance, are the Land Commission after they have heard the case pro and con.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given an assurance to the House that if land is being properly worked for the purpose of producing food, it is not going to be interfered with; but how will he see that that assurance is carried out? How will he know, without some interference on his part, that in fact it is being carried out?  I do not want the Minister or the House to misunderstand me.  I quite accept that he means what he says, but this is an <Col N="825" /> entirely separate point from the other. It is an entirely different sub-head. It is somewhat more technical, if you like.  It is a matter really on which the technical staff of the Minister for Agriculture would be the most competent to pass judgment.  We know what Land Commission inspectors are. They are, no doubt, estimable men, and they are capable of giving a balanced judgment, but, from my experience, the predominant consideration with them is to obtain land for the purposes of sub-division.  The predominant consideration, on the other hand, with the Minister for Agriculture and his officials is to see that the land is efficiently used.  I am not suggesting that the Minister for Agriculture, or indeed the Minister for Lands, should come in any place other than in this particular and specific instance.  I cannot say I am convinced&mdash;and I am quite open to be convinced&mdash;by the Minister's statement that merely because his own name is not mentioned in this connection, the concurrence of the Minister for Agriculture should not be sought.  The Minister for Agriculture will never come in on the general question of the resumption of holdings; his concurrence will be sought only on the point of the resumption of holdings under a particular and specific sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view is that the Minister ought to take into account the point of view of the Minister for Agriculture as well as that of his own Ministry as I know myself there are two points of view about this matter.  You will get two points of view as between the staff of the Minister for Agriculture and the staff of the Minister for Lands.  I know what I am talking about and I should like the Minister to give this consideration.  I am only trying to get from the Minister what I think would be a definite improvement in the Bill. I should be quite prepared to withdraw this amendment if the Minister would say that he would give consideration to it to see whether there was not something of value in it.  I am convinced myself there is.  If you are going to resume a holding, because in your judgment you can increase the food supply of the nation by so doing, I believe the people who should be consulted <Col N="826" /> before coming to a decision on that matter are the technical people whose job it is to know how best you can use the land and who, probably, have been watching how the land has been cultivated.  You can easily, through an officer of the Department of Agriculture, an inspector of the Department or a county agricultural instructor, get information as to what should be done in the case of a particular holding.  There may be a history attached to a particular holding. There may be some information concerning it of which the Land Commission inspector cannot be aware and, from what he sees at a particular time, he is not able to give a fair decision.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any insuperable difficulty in the Minister's agreeing to the suggestion put forward in this amendment. I do not think there is much in the Minister's point of view that simply because the Minister for Lands is not mentioned in this particular part of the section, the Minister for Agriculture should not be mentioned in it.  If I were asking to have the name of the Minister for Agriculture inserted in such a way that he would be able to pass judgment upon the general provisions of the Bill, it would be an entirely different matter.  This has reference merely to a technical point and I would ask the Minister to give it more favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely to apply the test of whether land is or is not producing food for the nation is a very unfair way of determining this matter. Is no regard to be had at all to the factor of profit?  Supposing it can be proved that by a certain type of agriculture I make so much profit or loss, and that by another type I make less profit or less loss, as the case may be, is no consideration to be given to that fact?  Do you mean to say that that is not going to be taken into consideration, that the only test is how much food is going to be produced irrespective of the profit-earning aspect?  The whole thing seems a most extraordinary doctrine to apply in that one-sided manner.  Everybody has a right to use his property in any way he thinks fit. I believe, however, we have already <Col N="827" /> come to a decision on that matter; but if you have got to have some test, I say that it is altogether wrong to impose upon the owner of land a condition of operation which may involve him in loss whereas another method may yield him a profit.  The whole thing shows the extent of the morass in which the Government is floundering on this whole matter.  The Minister never told us what the procedure in connection with the Lay Commissioners would be, or as to how they are to decide that land is not producing sufficient food.  Is there merely to be a bald statement to that effect?</P>

      <P>I would make a strong appeal that that should not be done.  It is the one and only solution that would be intensely inconvenient to me.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry about this intense inconvenience to individuals, but people who become Members of Parliament&mdash;as many of us know from experience&mdash;do find themselves seriously inconvenienced from time to time.  Without being offensive, I have no regard whatever for any individual Member's personal convenience. We could finish the Land Bill by 12 o'clock to-morrow, then take the motion, and, at an agreed hour, Senator MacDermot could conclude.</P>

      <P>It is not easy to see what is behind Senator Hayes' suggestion except his own personal convenience.</P>

      <P>If we are going to meet to-morrow this motion has been on the paper so long that we ought to hear what is behind it, and finish it.</P>

      <P>It is a most abnormal thing for either House of the Oireachtas to sit on Friday afternoon, and nobody should be expected to make plans in advance on the assumption that it will be sitting.</P>

      <P>The Chair would very much prefer that this matter should be decided outside the House.  The Committee Stage of the Land Bill will be resumed in the morning, and then the Seanad will be in the position to decide its further action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter for a ruling.  When we resume to-morrow an arrangement may have been come to as to the taking of the motion.</P>

      <P>I am concerned with the convenience of the Taoiseach, who is to be present, presumably, during all the discussion on the motion.  I understand he has undertaken to do so.  I think the House ought to have some consideration for his convenience.  Is he to sit here or sit in his office until the Seanad makes up its mind to take the motion?  I think that would be grossly unfair to the Taoiseach, and I do not think it is the desire of the House to treat him in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The strong view of the Chair is that this matter should be arranged outside the House.  There will be an opportunity to arrange something definite before to-morrow.  It cannot, obviously, be done by way of exchanges across the House.</P>

      <P>I understood that the motion was to be taken to-morrow after completion of the Committee Stage of the Land Bill, and that we would go on until such time as we completed the motion.</P>
