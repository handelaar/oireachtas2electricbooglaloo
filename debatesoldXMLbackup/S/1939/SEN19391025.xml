      <P>I am sure that all Senators are already aware of the purpose of the Bill.  Its purpose is to amend the law so as to enable the Irish Red Cross Society to raise funds by means of sweepstakes. The Bill is urgent as it is hoped to run the sweepstake in connection with a race at Leopardstown in January next, and in order to enable the tickets to <Col N="1266" /> be sold it is necessary that the Bill should be passed as soon as possible. Consequently, it is hoped that Senators will agree to take all stages of the Bill to-day.</P>
      <P>Any sweepstakes held under the Bill will be organised on the same lines as the Hospitals Sweepstakes and they will be governed by the restrictions contained in the Public Hospitals Act, 1933.  That Act fixes 30 per cent. of the receipts of each sweepstake as the maximum which may be charged as expenses.  If the expenses of a sweepstake held under this Bill exceed 30 per cent. of the receipts the excess will have to be borne by the promoters.  No claim can be made by the promoters for compensation under the Public Hospitals (Amendment) Act, 1939, as Section 8 of the Bill provides specifically that that Act will not apply to any sweepstake held under the Bill.  The scheme for each sweepstake will require the sanction of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>Hospitals Trust, Limited, have agreed to promote any sweepstake which the Red Cross Society may decide to hold.  I understand that it is proposed to run a special race at Leopardstown on the 13th January, 1940, for the first sweepstake.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of the Red Cross Society to make contributions from the proceeds of the sweepstake to similar societies throughout the world in accordance with the wishes of the subscribers. The basis of distribution will be specified in the schemes for the sweepstake.  I understand that on the tickets there will be a space for persons to declare to what society they would wish a percentage of the money subscribed to be devoted.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that both the Hospitals Committee and Hospitals Trust, Limited, are satisfied that sweepstakes in aid of the Red Cross will not in any way prejudice the Hospitals Sweepstakes.  In fact they believe that the effect will be beneficial. I understand that it is intended to organise a sweepstake in aid of the hospitals on the Grand National of 1940, or on some substituted race.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that he would like all stages of this Bill to be taken to-day and, so far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we have no objection to that being done.  I am in favour of the Bill myself for a number of reasons.  A few weeks ago in this House Senator Sir John Keane and Senator MacDermot spoke in a way that seemed to suggest that they were rather peeved that we were nonbelligerent in the present war.  With that point of view I have no sympathy whatever.  I said on that occasion, the theory that when there is going to be any war in the world it must be made universal is a theory with which I have no sympathy.  At the same time, I feel that, arising out of the present war, we in this country may be called upon for certain corporal works of mercy. I feel that we cannot stand aside in the present situation as though we were not our brother's keepers in any way. Therefore I should like the Red Cross organisation in this country to have at its disposal very considerable funds to be used when occasion calls for them. We already have had an occasion when Irish activity was called upon in the case of the landing of the survivors of the Athenia in Galway.</P>
      <P>Now, that sort of thing, or analogous things, may happen from time to time in the course of this war, and I think everybody will agree that it is desirable, when we have a first opportunity, so to speak, not of belligerent action, but of assisting in the relief of the suffering arising from this war, that we should not be handicapped for a lack of funds.  Consequently, I welcome, as I am sure we will all welcome, the organisation of this sweepstake in aid of the Irish Red Cross and in aid of the Red Cross in other countries, according to the wishes of subscribers, as has been explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I really wish that I could let this matter pass without any criticism whatever, but unfortunately there are certain things in connection with it which do hit one in the eye.  Of course, we all know that, when you are starting a new organisation, you naturally look <Col N="1268" /> around for a number of people to act as a committee in order to put that organisation on its feet.  Now, I have seen in the papers a list of the men nominated by the Government to the governing body of the Irish Red Cross. I looked at that list and I shall tell you quite frankly how the list struck me.  I saw the names there of certain people who had been prominently associated with the St. John Ambulance Brigade who, <i>ipso facto,</i> more or less naturally would go on to such a governing body, or men who, by their eminence in the medical profession, let us say, would be naturally regarded as suitable.  Then, however, I looked down the list in order to see why, apart from the kind of people I have mentioned, one person rather than another should have been appointed to that body.  I looked through the list to see if medical men, for instance, were chosen on account of their eminence in their profession.  Looking at it as an impartial observer, and trying to get an idea as to what reason these people were selected by the Government&mdash;apart, as I say, from those who would automatically, so to speak, be nominated to such a body&mdash;as far as I could see the only unifying point amongst these nominees was their known activity in the service of the Party organisation of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Now, I am being perfectly straight in this matter.  I saw the names on that list of two men who had both, what you might call, held positions analogous to that of the D.M.S. in the Army, but who had held such a position in forces operating against this State.  I was struck by the inclusion of names of men whose only distinction, that I knew of, was that they had Fianna Fáil associations, and by the omission of the names of men who were eminent in the medical profession but who were not supporters of that Party.  Now, I do not want to stress this too much.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should say at this point that this matter does not appear to me to arise on this Bill.  The council was set up by the Minister for Defence under the Red Cross Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, Sir, but I am only bringing it in order to show that we are now promoting legislation the purpose of which is to get money from the Irish public for this organisation, the controlling body of which will be nominees of the Government who, presumably, will have to do with the collection and expenditure of that money.  I think it is relevant in this way: that in such circumstances as now exist, even more than in ordinary circumstances&mdash;and in speaking as I am now I only want to give the Government an opportunity of reassuring the country at the present moment as to the position, and we are all very anxious to assist the Government in every possible way&mdash;it is necessary for the Government to show that it is giving the country a fair deal and that it is not using the present position, when, as one might say, our lips are closed to discussion, to do things that might not bear discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I have had experience of the starting of organisations, and I can quite understand that anybody who has to do with the starting of an organisation has to get an organising committee, or a committee of a temporary nature, to run that organisation, and that such a person often has to choose the people nearest to him and those whom he knows best.  Consequently, I would be completely in agreement, if such a committee were known to be of a temporary nature, but the fact which hits me in the eye is that these new members who have been selected by the Government&mdash;apart from those who, as I say, would naturally be on such a committee&mdash;are all of the one, and only one, political persuasion.  As I have said, I myself have had to do with the starting of such organisations, and I know that it is usual in such cases to get an organising body together that would function for six months or 12 months, as the case might be, in order to get the preliminary work done, and then the organisation that was formed would elect its own controllers.  I would be quite happy, therefore, if the Minister would say that these nominees of the Government have been put there for <Col N="1270" /> the purpose of getting this thing under way and that then, after six months or 12 months, or whatever may be the necessary period, another method of setting up a controlling body will he brought about.  I would suggest, for instance, that, since the Red Cross Society is an organisation notably associated with the medical profession, the correct way would be for the various institutions associated with medicine in this country, on a sort of vocational line, to be invited to nominate their own selections to this body.  I should like to have some assurance from the Government on that point, because a number of people outside have remarked to me that the Government, apparently, have selected &mdash;apart from those who, as I say, were associated with the St. John Ambulance Brigade and so on&mdash;only those doctors who were of a certain political persuasion, and that the only grounds that seem explainable to the public for the selecting of these people were that they were of the one political persuasion.</P>
    <P>Now, I have no objection to these people being nominated to such a body. As I have remarked, the names of two of these were associated with the equivalent rank of D.M.S. in the Irregular forces in 1922-23.  I have no objection to their being members of this body, no more than I think that there would be any harm in having two people who had held the position of D.M.S. in the Army.  As I say, I have no objection to that, or to the fact that doctors might have certain political views supporting the present Government&mdash;very far from it, and in fact I think it might be quite desirable to give such nominations to people of a particular political persuasion.  As far as I can see, however, this has been a holus-bolus selection of political partisans.  Perhaps the Minister will assure us on this matter.</P>
    <P>Now, there is another thing to which I should like to refer.  The Hospitals Sweep was founded some years ago and it went on merrily and received wonderful support both in this country and in other countries, and as far as I can see the first change in its success, <Col N="1271" /> from the upward grade, was when the Minister for Finance&mdash;and we have every sympathy with him in his efforts to secure money&mdash;looked around for new hen-roosts to raid and imposed a new tax on the Hospitals Sweepstake Trust.  That, undoubtedly, brought about at that time a very considerable reaction in England, because it was felt that here we were in this country seeking funds which were nominally to be used for the help of the sick poor, but from which the Government evidently saw a chance of enriching the national Exchequer.  Now, in the case of the present sweep, with which we are dealing, we are told that the money subscribed will be made available to the countries associated with the Red Cross, in accordance with the wishes of the subscribers; and that is very good.  Mind you, I do not want to close up any avenue of money to the Government at the present time, and I am sure none of us wishes to do so, but it does seem to me that the taking of that money injures the Hospitals Sweepstake.  It was not enriching the country.</P>
    <P>At the present time it would be an assistance to this Bill if the Minister gave an assurance that the arrangement made by the Government about 1933, or whenever it was, for seizing an amount of this money for the Exchequer would not be pursued in the present case.  I am sorry to have to refer to another matter, to the political colour of the nominees of the governing body, because it is a thing which has hit people in the eye for some time. One would not mind if one saw a man from Fianna Fáil, who was a strong partisan if, at the same time, he was a man of great distinction in the medical profession.  I saw one name on the list that I recognised as eminently distinguished in the medical profession. As far as the others go, why was A chosen instead of B?  The only answer that comes to mind is because he has been a very strong Fianna Fáil supporter. Apart from that, and independent of that, I may say, as far as I am concerned, that I intend to support this Bill, and I understand that on this <Col N="1272" /> side it is proposed to facilitate the Minister in getting all stages to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it desirable to follow Senator Fitzgerald into the political aspect of the Red Cross organisation, but I ask if we can get a frank statement from those who know, as to the objects of this Red Cross Society.  I only say that in the interests of the society itself.  There is at present certain apprehension, as there always is in this country unfortunately, founded to a great extent on rumour, and to a certain extent on suspicion, as to how the funds of this organisation may be used.  I am sure the greater frankness we have the better it will be for everybody and for the society itself, in that it will encourage people to subscribe who may, at the moment, be somewhat hesitant.  The general functions of the Red Cross Society are well understood, and this organisation, I understand, is on all lines with the existing Red Cross Societies with headquarters at Geneva, but we should like to see the Government in a position to give information, because they are footing the scheme in the Bill, and also to be more explicit as to the term &ldquo;war,&rdquo; and those who are suffering as a result of war.  Unfortunately &ldquo;war&rdquo; has many and varied meanings.  We ought to have an assurance that it is only war between constituted authorities and politically constituted sovereign States is referred to.  I need not develop the point, that there is a loophole, and that &ldquo;war&rdquo; in another sense&mdash;civil war, for instance&mdash;might be called &ldquo;war,&rdquo; but I do not imagine that the victims of civil war would be eligible for the receipt of assistance out of these funds. Similarly I should like to know&mdash;I suppose the answer would be in the affirmative&mdash;if sufferers from, say, Poland and refugees generally from Europe, would be eligible for support from the Red Cross Funds.  In fact, speaking generally, the more explicit the assurances the better it will be for the Red Cross Society itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself there are one or two points that I should like <Col N="1273" /> to deal with.  I should like to know from the Minister why</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the society&rdquo; means the Irish Red Cross Society;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;foreign society&rdquo; means a society or organisation in a country other than Ireland which has objects or functions similar or analogous to those of the society;</P>
    <P>Why cannot that be simply made any other Red Cross Society affiliated to the International Red Cross Society at Geneva?  Why should not a grant be given outside this country to other Red Cross Societies?  I think that would make the matter much clearer and the meaning much less susceptible to rather indefinite use.  In the same way, I should like the Minister to say why the Government wants power to control this scheme.  Surely, when so much money is available from the sweepstakes, it would be sufficient to hand it over to a properly and legally constituted body called the Irish Red Cross Society.  Why should it be necessary for the Minister to attach any conditions to the use of the money? I was hoping that the Government would keep out of it altogether, beyond giving the constituted authorities power to raise the money and having got the money, handing it over unconditionally to the Red Cross Society which is bound by statutory rules and obligations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer not to take part in this debate as I was at the inauguration of the society, and have been for some time interested in the promotion of the Hospitals Sweepstakes. Surely there are certain misunderstandings going about, and seeing that there are, as a Senator I might help to get rid of them.  Senator Fitzgerald said he would not criticise the structure of the central council of the society, if it were there simply for the purpose of organising the society, and then handing it over to the Government. The central council was nominated by the former Minister for Defence to organise and control the society up to next June.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>After that the branches of the society which, it is hoped, will be formed will elect their own governing body.  I think that takes away something from the criticism that was made.  I heard the criticism that was referred to to-day.  I have been at every meeting of the council, and speaking from my experience, I think it was not in any sense a political body or that anyone was there because of political attachments. There has been criticism by others similar to that put forward by Senator Fitzgerald to-day, and when it was made I regretted that the council and its constitution should be left open to what I believe is an entire misconstruction. It is possible that some of my medical friends, who have been nominated on the council by the Minister, have had strong attachments to the Party to which the Government belongs, but apart from that, it would be impertinence to suggest that they were not excellent and representative men in the medical profession.  One of the gentlemen that, I think, Senator Fitzgerald had in mind is, in fact, President of the Irish Medical Union at the moment.  Another was the former honorary secretary of that union who was mainly responsible for its foundation within the last half-dozen years. If, as Senator Fitzgerald had suggested, the Medical Union had been asked to recommend certain names to the Minister for Finance, I am sure such gentlemen as these would be amongst those who would be suggested, regardless of whatever might have been their political opinions or regardless of what suspicions there might have been about their political leanings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald said that the first hitch in the history of the sweepstake had been when the Minister for Finance of the Fianna Fáil Government put his hand into the bag.  There was a hitch before that when the Minister for Local Government and Public Health of the previous Government had got his hand into the bag.  That was when the descent in principle began and when the funds for the particular <Col N="1275" /> purpose for which the sweeps were founded were deflected to another purpose. That was when money was granted from the sweepstakes for the relief of rates and for the relief of the public purse.  That has been done and Senator Sir John Keane and I would not have thought it necessary to raise the point now if this matter had not been referred to by Senator Fitzgerald.</P>
    <P>I was about to draw attention to another point to which Senator Sir John Keane has referred, that is the rather loose definition of &ldquo;foreign society&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Foreign society&rdquo; is defined in the Bill as an expression that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;means a society or organisation in a country other than Ireland which has objects or functions similar or analogous to those of the society.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need to have the definition as loose as that. Almost every country has recognised the Red Cross Society.  That is recognised by its own Government and vouched for by its own Government&mdash; the international organisation in Geneva and Paris.  I think we would lose nothing if the definition would be a reference to the Red Cross Society in some other country.  With the loose definition that is here it is possible that difficulties may arise about the granting of moneys to societies which, though having excellent objects, might not have the same recognised position and might not be regarded as non-sectional in other countries.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider that matter in the second clause of Section 2 before the Bill is carried through this House.</P>
    <P>Certain fears have been expressed as to the possibility of this project on behalf of the Red Cross Society interfering with the functioning of the Hospitals Sweepstakes.  I am bound to say that those who have studied the question are of opinion that so far from interfering with the Hospitals Sweepstakes this project will benefit them. What I mean is that this country will <Col N="1276" /> become more popular because of its desire and its efforts to contribute something to the welfare of people in other countries.  Certainly it has to be admitted that the contribution to the Red Cross Society in other countries is somewhat precarious.  The Hospitals Sweepstakes got most of its funds from foreign countries.  I understand that is the view of its promoters.  I think this measure will render the Hospitals Sweepstakes more popular because of the fact that this country is showing its recognition of the generosity with which foreign countries in the last eight or nine years have subscribed.  Those concerned with the Hospitals Sweepstakes believe that this Red Cross Sweepstake will help them, and they have also another important point in view, namely, the giving of employment. At present one cannot hope for the same amount of support of the sweepstakes during the period of the duration of the war as was given in recent years, and in consequence it would be impossible for the promoters to go on giving at all the same amount of employment as they have been giving in recent years.  But the throwing in of a new sweepstake to be held this winter will enable the promoters to keep on a much larger number of employees in employment for the next few months than if this sweepstake had not been projected.  This may not justify the sweep being held, but at all events it will have the sympathy of every citizen.  The project has a good deal to be said in its favour apart from its object in providing funds for the purposes of the Red Cross Society. That is all I have to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>What has been said by Senator Fitzgerald with regard to nominations is only what can be said in the matter of the constitution of any organisation.  That is to say that no matter who is nominated to any of these positions some objection can be made to the nomination.  When the Irish Tourist Bill was being passed through this House, it was said that the board or committee should have been nominated by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  The fact <Col N="1277" /> remains that whoever is nominated to one of these positions, there will be objections from one source or another, and the statement will be made that the right people were not appointed. If most of us were asked our opinion in the matter of the promotion of this Red Cross Society sweepstake, I really think that our findings would be that the passing of this Bill was unjustifiable in this sense that it is a case of killing the goose that laid the golden eggs.  Very many people think that this new sweep is like drawing a red herring across the path of the Hospitals Sweeps.  I took it to be the general view of the people that if the Hospitals Sweepstake people, and the other beneficiaries of the Hospitals Sweep agreed to sacrifice one year's earnings or funds and devote them to the Red Cross Society it would have been a much better thing than the starting of a new red herring and drawing it across the greater organisation. I am sure, however, that that is now beyond recall, having gone so far as we have.  It is only for us to make the best of the matter as it stands.  I am sure every support will be given to the new organisation in providing funds for the Red Cross Society.  But in everybody's opinion that has not been the best way to go about it.  I repeat again that it would have been much better if one year's net profits of the organisation were devoted to the work of the Red Cross Society.  I am afraid this new sweepstake will do harm to the other and more prosperous institution of the Hospitals Sweepstake.  However, we are all prepared to give it our general support.</P>

      <P>I think it is unfortunate that the debate has taken this turn.  The Bill was not debated in that spirit in the Dáil.  Following Senator Fitzgerald there was Senator Sir John Keane, and one would almost have gathered from his remarks that almost all the funds of the Red Cross Society were to be devoted to the Fianna Fáil organisation.  We had one of the Senators referring to the funds and the other referring to the <i>personnel</i> of the board.  Senator Sir John Keane had a good deal to say as to the way the money was to be spent, and finally he said that it should be devoted according to the rules of the Red Cross Society.  Still he makes a speech almost entirely on the lines that he wanted to know in what way the proceeds were to be spent.  I regret that that tone has been introduced into the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said so much, I wish to raise one more point, one which has not been mentioned by any other Senator.  I put it to the Minister that, in the scheme sanctioned by the Minister, the fund subscribed in Ireland should be devoted to the Red Cross in Ireland.  I will clarify that.  As a neutral country, we do not want a census here of how many people are pro-German, how many are pro-British, and how many are pro-Polish; we, in Ireland, would find it very inadvisable to put on our tickets that we want the proceeds to <Col N="1279" /> go to Germany or to England.  I can understand quite well that any person subscribing to the funds outside Ireland could opt that the proceeds&mdash;or the accumulation of the proceeds&mdash;from that country, would go to that country; but I think that the funds subscribed by the people here should go to the Irish Red Cross.  The point is that we do not want so many Irish subscribers to say that they want the proceeds of their money to go to one of the belligerents in the present war.  I think it would have a rather disastrous result if the people were to say they were pro-this or pro-that.  It would be quite understandable internationally that the money which we subscribe ourselves in Ireland should go to the Irish Red Cross.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak at all, until the last speaker rose, because the previous speeches&mdash;to which he objected&mdash;could have done no harm, except as they were emphasised by him.  I have heard quite a lot of criticism, not of the persons nominated on the committee, but of the absence of prominent people connected with Fine Gael.  I have not heard a word against anybody on the committee, but I was asked to make inquiries as to whether Fine Gael had refused to take any part.  I would like to see the utmost publicity given to the statement made by Senator Rowlette to the effect that the Irish Red Cross will, after the 1st June&mdash;I think that was the date mentioned&mdash;have a central governing body nominated by the local bodies.</P>

      <P>Elected, if that is the case.  The way to make the Irish Red Cross satisfactory in the future is for everybody to take part, without regard to Party affiliations, in the local organisation. That is the way by which any defects can be remedied.  I think is would be a mistake to blind ourselves to the fact that these criticisms took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the second part of Senator O'Donovan's remarks, what he suggests is, to my mind, quite impracticable. <Col N="1280" /> I do not know very much about sweepstakes, but I do know that a very large number of subscriptions apparently from Ireland do not come from Ireland at all.  Most people in business have found that they have to oblige all sorts of people in various parts of the world, who wish to take part but do not desire the address to be given.  The suggestion could be borne in mind by the committee, but I think it is clearly a case where we cannot discuss the details. That would remain to somebody with full knowledge.  However, I do not think there is any harm in it as there is no disclosure of the figures of the amount that came from here, and I do not think that there could be.  My object is to suggest that the blunder which was made by the Minister in the general composition of the first committee could now remedy itself by all sorts and sections of the community taking part in the local organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidRobinson" hpid="Mr. Robinson Mr. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I did not hear what Senator Sir John Keane said, but if I am wrong he can correct me.  I rather gather that he wished that the Red Cross funds should only be used for humanitarian purposes for people who are what one might call &ldquo;accredited belligerents&rdquo;; that is to say, where Governments have formally gone to war, the Red Cross would have the right to assist the wounded under those conditions, but the Red Cross funds could not be used to assist wounded men in any other circumstances. The whole point is: When is a war not a war?  How can anybody tell?  The war in Spain was a civil war, so-called; presumably, that is one of the occasions on which Senator Sir John Keane, if he had paid a subscription or given a donation to the Red Cross&mdash;which I hope he will do shortly &mdash;would object to the money being used.  The war between Japan and China is not a war because nobody has declared war, though people are being killed all the time.  Does he suggest that the Red Cross should not use its funds there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidRobinson" hpid="Mr. Robinson Mr. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senators all know exactly what is in his mind.  We have got that much further on.  Is it not reasonable to suppose that, where two lots of Irishmen are killing each other, the Red Cross funds could be used?  Senator Keane has not come out completely in the open.  He has kept back something.  There again, is it a civil war?  Would there be people who would not have the view which was in Senator Sir John Keane's mind and who would call it, not a civil war but a war between different nations? I do not think the Senator has really helped his case at all.  If he had told us exactly what was in his mind there would be an answer immediately, but he has left us to infer certain things. Anyway, in a civil war, as such, I believe that Geneva thinks there is every reason why the wounded men should be succoured with Red Cross funds.  I am not absolutely certain, but I have a recollection that I read on one occasion of somebody having written to Geneva for a ruling and having received the reply that certainly wounded men in a civil war must be succoured.</P>

      <P>Well, I am not going to prolong the debate, at that rate, if that point is disposed of.  Senator Sir John <Col N="1282" /> Keane asked for frankness from me: I think the House would have been pleased to have had a little more frankness from himself.  I do not quite follow his point, but I see that one of the objects of the Red Cross Society &mdash;according to the Red Cross Act which was passed in 1938&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;shall be in time of peace or war to carry on and assist in work for the improvement of health, the prevention of disease and the mitigation of suffering throughout the world.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a very laudable object and I do not think there will be anyone who is going to object.  Anyone who does should keep the money to himself and not trouble to subscribe.  Even the victims of a civil war would be included, because, after all, they are all human beings; and, if they are unfortunate enough to fight one another, it probably means more hardship on individuals.</P>

      <P>That is very often the case.  If Senator Keane had nothing better to contribute, he should not have spoken at all.  On the tax point, the Minister for Finance will seek money wherever he can get it easily.  Senator Fitzgerald should, as an ex-Minister, know that.  If the Minister for Finance wants to balance his Budget and can get money by means of the sweepstakes, he will get it.  The money obtained by the sweepstakes will be spent in accordance with the purposes in the Act, and a scheme must be submitted to the Minister so that he may be satisfied that it will be spent in a proper way.  As regards the money handed over to the society, it is proposed that 20 per cent. be retained here and the balance be spent in accordance with the wishes of the subscribers, so that some of that money will come back here again.  Twenty per cent. will definitely be retained.</P>

      <P>That scheme is, I understand, chiefly concerned with the commissions given.  A limit is placed on the amount of commissions that can be given.  That is, I think, one of the essential features of the scheme which the Minister sanctions.  In this case, the Minister takes power to arrange the proportions which can be given to foreign societies and to the Irish Red Cross Society.  What is the object of that?  Why should the Government intervene at all?  Perhaps the society asked him to do so.  I notice that the society put up a scheme.  Is this whole section the outcome of a demand by the society?</P>

I am quite satisfied that the country is rather more disturbed than is evident, up to the present anyhow, by the attitude of Deputies and Senators and while I am prepared to go as far as anybody in assisting the Minister and the Government in whatever policy we generally feel is essential for our well-being, I think that there would be nothing more disastrous than silence and acquiescence in an agricultural policy that does not meet with general approval down the country.</P>
    <P>One might say that the other House seemed to give the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> to go ahead, but I know from my personal contacts&mdash;and I think other Senators, and I am sure many Deputies, from their own personal experience have had it brought home to them&mdash;that there is considerable perturbation in the minds of many farmers because of the introduction of compulsion.  I am not disputing the fact that it may be essential to have all these powers, but what I am concerned about is this: in the first place, whether or not the Minister could not by other means achieve his ends.  I think myself that there is nothing our farmers will dislike more than compulsion of any kind.  The truth is that they have had a great deal of it applied to them in recent years.  While, in the last great war, similar powers were in the hands of the Government of the day, it is quite a different position when an Irish Minister under an Irish Government comes along and, through civil servants and his Department staff, goes to one farmer after another, visits his home and tramps his fields and indicates to him generally that he has got to till whether he likes it or not, whether he has got facilities to enable him to do the job efficiently or not, and whether or not he has got any guarantee that when he sows and <Col N="1290" /> reaps, he will be able to sell the fruits of his harvest at a price that will pay him for the labour he has put into it.</P>
    <P>My view is, that before the Minister makes this order operative he ought to adopt other measures to get such an increase in tillage as would satisfy him and the country generally that we will be, so to speak, fairly safe.  Those of us who have given any study to the position know that, as a minimum, we ought to aim at an increase of 500,000 acres under tillage.  Somehow or other we will have to try to make up the 300,000 tons of maize&mdash;most of which we may not get&mdash;and the 300,000 tons of wheat which we may not get.  Therefore, if we can increase the area under tillage by another 500,000 acres we will be going a long way to meet the Minister's point of view.  In my opinion, it would be ever so much more satisfactory if, instead of proceeding with his compulsory order, the Minister were able to enunciate a policy that would encourage the farmers to aim at this increase under tillage of their own free will, because there are problems in the carrying out of a compulsory tillage scheme which the Minister may not have come up against yet but which he must come up against inevitably when the stage is reached that his inspectors will be going out amongst the farmers to see whether the Act is being obeyed or not.  The truth is that during the last couple of years our farmers have gone through a very trying time.  During that period some of us here have been pointing out how weakened and depressed they were, and, above all, what little reserves they have got: how little credit they have got to enable them to get the amount of production which they ought to be getting if agriculture is to be put in the position in which it can stand on its own legs and give a decent livelihood to those engaged in the industry.</P>
    <P>So far as the farmers are concerned, the situation has not improved since the war began.  If anything, it has worsened.  You have many farmers who have not stock on their lands. There are others who have not got machinery and many who have not got cash to buy either manures or seeds to be put into the land next spring.  More <Col N="1291" /> money will be required for these purposes next spring than was the case last spring.  If our land was carrying the number of cows, heifers, dry stock and sheep that it could carry&mdash;that it was carrying, say, before the last European war&mdash;then, in my opinion, we would be better off to-day to the extent of 200,000 cattle than we actually are. We all know that the lands of many of our farmers are not fully stocked because they had not the money to buy stock.  In that situation the Minister is going to make an order that these people must till one-eighth of the total amount of land they hold.  The order is to be applied to the country generally, regardless of the fact that we have in the Twenty-Six Counties much more than 26 different types of soils.  The order is to have general application regardless of the fact that the soil and condition of the people are very different indeed in the various counties.  In my opinion that is going to work a great injustice in the case of those people.  What I fear is that, if the order is applied generally, you are not going to get a return either in the area under tillage or from the tillage when you have it which we want in order to give us the food supplies that are requisite here.</P>
    <P>It is true that there are parts of the country where the farmers have the soil and a tradition in tillage.  You have both in the Minister's native county&mdash;Wexford.  You have a fair share of it in my own county as well as in the Counties of Louth, Offaly, Leix and elsewhere.  But, as we all know, there are other counties where for ages the soil has been laid down in grass.  There the farmers have not a tradition in tillage, and neither have the farm labourers.  While they may be the best judges of stock in the world, it will be found that very few of them can handle a plough, and it certainly can be said that none of them will handle a plough like a Wexford or Louth farmer.  It has further to be borne in mind that this compulsory tillage order is definitely going to create a labour problem.  In those counties that have not a tillage tradition <Col N="1292" /> it will be found, I think, that the farmers there or their men have not the skill necessary to get the soil into the condition requisite for good cropping.  I would remind Senators that while you can get a crop into the land it is a much more difficult problem to get it out and to save it.  That is a difficulty that those people are going to be faced with.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt at all that in the particular counties to which I have made reference there are stretches of soil suitable for tillage.  You have scattered through those counties quite a number of very good tillage farmers, but generally speaking the tillage areas are confined to the lighter soils.  That is a side of the problem that I think must be taken into account by the Minister, because while the tilling of our lighter soils is going to give us a return in grain, the tilling of the heavier soils may very well result in a waste of land that at the moment is growing the best grasses in the world, because there can be no guarantee that you are going to reap a reasonably good grain crop off it.  Take the lands in Meath, Westmeath, South Tipperary and other parts of the country, you cannot have any guarantee when you sow a grain crop that you are going to be able to reap it with any sort of reasonable comfort or security.  I have seen farms in the County Meath myself where they were only able to reap from four to six barrels of wheat to the acre.  That is some of the finest land in the world.  If that is going to be the result of this compulsory tillage order, then what it means for the country is this: that we will be destroying some of our magnificent grasses while gambling on the chance of a grain crop that we may not be able to reap.</P>
    <P>That is an aspect of the question that ought to be taken into account by the Minister.  I know he said, when replying to somebody in the Dáil who apparently was thinking of the County Limerick, that this compulsory tillage order was going to be good for the County Limerick land.  I do not know all the County Limerick very well, but I am quite satisfied about this, <Col N="1293" /> because I have seen it happen myself, that if you break up some of our best grass lands you are going to break up and destroy the growth of indigenous grasses which you will not be able to replace probably for 20 or 30 years.  I have seen experiments carried out in the growing of indigenous grasses as against commercial grasses.  I know the Minister will argue that these commercial grasses improve the pasture.  In my judgment they do not.</P>
    <P>This order, I take it, will be carried out by civil servants giving directions from Government Buildings in Merrion Street.  You will have inspectors going down the country to see that it is carried out with, as will be said, justice to all parties.  People will be compelled to comply with its provisions whether they are able to do so or not, but, in spite of all that, I have no doubt in the world that if this order is applied generally we are going to destroy the carrying capacity of some of our best land, and that not even the efforts of our best farmers to improve the pasture by the use of commercial grasses will give us, for a very long time to come, anything like the sward which is there now.  We have to think of the time when the war is over.  We have to think of the possibilities of waste during the period of war, and, in so far as it is possible, to avoid that, and to enable ourselves to come through to the other stage with our soil unimpaired and its fertility remaining. To the extent to which we are able to do that, we will survive those other days which will come to the world when the war is over, and which possibly for the whole world will be more disastrous than the days of the war itself.</P>
    <P>In addition to those two facts which I think ought to be borne in mind by the Minister, there is, too, the decision of the Minister or the Government that wheat and beet are to be the two crops to which particular attention is to be given, inasmuch as there is to be a guarantee for those crops and for no other crops.  It may be that the Minister's view is that the lands which we ought to exploit to-day are our good heavy soil.  There is going to be very <Col N="1294" /> great difficulty, apparently, with regard to the obtaining of fertilisers, and, if we are to grow those crops, as apparently the Minister wants us to grow them, we must be able to take a chance and put them on soils where they will grow whether artificial fertilisers are put on them or not.  I suggest that, apart altogether from the consideration that there are lands in this country more valuable to the nation if they are left under grass than if they are put under tillage, and apart from the fact that in a good number of places there is not a tradition of good tillage, or the training either on the part of the farmer or his labourer essential for good tillage, and apart also from the fact that considerable credit is necessary for a great number of our farmers to change over to this other scheme, and that that has not been made available to any extent by the Minister so far, there is in addition this other consideration that if you are going to break grass land you may be upsetting our internal economy to a degree not yet contemplated, because tilling one-eighth of a holding in a number of areas in this country may mean that we may have to cut down to a certain extent the number of dairy cows carried.  The cow wants her living space, too, and butter is just as essential a food as anything else we can produce.  It seems to me that that ought to be taken into account.  If our internal economy is going to be thrown out of gear to a considerable extent on a number of our holdings because of the application of this measure, then I think there is necessity for a great deal of study before the measure is put into operation.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister that, in the first place, before he exercises those powers, he ought to give a guaranteed price for every crop which the farmer is prepared to grow.  I find it difficult to answer the question as to why we have decided to give a guarantee to the farmer who will grow beet and who will grow wheat, while there is not to be any guarantee for the man who will grow oats, barley, kale, mangolds or any other of those crops, and not a word about potatoes.  In my <Col N="1295" /> judgment the potato crop in this country is far more vital to the country's life than wheat.  I believe most farmers in this country and most members of this House would prefer to do without bread than to do without potatoes.  A man is to get a guaranteed price if he grows wheat, but not in the case of potatoes.  Let us look at what we are asked to do.  By far the greater area under tillage is going to be under oats, barley, potatoes and other roots, the smallest area by far being under beet and wheat, even assuming that the Minister is able to get the maximum for which he is looking, but we are to be compelled to put our land under tillage and to grow oats, potatoes, barley, and certain other crops, and there is to be no guarantee that we are going to be paid for our labour.  I wonder what would an ordinary industrialist here in the city or elsewhere say if Mr. MacEntee made an order now demanding that a certain production should come from each of those factories in the next twelve months, and leave it at that? Certain facilities to help the production might be forthcoming in the shape of limited credits or something else, but what would happen if no guarantee were given to this industrialist that he was going to get a return upon the cost of production when the commodity was put upon the market?  All I can say is that I think the industrialist would shut down shop and say: &ldquo;I cannot do that.  If the Minister wants to do it, he is at liberty to take over the industry and set the wheels in motion, but I do not think I can do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Look at what the farmer who is not growing wheat or beet may be asked to do.  We have got to get the land ready from this time forward.  The men are ploughing the stubble now for the potatoes for next year.  The manure was out on the stubble as I came along to-day.  That is being prepared for the potato crops for next year.  Other lands will be turned up for the growth of other crops.  As far as one can judge at the moment, the war may be still on in 12 months' time.  It may not but, assuming that <Col N="1296" /> it is, the cost of putting in a crop next spring is definitely going to be higher than it was last spring.  I know the Minister will say, and I have heard members of the Party to which I belong say: &ldquo;You need not mind; you are going to get a good price for everything you have got to sell.&rdquo;  That is possibly true, for awhile.  While the war is on we may be able to get a good price, though the extent to which we can raise our prices is definitely going to be limited by Government intervention.  But I am putting in a crop in spring which I cannot harvest until August or September.  If I am to feed it to stock, I am not turning out the stock until the following January, February or March.  The crop will go in during the spring, and the war may be settled in August, perhaps in July.  Then, where is the farmer going to be?  The grain grower is going to meet the full impact of Argentine and Canadian grain, wheat and grain from the Balkans and elsewhere; the Danish bacon will be back in the English market.  The submarine will not be operating against it.  We are going to be right up against all that, with our high costs for the putting in of the crop, and no security or guarantee as to what we are going to get when we take it out.  We are expected to go into this tillage with empty pockets, with our credit not very high, and with our machines in bad condition.  I agree the Minister has indicated that he is prepared to make certain credit facilities available to enable farmers to get machines.  There is very little use in my getting credit to buy a machine if I cannot also get credit to buy manure and seed for the soil.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, even in his credit scheme, he has only touched the fringe, and has not gone far enough.  He has encouraged the farmers up to a point, but he has not gone far enough.  I argue that there is no justice at all in a scheme that is going to compel us to till without giving us any guarantee that at least the costs of production are going to be covered when the crops are put upon the market.  I urge that the right way <Col N="1297" /> to get an increase in the area under tillage in the country is by giving a guarantee to the farmers that, no matter what crop they grow, they will get such a price as will leave them something above the cost of production. It might have been better still &mdash;I believe myself it would have been better still&mdash;if the Minister did what they are doing in Northern Ireland and in England, that is, to give a subsidy to the farmer for every acre of land which he ploughed.  That would have done certain things which were terribly important to our smaller farmers.</P>
    <P>We know well the position we are in to-day.  We have certain foodstuffs of our own, but unless we can add to these stocks we will not be able to retain our present stocks of cattle, pigs and poultry. From my own experience, you cannot pay £13 a ton for maizemeal and sell pork at about 73/- a cwt.  What I fear most is that arising out of this whole position we are suddenly going to have a considerable reduction in our live-stock population.  That would create a very grave situation in the country as a whole later on.  If we cannot get grain to feed our stock, or the potatoes which is the food for our pigs, and which ought to take the place of the maizemeal, there is only one thing to do.  I have heard of a man in the Six Counties within the last week who has had to kill off 1,000 of his pigs.  We may be doing the same sort of thing with our smaller numbers.  The Minister, I am sure, realises that, but some of us feel that in putting the case to the Government we must make them realise that what is most important to the life of this country is not the growing of wheat and beet but the growing of oats, barley, potatoes and the other roots, and that if we are able to keep our farmers in the production of live stock up to the minimum to which we have been able to hold them at present by the production from our own soil of the food for this stock, we will come through this emergency with our vitality unimpaired.</P>
    <P>You have guaranteed wheat and beet but you have left the great majority of the farmers not knowing what they are going to do.  At the moment, the <Col N="1298" /> farmer is not saying very much, although everywhere one goes one hears complaints.  He is not complaining that he has got to till.  Most of them realise that they have got to stretch their trace to-day and that they have to go as far as they can to provide from their own soil foodstuffs that we cannot import.  What he does complain about is that he is getting unjust treatment, that he is not getting encouragement and that he is expected to take a leap in the dark without any guarantee that he is not going into the production of commodities which he may not be able to sell at all.  I believe myself that that position ought to be faced.  I believe it is a situation which will have to be faced.  If the Minister or the Ministry is responsible for the initiation and the putting into effect of a policy which is going to put a great many of our people into the production of commodities which will be put upon the market at a time when the bottom has fallen out of the market it is then we will have to face chaos in this country. Now is the time to face up to that situation. It is not enough to say to the farmers, &ldquo;Go on and produce.  You will be able to sell anything you produce at a very good price.&rdquo;  The very good price has not come yet and, anyhow, the farmers who are trying to produce pigs at 73/- or 75/- a cwt. on meals that are costing £12 and £13 a ton are not making money.</P>
    <P>In my view, the means which the Minister ought to adopt in order to get the increased area under tillage would be to guarantee a minimum price for the production of all the crops which the farmer will grow or, alternatively, to guarantee a minimum price for the production of bacon, butter, eggs, poultry and all the other commodities which are the finished products of the raw materials which the farmer will take from his own soil.  I think, in justice, he is entitled to get that much. If the Minister did that I believe he would go very far to get the total area which he requires put under tillage without the exercise of the compulsory powers at all.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister feels that <Col N="1299" /> there are a great many farmers who will only do things at the point of the bayonet, so to speak, or that they will till only when there is no alternative. There are good reasons why men follow a particular scheme on their lands.  My view is that the farmer always does what pays him.  I believe he always did and always will.  If ploughing his field will pay him better than the other method I believe he will plough, but if he has got an area of land that will carry an additional three-year-old bullock or 2½-year-old bullock to the acre he will be slow to till that land and will realise that he is performing an important function in the national life by finishing the product that has come from poorer soil elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask what indication is there that the farmers will rise to this demand without the enforcement of these compulsory powers.  In my judgment, anyhow, the farmer is a fairly wide-awake individual.  He is as keen to make the most of his calling as anybody else.  He is busy thinking out ways and means to improve his position and he will do so if he gets a chance.</P>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago there was a discussion in this House in which it was urged&mdash;and the Taoiseach himself assented to the point of view and has recently stressed it elsewhere&mdash;that if we could organise our country people we could probably get them to tackle the problems with which we are faced with a great deal more energy and vitality and with a greater possibility of success than we could possibly get from any compulsion which a Government Ministry might employ.  I would suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that before he decides definitely to put this order into operation he should make an effort to see if he could get the farmers in all the parishes in the country organised.  I see that Senator O'Dwyer has been trying to do so already in his own parish, around his own creamery.  I believe that if the Minister set himself to it and sought the aid and co-operation which I believe he could get if he tried, he would bring into existence now organisations <Col N="1300" /> throughout all our parishes of the farmers and the workers that would do much more to increase the area under tillage and get good tillage done than could possibly be obtained by the exercise of any compulsory powers.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those whose point of view is that you can do nothing in this country unless you do it from Dublin. I think that right from the beginning of home government our people got an entirely wrong point of view about the function of government.  Their eyes were drawn towards the Government and Government Buildings.  They expected too much.  Some of them are now disappointed and it is no wonder. They were promised much more than they could ever expect to enjoy.  I believe that if they were thrown back on their own resources now they have both intelligence and initiative, and if these forces were put to work in their own districts I believe it would put new life into rural Ireland.  They have done it in another form in England.  I cannot say that they have done it in the Six Counties.  I know the country myself and I believe that if you could get groups of farmers, with their workers, irrespective of creed or political belief, with the co-operation of the heads of the Church, of teachers and of the public men, whoever they might be, in the respective parishes, to come together, either in their halls or schools or other suitable place, they could consider the particular problems of their own parish and see what they could do with the land of their own parish to make it more productive.</P>
    <P>There are all sorts of problems. There is the widow with the small family.  What can she do?  There are others short of stock, short of machines, short of manure and all that. No work on files kept in the Department's offices will solve the problems that are there to be tackled.  I believe if you could get the people together themselves they would face up to this situation in an entirely new spirit.  I believe that you would breed a spirit of co-operation and of new enterprise that the country needs and I believe that you would get a completely new <Col N="1301" /> attitude and a new outlook towards this whole work.  It is the people's work just as much as it is the Government's work.</P>
    <P>Instead of the Minister taking staffs who are engaged on the work of the Land Commission from that work and sending them amongst the farmers to compel them to till a certain area of their holdings without any regard to the kind of soil or the conditions of the farmers or anything else, I would suggest that careful consideration should be given to these other aspects of the question.  It is not for to-day, but for to-morrow and the days to come, and I believe that if you can, in the present emergency, make our farmers realise how much is dependent on them, and show them the need for pulling together, working together and co-operating where they can with their horses and machines, and showing a general desire to help the weaker members of the community, the total productive capacity of the people and the land would increase beyond the wildest hopes.</P>
    <P>There is this further consideration. In other and difficult days in this country, when the men at the head of affairs here were hunted from post to pillar, when it was not always possible to get orders from Michael Collins or Dick Mulcahy or somebody else, there were forceful, vital units up and down the country working on their own, men with courage and initiative&mdash;here to-day Seán McKeon struck out, and next day Seán Moylan struck out, and so on. Deeds like theirs gave hope and courage to the people as a whole, held them together and enabled them to keep up their courage and fight on to victory.  I believe in every district you have people who would be prepared to throw all their energy into this kind of work, more energy than they have put into anything else since 1918 and 1919.  I believe that in the storms that will break upon us here, if not in this war, possibly in the war that will follow this one, that we will want these people.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about it, these things may come, and our capacity to weather <Col N="1302" /> these storms will depend, not on the perfection of the machine that you are going to create in Government Buildings now, but on the initiative and resourcefulness and courage, and above all, the spirit of co-operation that our people down the country are prepared to display.  That is something that should be encouraged by the Minister and I suggest that he should attempt to get an increased area under tillage by giving a guarantee to every man who is going to till that he will get a price that will pay him for the total area put under tillage.  If the Minister will try to get the farmers to carry that scheme into effect, he will not want any inspectors obtruding themselves on the farmer and his wife at the busiest hour of the day.  Under such a scheme the farmers will be desirous to go on with the job and they will be anxious to have the area under tillage that the Minister requires and everyone will be satisfied.</P>

      <P>I beg to second Senator Baxter's motion, for the reason that I agree very much with what he has said, and I had practically a similar motion down.  I sent it in to the Seanad for this debate but, unfortunately for me, the post to Kerry was missed and our weekly delivery there made my reply too late.  I think that during this emergency the four-day period in relation to motions of this sort might be reconsidered by the Standing Orders Committee, because if you happen to be away from home certain inconvenience may result.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I will not say any more on that subject. I am in a favourable position to discuss this matter, because my part of the country is one where almost everybody who is in a financial position to do so tills a full 12½ per cent. of the arable land.  Moreover, I personally, since this emergency started, have been breaking up every possible acre of arable land which I think may grow a reasonable cereal crop.  But though <Col N="1303" /> the position in the mixed farming areas and in the tillage counties is generally as I have described it, there are still very large areas in the country in which, notwithstanding the campaign for more wheat in years past, you can still travel over miles of grass.  The reasons for this are twofold, and they are two reasons that all farmers know. Senator Baxter has developed one, and that is that a great deal of the land is so rich that it will grow grass in abundance and straw in abundance, but it will not grow a reasonable crop of corn, and that is what the Minister is setting out to do.</P>
      <P>Another point which Senator Baxter did not develop quite to the same extent is that this type of land is absolutely essential to the whole of the cattle trade.  By that I mean the store trade, such as is carried on in the West. I have in mind the small man with three or four calves, yearlings.  He must pass them on and they go to the Midlands.  They move up and they arrive on the finishing lands.  These lands are absolutely essential for the development of our cattle for export to other countries.  In those particular areas the farmers, as a rule, are very poorly prepared for tillage operations on a large scale.  On these large farms in the grass counties tillage will be on a large scale, if started at all.  Those who are going to till are in the position that only a minority of them have the experience to carry out the tillage in an economic manner, even in favourable weather and under favourable circumstances. They will have to get ploughmen, not only from Louth and Wexford and Waterford, but they will have to bring men from Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you make a compulsory tillage order you, in effect, go to the farmer and say: &ldquo;No matter what the type of your land, no matter whether you have the money to pay for the seed and the labour and the necessary implements to till the land, no matter if you are already in debt to the shopkeeper or the bank and, finally, no matter what the conditions of your land may be after your effort to comply <Col N="1304" /> with the order and when the emergency is over, you must forthwith go and till as much land as I require you to do.&rdquo; There is an old saying that you should never give an order which you cannot be sure of having carried out satisfactorily, and in my opinion the order which it is proposed to issue at the present moment comes under this heading; in fact, it goes further, because those farmers who are now in poor circumstances, if they are obliged to till in this way will be in a very sad plight indeed at the end of the emergency and they will become another of the many burdens which the State is already bearing.</P>
    <P>As to the major details of the scheme, I should like to touch on three or four of them.  As regards the first one, I think that, except where farmers are in a position to form themselves into limited companies, the loan proposals as we know them are inadequate.  At the present moment there is a very great shortage of agricultural machinery for any large-scale tillage operations.  Incidentally, there is very considerable profiteering going on in regard to those particular articles.  So serious is it in some places, that I suggest to the Minister that an immediate and retrospective control of prices order should go out in respect of all agricultural machinery and this should specify all machinery which has been sold out of stock in the hands of wholesalers and retailers at a price higher than was listed in this country on the 26th August last.</P>
    <P>If that were published, and if the farmers were given an opportunity of writing in and stating what they had paid for some of these machines in the excitement of trying to get implements for tillage, I think it would be a revelation.  I can provide the Minister with several glaring cases in the South which the Attorney-General really could certify under the Treason Act, or, at any rate, under the Offences Against the State Act.</P>
    <P>This particular question is very important because here is the State trying to save itself and to provide its food supply, while, at the same time, <Col N="1305" /> traders are jumping in and trying to make all the profit they can.  I am seriously concerned that unless there is a price for the various types of cereals, it will be found that there will be only a turnover from oats to wheat, and, as a result, there will be a shortage of certain essential types of feeding-stuffs for stock.  One great object of the scheme is to absorb surplus labour. If this is to be done, there must definitely be some alterations in the present regulations as to unemployment. It is really only a pretence to say that we farmers can go to the employment exchange, demand a man, and get him.  In actual fact, we all know what would be the result upon our farming operations, if we did so. There must be some alteration to prevent these men standing around, however unpopular and undesirable it may be to say so.  I think it my duty to say it because the proposal of the Government to absorb labour under this scheme will not materialise otherwise.</P>
    <P>Finally, I suggest an immediate constructive alternative very much on the lines of what Senator Baxter has suggested, a campaign of persuasion throughout the country.  If this were to fail, then it would be the farmers' own fault and the compulsory powers could then be put into force.  The campaign could be carried out through the county committees, the agricultural instructors, the overseers, the creamery managers and through parish committees, the clergy and by public meetings. I believe if that were done at once, you would have very little difficulty in getting your whole acreage. We are all ready to help, but I suggest that, as an incentive, because this is a business problem, there should be a guaranteed price, firstly for first-grade millable wheat and that guaranteed price should cover two years and not one and, secondly, the farmer should be reassured as to the price he is going to get for wheat which, for one reason or another&mdash;weather or other conditions&mdash;is not millable, but is fit for the feeding of stock.  In addition, I suggest that there should be a bounty of £2 per acre for the breaking of new <Col N="1306" /> land not only to cover the initial expenses&mdash;the labour, the seed and the implements, together with payment of interest on any loan that may have been obtained&mdash;but in the case of land which is put in wheat, to enable the farmer to make up for the exhaustion which possibly one or two wheat crops during this emergency will bring to the land.  Against that, the farmer must give the State a guarantee of performance for two years.  I think it should be something on the lines of the lime subsidy&mdash;that he is going to till so much land and produce certain types of cereals, and that, provided he is given this bounty, he agrees to spend it on labour over and above what he normally employs on his farm.  That would have an immense effect on reducing the present dole and unemployment, and would bring back a good deal of pride to the people who have not got it at present.</P>
    <P>It may seem a stiffish price to pay, but war, whether you are neutral or otherwise, unfortunately throws expense on the people, and I think that if this matter is handled on a business basis rather than on the basis of regimentation such as this order contains, without regard for immediate circumstances, or for ultimate results and misfortunes, I think the country will come well instead of badly out of the tillage scheme.  There are ample sources, which I think most Senators can call to mind, evident in this year's Estimates from which very large savings can be made which could be used to pay the great portion of the bounty I suggest.  I think they can be made in what I call unremunerative undertakings and turned to what is one of the most important, and will be the most remunerative, undertaking the country has attempted for many years. I beg the House, in conclusion, to regard this matter absolutely and entirely free from political bias of any sort and I feel definite that if this scheme goes on as the Minister proposes&mdash;possibly only as a kite; I hope so&mdash;it will be a national misfortune.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> To delete all words after the word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that a Committee of practical farmers to be nominated by the Minister for Agriculture, should be set up in each county to consider and adjudicate upon the claims from farmers for exemption from the provisions of the Compulsory Tillage Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Though I disagree with portion of Senator Baxter's motion, I am in thorough agreement with every word of the speech he delivered.  I think we are both out for the same object. I am in agreement with the first portion of the motion, but I must say that I cannot agree with the second portion which I propose to delete.  If the motion were accepted it would mean uncertainty and eventually may create greater hardships and injustices to farmers without any possibility of any success in the matter of tillage.</P>
    <P>The motion proposes that the Minister should not put the tillage order into effect for the present, that he should leave it in abeyance, and then, if there is not a proper response to his appeal, that next March or April he could enforce the order.  In my opinion, that uncertainty would not be good for the farmers.  Eventually, when the order would be put into force, if the appeal had not been properly responded to, it might create hardship for and injustice to a good many farmers.  I think the majority of farmers would prefer to know immediately where they stand with regard to this tillage order.</P>
    <P>The policy which I propose is the policy adopted in England.  It is a commonsense policy which will create confidence.  It is a policy which will save the rich fattening lands from the plough; those lands which, in the best interests of national economy, could not be put to better use, either in war or in peace-time, than in fattening bullocks.  The British Minister of Agriculture has set up an executive war committee of experienced practical <Col N="1308" /> farmers in each county.  Those farmers have local knowledge of the conditions prevailing in their counties and they, and not the Minister of Agriculture, decide what amount of tillage each farmer should do in every county.  If such committees were set up here they should have wide discretionary powers and not be tied down by any hard-and-fast rule, as conditions differ in every county.  I know farmers in County Dublin who are paying £6 per acre for land on which to grow wheat and I know parts of Meath, Westmeath, and Limerick where, if you offered land for nothing for tillage, you could not get anybody to take it.  That land will grow excellent grass and will fatten a bullock in three or four months, but it is useless for tillage.</P>
    <P>If those committees were set up, they should also be instructed to take into account the financial condition of some farmers who are compelled to till. There are many farmers in those grazing counties who, I will not say due to the economic war, because that might lead us on to a different track, but I will say due to the depression in the live-stock trade for a number of years, are not now in a position to buy machinery, seeds, or manures to enable them to till their land.  The £100 which the Minister proposes to give to meet those demands is entirely insufficient to meet the requirements of those farmers.</P>

      <P>I realise, however, that there is a war on, that we are faced with an emergency, and that it is necessary to have more tillage.  My only object is to try to persuade the Minister that this order should be carried out with as little loss as possible to the farmers concerned and that we should try to save the rich grazing lands of the country, which we are all very proud of, and which are our greatest national asset.  We have 11,000,000 acres of what is supposed to be arable land in this country, and I think that, if the Minister would hold out more inducement to the farmers in the counties which are suitable for tillage, he would get all the tillage he requires and that he could exempt some of our best grazing counties such as Meath, Westmeath, and parts of Limerick and Tipperary.  There is no question but that the conditions prevailing in those counties are quite different from those prevailing in, say, Wexford, Carlow, portions of Kildare, and many other counties.</P>
      <P>If the Minister will get the help of practical farmers in the different counties I am sure that, with a little goodwill, he will get all the tillage he requires and the country will be saved from what, to my mind, would be the greatest national loss it could sustain &mdash;the ploughing up of those valuable fattening lands.  There are not so many acres capable of fattening cattle and it would be a disaster to destroy what we have.  As Senator Baxter said, no matter what the Minister or his experts may say, it will take 20 or 30 years for them to come back to their present state if they are ploughed up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Parkinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion of Senator Baxter.  Any Senator here, or anybody in the country, must admit that in a crisis like this it is vital for the Minister for Agriculture and the Government to look to the future and the danger that it holds for this country if, by any horrible chance, we went short of food.  Therefore, I am in full sympathy with the extension of tillage, whether it will be by persuasion or by compulsion, but I am sure the Minister will give very careful consideration to Senator Baxter's attempt to show how, by persuasion, he might get the results he aims to get by compulsion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, we know that a great many of our farmers to-day are very short of money, short of stock and short of machinery to carry out the wishes of the Minister, and above all they are particularly short of credit. I should have liked to have heard Senator Baxter put up some constructive scheme of credit, which is just as vital to the farmer as anything else to enable him to carry out the wishes of the Minister.  Our official statistics show that the 300,000 farmsteads in the Twenty-Six Counties have paid or are paying to the landlords £129,000,000 for the tenant right of these 300,000 homesteads.  The same farmers or their ancestors have paid at least £100,000,000.  Now, here is a round sum of £230,000,000 and, owing to legislation, beginning in 1923 and going on up to 1938, the farmers have been deprived of the use of the ownership of the soil, which should belong to them, having bought the tenant right and the landlord's right, and to-day it is a frozen asset in this country, which is of no use either to the Government or the <Col N="1311" /> farmers.  It would be of immense help to the Minister for Agriculture if, in a few lines of an amending Bill, he would restore to the farmers the right to take the title deeds of their lands to a bank and on these deeds borrow a certain sum which is absolutely necessary and vital to them in order to be able to get the necessary machinery and the necessary horses and ploughs and so on, to till the amount of land which the nation requires.  At the end of this crisis, if we continue to grow wheat and beet to meet the necessities of the nation, we will have to be in a position to restore some of that fertility, and fertilisers will be required not only at the end of that time but during the process of tilling.</P>
    <P>Now, we have in this country a research committee.  That research committee, after two years of consideration as to whether there was any value in the phosphatic rock which exists in Clare, have not yet made a public report and we have no means of seeing what they think of that phosphatic rock.  We have in this country, as they have in Germany, Norway and Sweden, limestone, and we also have electric power and anthracite coal; so there is no necessity at all why Ireland should not be self-sufficient in the two great requirements of the two things we need most as fertilisers&mdash;phosphates and nitrates. Now, nitrates&mdash;without going into the specific manner of manufacture from limestone, anthracite coal and electric power&mdash;supplied Germany with her nitrate requirements in the last war. To-day, it is quite reasonable and possible that Ireland herself should turn to the manufacture of similar nitrate manures and develop also the phosphatic rock in Clare.  As long as we neglect our own national resources, such as these, we will be draining the money from the country to other places and to other people.  I suggest that the Minister should take up this matter with the research committee and get something practical and definite from them as to why, having these natural resources, we have not yet started to utilise them.</P>
    <Col N="1312" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear Senator Parkinson speak about the phosphate deposits in Clare.  It seems that there is some delay, whether accountable or unaccountable, in dealing with that very valuable deposit. We are all interested in the development of industries of that type and we are all very anxious to increase the real wealth of the country, and if we are to increase agricultural production it is clearly necessary that we should have fertilisers of these kinds.  I know that the Minister has had put before him suggestions in respect of this matter. I know that this matter has been going on for a very long time, and I do not know upon what shoulders the blame for the delay rests.  Now, in view of the present European war, it may not be possible for us to get from abroad all the fertilisers we require, and here at our door is a thing that we do require. The development of this thing would achieve two or three objects.  It will give us the fertilisers we require and will also give very necessary employment. We are importing, I think &mdash;I have not time to verify the figures entirely&mdash;something like 80,000 tons of rock per year, and if we were to calculate what employment that would give in the development of these deposits down there, it would give employment to something like 400 or 500 men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Parkinson said that there are no data available as to the value of this deposit or of this rock in comparison with the imported material.  I understand that that analysis has been given to the Departments concerned, and I understand that the worst that can be said about it is that, possibly, it is 2 per cent. less in value than the imported rock.  Now, on the basis of that value, we ought to take serious consideration of what could be done as regards the production of the food we require at the present time, or are likely to require, the wealth that would be produced in that direction, and the amount of money that would be put in circulation as a result of setting 400 or 500 men to work in that area.  That is something that the Government should take into serious consideration, and <Col N="1313" /> there should be no dilly-dally about it.</P>
    <P>I have been considering this matter for two or three years now and, as I say, I do not know on whose shoulders the blame rests for the delay.  Neither do I say that the Minister for Agriculture is at fault, but I do say that it is time for somebody to see that action should be taken in order to give us that valuable product and employ these men.  I put it very seriously to the Minister that he ought to consider that matter&mdash;particularly in the crisis we are now passing through&mdash;and take it up seriously and see that some effective work is done immediately.  I stress the word &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; because unemployment is very severe in the Clare area and because the need for fertilisers is also great.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I should like to stress, and that is that there is a good deal of land&mdash;well, perhaps it might be hard to define such a term as &ldquo;a good deal&rdquo;&mdash;but there is some land in the hands of the Land Commission and I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the advisability of having that land tilled for the production of food.  There are also some lands that nobody can use at present.  There are frozen loans connected with these lands and even the banks cannot make use of them.  The people who formerly owned these lands cannot use them.  The Land Commission should adopt a scheme whereby such lands could be released for the production of food.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider that position in respect to land that has been acquired by the Land Commission for distribution, and that is not now available for food production.  The Land Commission should not remain any length in possession of land that could be made available for the benefit of the community.  Lands on which there are frozen loans should also be made available immediately for food production.  There is another source of food production to which I direct the Minister's attention.  For some time past plots attached to cottages have not been made available as freely as in former years by boards of health. Possession of some of these plots has <Col N="1314" /> been withheld in some places.  If they were available they would be valuable to the working-class community and would help to maintain families in vegetables and potatoes.  These sources of food production may seem to be of little value, but I suggest that they would ultimately be an asset to the whole community if available for food production.  I ask the Minister to take these matters into consideration, and to do something about the mineral deposits, to which I was very glad to hear Senator Parkinson calling attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not unduly delay the House, as we have had a very long discussion and review of the whole circumstances of the agricultural community. With many things that Senator Baxter said I am in complete agreement but, God knows, I am afraid that his speech was a kind of litany of pessimism.  It had a depressing influence on me, and was without any bit of silver lining.  I do not like to follow exactly on these lines.  On the last occasion that this House met, the Taoiseach, when speaking on this vital matter, gave the impression that there would scarcely be anything in the nature of compulsion.  It is an ugly stick to use on the Irish people.  We know, historically, that you may lead them but you cannot brow-beat or drive them.  That is an admitted historical fact in reference to the Irish character.  The inference I got from the Taoiseach's address, and that I took with me to the country, was that an appeal would go to the farmers of Ireland to realise their duty to the nation in this crisis, and that they would rise to the occasion and implement their industry by increased acreage in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In normal times the accepted philosophy, internationally, is, I believe, that nations cannot live in complete isolation; that they are interdependent on one another for their trade and commerce.  But these are not normal times, and, probably, whilst some of us may have criticised the policy of Fianna Fáil in past years, and the policy of self-sufficiency, there is no doubt that the inspiration and the support <Col N="1315" /> that that Party gave to that policy has been conducive of very beneficial results in the crisis that is there now.</P>
    <P>There is much in what Senator Counihan suggests about parish committees. I was rather relieved when some Senator suggested that the Minister should select these committees. I agree with that.  Some of us who have had experience of rural committees know that they meet and then sit down and begin to segregate those who should be excluded.  It is found that Paddy Fitzgerald has to do no tillage.  Then they start to scratch their heads and say: &ldquo;Oh, do you not see the reason?  Is not Paddy Fitzgerald's aunt married to Tim Casey, and is not Tim Casey the chairman of the whole committee?&rdquo; From experience these are the things we find happening. Some means should be devised whereby committees set up by the Minister would go into the question. The difficulty will arise in each area as to the suitability of certain land for crop production.  All credit to Senator O'Dwyer for the initial step he has taken in the crisis.  Being a Limerick man, like myself, I think he will admit that if a compulsory tillage order is forced on the farmers I would be right if I said that about 75 per cent. of the land in that county is totally unsuitable for tillage.  I can speak from practical experience.</P>
    <P>Although I am a townsman, as well as being a farmer, I am not evading my duty as a citizen of the State.  I think if we had less patriotism and a better spirit of citizenship it would be an advantage for the country, because there would be less politics and other sorts of nonsense.  I own land two miles due west of the town I am living in in West Limerick.  I gave evidence before the Derating Commission in 1928 dealing with the geological differences in land in close proximity to where I live. I can go into my farm on Christmas Day and open the drills for potatoes. Apropos of that, I doubt if there is any farmer in Ireland who can stand up and boast, as I can to-day, of the unique distinction of having put in this week my wheat crop for the year <Col N="1316" /> 1940.  That shows the accommodation of the soil on land I own, but if I went some miles south-west, which would bring me in close proximity to Newcastle-West, and the western area of the county, then the enforcement of a tillage order for a considerable number of months in the radius around that town would be the last word in tyranny.  One shower of rain and all the energies and all the toils and the hardship that the farmer has gone through in the course of three weeks in pulverising his soil is gone for nothing; this one night's rain converts the soil into blocks of almost brick and mortar.  Certainly the soil is rendered unsuitable for the planting of the crop and for the raising of it.  Most of the farmers in that particular area are scarcely able to produce sufficient food to maintain even their own families owing to the vagaries of soil and climate.</P>
    <P>That is one of the facts that I gave evidence of before the Derating Commission. Ours is essentially a grazing county suitable for the production of eggs, butter, beef and mutton.  I warn the Minister for Agriculture now that if the Compulsory Tillage Order is enforced in such circumstances it will have very serious results on the people. It will be prejudicial even to the production of butter, eggs, bacon, beef and mutton and it will not increase the production of corn or other crops. Senator O'Dwyer can bear me out in that.  He knows that over an extended area in the east of the county the farmers put in an oat crop or a wheat crop.  That grows luxuriantly but when it comes to maturity one night's rain causes the whole crop to be lodged; it rots in the ground and cannot be taken out.  These are the conditions to which I want to draw the attention of the Minister.  I am quite aware that there is a condition and a sort of an atmosphere in the minds of the people of the country at the moment strongly in favour of making our country as self-sufficient as possible.  The people realise that if the U-boat menace continues indefinitely it will have serious reactions on the fortunes of this country.  That mentality is there among the people.  There is as a consequence <Col N="1317" /> a natural pre-disposition on the part of the people to co-operate with the Government in the raising of at least two fundamentals&mdash;beet and wheat, wheat for the making of flour and beet for the production of sugar primarily for the table of the poor.  I would appeal to the Minister to go into this whole question with the local people, with the people who know local conditions and who are able to see things for themselves.  He would discover from them that soils and farms that are excellent for the raising of beef, butter, eggs and bacon are quite unsuitable for the growing of wheat or other cereals.  However, he can go into that matter with these people themselves. He can then pursue the policy that is best for the country.  All credit is due to Senator O'Dwyer for his initiative in the matter of the creation of these parish committees.  I believe that if we could segregate politics from this business great things could be achieved and the people would be saved from worrying about the future and anticipating the dangers and troubles that the future may bring.</P>

    <P>Anois tá plean eile ag an Seanadóir Baxter&mdash;agus ag Seanadóirí eile: i n-áit talamh do thabhairt do dhaoine chun í do shaothrú, tá scéim acu barántas do thabhairt dóibh go bhfaghaidh siad a luach ar gach toradh a fhásfas siad. Ach cé bhearfhas an bhreith fán luach a íocfas siad?  Cé chuirfheas an &ldquo;minimum price&rdquo;, agus, má cuirtear &ldquo;minimum price&rdquo;, ba cheart &ldquo;maximum price&rdquo; do bheith ann chomh maith?  Má dheineann Piaghaltas na tíre an talamh do thabhairt dos na feirmeóirí ar bharántas go bhfaghaidh siad an luach, níor cheart luach níos aoirde do chur ar an lucht cheannaigh. Cad é an cothrom atá ins an méid seo?</P>
    <P>Ní gádh dul níos fuide leis an scéal, ach tá dúil agam go mbeidh an tAire agus an Riaghaltas seasmhach ar an gceist seo, agus, nuair a bhéas an cogadh thart ar fad, nach rachaidh siad ar ais go dtí an sean-nós agus an talamh d'fhágaint gan saothrú ach go leanfaidh siad don bpolasaí seo&mdash; iarraidh ar na daoine an talamh do shaothrú i gcomhnuidhe.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh leithscéal annseo de dhaoine gan airgead.  Bíonn an &ldquo;béal bocht&rdquo; ar an Seanadóir Baxter i gcomhnuidhe&mdash;nach bhfuil airgead aca, nach bhfuil creidiúint le fagháil aca, nach féidir leo an talamh do shaothrú.  Sé rud adeirim-se: nár cheart daoine do chur ar an talamh má tá siad gan bheith ábalta aon rud do dhéanamh leis.  Má bhionn siopaí nó monarchana ag duine agus má theipeann air airgead d'fhagháil agus má tá sé gan creidiúint agus gan ar a chumas dul ar agaidh níos mó leis an obair, stadann sé.  Tig leis na feirmeoirí gur féidir leobhtha é an fheirm do dhíol agus dul ag obair.  Ba cheart an talamh do thabhairt do dhaoine a bhéas ábalta an talamh do shaothrú. Tá ógánaigh ag imtheacht as an tír agus bhéadh siad an-shásta feirm d'fhagháil, agus dá mbeadh beagán tailimh aca bhéadh deireadh leis an imtheacht.  Cuirim i n-iúl do'n Riaghaltas gur mhaith an rud seans do thabhairt dóibh níos mó do dhéanamh <Col N="1320" /> ar an talamh ná mar a dheineann an dream atá air anois.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Before anybody strikes an unpleasant note, I would like to congratulate the House on its unanimity on this question of compulsory tillage. When I saw the motion and the amendment, I thought we would have some differences of opinion between Senator Baxter and Senator Counihan, and so it was quite a relief when Senator Counihan got up and said he was thoroughly in agreement with everything Senator Baxter had said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I take it we are all agreed on the necessity for this compulsory tillage measure.  Some of the speakers said we should not have any tillage in County Meath but that it would be a good thing to have it everywhere else.  Other people said we should not have any tillage in County Limerick, but that it would be absolutely necessary to have it in every other county. If we went around all the counties, I am sure we would find isolated people in every county who would say that tillage was all right for somebody else but not to ask them to engage in it.  I believe that Senator Baxter and Senator Counihan&mdash;and this was always my opinion&mdash;represent a very small minority of the farmers.  I refuse to believe that any appreciable number of farmers have any objection to carrying out the tillage order of the Government. I have gone around the country as much as most other people since this measure was introduced and I am very glad to say that anywhere I have been people of every denomination realise the necessity for increased tillage.  With very few exceptions, they are prepared to carry out that order to the letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter's motion suggests that everything possible should be done before this order would be put into force.  I did not hear his speech, but I am sure he did not tell us the things that should be done and which have not been done.  In my opinion, everything possible has been done to get the people to carry out a tillage policy and the people have responded <Col N="1321" /> reasonably well.  Senator Counihan tells us that we should set up parish committees.  I do not know whether he means the same committees to which Senator O'Dwyer referred at the last sitting or to which Senator Madden referred in very complimentary terms to-day.  Does he intend to give these committees judicial powers?  If not, they will have no authority to do anything.  If he does, they will have too much authority and the results will be disastrous, as the Senator himself knows.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan let the cat out of the bag when he said that his principal idea was to save the good land from the plough.  If he would substitute the word &ldquo;people&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;plough,&rdquo; we would know where we stand.  The attitude of certain Senators is that the good land should be saved from the people, that the people should be shoved back on the bad land.  When it is a question of tillage or anything else, the obvious thing, according to these Senators, is to fall back on the bad land and force the unfortunate people who have been scraping the surface of this land for years to do what is required.  This idea of land being unsuitable for tillage can be knocked into a cocked hat in a very few minutes.  We have only to look back on history in order to find out that in the year 1847 we grew 671,000 acres of wheat.  Where was that wheat grown?  Was it all grown on the bogs and mountains?  No.  It was grown on the land which Senator Counihan asks us to save from the plough, which means from the people.  In that period, the rich lands which Senator Counihan tells us are absolutely unsuitable for tillage were the lands which supplied the grain for practically the whole of north-eastern Ireland.  Anybody who knows the country is aware that the furrows still remain in the land which Senators say would not grow wheat at all.  They are there as evidence that every bit of that land grew wheat in that period.  It is not necessary to go into figures to show that that line of argument will not hold water.  The same thing might be said in regard to County Limerick.  Wheat was grown in most of that land in the <Col N="1322" /> past and I believe it can be grown again.  If the Minister issued an order requiring 75 per cent. of the land to be tilled, I would say that there would be some reason for the arguments put up against this measure, but all he is requiring to be tilled is 12½ per cent. Any man calling himself a farmer should be tilling 12½ per cent. of his land without the necessity for any compulsory order.  I will go further and say that the farm on which there is no tillage is practically impossible to work satisfactorily.  I agree that there are certain fields in every farm which would be unsuitable, but there are very few farms in which there is not sufficient suitable land to carry out what is required under the tillage order.</P>
    <P>We have had any amount of destructive criticism and very little constructive criticism.  The only sensible speech I heard from the other side of the House was the speech of Senator Hogan, with most of which I am in thorough agreement.  He suggested the development of phosphate mines in Clare.  I do not know anything about the matter but, if these mines can be developed, now is the time to do it.  In my opinion, the most serious obstacle to increased tillage is the rabbit pest.  It is a far more serious obstacle than any of those mentioned by speakers on the other side.  I suggested before to the Minister that he should take the steps necessary to get rid of these rabbits.  I think that the most desirable way of doing so would be to start a canning factory.  I believe that these rabbits could be made a valuable asset instead of being a pest. Something would require to be done on these lines immediately and, if it were done, it would eliminate a lot of the &ldquo;grousing&rdquo; which is going on in the country.  It is very desirable to have manures, especially for lea land, but, if we go back to 1847, we can ask those people who say they cannot get along without abundance of manures where the manures came from at that time. We have got to face the situation that exists and realise that we are in a very peculiar position.  Before we come to the end of the year, we might find ourselves in a position where we could not get even wheat, not to mention <Col N="1323" /> manures.  We should make the best use of the materials available at the present time.  I do not say that we can perform miracles but there is enough manure on the sides of the roads at present to provide for a greater area than it is proposed to till if there was time to prepare it for use.  Senator Baxter laughs.  Obviously, he does not know anything about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how he could.  He has not had any experience. Scrapings from the roads are piled up on the roadsides all over the country, and they constitute first-class manure, if properly used.  If Senator Baxter will call round to me to-morrow, I shall show him how to use this material.  If things like that could be developed, it would provide employment for our people, regardless of what Senator Baxter may think, and would certainly improve grass land or tillage land.  The policy of saving the rich lands from the plough, or from the people, would, in my opinion, be a disastrous policy at the present time.  As I have pointed out, the good lands have produced wheat in the past, and, in my opinion, are the most suitable lands for the production of wheat in the present crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only natural that the same thing should happen in this crisis as happened in the last crisis.  In 1917-18 we had a Compulsory Tillage Order and the greater part of the burden fell on the small farmers.  What will probably happen now is that the burden will fall on the small farmers.  During the period of the last Compulsory Tillage Order, the people who were brought into court for not complying with the order were the people who are now objecting to carrying out the tillage order made by this Government. They might, in the main, be called &ldquo;loyalists&rdquo; but they were not sufficiently loyal to carry out the tillage order of the British Government in the last crisis and I suppose they will not be sufficiently patriotic to carry out the tillage order of an Irish Government now.  Because of that, it is necessary <Col N="1324" /> to have legislation to make these people do what is their duty and what they realise themselves is their duty.</P>
    <P>Along with this order for compulsory tillage should go, in my opinion, an order for compulsory acquisition as the penalty for non-compliance.  I believe that that is really the only way in which the matter can be dealt with. Somebody may say that that is Bolshevism or Communism or something else. I say that the threat has been there all the time&mdash;during the period of this Government and of the last Government. The people were told that if they would work their lands according to proper methods of husbandry, give the proper measure of employment and have a proper area under tillage they would not be interfered with.  They were told that by Minister after Minister. The same thing should apply to-day.  If a person will not carry out his duty and provide the necessary food for the country, the only thing is to acquire his land and put people on it who will till it and produce the crops necessary for the maintenance of the country.  Senator Counihan is well aware that the best land is in the big holdings and that the best land is being grazed at the present time.  I wonder if we were really up against it and if we reached a situation in which the people of this country were hungry, would Senator Counihan be of the same opinion that this rich land, which has been under grass for 40 or 50 years, should continue to be left in grass while the people went hungry.  I do not think that he would say anything of the kind.  I believe that the slight opposition which exists to the tillage order is due to lack of appreciation of the present position.  If we are to provide against disaster in future, the only way to do it is to have additional tillage.  Not alone do I think that the course adopted by the Government is right, but I think that it is the duty of the Government to insist on increased tillage.  I believe they would be lacking in their duty if they did not take the steps necessary to provide against the possibilities which threaten. We have the men available to work the land.  We have the necessary implements and no reasonable argument can <Col N="1325" /> be put forward as to why we should not deliver the goods.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were foolish enough to take any notice of the arguments put up by certain people in this House it would mean that we would have what you might call a privileged class.  We would have a situation in the country wherein demands would be made on a great percentage of the people while another small section of the people would be getting off scot-free, as far as those demands were concerned.  I do not think anybody will disagree with me when I say that if any such situation could possibly develop, it would be likely to have disastrous results.  In any troubles we might have here, whether in the way of the provision of food or if, eventually, it came to the time&mdash;I do not say that it will come to that&mdash;when some outside enemy would land on our shores, and it became necessary to fight to repel that enemy, you would have the same argument brought forward.  It would be said that because certain people never did any fighting, they should not be asked to fight to repel an invader, just as it is said now that because certain people never did any tillage, they should not be asked to till now.  I say, at any rate, that if it ever happened that an outside enemy landed on our shores, every available man should get into the fight.  As far as I could help it, at any rate, there would be no people on the fence the next time. This attempt to protect the rich lands from the plough has gone on here consistently for 125 years.  As a result, we find to-day that depopulation exists to a greater extent on the good land than on the bad land.</P>

      <P>I shall be delighted if Senator Baxter can prove that to me, but I am quite certain he cannot.  The people have had to be pushed back on to the mountains and bogs.  What we want is a policy to put the people back on the land.  I say that it would be a disastrous policy to adopt any suggestion that the operations of the Land Commission, with regard to the acquisition of land, should cease during this crisis.  The only sensible thing to do is to aim at increased productivity and, along those lines, to put the people back on the land and to give them a chance on the land&mdash;to evacuate, as I said before, people out of the danger zones, the agricultural slums on the bogs and mountains, and put them on the good land.  If they are not able to carry on and feed themselves then, it will be their own fault.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I say that we should have a policy to provide people with what might be called sustenance holdings, holdings on each of which a man, his wife and family, could at least exist under any conditions and survive.  A good deal of that could be done in proximity to cities and towns.  Where land could be made available close to markets of that kind, I would suggest that people be put on small farms, each containing ten or eight acres, with no idea of making these farms what are at present called economic holdings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I have. Any time that I am not relevant, I am quite agreeable to be brought back to the mark.  If I am not talking to the motion when I am talking about developing ten acre holdings, six acres of which would <Col N="1327" /> be put into cultivation, then I do not know what relevancy means.  My idea is that these holdings should be utilised to provide market gardening, to provide fruit and vegetables for the markets of the cities and provincial towns.  At the same time, you would be providing in each case for a man and his family.  You could say as soon as you had such a holding established: &ldquo;We are finished with that man and his family anyway.  No matter how long the war continues that man and his family are safe.&rdquo; I am also in agreement with Senator Hogan's suggestion about the establishment of cottiers' plots, because any man who has a cottage and a piece of land in addition is not going to starve.  He may not live in opulence but he is not going to starve.</P>
      <P>With regard to credit, I did not hear Senator Baxter's statement on that matter but somebody mentioned that he had not referred to credit at all.

However there must be something seriously wrong with my remarks when I got &ldquo;hear, hear!&rdquo; from that side of the House so I had better bring my speech to a conclusion.  I think this House could be used to much better advantage if, instead of allowing the debate to drift along the lines we have heard this evening&mdash;lines that are generally followed by certain people in this House&mdash;we tried as far as we could to create a spirit of optimism, to create a feeling that the people would be encouraged to get on <Col N="1328" /> with the work, to produce a little more of everything that it is possible to produce in this country, to get into the people's heads the idea that we are up against a certain position and that it is in our power to overcome that situation. These are the lines we ought to follow, in my opinion, but the bringing in of motions such as have been brought in here by Senator Counihan and Senator Baxter at this stage, can have nothing but the directly opposite result.</P>
      <P>Any man who knows anything about tillage or agricultural conditions knows that if this tillage order is to be a success people will want to get down to it right now.  They should not be encouraged to put it off for a week or a month, but to start right away.  I am sure that very few people take any interest in motions of this kind.  I think their only effect can be to create a feeling of uncertainty in the minds of the farmers of the country: the feeling that, after all, the Government or somebody else will perform a miracle, and that they will not have to get on with the work.  Our aim here should be to get it into the minds of the people that in this crisis they have a patriotic duty to perform, that it is up to them to do the work, and not to grouse about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement made by Senator Counihan was, I think, a very unfortunate one.  He spoke of keeping the good land from the plough. May I remind him that the history of this country is one of keeping the good land from the plough?  The result of that has been that our population, which was 8,000,000 in 1841, has been reduced to 4,000,000 at the present day, if we include that portion of Ireland which should belong to us.  If this country were to follow the policy outlined by Senator Baxter and Senator Counihan it would mean that the drift, which has been in operation in one way or another for 600 years, would be continued. Eventually, it would lead to the disappearance of our rural population. According to official statistics, the rural population has declined in the last ten years by 113,000, while in the same period the urban population has <Col N="1329" /> gone up by about 133,000.  If a policy of that kind were allowed to go on, we would have no rural population in another ten years.  We have seen the sons and daughters of farmers and farm workers fleeing from the land. In my opinion the Government have some share of responsibility for that condition of affairs.  If more had been done by them on certain lines, which I will indicate later, the policy of compulsion proposed to-day need not, I think, be adopted.  I think, for instance, that the Government were neglectful in the matter of land division. We have an army of inspectors going through the country, and yet, in the matter of land division, we have quite a large number of estates which have not yet been touched.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the suggestion that one way of meeting the present crisis would be to speed up land division.  Another would be to increase the allotments held by rural labourers.  We have 44,000 cottiers, and, without any compulsion whatever, where the land is available, their half-acres could be increased to one acre. Another suggestion I have to make is <Col N="1330" /> to make credit available for farmers. In my opinion this compulsory tillage scheme will not be a success unless extensive credits are made available for farmers.  They will not be in a position to increase production unless that is done.  Senator Counihan need not be afraid, if my suggestion is adopted, that the fattening land will be touched because we know, from the past history of the country, that it was land that was already in production that provided the increase in production when the demand for it was made, and not the fattening land.  I would ask the Minister to consider the suggestions I have made.</P>
      <P>If greater freedom were allowed on the discussion of the motion there are many other suggestions that I would like to make.  There is one thing that I cannot help saying, and that is that in my view the farmers have not been doing their job in this matter of production. Take the case of Denmark. In a period of ten years, the farmers there, by increasing the area under tillage, doubled their butter production and quadrupled their egg production. In the same period we here had to depend on what is known as grass butter. Very little butter is made here in the winter time.  I suggest to farmers that they should give greater attention to the growth of the crops necessary to enable them to carry on production the whole year round.  We should have a greater production of butter, eggs and bacon.  The fact that we have not is, I believe, due to the lack of tillage.  In that country, too, 86 per cent. of the food consumed is home grown.  Surely, what has been achieved there on a very inferior soil, and with a climate not nearly as good as ours, could be done in this country.  If some effort is not made here on a voluntary basis to increase production, then I think the Minister should have his compulsory powers.  In conclusion, I hope that discretion will be used in the exercise of the powers which the Minister is seeking, and that penalties will not be imposed if people show that they cannot carry out the terms of whatever order is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. McCabe Mr. McCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I referred to the question of credit for <Col N="1331" /> farmers.  If we are to have increased tillage I am of the opinion that there will be a number of people who will not be able to carry it out.  It would be my wish that there should be no exceptions in the enforcement of this order, but at the same time I feel that a number of people will be found down through the country who, in the absence of credit, will not be able to carry out the regulations.  I agree with the suggestion that the setting up of parish committees would prove useful.  An important matter is the number of farm labourers presently unemployed. The majority of them are receiving the dole&mdash;I suppose about 8/- or 9/- a week. In my opinion an easy way of helping the farmer to increase his area under tillage would be to give him a share of that money.  If that is done he will be in a position to pay the standard wage to his farm labourers.  That is one way the Government could help him to produce more food&mdash;by providing him with 50 per cent. of his labour costs.  That would absorb, of course, a number of practical farm hands; I mean men who are accustomed to working on the land, and who would be most content to have work with the farmer at the moment.  If we do not consider this matter, I am afraid we will have a number of those boys going into the towns, and there is nothing there for them.  It would certainly get the people off the land, and in a few years hence nobody would mind about the land or have any knowledge or experience of working it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My other point is that I do not altogether agree with Senator Quirke when he refers to the matter of fertilisers and artificial manures for the production of more food.  I say it is absolutely essential that the Minister should see that a sufficient amount of artificial manure or fertilisers is in this country if we are compelled, to put in extra crops next year.  It is all very well to say that farmyard manure is sufficient, but, from the experience that I have had in County Cavan for a number of years, I say that farmyard manure is not sufficient to raise the crops that are required. I say that artificial manures are certainly wanted, and that the <Col N="1332" /> Government will be doing good work&mdash; I know they will have their difficulties &mdash;if they try to get a sufficient quantity into this country.  Probably, with the assistance that the farmers may get from the Government, and with the cooperation of the people generally, we may get what we expect and hope for, a good return on production next year for the farmers of the country.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion when this House met, I had the audacity to speak for an hour and a half on a motion advocating various methods of expanding agricultural production. Unfortunately, on that occasion the Minister was unable to be present, owing to reasons of ill-health, and I may say that I welcome the presence of the Minister on this occasion; we are glad to see that he is well enough to be with us again.  By way of cheering you up, I may also say that, if the Minister can assure me that he has meanwhile read any of the words of wisdom which I spoke at such length on that occasion, I might on this occasion restrict myself to a very few minutes indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks on that occasion did indeed produce a certain reaction from a very important Senator of the Government Party, who unfortunately is not present in the House at the moment.  He told a very amusing story about a cock and hens, the point of which seemed to be that those fowl prefer a diet of wheat to a diet of pearls.  I also inferred from that anecdote that the Senator in question was of the opinion that I had been casting unappreciated pearls of wisdom somewhere in the neighbourhood of where he sits.  If that be so, I should like to apologise to all concerned. Coming now to the more serious business in hand, I might ask what do we want all this tillage for?  If the answer is only in order to feed 3,000,000 Irish people, then, so far from increasing the area under tillage, we might indeed diminish that area, and so far from <Col N="1333" /> maintaining our present 8,000,000 acres of pasture land, we might easily allow 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 acres of that pasture to grow gorse and ferns.  We would have enough land left to feed our 3,000,000 people, both with tillage crops and live-stock produce, if we were concerned only to feed our 3,000,000 people.  Obviously, we have far more in view than that.  We want not only to feed our 3,000,000 Irish people, but to maintain, and if possible increase, our exports of agricultural produce to John Bull.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who are those people on the land that we are asking to make what looks like a sacrifice in obeying this compulsory tillage order, in order to maintain and increase production and maintain and increase our exports to John Bull?  Our total number of producers, the number of persons gainfully occupied according to official statistics, is something like 1,200,000 and, of that total, about half or about 600,000 are occupied in agricultural production.  The other half, mainly urban population, are occupied in non-agricultural production, commercial, industrial and professional.  Those 600,000 people who produce agricultural goods, according to a recent official record, enjoy and distribute amongst them some £42,000,000 of the total national income, an average of £70 per head.  The other 600,000, representing a privileged class and mostly living in towns and cities, enjoy and distribute between them an income averaging £170 per head.  In other words, we in the towns have been exploiting agriculture as a whole, and those are the people we are now asking to make an effort in the national interest in order to produce and export more food.  Well, we in the towns have an interest in continuing this profitable exploitation of agriculture, and it will certainly go hard with us if they cease to maintain their present volume of production.  If they adopted a policy of producing only for the subsistence of the 3,000,000 people in Ireland, then the economic foundations of our urban population and our urban industry would be completely destroyed, for urban industry depends on the ability to import some £20,000,000 worth of <Col N="1334" /> industrial raw materials, and the only way in which we can continue to pay for that necessary import of industrial raw materials is by continuing to be able to export some £20,000,000 or £30,000,000 worth of agricultural products. We in the towns, then, have an interest in maintaining and expanding agricultural produce as a whole, and we have an interest, both a sectional and a national interest&mdash;in which I wish the agricultural community had a richer share&mdash;in maintaining this policy of feeding John Bull.  Well, John Bull also has an interest in our pursuing this policy, and if this policy requires that we should expand the area under tillage, and if that expansion is going to cost money, then I say that John Bull ought to pay for that additional expansion of tillage which may be necessary.  I say further that if John Bull will pay our farmers the same price he has readily agreed to pay the farmers in Northern Ireland for the bacon exports and the egg exports which come from that region of Ireland, then the incentive to tillage derived from the profitable price of eggs and bacon will be sufficient greatly to expand the production of potatoes, barley, and every other forage crop which in any way can be turned into pigs and bacon and beef.  In other words, there would be an incentive for them if our Government could only arrive at an agreement with the British Government by which the British Government would pay our farmers the same price for eggs and bacon as they are already paying the farmers in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Further, I would say that if the object of this compulsion is to compel us to continue growing 200,000 acres of wheat and, in fact, to expand the growing of wheat until we reach 350,000 acres of wheat, we are doing something which is neither necessary nor profitable, even in the present national emergency. The fixed price for wheat grown at home is 35/- a barrel, which is equivalent to a price of £14 a ton, unless my arithmetic is wrong, and the average yield of wheat per statute acre is somewhere in the region of a ton to the acre.  Now, even at the present time, wheat is available in America at <Col N="1335" /> a price which is less than £10 a ton, and, in fact, the American Government are paying a bounty of 27 cents a bushel on every bushel of wheat exported from that country.  So that if only we could get wheat by import instead of growing it ourselves at a cost of £14 a ton, we would save some £7 or £8 on every ton of wheat consumed in this country. Applying that saving of £8 a ton to 350,000 tons of wheat, you get a total saving of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 in the year, which our consumers would profit by in cheaper bread if we abandoned altogether the cultivation of wheat in favour of an expansion in the cultivation of other cereal products which would be just as profitable to the farmers under present conditions, inflict no injury on the land, and would form a natural part of our permanent agricultural economy.  As things are, our compulsory policy, if it is directed to increasing the amount of wheat grown at home, when there is no real difficulty about getting cheaper imported wheat, is, I believe, a device for increasing the taxation on consumers in furtherance of a policy for which there is no excuse whatever.  I do want to see more tillage of the kind which has an economic justification, both temporary and permanent.  A policy of expanding bacon production and egg production and beef production by stall-feeding in the winter as well as grass feeding in the summer will indirectly be a policy inducing the cultivation of a considerable increase of oats, barley and, I would add, potatoes, and those are the directions in which tillage should, I think, be expanded.</P>
    <P>Finally, we seem to have a wrong attitude altogether to tillage.  Tillage is not simply a healthy form of open-air exercise for horses and men.  It has some relationship to the ultimate values which should be achieved directly or indirectly by the process of tillage and, in fact, most of our characteristic tillage crops are eventually turned out in the form of live-stock products, like eggs, butter and bacon. Consequently we want to look to the prices obtainable for those final products, to the price of bacon, eggs and such like, as the ultimate economic <Col N="1336" /> justification for our encouraging or compelling an expansion of the area under tillage.  If we can make satisfactory arrangements with John Bull about the price at which he will take over any amount of eggs and bacon that we can produce, I think you will have no trouble whatever in getting our farmers to expand tillage.  One of the reasons for that is that they know that they cannot count on the unlimited import of Indian meal and other imported raw materials which they formerly used to a considerable extent in producing live-stock products, and our own potatoes and oats and, to a certain extent, barley, are a natural substitute for the maize meal that we can no longer count on freely importing. If we must import cereal products of some kind, it is more economic that we should import wheat, the whole of which in the form of flour becomes a product capable of direct human consumption, rather than import Indian meal which, in the process of use, becomes only a sixth of its former weight and volume when turned into bacon or eggs.  From the point of view of economy of shipping space it is in our interest and also in the British interest that we should import wheat rather than Indian meal and, if we must curtail our imports, that we should curtail Indian meal and expand the production of home-grown potatoes, home-grown oats and home-grown barley.</P>
    <P>Interpreted in that sense, I am all in favour of a policy of expanding tillage but I am all opposed to any flat rate, or inflexible system by which every single farmer in the country would be compelled to till at least 12½ per cent. of his land, whatever might be the nature of that land.  If you have good fattening grassland, why spoil £10 worth of grass in order to produce £11 worth of grain?  The thing is utterly absurd both from the point of view of the individual farmer and of the nation.  On the other hand, if you want to expand tillage in the country as a whole the right policy is to encourage the expansion of tillage in those regions of the country where tillage is already part of the local economy and part of the local tradition, and, at the same time, to allow <Col N="1337" /> the specialised qualities of those other regions in the country, even if they are grasslands, to continue to contribute their quota to the national wealth. The idea that a farmer whose land is altogether under grass is not playing a worthy part in the agricultural economy is quite absurd and in this matter I speak with some little personal experience.  I did, once upon a time, run a farm of 20 acres.  It consisted mainly of two fields and a garden.  Both the fields were grass and sometimes hay.  I kept 200 hens, three or four cows and about eight or ten calves.  I maintain that by my keeping of so many hens, although I did not actually till one square yard of ordinary field myself, I did, nevertheless, cause the tillage of a considerable number of acres by other people because, as Senators are aware, if you feed your hens properly, every 200 hens will consume the produce of at least one or two acres of corn land and, if you feed your cows properly, you will want to buy roots for them, if you do not grow them yourself, and that gives an outlet for tillage in other parts of the country in your own neighbourhood or elsewhere. So that, grasslands properly managed in conjunction with live-stock farming intensely carried on is a natural concomitant of tillage, although not necessarily on that farm, but it does give economic significance to the tillage carried on elsewhere.  What we really want to aim at is a natural regional specialisation of tillage in some districts and some farms and intensified grass cultivation and live-stock production in other districts and other farms.  The two together will give us a properly balanced economy and we must not look askance at the man whose whole activity is in connection with grassland, because, directly or indirectly, that man may be creating just as much wealth and just as much employment as if he tilled three-fourths of his farm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to keep the House very long, but having listened here this evening to some Senators, particularly Senators Counihan, Johnston and The McGillycuddy, I may say that they appear to have been <Col N="1338" /> far more interested in keeping the good land of Ireland for the bullocks and that they feel that they are more important than the human beings.  It is not a question with these people to keep the land from the plough but to keep it from the people of Ireland. The only fault I have to find with the Government's order is that they are not going far enough.  I think that it should be 25 per cent. instead of 12½ per cent.  Apart from the question of any crisis, let the people not forget that it has been the policy of Sinn Féin and the policy of those who supported Sinn Féin that this country should be self-supporting.  We all know that there are certain people possessing lands in this country who will not till.</P>
      <P>I would like Senator Counihan to enlighten me in some way as to what he means by a &ldquo;practical farmer.&rdquo; Does he mean a man who never raised a cow, a calf, a pig or a hen and who never cultivated one acre of land but who leaves the work to others?  Is that the practical farmer that Senator Counihan would like to get on this committee to say who should till land?  There are many such people in this country making a good living out of what I term the small practical farmer in this country, the man who has to take off his coat to produce the wealth out of the soil of the nation.  I should like Senator Counihan to tell me what type he would like to put on the committee, what type he would say is the practical farmer.  I have made up my mind as to what is meant by a practical farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Outside the question of any crisis, it is time the Government took action to make the people who own the land of Ireland, which is the real wealth of the country, do their duty.  It would be interesting, I am sure, if Senator Baxter would take note of an advertisement I saw in a local paper of last Saturday's date&mdash;<i>Drogheda Independent and Cavan Leaguer.</i>  The advertisement stated that there were 400 acres of land to be let, and the persons advertising indicated that they were acting on the instructions of the agent.  I would like to know where the owners of this land are.  The advertisement mentioned that there would be a herd on the land.  I wonder what payment does the herd receive. <Col N="1339" /> It was also mentioned that the property included 100 acres of uncut meadow.  Hay at present is worth 5/- a cwt.  Could the persons who own that land be described as some of the practical farmers Senator Counihan would like to have on the Committee.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Senator Baxter would not like to see the valuable land of Ireland left with people who refuse to use it properly.  Would he like to have the position that there would be no compulsion on them to produce the wealth necessary for the nation?  I have given one instance of persons with 400 acres and they are so useless to the country that they will not cut 100 acres of meadow.  How many families could make a comfortable living out of the 400 acres of arable land.  I was reared in a parish where there were 90 families and there were not 400 acres of arable land in the entire parish.  There was land that could, perhaps, be used in another direction, in the production of timber and forestry.  That, in its own way, would be a very valuable asset. At the same time, it was not the type of land the people should be compelled to live on.  I hope the Government will insist on the cultivation of at least 12½ per cent. of the arable land. I think that amount is too small and the Government are not going far enough.</P>
    <P>There is one point that does concern me very much in connection with this tillage problem.  What can be done for the farm labourer?  Have the Government taken into consideration that some reasonable increase should be given in the wages that the farm labourers are receiving?  I know there are certain farmers who have made an honest effort to pay their farm labourers, but they probably are not in a position to pay at a higher rate than the fixed rate.  I feel that the Government should consider the farm labourers' position very seriously.  I am satisfied that the farm labourers as a whole work hard on the soil for 53 hours every week and they should not be treated as they are being treated to-day.  They are the lowest paid persons within the nation.  I hope when the Government are intensifying <Col N="1340" /> tillage schemes, they will give due consideration to the farm labourers by giving them a reasonable increase.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I would like to bring forward, if I would be in order.  I am not satisfied that the main producer, the small farmer, is getting a fair price in proportion to what the workers in the towns are paying for agricultural produce&mdash;bacon, beef and other commodities.  I can never understand, when I read the Dublin Cattle Market reports, setting out that the price as 38/- per cwt., or 4d. per lb., why my neighbours have to pay 1/4 per lb.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is not, but, nevertheless, it is a very serious position. The difference between 4d. and 1/4 is too great, and there is something definitely wrong.  The matter should be carefully examined.  I am sure Senator Baxter will realise that it is unfair for any person to hold 400 acres and make no effort to till the land, or utilise it as it should be utilised.  I think that at least that property should be given to people who are prepared to till it, to give reasonable conditions to their employees, and to produce the food so much needed in this country. At the present crisis there is no reason why we should not produce all the wheat and sugar beet that we require, and be in a position to export some.</P>
      <P>I instanced the case where the owner of 400 acres had 100 acres of uncut meadow.  If such people would only realise it, the cultivation of the land is very profitable, and I will give one example.  I know a holding of eleven acres in the County Dublin that produced wheat to the value of £360.  That was an excellent return, and it would be very profitable for people with large holdings to go in for cultivation of that type, as well as giving employment. There is no use in saying that any land is too good for tillage.  If you are to expect a return from any land, it must be good land, not land of the rocks, bogs and patches type that is to be met with in different parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1341" /> In the minds of many people, the idea is not to give the land to the people, but rather to give it to the bullocks. That has been the policy for years, and because of that policy the population of the country has decreased.  Thank God that we have in power a Government that before the crisis has gone very far, have adopted a certain definite line, which must be now admitted was sound national policy.  I hope they continue along that line and intensify their efforts, and, in pursuing that policy, I trust they will consider the agricultural worker and give him an increase in his wages.  If there are certain farmers not in a position to give decent wages, they might be granted loans or given certain credit facilities.  I should like Senator Counihan to explain his type of practical farmer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in this discussion we should realise the emergency that we are up against, and we should also realise that it outweighs every other consideration.  It is rather futile to discuss compulsory tillage, and it is futile to discuss the suitability of land for tillage purposes or anything else in face of the fact that there is a war on, and, if that war continues until next summer, we may find ourselves a year hence confronted with a shortage of wheat and sugar and practically every other essential foodstuff. That is quite possible.  We must realise also that the value of the pound may fall and we may not be in a position to import foodstuffs.  Any hardship that might fall on the individual farmer would be nothing compared to the hardships that would arise if we found ourselves next year faced with a shortage of foodstuffs.  Let us put ourselves in the position that it cannot be said later on that we lost a grand opportunity when we did not utilise the land at our disposal.  If we were not to make proper use of the land now, it could be said later on that we must have been mad to allow such a thing to happen, when the land was there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the farmers generally realise that this extra tillage is necessary. There is no objection to compulsory tillage.  At an earlier stage it might have been possible to obtain <Col N="1342" /> the extra tillage by voluntary means, but it is too late to try experiments now.  Everyone admits that the growing of food is essential, as it may not be possible in this period of emergency to import our requirements.  At the same time, it is well to realise that every class should bear its part in promoting the scheme.  The farmers will do their part and the general public also have a part to play, but the Government have a great part to play in making this tillage campaign a success.  There is no doubt that in the greater part of the country, the dairying and grazing districts, the farmers are not used to tillage and the change over will entail great hardship for them.  It is as difficult for a farmer to change from grazing to tilling, a large portion of his land as it would be for an ordinary grocer to turn his establishment into a drapery establishment. There is the greater difficulty still that the farmers in grazing and dairying districts, as a general rule, are short of capital.  They lived from hand-to-mouth in pre-war days, and, during the recent depression, nearly all of them lost whatever capital they had and are not, as a result, in a position to buy implements or labour.  That fact should be recognised, and if the tillage campaign is to be a success, loans should be made readily available in proportion to the amount of tillage which farmers are required to carry out.  The ordinary loan schemes which might work in ordinary times would not suit an emergency such as the present. The loan must be available.  The sugar company gives a loan of so much per acre for beet grown, and provides seeds and manures, so that the farmer can go in for beet with very little capital. The same facility should be provided for any other class of crop.</P>
    <P>It would also be well to point out that there might be a danger that too great a quantity of grain crops might be grown.  Most of the farmers on the land which will be broken up will go in for wheat, barley or oats, with the result that there may be a great deal of grain crops, but a shortage of roots and potatoes.  We must remember that we should provide not alone for the feeding of the people, but, as far as possible, for pig feeding and stall-feeding, <Col N="1343" /> so that we may export the greatest possible quantity of meat, butter and eggs during the coming year and, to make sure of that, it is necessary that a large quantity of potatoes should be grown.  I suggest that if the Minister allowed an acre of potatoes to count as two acres of ordinary tillage, it would be a great encouragement. Another means might be the giving of a bounty on potatoes, but perhaps that is not practicable. We must also remember that grain crops in general do not give much employment. A man can sow 100 acres of grain crops with scarcely any labour, but potatoes and root crops will employ labour.</P>
    <P>The question of parish committees was also raised, and I think the Government should consider the establishment of these committees because of the great help they would give in the tillage campaign.  The question was asked as to whether they would have judicial powers, but I do not think it would be practicable to give powers to such bodies to decide who should or should not be exempt.  A parish committee, however, representative of workers and farmers, could help in providing machinery like tractors, reapers and binders, in providing seeds and manures, and generally doing in their own district what the individual farmer could not do for himself.  There would be difficulty in starting them over the greater part of the country, and the initial steps should be taken by the Department of Agriculture, or by some other authority with courage and confidence, and not left to local initiative, because, in the districts in which tillage is quite new, it would be very difficult for the ordinary farmer, left to his own resources, to break a large proportion of his land.</P>
    <P>A further point is that there are many derelict farms throughout the country.  In the grazing districts there are many farms on which the farmer has no help, and which he has no means of tilling, and if the owners are to be obliged to till a certain proportion, it would be well if that land was taken off their hands.  If such lands are to be put into cultivation, it would <Col N="1344" /> be necessary to devise some means by which they could be rented or allotted to those who could till.  The best means of doing that would be the committees. It is necessary to meet that difficulty in some way and to deal with the position of people who would not themselves be able to till.  I suggest these are the questions the Government should tackle&mdash;the provision of capital in such a manner as to make it readily available to those required to till, the starting of these local committees, and the making of arrangements whereby farms could be tilled in cases in which the owners preferred to hand them over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was late for the early part of the debate, but I gather that arguments were used against compulsory tillage.  That, to my mind, is a very short-sighted policy.  We have heard a good deal of criticism of the wheat and beet policies, but if we had not got the sugar beet industry established in this country to-day, the people would be without sugar.  It is quite possible that, 12 months from now, if we have not got our own wheat to supply our people, we may also be without wheat.  I realise that there are difficulties connected with the tillage order.  There are districts in which the art of tilling is lost, in which the land is heavy and difficult, and in which great skill is required to make tillage successful, but I think the tillage order may be a blessing in disguise. My own opinion is that it is a bad thing for the farmer to have all his eggs in one basket and to give over his land entirely to dairying and cattle raising.  He would be much better off if he went in for mixed farming, and particularly a little tillage.  We had a famine in this country not so long ago, and the memory of that epoch will never be forgotten.  There is a great responsibility on the Government in respect of the provision of food for the people, and there is also a great responsibility on every member of this House.  I think it very unwise and foolish for any member to make any statement that would tend to lessen the supply of food for the people during the difficulties ahead of us.  I realise, as I say, that there are difficulties <Col N="1345" /> in connection with the tillage order, and I have in mind particularly East Limerick, where the land is difficult and hard to manage and where the grass is the best the world can produce. I know that it is difficult to get the people of the district to reconcile themselves to the plough, but I have no doubt whatever that, once they get accustomed to a little tillage, they will be better off and will never give it up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much I should like to say about the compulsory tillage order in the last war which I will not say, but the Senator has brought to my mind a very important point.  The compulsory tillage order of the last war was not, to my mind, carried out by the proper people, and I hope that, when this Order is being carried out, it will be carried out by the right people.  I still have East Limerick in mind, and I say that if the proper person is sent into that district to enforce the tillage order, a man with full knowledge of all the difficulties connected with tillage in that district, a man who will himself be a good tillage farmer and able to impart the knowledge he possesses in a kindly and cheerful way, the people will bless that man and abide by his counsel.  I say again that when we had a compulsory tillage order previously the wrong type of people were administering it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our first duty is to provide food for the people, and our second duty is to provide food for our live stock.  I think the opportunity is there now to develop our live stock and to bring our herds up to scratch&mdash;to improve the quality and increase the numbers of our animals.  Our dairy herds, particularly, in many districts are not up to scratch.  I think there is an opportunity, through a heifer loan scheme or a credit scheme of some kind, to provide people with the means of replenishing their herds.  Some people are under the impression that more tillage means less cattle.  Practical experience shows that more tillage means more cattle.  In the tillage districts the cattle are always better turned out and <Col N="1346" /> more economical.  In the good grazing districts the cattle get very lean during the winter and it takes them a good part of the summer before they come back to normal.  In the tillage districts the animals get a little feeding all through the winter and are kept in a healthy thriving state all the time.</P>
    <P>Some people seem to think that silage is the remedy for the grass-growing areas.  My opinion is that if silage is to be made a success it will be made a success in the good tillage districts and not in the grazing areas.  The making of silage is a skilful operation and needs skilful people.  I do not want to reflect on the people in the grazing districts, but I say that they have not the same skill in connection with agriculture as the people in the tillage areas. Therefore, I say that if silage is to be made successful it will be made successful in the tillage areas.  If silage can be made successful in any of the European countries I cannot see any reason why it should not be made successful here. I have had a little experience of it, as I have been making it for four or five years.  I am not entirely enamoured with it, but that does not mean anything. I have seen silage made in Germany from beet leaves very successfully, but the efforts that I have seen in this country have been failures more or less.  There is need for education along these lines.  The Minister, I think, has promised to direct his attention to it, and it would be well for him to do so.</P>
    <P>We are growing beet seed very successfully in this country, and I see no reason why we should not produce mangel seed, turnip seed, grass seed, and every other kind of seed that we need for our agricultural requirements. I should like to see some steps taken in that direction.  I have the greatest faith in the landholders of this country and I think they will do their duty in the crisis ahead of us.  I ask Senators particularly to refrain from making any statement that would tend to draw them off their duty.</P>

      <P>I am afraid this debate is largely academic, because we are faced with an accomplished fact. We have this order we do not like it; <Col N="1347" /> but I am afraid we will have to lump it.  After listening to the speech of Senator Johnston, I feel that if the Minister heard that speech before he made the order he would have hesitated to make the order.  The Senator put the whole broad economic aspects of the case very clearly.  After all, it has to be considered objectively in that light. I have been listening to a lot of woolly generalisations about reconstructing the social order and dealing with the whole of our agricultural economy. Senators who dealt with the matter on these lines seemed to forget that this is an emergency and that the whole thing has to be dealt with in the course of two or three years.  You cannot completely turn everything upside down suddenly in that way.</P>
      <P>My objection to this order is its rigidity.  If you are going to make people till against their wishes and against their experience, with little or no equipment, and when they are short of capital, you are not going to get them to approach it in a patriotic spirit.  It has been suggested that everybody should rally to the cause as a national endeavour.  That is not the way it is done.  That may be very interesting for platform speeches, but, in practice, people are going to consider their own personal circumstances. There will be a large number of people doing this in the most perfunctory manner, tilling in such a way that it will just satisfy the inspectors.  Incidentally, the necessity for inspectors is a great blemish on the whole thing.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dwyer made a very good suggestion.  He said that potatoes are a very essential crop to grow in this country, and that one acre of potatoes should count for two acres of tillage; instead of encouraging all kinds, as I say, of perfunctory tillage, such as forage crops, like rape, which can be grown very easily and, presumably, satisfy the requirements of the order, and which will not carry out the spirit of the thing at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnston went to the root of the whole problem.  We are hoping by high prices, prices altogether above <Col N="1348" /> world prices, to produce certain crops, and that is only going to be done at a proportionate burden on the consumer. That is the objection to both of these crops which we want to encourage by this method&mdash;sugar beet and wheat. Both of them are very expensive crops to grow, are utterly uneconomic, and can only be grown at the expense of the taxpayer or the consumer.  Whereas, if we can only get satisfactory prices for what the country can produce, such as eggs, butter, bacon and so forth, the whole matter would be settled, because undoubtedly, if we use our own intelligence, we know that prices are bound to rise under the existing conditions, and that tillage will be brought about naturally as a result of the rising of prices.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the whole matter is conditioned largely by the fear that our export and import trade will be interfered with, or that the seas will not be kept open.  Now, I think that if such a time should come, it would be very bad for this country, but it must be remembered that this country is neutral, and if we are neutral, what is to prevent this country from getting supplies, even though other nations cannot get them?  I think that we should be able to keep the seas open for our produce, if we are neutral, and if we are not able to do so, how will we be able to get on with regard to tea or many of the raw materials of our industries, or, in fact, some of the necessities of our industries and of our lives?  If there is to be any reality in this debate at all, it should be determined by that basic fact: that we expect the seas to be kept open, or that we do not expect them to be kept open. If we expect the seas to be kept open, I consider that this scheme of compulsory tillage is the wrong way to approach the matter, and I believe that, if we approach the matter from the point of view of the ordinary price level, and the question of getting better prices for our produce, the tillage will come naturally.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I wish to put before the Minister.  If you put this percentage of 12½ in tillage on to the farmers, you will put a strain on the credit system.  It must be remembered <Col N="1349" /> that quite a lot of these people have no capital at all at the present time, and now, at a time when all the savings of the people are wanted, largely to finance the expenditure of the Government, as a result of the war, you are going to ask credit to be applied to a form of production which is uneconomic and which, I think, is very largely unnecessary under the circumstances.  Moreover, it must be borne in mind that this war may end sooner than some people think, and you are going to burden these new producers, who have no capital of their own, with a capital expenditure that they may not be able to recover during that period.  For that reason I think it is most unfortunate that the matter is being handled in this manner. Senator Johnston has put the whole thing very clearly, and I do wish that the Minister or the Executive Council had heard these arguments developed before they embarked on this very dangerous practice, as it seems to me. I think I am right in saying that there is no compulsory tillage in England.</P>

      <P>I know that certain bounties are given for the breaking up of land, and I say that if the Government, in their wisdom, think that this can be achieved without resorting to compulsory tillage, why should it be resorted to when we are, on the whole, a self-supporting country?  Now, there is one final matter to which I want to direct the Minister's attention.  Supposing that the worst came to the worst, and that we could get absolutely no more wheat, for instance, into this country than what we are producing ourselves, I suggest that the country still could live.  Potatoes, for instance, <Col N="1350" /> could come to the rescue, as well as other things, and we could live.  Of course, we would certainly be living under conditions of stringency, but it would not be a matter of life or death. We already have practically enough sugar to support ourselves.  Of course, we have to get such commodities as tea from other countries, but why should we introduce this totalitarian and rather dictatorial practice to bring about something which we might be able to get with the whole-hearted support of the people?</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter started off by saying that he would like to hear me justify the necessity for this tillage Order, and I think a number of the speeches made here to-day would point to the same doubt on the part of Senators as to the necessity for such an order.  I can quite understand that there may be a difference of opinion about that, but I suppose there is no harm in saying&mdash;I think it must have been obvious to everybody&mdash;that the Government themselves took some time to make up their minds whether to have compulsory tillage or not.  We would have preferred, I think, to go ahead and face the present crisis without compulsory tillage if we thought it was possible and advisable to do so, but in the end we decided that, on the whole, compulsory tillage was necessary. The considerations are obvious. Senator Baxter in his speech more or less referred to the fact that, if he were a member of the Government, he would be faced with the same problems with which we are; that is, having regard to the fact that we do not produce enough sugar or wheat for our people.  Now, it is possible that during 1941, and 1942, for instance, we may not be able to import all the wheat that is necessary for our people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, I think, between the home-grown crop and whatever foreign wheat is in store, something like seven months' supplies.  It is true that wheat is coming in very well at the moment, but, as I say, we had to look at the position as it might be later on. It is quite true that we are a neutral country, but even though we are neutral, there is a difficulty in getting in certain things, as everybody knows. For instance, there is the difficulty of getting in manures and certain other raw materials.  As far as I know, the difficulty with regard to these things is, to a great extent, a difficulty of shipping.  Now, if the war becomes very much intensified, even though we may be lucky enough to remain neutral, it is quite likely that it will be impossible almost for us to import anything, and especially anything so bulky as wheat, because our imports of wheat are very big in bulk.  As a Government, I suppose we were, perhaps, a bit cowardly in some ways.  We were afraid to be in the position of having to face the people in a year's time, next September, and have to say that, unfortunately, we had grown very little more wheat than last year and that we could not get wheat in either and that, as a result, we would have to cut down the bread ration.</P>
      <P>I admit that that might not be necessary, because, as Senator Sir John Keane says, we could use other materials, such as pollard, barley, and so on, in the manufacture of the loaf, instead of flour, but it would be a loaf of inferior quality and might be a small loaf.  Now I say that, in such a case the people would say that we should have done something to ward off such a situation, and, honestly, as a Government, we were afraid that the people would be very indignant, and there is a possibility that that might occur. Senator Sir John Keane says that Senator Johnston's speech would have influenced the Government to a great extent if they had heard it.  I do not think so, because Senator Johnston assumed, in his speech, that wheat would come in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We could have done it five years ago.  We adopted the policy of growing a certain acreage of wheat which could be quickly increased.  In 1917 and 1918 desperate efforts were made to grow more wheat, and they succeeded the second year in getting something like 130,000 acres.  We started with 250,000 acres.  It was much easier to increase and double that than to get 130,000 acres in 1917 and 1918.  We had these considerations in front of us: that we were not producing enough wheat and sugar for ourselves, and that as no one could know what the conditions in this country might be next September and the year following, it was rather the duty of the Government to see that as little hardship as possible was inflicted on the people in the years 1940 and 1941.  We had another consideration in front of us.  Senator Johnston and Senator Sir John Keane thought truthfully enough of the uneconomic crops, wheat and sugar beet.  That is true. They are becoming, and very nearly have become, economic now, even though the war is only on two months. I put it roughly this way, that the gap has been spanned at least half way in these two months.  If shipping becomes more difficult, it is quite possible by this time next year that our wheat and beet crops will be actually economic.  As a matter of fact, I know that from a number of quotations the Sugar Company got within the last few weeks for sugar to be imported, if they had to accept them they would be in the position that they could get sugar grown cheaper at home. Fortunately they had not to accept the quotations, and got sugar cheaper from another source.  Even the economic argument is not as strong now as it was before the war started, and may not be nearly so strong in 12 months' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> Apart from the feeding of the people we have a certain output of animal products, and we have been importing feeding stuffs, principally maize.  If we want to maintain the present output of bacon and butter for home consumption, and for export, it would be necessary, either to continue to import these feeding stuffs, including maize, or to grow as a substitute barley and oats.  We have not been able to get all the maize we want even within the last two months.  We had difficulty, unfortunately, in getting certain feeding stuffs that are necessary.  I give that as an example of the difficulties of importing certain materials, largely through shipping difficulties.  These difficulties may be increased as time goes on.  We saw the position, that we had been importing for the last four or five years roughly 7,500,000 cwts. of wheat and about the same quantity of maize.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say how much sugar?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not really say how much.  Our consumption of sugar is 100,000 tons, and we produced this year and last year about 66,000 tons, so that our imports are somewhere about 40,000 tons.  I have a note here showing that we would require another 25,000 acres of beet.  That would represent, roughly, the 40,000 tons of sugar to fulfil our requirements.  If we take the present yield of wheat, barley, oats and beet&mdash;the figures may not be altogether correct&mdash;and if we double our tillage, the yield may not be as good, especially if we have trouble about artificial manures.  We are assuming that the yield will be as good.  We would want about 450,000 acres of wheat, 400,000 acres of barley and oats, and 25,000 extra acres of beet before we could feel that the position was safe, that the people would have all the wheat and sugar they required, and that our output of animals would remain the same as it is at the moment.  That is as far as the picture put before the Government would go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing we had to consider was whether we might get that acreage or even the greater part of it, by voluntary <Col N="1354" /> effort.  We felt, even if we took the gloomiest view of the picture, that we need not prepare for a total blockade of this country commencing in September, 1940.  We asked ourselves, if shipping was reduced fairly considerably from what is available at present: would it be possible to get the greater part of that wheat, maize and sugar production by voluntary effort?  That is a very hard question to decide.  Naturally there will have to be an inducement offered.  We have to appeal to the farmers to grow wheat because our own people will require it and, at the same time, every farmer would require what would be a fair price for 1940 and 1941.  The same would apply to the growing of more beet.  At the same time we would appeal to, or, at least warn, farmers that it might be very difficult, in fact impossible, to import the large amount of feeding stuffs that we have been importing for the last three or four years, and that it would be well if they grew more oats and barley to feed to their stock.  I have no idea what we would get in an appeal of that kind under a voluntary scheme.  Possibly we might get even one-third, or about 300,000 acres of extra tillage.</P>
    <P>When you come to analyse the position I think if any Senator were in my place, and trying to give some advice to the Government, he would be inclined to divide farmers into three classes: farmers tilling up to full capacity, as they are doing in certain areas, where we cannot expect any increased tillage; farmers tilling some land with advantage to themselves and to the country, who could increase that tillage, from whom we might expect an increased acreage under an appeal made in the very best way, and by certain inducements with regard to price; and the third class of farmers who are not tilling at all.  Some of these would possibly buy the necessary implements and horses, get seeds and manures, and start to till as a result of the appeal. I think many of those who are not tilling would not answer the appeal. Anyone listening to the debate here to-day would agree with me, that the great majority of these would not answer any appeal.  Is it not obvious, from the way Senators spoke, that the <Col N="1355" /> mentality, not only amongst Senators but amongst farmers and the men for whom, I presume, they spoke, is that farmers in Meath, Westmeath, Kildare and Limerick would think that it was a bad thing to till their land, or that they were going to injure the land, or to injure themselves and the nation, and that if they wanted to serve the nation they should leave the land under grass?  From my experience, such as it is, and from the knowledge of the officers in the Department which, I would say was very much confirmed by the speeches here to-day, we could not expect to get very much from farmers who are not tilling now.  What would be the result?  Some of them at least&mdash;I think the great majority&mdash;would not till.  Not only would that lessen what we expect to get by the Compulsory Order, but it would have a very bad effect on their neighbours.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that if I were a tillage farmer living beside what is called at the moment a grass farmer, and if I had 30 or 40 acres of my land under tillage and was inclined to increase that this coming year by 10 acres, I would be inclined to say: &ldquo;I will not till any more if this fellow (the man beside me) is not made to till.&rdquo; At all events, that is what farmers have said to me.  One thing that was said to me was: &ldquo;You cannot expect me to do any more tillage unless you make these fellows, the grass farmers, do their duty.&rdquo; In the circumstances we would have the situation that the grass farmers would not till and that those tillage farmers living beside them would not till any more either, and that perhaps instead of increasing their tillage they may till less. That is why I say that those who oppose the Compulsory Tillage Order cannot claim to be doing any more than shielding the grass farmers who would refuse to till in the absence of the Tillage Order.  Now, as a matter of fact, the Compulsory Tillage Orders do not refer to the person who is tilling at all.  If he is a tillage farmer he is probably tilling more than 12½ per cent. If he is under 12½ per cent. it will cost him no great effort to increase his tillage operations up to 12½ per cent. We have appealed to those farmers <Col N="1356" /> who are already tilling their land not to be confined to the limits of the Compulsory Tillage Order but for their own sakes and for the sake of the nation to do more.  I do expect that we will get an all-round increase in tillage from these tillage farmers.</P>
    <P>I have said that if anybody here was in my place, or in the place of the Government, he would have certain considerations to face.  These would be that if the U-boat menace continues, we might not very easily get wheat or sugar into the country next year.  Anybody who considers the matter and puts himself in the place of the Government would realise that the Government would feel a responsibility for the feeding of the people.  They would, in fact, feel called upon to prevent unnecessary hardship or suffering on the part of the people through not having sufficient wheat, sugar, and other such things in the country.  There are even further considerations.  I was asked by Senator Johnston, for instance, whether we wanted to go on exporting to Great Britain or not, or whether we wanted to increase our exports to that country.  That certainly is a consideration.  First, let us consider keeping up the present output of live stock and live-stock products, because, as Senator Johnston said, the sole economy of the country, apart even from agriculture, would be upset if our exports to Great Britain did not continue.  But I am afraid that we ourselves cannot settle this matter.  The British Food Controller will fix prices for what goes to Great Britain.  He is the buyer and we are the sellers. Some Senators here, and some members in the other House have assumed that the prices for our products going into Great Britain will be satisfactory&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope so.  I do not want to give the impression here either to the Senators or to the country that we have come to the end of the matter with regard to egg prices or the prices of anything else.  These have all the time been published, but they have not published the permanent prices yet.  In the case of eggs they have put us on a level well below Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  In the case of bacon they have put us well below the prices paid for the Northern Ireland and the British bacon.  In the case of other things we are on the same level as Northern Ireland and Great Britain. We have been arguing this position with the British Food Controller for some time.  I do not know how we will succeed.  It is impossible for the Government to say to the producer what the price will be, whether it will be more or less, until a definite price is fixed.  Then we can go ahead and say to the producer: &ldquo;You are going to get a certain price for bacon and a certain price for eggs.&rdquo; We may say to the producer: &ldquo;We think that a good price and you should go stronger into production; if it is a bad price it is for yourself to decide whether you will go on at that price.&rdquo;  I want to make that position quite clear.</P>

      <P>In the meantime we do not think it well to wait for another three or four months for the fixing of these definite prices before we say to our people: &ldquo;Go on and till more.&rdquo; If we waited three or four months there would be a year lost.  We do say to our people that they would be on safe ground by growing more of their own foodstuffs, for then they can produce more live-stock products and more live stock: that is why we say to them that they ought to till more.  I have tried to make it clear what are the considerations that are influencing us in the making of these Compulsory Tillage Orders.  Having made these Tillage Orders, I think it is just as well that we should not hold out any hope to the farmers&mdash;that is to these farmers who are anxious to find a way out of increasing <Col N="1359" /> their tillage&mdash;that there will be any change in the policy of the Government in this matter of compulsory tillage.  Senator Baxter says that there is considerable perturbation in the minds of the farmers consequent on the making of this Compulsory Tillage Order.  He said that before making this Compulsory Order operative the Government should try other methods. I do not know what the Senator means by that.  We will issue the Order in the next few days and when that Order is issued we will have to see, as far as possible, that it is obeyed.  We cannot try other methods besides compulsion. But we mean to be as lenient and sympathetic as possible in the administration of that Order.  Unlike some Senators here, I do not believe at all that the officials who will administer this Order will be too rigid in their outlook.  I think they will try to meet any genuine difficulty the individual farmer may have.  If a farmer is trying to meet the officials by sowing his crops in one particular place or farm instead of in another, I think every sympathy will be shown him.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter says there is the want of live stock, the want of machinery and the want of cash in the ease of the farmers.  I suppose that applies in every country in the world. In every country in the world there are farmers who want live stock, machinery and cash.  In some places there are farmers more in want of these necessaries than others.  We could spend a good deal of time arguing as to how the farmers to-day compare in these matters with the condition of the farmers ten or 12 years ago.  As Senator Cú Uladh said in his speech, I wonder why do people always claim that because some <Col N="1360" /> percentage of farmers have not the necessary capital there must be some great exception made.  Now, if a certain number of shopkeepers get an order to do a certain thing and if one of these cannot do it through want of money, he goes out of business.  That was what the Senator said.  I do not want to interpret his speech as being hard-hearted or anything like that.  I think what the Senator wanted to say was this:&mdash;&ldquo;We cannot hold up the policy of the Government because of the fact that there are some farmers hard up and in want of cash.&rdquo;  We in the Department are trying to provide, as far as we can, a more extended scheme of loans for implements.  We think anyway, that even if a small farmer is fairly badly off for horses and implements, he will somehow or other get the loan of horses.  We find a difficulty in giving loans for the purchase of horses but we believe that even such farmers will get over these and other difficulties and get their business done.  That is so far as the small farmers are concerned. Some Senator mentioned that the scheme would not be sufficient for large-scale tillage.  I admit that, but if a farmer who has 400 acres and who must till 50 acres wants a tractor, a tractor plough, a disc harrow and a binder, we should not have to cater for him.  We think that a man with a 400-acre farm will be able to raise the money without Departmental help.</P>

      <P>A two years' guarantee is a difficult matter for the State.  If the State gives a guarantee, it will <Col N="1361" /> have to be a very rigid thing.  It would have to apply to absolutely everything for the two years.  Under the Wheat Order we are making, the prices will apply for wheat reaped in 1940 even if the war were to stop next week.  The Order will be made under the Cereals Act and it cannot be revoked.  It could not be revoked even by the Dáil and Seanad.  Of course, the price prevailing for the past two or three years would be there for the following year because that was made before the war started.  The price is always fixed in advance.  That is so far as wheat prices are concerned.  I do not know what other guarantees one could give.</P>

      <P>In this Order fixing the price of wheat there are three classes &mdash;wheat that bushels over 59 lbs., which will have a price of 35/- for the first period, up to the end of December, and, after that, of 35/6; wheat that bushels from 56 lbs. to 59 lbs., 34/-; wheat that bushels from 53 to 56 lbs., 32/-.  Any wheat bushelling under 53 lbs. is very poor.  It was argued that we might destroy good grass land in Meath and reap poor crops.  Senator Cú Uladh spoke about the great amount of wheat raised there years ago.  It was, it is true, raised under different conditions. Senator Baxter argued&mdash;many others hold with him&mdash;that if a Meath farmer who has some of that very good grass land ploughs part of it up and grows crops on it, though he does it under the best possible conditions, the crops will be poor and, when he sows it down again, it will be 20 or 25 years before he gets the same good grass. The best technical advice I can get does not agree with that.  My advice is that, if that land is properly treated, you will get good cereal and root crops from it and, when sown down again, it will be better than before, if properly treated.</P>

      <P>The same question was raised in connection with County Limerick, and the same remarks apply as regards pasture.  Senator Baxter said we would have fewer dairy cows if we went on with this policy.  I do not think so.  Senator O'Callaghan said that, with tillage, you can have more cattle than without it.  The statistics show that, on the small farms, they have more tillage and more cattle than on the big farms.  They have also more hens and more pigs, and they have, certainly, more cows than on the big farms.  Even if we have only as many cows or fewer cows, we shall have better cows.  When you see cows in Leinster in March, and compare them with cows in Munster in the same month, you think it a pity that the Munster farmers do not farm like the Leinster farmers.  The Leinster farmer has good, strong cows in the spring, who are able to milk when they calve and keep the calf alive.  Look at the mortality of the calves in Munster.  In the creamery districts there, the mortality is as high as 20 per cent. or 25 per cent.  The cows are not able to milk the calves.  In the tillage districts, the mortality rate is very low&mdash;about 1 per cent.  You will have different economic conditions in these districts if you have some tillage, and they can feed their cows during the winter.  Senator Baxter may have heard of a foreign economist over here who said that no country fed its own cows so expensively as this <Col N="1363" /> country, as the Irish farmers fed their cows on beefsteak.</P>

      <P>We were rather doubtful about the import of fertilisers.  During the past few days, I am more optimistic. It is quite possible that we may succeed in having, at least, as much artificial fertilisers brought in this year as last year.  If so, we should not be too badly off.  Senator Parkinson raised a question as to our self-sufficiency. I know that these propositions have been examined, and, for Senator Hogan's information, I should like to say that nobody is to blame. That is one of those questions which Senator Johnston would describe as &ldquo;economic propositions&rdquo;.  We can bring in raw phosphates and get superphosphates here more cheaply than by working the native phosphates.  The matter is under consideration again, and it is possible that, as a result of the war, the economics of the matter have changed and somebody may commence working the phosphates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking about Limerick farmers, I once went into the house of a Limerick farmer.  I saw he had some wheat growing on his land, and I said &mdash;this was some years ago when there was no compulsion to grow wheat, and before there was any scheme&mdash;&ldquo;I am very glad to see that you are growing your own wheat.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have to grow it for the thatch.&rdquo;  It was held by some Senators that the land is so heavy in parts of Limerick that it is very difficult to till that land.  In the county from which I come, there is a lot of tillage done. After rain in the months of February and March, it is impossible to go in on that land to till it for about two or three weeks.  Yet, in spite of these handicaps and hardships, the farmers have to till their land, because if they did not till it, the land would be no <Col N="1364" /> use.  All I can say to the Limerick farmer is that if he puts up with the same hardship as the Wexford farmer, he will not have any trouble about tilling his land.  I was asked by Senator Baxter why we guaranteed a price for wheat and not for potatoes.  There is a very practical point there.  We want more wheat, but we feel that we have plenty of potatoes in the country.  During the Great War, the price of potatoes was guaranteed, but then you had a very big population and the British Army to cater for, and all the potatoes that were offered could be taken.  Suppose we guaranteed a price for potatoes, and that they were offered to us in any quantity, I do not know what we could do with them.  We have a very small population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, if potatoes were very dear, they would be uneconomic there.  Senator Baxter, as an illustration of the inequity of compelling farmers to till their land, asked if the Minister for Industry and Commerce were to compel a certain number of industrialists to produce a certain article without giving them any guarantee, what would they do.  I heard that analogy put forward before, but it is not a fair comparison, I hold.  We are not saying to the farmers: &ldquo;You must do a certain thing, but we will guarantee nothing.&rdquo;  We say to them: &ldquo;We will give you a guarantee for wheat and beet but, for your own sakes, we want you to grow more oats and barley in order to keep up the output of live stock and live-stock products.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That part of the tillage is going to produce bacon, butter and eggs.  Why not guarantee prices for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a fair comparison would be this.  Suppose our weaving plants were doing very well, and <Col N="1365" /> the spinning plants were not doing so well, and that the Minister for Industry and Commerce were to say to the spinners: &ldquo;You must spin a certain amount in order to keep the weaving industry going,&rdquo; the spinners might regard that as unfair.  We say to the farmers: &ldquo;If you want to continue with the production of pigs, eggs and so on, you must grow your own crops, because you cannot depend on getting imported food.&rdquo;  Therefore, we say to every person that he should till a certain percentage of his land.  Senator Baxter asked: &ldquo;Why not give a guarantee for all crops, or, alternatively, a guaranteed price for animal products?&rdquo; Suppose we did guarantee a price for bacon and for eggs, and that we did not, in turn, get that price when we exported them.  We would then be in a position where the State would have to pay the deficit, a position in which we would be told, I need hardly remind you, of the fact that we were paying that sum out of our Exchequer to feed John Bull when he had his back to the wall, and to feed his troops at the front.  I think if we do not get a price from Great Britain when they are at war and in want, really we shall have to give up this agricultural business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This compulsory business, anyhow.  Senator the McGillycuddy said that we should have a Control Price Order for agricultural machinery. I did not hear any complaints about that before, but I have taken a note of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Senators raised the point about the difference between conditions in Great Britain and here. For instance, Senator Sir John Keane stated that there was no compulsory order in Great Britain.  That is true. Other Senators asked why we did not give £2 per acre as they are giving in Great Britain.  We possibly have given more to our farmers in other directions than the British Government have given to their farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> We have, for instance, given more for wheat and, I think, more for sugar beet.  I am not so sure that that is the case at present but we certainly did for some years.  The British Government have not fixed the price for wheat for the coming year and I do not know whether it will be better than ours, but we are in a very different position from the British.  The British are in a desperate way and will be in a still more desperate position for food, if the blockade becomes very effective. They must, I suppose, offer good inducements to get what they want in the way of food.  We are not so desperately up against the wall.  We want to keep things going in the same economic way if we can and we are trying to regulate things as best we can with that object in view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy The McGillycuddy">
      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That has often been put up but it has not been found practicable to any great extent.  Various questions have arisen about the setting up of farmers' committees and about the possibility of our inspectors being unsympathetic.  As has been announced already, I am setting up an advisory committee of farmers.  I think that committee will be set up inside the next three or four days.  All the names that we asked for are in.  One of the first jobs which that advisory committee will have is to examine the Tillage Order.  Perhaps when we are sitting round the table, we may get more considered and more interesting suggestions from these men.  In that way we should be able to discuss the matter with more freedom.  They may be able to give reasons why certain clauses in the order should be changed and, if they are convincing, I shall certainly make the necessary changes.  I think that particular advisory council will only advise on the general clauses of the order.  They would not, naturally, discuss the conditions of a certain individual and as to whether he should be compelled to plough up his land or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> The land in the hands of the Land Commission will be, I am assured by the Land Commission, allotted to a great extent early this winter and in time for the new allottee to do his tillage. With regard to land held by banks under frozen loans, whoever holds the land will get an order to till part of it.  If that is not done, then I shall have power under the order to come along and take part of the land from the banker or whoever holds it, and have it tilled by somebody else. Senator Hogan said that plots were not given out by the boards of health. I do not know what is the reason for that.  Although I cannot remember the details, I remember hearing some time ago that there are certain legal difficulties in many of these cases.</P>
    <P>Senator Cummins said that there was no reason why there should not be more land given to those people.  That might be a useful thing to do, but I wonder, if they got more land, would they till the plots.  Going through the country you see a number of them untilled. That is no reason, of course, why you should condemn the occupier of the cottage who is willing and anxious to till more for the sake of his own family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  Taking them as a class, they are not the worst class. The question of rabbits was raised by Senator Quirke.  We are considering various schemes in connection with that matter and I hope to be able, in the near future, to make some announcement about it.  Senator Quirke said that it was the good lands that <Col N="1368" /> were being depopulated.  His statement was contradicted, I think, by another Senator.  I had a look at the statistics some time ago, and, as well as I remember, the position was something like this: that two-thirds of the people living on land are living on land which represents only one-third of the total valuation.  That looks as if the great majority of our agriculturists are living on poor land.  Senator Tunney said he was disappointed that this was not 25 per cent.  In coming to make up our minds as to what the percentage should be, we had to keep certain things before us.  First of all, everyone must till 10 per cent. more.  As regards those who are tilling already, we are letting them go ahead and till more if they can do so.  We are appealing to them to till more.  As regards the others, we are asking them to till one-eighth of their arable land.  We think that is about the maximum that you could look for in one year.  If we asked them to do more than that, then in two or three years' time there might be difficulties about rotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether this percentage will be followed up next year by another 12½ per cent.  We may have to make it 20 per cent. next year, instead of 12½ per cent., if the conditions are the same as they are now, or worse. With regard to farm labourers and their wages, a board has already been set up to deal with them, and there is no reason why anyone should interfere with it.  I do not see why one acre of potatoes should be regarded as two acres of tillage.  Beet growers, for instance, would probably regard the labour on growing an acre of beet as probably greater than that needed for the growing of an acre of potatoes, and I imagine would claim to be entitled to the same treatment as the potato growers.  The big objection to suggestions of that kind is the question of administration and inspection.  It would take a great deal of inspection to put a scheme of that kind into effect. Senator Sir John Keane made the point that farmers sowing rape might be regarded as growing a crop.  I am not sure that we would look on rape as a crop.  During the last war some farmers made it a practice to sow rape about August, with grass seed.  That is to <Col N="1369" /> say, if they sowed rape in August, it would count as a crop in August, 1940, and the grass seed would count as a crop in 1941.  Under our Order neither would count, because they must sow a crop named in the Order&mdash;cereals or roots.  Grass will not count as a crop. I do not know that it is true to say that grain growers give very little labour. It must be remembered that if a person grows grain this year he cannot continue to grow it very long without turning to some root crop.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that I think there is a lot in what Senator Quirke said, to the effect that we ought to have some finality on this.  An Order has been made for compulsory tillage. It has not been issued yet.  I am keeping it back until the advisory council is formed so that they may have an opportunity of seeing it before it goes out.  I imagine that it will be issued early next week.  Apart, however, from that, everybody knows, because the announcement has been made, that there is going to be compulsory tillage. Therefore, I think there should be finality on this so that farmers would not have the hope held out to them that the question would be raised again in the Dáil or Seanad, and that they had better make arrangements and go ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>In concluding the debate I am not going to take up much time. I have no great complaint to make of the Minister's approach to, or treatment of, the whole question.  He did leave some questions unanswered. These will have to be answered yet. Senator Quirke said that there ought to be some finality about this, but the truth about the matter is that the Minister himself, when he came to deal with some of the difficulties which were raised with regard to stock, machines, cash and so on, passed on and did not deal with them.  The only desire I had in putting down the motion was to be helpful.  We all want to get the most we can out of our land.  I would point this out to the Minister: that while we are going to be compelled to till a certain area of our land, some of our farmers&mdash;those growing beet and wheat &mdash;are going to get a guaranteed price, while others will have to put the <Col N="1370" /> products of their tillage on the British market without any guaranteed price. That is because the British Food Controller is the purchaser of their products.  My feeling about the matter is that before we are compelled to till the soil of this country and grow food that is to be fed to the stock which are to be exported to England, we ought to tell the British people and the British Food Controller that our people are not going to be compelled to engage in a policy of that kind until we get a guaranteed price for the products that we send to them.</P>
      <P>That represents the general feeling in the country.  I think it is a justifiable point of view.  The Minister, I think, should make the British Food Controller understand that the compulsory powers which he proposes to take under this Order will not succeed in getting our farmers to do the impossible, and that if our farmers are going to be left to carry the baby when the bottom falls out of the market it is the Minister and the people of this country who will have to face the problem that will then arise.  In the meantime, I think there is every justification for the Minister putting every farmer in this country in the same position, especially as we are all going to have to till one-eighth of our arable land. These are some of the misgivings which our people have.  I believe that if I were a Briton, and were looking at this from the British point of view, I would regard the attitude which the British Food Controller has taken up as quite stupid.  I was told coming here to-day that they have now fixed the price for eggs at 17/6.  They are actually offering 25/-, but because that is the fixed price our people here cannot get it.  A couple of weeks ago, on the Dublin market, the pig buyers could not get licences to export pigs that were worth £1 more than the price they were actually sold at if licences could be obtained.  Simply because the buyers were not able to export those pigs, the producers were deprived of the benefit of war-time conditions.</P>

      <P>I got my information coming up in the train from a man who had pigs on the market.  Now, we all want to help.  None of us wants to engage in carping criticism, but we know there are problems, and they are not going to be solved by Senator Quirke, Senator Cummins or anybody else getting up and abusing the farmers.  If somebody were to get up and abuse the teachers we would be told it was not right or fair.  Equally, it is not right for some of those people to get up and abuse the farmers.  In my judgment, you are not going to get this out of the farmers with a big stick. Neither Senator Quirke nor Senator Cummins nor I nor the Minister can in that way get out of the Irish farmer what we want to get out of him to-day. We want to treat him as a human being.  We want to make him understand that he is going to get fair play; that he is going to get a fair price for what he has to sell.  If the Ministry here cannot get a guarantee out of the British Food Controller in regard to the products we are going to send over there, they ought to give that guarantee to our producers at home.  The sooner they can do that, the better it will be, and the more co-operation there will be in this whole scheme of getting increased tillage.</P>

    <P>I agree that it is better to have finality, and to know where we stand, but it is as well that we should all realise that this is not going to be something soft.  It is not going to be solved unless the farmers can get increased capital and more fertilisers. We were told we were going to get the same quantity of fertilisers as last year. There will be the same quantity of fertilisers, and 900,000 additional acres under tillage! Where is the use in talking about manuring our soil and getting additional crops if we are to have only the same quantity of manure as last year when we had about 1,500,000 acres under tillage, while we want 2,000,000 acres this year?  A plough which could be bought for £8 last year costs about £13 to-day, and a horse which could be bought for £20 or £30 last year costs £50 to-day. Those are some of the problems with which our farmers are faced.  Who is going to solve them?  Those are very <Col N="1372" /> difficult problems for the farmer who has no credit and no cash, and who cannot get it from the banks nor from the Agricultural Credit Corporation. If the Minister could persuade the Government to make available by way of credit some of the sterling assets which you have to-day, at about 2½ or 3 per cent., he would be going some of the distance to get this increased tillage.</P>
    <P>I believe that no matter how much you are disposed to be helpful, when you go down the country and meet the people who are faced with those problems, soft talk will not make those problems fade into thin air.  However anxious we all are to help, unless the Minister realises that those problems cannot be left unsolved, I assure him that when he comes to put his order into operation he will be up against difficulties which at the moment apparently he is prepared to keep away from.  If he thinks that there is no necessity to take any action with regard to local organisation, if he thinks that he can do all this from Government Buildings by asking the co-operation of Senators and Deputies, if he thinks it can all be accomplished by a consultative council in conjunction with his officials sitting in the Department of Agriculture, he is really very optimistic.  I should like to be optimistic too.  I could be much more optimistic if I were convinced that those difficulties are being faced up to, that there is appreciation of the fact that they exist, and that the right way to solve them is being taken.  Then you can compel people to do things which are difficult, but I think first and foremost the farmers ought to have a guarantee that, whatever labour they are going to put into their lands in order to produce extra crops, they will get their costs of production, if not from the British Government, from the Government here.</P>
