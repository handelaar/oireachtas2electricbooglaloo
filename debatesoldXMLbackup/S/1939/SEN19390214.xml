      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, as a tribute of respect to the memory of His Holiness Pope Pius XI, Seanad Eireann do now adjourn, and that an expression of its profound sorrow on the death of the Holy Father be sent to His Eminence the Cardinal-Chamberlain.</P>
      <P>I have the honour, a Chathaoirligh, to propose this motion to adjourn Seanad Eireann out of respect for the memory of his late Holiness Pope Pius XI, and to mark our sorrow and sense of loss at his passing.  The Catholic Church has lost one of her outstanding Pontiffs; this is acknowledged, and his death has dealt a heavy blow not only to Christendom but to the whole of humanity.</P>
      <P>In a world that seemed to be parting company not only with God but with commonsense and even reason, the late Pontiff stood forth a towering figure pointing unerringly to the only road that could lead the world back to sanity&mdash;sanity in the life of the individual and the family, sanity in the conduct of government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pius XI was more than a great Christian leader; he was a world leader, in an age that called for able and fearless leadership.  Human beings have certain elementary rights and liberties. He fought for those rights and liberties.  Above all, Pius XI was a <Col N="1016" /> great Christian with a great compassionate heart that had only one desire in it: to restore a sick world to health by bringing men back to the knowledge and love and guidance of the God Who made them.  That was all he lived and worked for; and it was what he died doing.</P>

      <P>Is mór an onóir duinn-ne go bhfuil caoi agus cóir agus cead againn sa Phairlimint seo indiu chomh-bhrón Muintir na h-Éireann do chur i n-iúil ar bhás an Phápa, ár n-Athair ró-Naomhtha.  Ní raibh an chóir ná an chead san ag aon ghlúin de Chlanna Gaedheal a chuaidh romhainn leis na céadta blian.</P>
      <P>It is our great privilege to belong to a generation which through an Irish Parliament and Irish institutions of government can express the sympathy of the Irish people on the death of a Pope.  The Pope whom we mourn to-day stands forth as a truly great successor of Peter&mdash;remarkable in a long line of illustrious rulers.  His predecessor had to cope with the difficulties of a world at war.  Pius XI governed the Church during a period of world change which saw an aggravation of old problems and the emergence of new theories and forces that struck at the very foundation of religion and what is best in our European civilisation.  He brought to bear upon these complex problems a unique combination of qualities, spiritual, mental and physical.</P>
      <P>A teacher and a profound scholar, he was never removed from personal contacts with ordinary people and never failed to show his sympathy with their real problems, social or national. Before he was called from his studies he had inured himself to feats of bodily endurance which gave him the immense physical strength which he displayed in the many-sided activities of his Pontificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has been called the Pope of the Missions.  He did inspire renewed and <Col N="1017" /> greater missionary efforts in pagan lands, but who can say where his greatest interest lay&mdash;in the missions, in education, in philosophy, in the problems of social justice or of international peace?  Though he was the Pope of Peace he did not suffer injustice in silence.  He recognised that there were principles which could not be abandoned and he proclaimed them unflinchingly.  Whatever attacked these principles he was not slow to denounce, whether Bolshevism, racism, or extreme nationalism.</P>
    <P>If the late Pope held fast to old principles and to unchangeable moral laws, he was not afraid of what was new in the sphere of science.  He was prompt to use new methods and discoveries to further the eternal truths for which he stood.  In a world of pagan theories and selfish policies his fearlessness and spirituality gave solace and hope and courage, not only to his own flock but to multitudes outside the Catholic Church.  He never ceased to preach that peace could not be achieved by the multiplication of engines of destruction but by turning men's minds to God.</P>
    <P>The reign of Pius XI began shortly after this State was born.  It was to him that the first Irish Minister to the Vatican was accredited.  It was by his gracious thought that an Irishman was selected to come to Dublin as the first Nuncio to a recognised sovereign Irish State.  In us here he had a special paternal interest and men and women of every class and creed in Ireland mourn his death.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the vocational body which I have the honour to represent in this House, I desire to associate myself with this expression of sympathy and deep regret at the passing of our Holy Father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is indeed with feelings of profound <Col N="1018" /> sorrow that the world&mdash;and particularly the people of our own country&mdash; learned of the passing of that great and fearless Pontiff.  The poor and the oppressed of all nations have lost in him a real Father.  His sympathy with the former, and his fearless championship of the latter, were the outstanding features of a Pontificate that must forever remain notable in the history of the Papacy.</P>
    <P>It was during his reign, too, that the encyclicals dealing with our social and economic life were promulgated.  In them he repeatedly emphasised the fundamental principles of social justice and the duty of safeguarding the common good.  In them, too, he clearly indicated to the Governments of the world their duty in regard to the practical application of these principles in the conduct of their economic affairs.</P>
    <P>The cause of world peace has lost in him a stout champion, and one can only express the hope and the prayer that in his Heavenly Home he will continue his advocacy with the Father of us all to save the world from that awful catastrophe which the will and the effort of poor humanity seem unable to avert.</P>
    <P>It is with feelings of profound regret that I support the motion.</P>

      <P>My colleagues, the Independent Party, have done me the honour of asking me to speak for them.  It is with a consciousness of my unworthiness to support this motion adequately that I rise.  I speak largely for Irishmen who belong to the communion of the minority, but I can assure all our colleagues in the Seanad, and our fellow Irishmen outside, that we share their sorrow, and share it sincerely and profoundly, and that our admiration and reverence for the great Pontiff who has passed away is equal to theirs.  There are many reasons why he had this appeal to us all.  I can only touch on one or two.  He always seemed to me to look upwards. He was not merely a fine scholar, an <Col N="1019" /> accomplished diplomatist and a great Churchman, but his eyes were always on things spiritual.  They had the value for him.  Modern materialism, whether it was Marxian Socialism or aggressive capitalism, was equally abhorrent to him.  It was the things of the soul that he worshipped, the ideals and ideas of the Prince of Peace.  He was so human and so humane.  I had the singular honour of being presented to him&mdash;it must be nearly 18 years ago&mdash;and the simplicity and charming sincerity of that great man struck me at once.  He was the champion of the rights and liberties of the individual against the aggressive State which is the mark of our age. He was the foe of all sorts of intolerance, racial or religious.  He recognised, and could recognise, the duties of patriotism, but he pointed out that those duties were always subject to the higher duties of Christianity. He never forgot that.  He was a gallant fighter, fighting for his ideals to the end, fighting in health and in weakness against the rulers of the darkness of this world, and he fought to the end.  One might say that he died fighting.  The events of last <Col N="1020" /> September, when the very powers of Heaven seemed shaken, and men's hearts failed them for fear, are not easily forgotten and certainly no one who heard it can forget that poignant appeal he sent forth through the night, those broken accents when he tried to call humanity back from madness to sanity and back to the teachings of the Prince of Peace.  If a mere sinful layman may say it, he fought the good fight, he finished the course, he kept the faith, and he will live in the memory of this and succeeding generations as one crowned with the crown of righteousness.</P>
