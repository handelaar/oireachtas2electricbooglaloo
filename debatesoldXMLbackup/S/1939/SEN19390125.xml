      <P>Before we take up to-day's business there is a matter upon which I would like to have guidance from the House.  It would appear improbable that item No. 4, that is, the motion in the name of Senator MacDermot, and the amendments thereto, will be reached sufficiently early to-day and it has been suggested to me that it might be more satisfactory, and meet general convenience, if it were agreed that the debate on the motion might be taken as first business at to-morrow's sitting. I have been informed that that arrangement would meet the convenience of the Taoiseach, who will, I am given to understand, be present at the debate.  I should be glad to have the views of members regarding the suggestion.</P>

    <P>Section 1 put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>(1)  In this Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>the word &ldquo;worker&rdquo; means any person of the age of 14 years or upwards who is employed, other than&mdash;</P>
    <P>(j)  a person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  who is the wife, husband, father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, stepfather or stepmother of, or who is a son, <Col N="676" /> daughter, grandson, granddaughter, stepson, stepdaughter, brother, sister, half-brother or half-sister of, the person by whom he is employed, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  who is maintained by and dwells in the house of such last-mentioned person, or</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of sub-section (1) of this section the expression &ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo; means a person who is employed by the owner of agricultural land and is so employed wholly or mainly on work (including industrial work) connected with the user of such land, but does not include&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a gamekeeper, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a stableman, or</P>
    <P>(c)  a groomsman, or</P>
    <P>(d)  a person wholly or mainly employed in work connected with any part of such land which is maintained as an amenity to a residence on such land, or</P>
    <P>In this sub-section the expression &ldquo;agricultural land&rdquo; means land used for tillage, dairy farming or horticulture or used as grazing, meadow or pasture land but does not include osier land or woodland or land used as a market garden or a nursery ground.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (j) (i), line 22, page 3, after the word &ldquo;stepmother&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;uncle&rdquo;, &ldquo;aunt&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>This section, as the House knows, is making provision for the exclusion of certain people from the operations of the Act.  I do not know how the Minister came to exclude these two classes of people in view of all the other relatives he has included in this particular sub-section.  I do not think it requires any argument to make it appear necessary to make the insertion which I have asked the House to agree to.</P>

      <P>As the Minister knows, it is a very common practice for these relatives to be resident with or working with their people, and I think it would be inequitable, particularly in view of the others who are mentioned, not to insert these.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In recent years we have had a number of Bills of one kind or another in connection with which it was decided to exclude from their scope the relatives of employers.  In the process of time we have evolved a standard definition of relative for that purpose and this is the classification of the relatives that should be excluded from that type of legislation.  This definition here is in the standard form, and for that reason, apart from other reasons, I would be very slow to agree to any change in it.  But, apart from the fact that we desire to keep the scope of this measure in conformity with those measures to which I have referred&mdash;the Shops Acts, the Workmen's Compensation Acts, and similar measures&mdash;there are practical difficulties in extending the definition of relative in the manner suggested by Senator Baxter. It is not infrequently a matter of some difficulty to establish the relationship between an employer and a relative employed by him when the question of enforcing legislation of this kind arises, but that difficulty is more pronounced in the case of those who are uncles, aunts and cousins than in the case of those who are of the degrees of kindred set out in the section.  It would, I think, add very considerably to the difficulty of enforcing this legislation if this amendment were inserted and I do not think that we should do that.  It must be appreciated that an employer who can, by means of the employment of relatives <Col N="678" /> of these remote degrees of kindred, escape the obligations of measures of this kind secures an advantage over his competitors&mdash;an advantage which I do not think be should be given.  It is necessary to exclude certain relatives because enforcement in their case might be still more difficult, but I think we should limit, in a very definite way, the class of relatives excluded.  My experience when measures of this kind were before the Dáil and Seanad was that there was a much greater tendency to move amendments restricting the number of exclusions than extending these exclusions.  What class of relatives should be brought within a section of this kind has been the subject of so many discussions in the Dáil and here in recent years that I do not think it would be advisable to depart from the standard form which has been evolved.  To do so would cause complications not merely in respect of this Bill but in respect of other Bills in which the same definition has been used.</P>

      <P>On the merits merely of the words, taking Senator Baxter's two amendments, he seeks to exclude &ldquo;cousin or other relative.&rdquo;  I sympathise with the Minister in his refusal to accept the phrase &ldquo;cousin or other relative&rdquo; because that is so extensive that it would nullify the whole list. But, referring simply to the wording of the sub-section, I do not understand how you can bring in a grandfather and grandmother and fail to bring in an uncle and an aunt.  While I can see considerable difficulty in discovering&mdash;particularly in the country&mdash; cousinship, I cannot see any difficulty in discovering the relationship of uncle and aunt.  Perhaps the Minister would compromise by accepting the uncle and aunt and abandoning the cousin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no case for excluding relatives from the scope of the Bill save the difficulty of enforcing the measure in the case of relatives who are within the degrees of kindred set out.  One can visualise a shopkeeper or other class of employer having very intimate relationship with relatives of these degrees who are <Col N="679" /> residing in the same house with them &mdash;such a relationship as would not exist in the case of the ordinary employer and employee.  It is because of that intimate relationship that it is difficult, if not impossible, for the State to intervene and regulate holidays and so forth.  The only reason for excluding any relatives from the scope of the Bill is the practical difficulty of enforcing the Bill in respect of these relatives.  There would be no means in these cases of ensuring observance of the law.  But the narrower the class of persons excluded the fairer the measure.  While that argument does not apply in the case of this Bill with the same force as it applied in regard to the Shops Bill, it applies, nevertheless, and Senators should bear in mind that an employer who succeeds in escaping this obligation in relation to relatives employed by him gets an advantage over his neighbour who has no relatives employed.  In the Shops Act, the Workmen's Compensation Act and other Acts the particular degrees of kindred set out here are also to be found and, from the point of view of uniformity, no change should be made unless there is a good case for it.  I do not think that there is ground for extension in the case of this Bill.  I think the move should be in the opposite direction.</P>

      <P>We have all had uncles and aunts and we all know instances in which young men are working in businesses in which their uncles or aunts were engaged.  This provision does not refer to business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If a nephew went into his uncle's or aunt's industry, he would have to make provision for giving his uncle or aunt holidays, while the grandfather or grandson would be excluded. I cannot see the point in that at all. If any relatives, after the father and mother, ought to be excluded from the terms of the Bill, it would be the uncle or aunt.  After the parents and the members of the family, the uncle and aunt would rank.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that at all.  In the ordinary case where a father employs a son, it seems clear that there should be an exclusion.  All the rest follows from that.  Where the son employs the father there should be exclusion.  All the other classes mentioned here&mdash;daughter, grandson, grand-daughter and so on&mdash;come within the same category and, going backwards, you have the father, mother, grandfather and so on.  Where that degree of relationship exists, where the parties live in the same premises and are maintained by the employer, then I think they should be excluded, however reluctantly we may do it, because of the peculiar difficulties of enforcement. I should be opposed to any extension of the exclusion beyond that degree of relationship, and I should object to bringing in aunts, uncles or cousins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a fact that the relationship of the uncle or aunt to the employer justifies their exclusion. Relationship is not the reason for exclusion; it is the difficulty of enforcement because of the relationship.  If the person employs an uncle to work for wages, then I think the same conditions should apply to that contract of employment as would apply in the case of a person having no such relationship to the employer.</P>

      <P>In Section 2, at the top of page 4, we have a definition of &ldquo;domestic worker.&rdquo;  This was inserted in the Dáil and inserted for a particular purpose.  I am not sure that I am right in this, but, as far as I can make out, unless there is some reference elsewhere in the Bill &ldquo;domestic worker&rdquo; means a person who is a worker and who is entitled under his contract of service to free lodging either in his employer's house or elsewhere.  Does that not conflict with the definition of an agricultural worker later on? Would not an agricultural worker, enjoying lodgings in his employer's house <Col N="681" /> or elsewhere, become a domestic worker under this?</P>

      <P>I think Senator Hayes is wrong.  If he will read sub-section (1) of Section 2 he will find that a worker is there defined, and that a worker means a person, excluding a whole long list.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 27, page 4, to delete the word &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the word &ldquo;partly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>For the purposes of sub-section (1) of this section the expression &ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo; means a person who is employed by the owner of agricultural land and is so employed wholly or mainly on work, including industrial work, connected with the user of such land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to insert the word &ldquo;partly&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; there, so that it would read &ldquo;employed wholly or partly on work.&rdquo;  In the first place, I think it would be impossible for anyone to define this matter. I am at a loss to know how exactly it will be determined whether a man is mainly employed working on agricultural land or not.  Who is going to determine that?  I think it would be impossible.  An inspector may come along, but is it the inspector who will determine the matter or is it the worker himself or the employer?  I <Col N="682" /> think it would be impossible to get a definition as to whether or not a man was mainly employed on agricultural work.  For two or three days in the week a man might be employed, during the greater part of his time, doing what would be undoubtedly agricultural work purely, out in the fields, but for part of another day or two he might be engaged in the type of work that might not be said to be mainly agricultural work.  Accordingly, I think it is essential that this amendment should be inserted here.  The administration of the section would be impossible otherwise.  I myself, at any rate, cannot see how it is going to be properly defined whether a man is mainly engaged on work on agricultural land or how much more work he will have to do on agricultural land for the purposes of definition.  Who is going to watch the number of hours and so on, and how is it going to be done?  Further, I think that if the man is doing work on the land, even though he is engaged at another period on work of another type that, from the Minister's point of view, is not purely agricultural work, it is altogether wrong to be trying to draw that line in that form.  If you have a man, because he is doing a certain amount of work around the place and who is then called out to the fields, being entitled to holidays while other men working in the fields with him are not entitled to holidays, I think that work on the land would be impossible. I believe that the insertion of the word &ldquo;partly&rdquo; there would remove difficulties with regard to administration that are impossible to visualise at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Baxter knows well, it is the custom down the country to hire men from May to November, and from November to May, and I think that Senator Baxter is right in the point he makes.  The man is employed on the farm from 8 o'clock in the morning until 8 o'clock in the evening, and I believe that he is a whole-time worker.  In any case, I think it is well that the point should be made clear so that employers down the country may know where they <Col N="683" /> stand in connection with this matter&mdash; that is to say, that if you employ a man on the farm you cannot allow that man to do work apart from that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Baxter and the other Senators who spoke are merely concerned about the possibility of administrative difficulties arising.  I am prepared to take the word &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; out so that the sub-section would read &ldquo;employed wholly on work connected with the user of such land,&rdquo; but I do not think Senator Baxter would agree to that.  The insertion of &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; was a concession to agriculturists to ensure that a man would not lose his status as an agricultural worker if he were employed mainly on work connected with the land.  I am prepared, as I say, to remove that word, but I could not agree to substitute the word &ldquo;partly&rdquo; for &ldquo;mainly.&rdquo;  To insert the word &ldquo;partly&rdquo; would make a farce out of the Bill altogether, because it would be open to any employer to evade the holidays provisions by employing a man once or twice in the year on agricultural work.  I could not possibly agree to the insertion of &ldquo;partly&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;mainly.&rdquo;  I am prepared to consider taking &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; out, so that only those will be described as agricultural workers who are wholly engaged, all the year round, upon agricultural work and upon no other form of work.  I do not think that the actual difficulty of determining to whom this will apply, because of that certain looseness in the definition, will prove to be very great in practice.  The only answer there is that individual cases will have to be considered on the facts. This is something of which we have fairly considerable experience, because the same question arises frequently in connection with the insurability of persons under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and it is necessary, for the purpose of these Acts, to determine in <Col N="684" /> individual cases whether a worker is employed mainly upon agricultural work or upon work which is insurable under these Acts, as agricultural work is not insurable.</P>
      <P>In any event, I think that if, in the course of an employment year, a man does the qualifying number of hours of work to which the Bill applies, and which is not agricultural work, he should get the same treatment in regard to public and annual holidays as other workers get in similar work for a similar amount of time.  That is what, in fact, the Bill purports to provide. The inclusion of the word &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; was decided upon in order to ensure that a person would still be regarded as an agricultural worker, and, consequently, outside the scope of the Bill, even though on occasion that person did work which was of another character.  I think we have gone a considerable distance to meet the representations put forward by agriculturists. We have excluded agricultural workers and those mainly employed on agricultural work, and we have also excluded industrial workers if their work is mainly done in connection with the running of a farm.  I would not be prepared to go further than that, and under no circumstances would I agree to accept the word &ldquo;partly,&rdquo; because that would open the high-road for the evasion of the Act throughout the country, a high-road which I feel would be availed of in full.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister on what grounds he excludes agricultural workers from benefits under this Bill?  It seems to me that agricultural workers are as justly entitled to holidays as any other employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point of view with which I have a great deal of sympathy.  The only answer to it is that it has been the practice to deal with the conditions of employment of agricultural workers under separate legislation, legislation which applies to them only.  The application of this principle of holidays to agricultural workers should properly be done by an <Col N="685" /> extension of the Agricultural Wages Act rather than by inclusion in a Bill of this kind.  If Senator Sir John Keane is prepared to have that principle extended he will not find much opposition from the Government.  They have much sympathy with that view.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say that in my view there is nothing more detrimental to the progress and development of agriculture than this type of legislation.  It is bad enough to have us in the country looking at the joys of the towns and nothing the ease of the <Col N="686" /> dwellers in the urban areas and all those amenities that we cannot enjoy in the country, but it is going to be much worse when you are going to divide the country against itself.  One sees the road workers walking home on their half-holidays while our men &mdash;country workers&mdash;have to stay on in the fields.  Now there is going to be added to that another list of people who are going to be given their holidays while our workers have to stay on if the food is to be produced and if agriculture is to live.  I find it rather impossible to reconcile the views of the Minister and of his colleagues in the Cabinet when they go out and talk at various gatherings, such as they have been attending recently&mdash;I find it hard to reconcile the views given expression to there with the great body of their legislation. The position the Government is going to create is this, that you will have men working around a lawn keeping the walks in condition and the grass trimmed and using their machines and the rest of it, and these men are going to be given benefits under this Bill.  But the men on the same farm who are working out in the fields and who have to withstand the heat and burden of the day, men who are engaged with their ploughs and tractors during spring, summer and harvest, are not going to be given any of these holiday benefits at all.  Both groups of men are working side by side, but the men who are around the lawns and whose work is so easy that they have not even to take off their coats, are going to be given holidays which are denied to the farm workers. I feel that that is a state of things that is most inequitable.  When one talks about people getting holidays, one feels that they are being given holidays because they have worked very hard; because they have been engaged in exhausting toil and that because of that exhausting toil they have stored up something on which they can draw. It seems to me that the Minister has begun at the wrong end altogether.  It is the people who are engaged in exhausting toil who are excluded while side by side with them the men who have to work less strenuously are to <Col N="687" /> enjoy the privileges of holidays.  The Minister admits that the agricultural position must be improved before agricultural workers can be given holidays. He admits that there will have to be very considerable improvement before the people who employ the workers will have holidays.  A few nights ago the Minister for Finance said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Anything, therefore, which would tend to impede the fair course of trade between the two countries, anything which would create enmity between the two peoples, or arouse prejudice against this country, her people or her products, is a matter of the gravest concern to everyone of us, but most of all to those who are the mainstay of Ireland, the farmers and the tillers of the soil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now that is true, and I am quite convinced that there is no use either in the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance going to open new industries or attending meetings of the Industrial Development Association or bankers' dinners and talking about how essential it is for the welfare of the State to have agriculture put on its legs if they are going to go on legislating along lines that are definitely creating inequalities as against the rural workers.  It is bad enough to divide the country from the town.  It is bad enough to make the town more attractive as against country life.  But it is much worse to divide the country against itself.  It is much worse to divide one house against itself as the Government is doing under this Bill. Under the Bill as it stands there will be found houses where one maid will get holidays and the other maid will not.  I feel that the Minister ought now to take these matters into account. If you decide to exclude certain people from the privileges of this Bill you will not exclude them for all time. But if you give people certain privileges now you are never going to be able to take them away.  We are all poor or rich in comparison with somebody else.  Our lives are hard or easy judged by the standards that <Col N="688" /> others are enjoying.  If in the rural districts certain people are going to be given certain privileges because they are not workers on the land then you will not be able to get people to work in the fields at all.  I strongly urge on the Minister that he should take into account that point of view now. If the Minister leaves the section as it stands certain people will be given benefits under the Bill and others working on the very same lands will be excluded.  I am sure the Minister is not prepared to face up to the position to which such legislation is leading.</P>

      <P>I believe that, in an agricultural area, if you can pay a man and feed him you are going to have that man; there is no question about that, and it is optional to yourself to give him a holiday if you wish to do so.  I would agree with the Minister that the agricultural labourer should not be included in this Bill. Generally speaking, the small farmer employs only one man and one girl, and if that labourer were to be given a holiday of two weeks or even one week in the year it would embarrass the members of the household.  It would be much better to give him extra pay, and have him there.  That is my idea.  I certainly agree with the Minister that the agricultural labourer should not be included in this Bill.</P>

      <P>With regard to the line of argument pursued by Senator Baxter, I am afraid those anomalies are inevitable with this class of legislation. When you get the Government interfering with industry in that way you are bound to have anomalies.  I am astounded that the Minister should differentiate, first of all, by casual remark between agriculture as not being able to afford and other industry as being able to afford legislation of this kind.  Surely the Minister must admit that all those burdens are borne by agriculture in the last resort.  All those high costs which the Minister is piling on by this legislation are ultimately borne by the small farmers with 30 or 40 acres all over the country.</P>

      <P>I think it is quite unfair for Senator Baxter to attempt to make a comparison between industry, as such, and agriculture, for the purpose of decrying the holidays to be given to industrial workers under this Bill.  There is no comparison between the work done in industry, so called, and work done in agriculture, so called.  I think it is quite an unfair premise for Senator Baxter to make that comparison.  Work on the land, difficult and onerous in itself, is no more onerous than work in factories, and certainly to oppose giving those holidays to industrial workers on the grounds that agriculture is not in a satisfactory condition is unfair, and should not be done.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane made reference to the fact that agricultural workers were not being included in the scope of this Bill, and attributed that to the depressed economic condition of farmers.  I had more in mind the circumstances under which agriculture was carried on than the actual financial condition of farmers at present as compared with any other time.  The manner in which agriculture is carried on in this country would make it difficult to apply a measure of this kind to that industry.  Certainly an entirely different type of machinery would be needed for enforcement purposes, but as the Senator is, no doubt aware, the suggestion of paid holidays for agricultural workers has arisen before, and has arisen outside this country.  I think I mentioned here on the Second Reading debate that the Committee set up by the Government of Northern Ireland to consider the conditions of agriculture there recommended the introduction of legislation to provide paid holidays for agricultural workers in that area, and I think I am correct in saying that in many districts in Great Britain it is an established practice. That has nothing whatever to do with the amendment before the House now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter's speech, in so far as it related to the amendment, was in fact a speech against it.  He did complain here, and complained bitterly, <Col N="690" /> during the course of the Second Reading debate that the Government was legislating for the benefit of the urban population to the neglect of the rural population.  I pointed out then, and want to emphasise now, that not merely was the contrary the case, but the Government had of deliberate policy exercised great care to ensure in all this kind of legislation that differentiation was not made, and this Bill as well as previous Acts of a similar character is based upon forms of work&mdash;not localities or areas or anything else.  It is Senator Baxter who is now proposing to make a differentiation between rural and urban areas. We set out to say that certain classes of workers&mdash;estate workers, those who are employed attending to gardens and doing work in connection with the maintenance of the amenities to a residence&mdash;should be regarded as coming within the scope of this Bill, no matter where they are employed, whether in rural or urban areas.  But Senator Baxter says: &ldquo;No; do not give that privilege to workers in rural areas. Give it only to workers in urban areas.&rdquo;  That is the purpose of Senator Baxter's amendment and that amendment I am going to resist. I think we should not make that differentiation in the treatment of workers doing a similar form of work in rural areas and urban areas.  I think those workers, if they should be within the scope of the Bill at all, should be entitled to precisely the same treatment whether they perform that work in a rural area or an urban area. I think workers employed in that form of work, employed as estate workers attending to those amenities, should be given the same rights in respect of holidays as other classes of workers to whom this Bill relates.  Apart from that objection in principle to Senator Baxter's amendment, there is the practical difficulty that so far as I know there is no legal definition of what constitutes a rural area.  Certainly it would be a rather tedious matter to get embodied in this Bill a definition of a rural area which would convey what is obviously Senator Baxter's idea.  In any event, I do not think any differentiation should be made.  I <Col N="691" /> think the Bill should be based on forms of work, and should apply to workers engaged on those forms of work no matter where they do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course my view is that the man in the country should enjoy all those amenities first; that if the country could afford them the first man who should get them should be the countryman.  I would relate every other man's privileges to those of the countryman.  That is where the Minister, in my view, is entirely wrong; he is beginning at the top, and leaving the poor people at the bottom to carry the whole weight all the time. The poor people at the bottom are getting fewer and weaker and, unless there is a vast change, a great many people at the top will come tumbling down.  There is no doubt whatever about the truth of that.  With regard to this particular amendment, in the first place my view is that the number of people who will come under it and enjoy those holidays is a very limited number.  Accordingly, I think that their exclusion from this particular <Col N="692" /> privilege will not cause any very great hardship.  But what it is going to do is this: Let us take any of the places here, perhaps Senator Parkinson's or Senator Quirke's.  A man employed there will perhaps to-day, to-morrow or the next day be engaged in the garden&mdash;and the day after he will be ordered to help with hay or something else.  There you have him out amongst the other workers, this gentleman who can enjoy his holidays, while the other men who are reaping the corn or gathering in the beet have got to carry on without any holiday whatever. Now, that is the thing I do not want. It is the psychology that it is going to create which is really going to be very disturbing to our rural life.  We are disturbed enough already and it is this sort of thing I am totally opposed to.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to look upon this matter with a more open mind.  I realise that when you put something in a Bill you are very reluctant to alter it, but I am convinced that in this matter the Minister is going to do something which will have a further disturbing effect on the people who are trying to do the work in the country. The country people know at a distance what is going on in the towns.  You only see the townspeople when they come out into the country after their day's work has long finished and you are still working away.  What we are most concerned about is what is going on in the country, what is happening at our neighbours' places, what one man has to say to another when they meet after the day's work is done; and if the man who has been trimming hedges, attending to gardens or mowing lawns can come out after his day's work is done and at a time when other people are working hard, and can occupy the privileged position of getting holidays when the others have not a chance of doing so, it will finish up with all of them being anxious to become gardeners or hedge-trimmers.</P>

There are all kinds of problems that can arise in connection with gardens close to the city.  Take my own case.  I got an agricultural grant for my garden.  I have two and a half acres of land and I employ a gardener.  The gardener grows vegetables for me.  Quite a considerable amount of vegetables.  He is mainly employed on that work.  Does he, or does he not, come under this Bill?  I think that is a point that requires to be cleared up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether there would be any judicial determination of the exact meaning of the term &ldquo;amenity.&rdquo; We set out to put in the form of legislation the ideas which were accepted by us as appropriate to a measure of this sort and we have here the result of the efforts of the draftsman to that end.  If there is any suggestion offered by way of improvement of the draftsman's handiwork I am prepared to consider it.  I want it to be clearly understood what we are attempting to do.  Senator Baxter is obviously confused about the purpose of this section.  He talked about a man clipping hedges one day and the next day attending to corn or hay. Clearly, from the words the Senator used, he has not fully appreciated how the sub-section or the paragraph came to be here at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that all workers will get holidays with pay.  We have already provided under previous Bills for holidays with pay for industrial and shop workers.  It was decided to extend that to all workers, but we found that certain exclusions had to be made and one of the classes to be excluded was agricultural workers, those employed wholly or mainly upon agricultural work.  In order to ensure that there could be no evasion of the intention of the Bill by reason of that exclusion, it was found necessary to put in a definition of agricultural workers.  We make it <Col N="694" /> clear that amongst those not to be regarded as agricultural workers are people employed wholly or mainly on work on any portion of land which is maintained as an amenity to a residence situated on such land.  We do not regard persons who are employed wholly or mainly on that work as agricultural workers and, therefore, we are not going to exclude them from the Bill, whether they do that work in a rural or an urban area.</P>
    <P>An employer with an estate in a rural area may be better able to pay his employees than an employer with an estate in an urban area.  Senators do not have to look very far around the country to see situated in rural areas employers who could, without difficulty, afford to pay workers who would be granted holidays.  The question of the ability of the employer to pay might arise in a rural or an urban area.  To make a differentiation on the basis of the locality in which the work is done is fundamentally wrong.  I am quite prepared to consider excluding altogether from the Bill men employed on market gardening, but I am not prepared to make an exclusion merely because of the locality.  I believe the provisions of the Bill should apply whether the work is done in a rural or an urban area. It may be that the definition of agricultural worker here will give rise to some difficulty.  I am not foolish enough to hope that it will not.  The definition of agricultural worker inserted in previous Bills nearly always gave rise to difficulty and such definitions were either the subject of legal determinations or administrative difficulties.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already the effects of the Unemployment Insurance Act. That Act does not apply to workers employed wholly or mainly in agriculture and, although it is very nearly 20 years since the Act was passed, one of the principal duties devolving on the Minister for Industry and Commerce is deciding on individual cases whether a named worker is an agricultural worker or not and whether he is wholly or mainly employed on agricultural work.  These decisions are continuously coming out of his office. <Col N="695" /> It would be foolish to expect that no difficulty will arise from the definition. I am prepared to improve the definition, if it is possible.  The purpose is merely to ensure that a class of worker, namely, the agricultural worker, to whom we do not think this applicable, will be excluded, particularly persons not employed on agricultural work, but who, because of the locality in which they live or the nature of the work they do, might reasonably be mistaken for agricultural workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not convinced me.  I want to point out that I made no reference whatever to the capacity of the employer to pay.  I did not introduce that point at all.  I do not think it has any relation whatever to the amendment or to the section. What I did point out was, and what I think the great inequity is, that you are here going to legislate in such a way that certain employees who at certain times of the year will be doing exactly the same work will be divided: one or two will get holidays and the others will not.  I fear the result of that will be actually the dropping of some of those men who are at present engaged in keeping residences in the trim condition they are in to-day or it will have such an unsettling effect on the minds of the other people who are working on the farms and who are not getting holidays that it will be much more difficult to keep them.  As a result of all this legislation, we will very probably have fewer people employed and a further fall in our productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of the person wholly or mainly employed.  I want to point out that in the rural districts these men will go out on the farm at certain periods of the year and will work at the same kind of work that others are engaged on in the fields. The men in urban districts or in cities will not do that.  The men in the urban districts or cities are not going to the hayfield or the cornfield.  They are not going to be called on when there is a rush in spring, in summer or in harvest.  There is no comparison <Col N="696" /> at all between the conditions and the kind of circumstances in the city and in the country.  It is because it is my view that this legislation would result in obvious inequities and that these inequities are very bad for rural life that I am urging the Minister to accept this amendment.  I do not know what difficulties there are about the words &ldquo;not in a rural district.&rdquo;  I took it that &ldquo;not in a rural district&rdquo; meant that it would be in an urban district or in a city and that that would cover it.  Everything the Minister has said has convinced me of how essential this is.  I am now more convinced than when I introduced the amendment.  It may be that he and I are talking in different languages.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister is quite fair to this amendment. I agree with the Minister that workers ought to have holidays and I am entirely convinced that all kinds of workers ought to have holidays, but the Minister is a very skilful debater and is not quite fair to the amendment or the arguments put forward on its behalf.  I made an endeavour to understand the exact points that are being made by Senator Baxter.  The Minister has put up an argument that nobody else put up, that is, the argument regarding the ability of the employer to pay.  The Minister says his purpose is to give holidays to all workers.  We have already dealt with shop workers in another Act.  That is that.  We are now dealing with another class of workers, agricultural workers, but the Minister has in his mind, and I agree with him entirely, that the thing should be finished up eventually by including all classes of workers. The question is one, not of principle, but of expediency as to what kind of workers you are going to include in this Bill for the moment.  The Minister says, with a certain amount of half truth, that the object is to differentiate between types of work done, not between the localities in which the work is done.  That, of course, is perfectly sound, but he must be aware, as we are all aware who know anything about this country, that the point Senator Baxter is making is a clear and simple one: that in a particular rural area you <Col N="697" /> will have a man&mdash;call him a farmer or gentleman farmer or anything else you like&mdash;who may have half a dozen employees all of whom will work together for certain times of the year but one of whom, owing to the operation of this particular paragraph of the sub-section, will get holidays while the other five will not.  I do not begrudge holidays to the whole six.  I would like them all to get it but, while the state of mind of the Government and the economic state of the country are such that you cannot give the six of them holidays the point arises for discussion whether it is not more unsettling and more unjust in that particular place and in those particular circumstances to give one of them holidays and exclude the other five, whether it would not be better for the moment, when you are proceeding step by step, to exclude the whole six of those particular people.  That, I think, is the argument and it is a simple one.  It is not an argument directed towards the ability of the employer to pay.  It is not an argument directed towards depressing the conditions of any particular class of worker.  It is an argument as to whether that is going to have a very bad effect upon the five people concerned and also, I think, as to whether it is not going to make it more difficult for some of the people, and the decreasing number in the country, who are actually in jobs to-day to keep the jobs they have. That is a point the Minister ought to deal with and I think it ought to be dealt with without indulging in any kind of debating arguments.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane stated in connection with this amendment that in a Bill of this kind you cannot avoid certain anomalies.  I think he is probably right, but we are here for the purpose of trying to reduce the number as far as possible. I would like to suggest that this matter should be left over for further consideration. I agree with the Minister that the exact amendment of Senator Baxter would not meet the case and would possibly go too far if it were worked at all.  But there is a clear distinction to my mind between ordinary agricultural land and the large <Col N="698" /> estate which is not maintained for the purpose of agriculture at all&mdash;there may be a certain amount of agriculture incidental to it&mdash; and I am inclined to agree with the Minister that in that case it ought to come under the Bill. But where you have a farm in which there happens to be a very small proportion of it around the house and a man is employed most of the time there I think it is an unwise provision to provide that that man alone should have a holiday.  I think it might be possible by a different method to get over the difficulty by providing a different type of amendment, an amendment to provide that where the amenities (I still do not know exactly what the legal definition of it will turn out to be, but we will assume for the moment it means the land around the house, pleasure grounds) are a very small proportion of the total the employee should not come under the Bill.  If this is passed I think the effect will be very much like this: a farmer who may have employed one man as a gardener who is not particularly suitable for agricultural work will cease to employ that man and will get a man who is generally suitable and divide up between his workers such work as has to be done around the house and keep them all on the same basis.  I do not think that will be done simply to avoid one man's half-holiday.  It may in some cases, but, generally speaking, it will not.  I think most of us who have any experience at all as employers know that it is highly undesirable to have different sets of conditions with regard to holidays.  I shall have something to say about that later on in the Bill in connection with another matter. As far as possible, we should aim at amending this Bill so as to provide that people who are employed together in the same kind of business and doing the same kind of work should be entitled to the same holidays.</P>

      <P>As far as I can see, one statement made by the Minister in his argument covers the whole thing, that is, the difficulty of defining what is a rural area.  Senator Baxter suggests that it is a terrible thing to insist on <Col N="699" /> segregating the people in the rural areas into different groups.  I suggest that they are already segregated into different groups.  The people he refers to in his various statements are the people who have not already benefited by the previous Act wherein the definition of an agricultural worker came up for discussion.  The stableman, the gamekeeper, the groomsman and various others did not come under the heading of an agricultural worker for the purposes of the Agricultural Wages Act, and when it is the policy of the Government to pursue the thing until every man in the country comes under the heading of some Holidays Bill, I see no sound reason why the amendment should be insisted upon at all.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt about it that agricultural labourers are at present the most unprivileged class of workers in the country as a whole and there is no doubt about it that there is a lot in what Senator Baxter and Senator Hayes have advocated, that we should do nothing to aggravate the sense of lack of privilege which these people must feel under present difficult economic conditions.  I understand that agricultural labourers are not eligible for unemployment pay, but that road workers are.  I am told by some of my farmer friends from the country that it is difficult under present conditions for a farmer to add to his staff of agricultural workers, because the people who ought, in the country's interests, be taking up agricultural work, very much prefer to take up some of those other very privileged occupations in which they are entitled to unemployment pay during certain seasons of the year.  If you legislate on the lines which the Minister is advocating you will merely add one more to the objectionable differences which lower the status of the agricultural worker and make him feel his lack of privilege and merely add another difficulty to the difficulty that exists at present of getting a desirable increase in the recruitment of agricultural workers in the agricultural industry.  In general, I think <Col N="700" /> that there could be no greater economic advantage than to increase the number of workers for agricultural wages in this country, but if you legislate on the lines of this Bill the number of agricultural workers is more likely to diminish than to increase.</P>

      <P>Senator Douglas told us that estate owners will find ways and means of evading their obligations under this Bill.  I realise clearly that such is the case.  In fact, I might say from my own experience, whether in connection with Unemployment Insurance Acts, National Health Insurance Acts or Conditions of Employment Acts, estate owners, as a class, go to the greatest lengths to avoid giving to their workers the benefits secured for them under legislation.  They are the hardest class of employers on whom to enforce legislation of this kind.  The way out of that difficulty&mdash;the difficulty that employers may find methods of evading their obligations&mdash;is not to release them from the obligations but to improve the machinery of enforcement. I would not be disposed to exclude any class of workers from this Bill merely because of the possibility that they may be unfairly deprived of the privileges of the Bill by some device which has not been foreseen by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question raised here, I just want to say that I think we should be very slow to depart from the basis on which the Bill has been framed.  It is designed to ensure that certain regulations shall apply to forms of work and not to localities, classes of persons employed, or classes of employers.  We have to relate these regulations to forms of work and we should stick to that basis.  If we do that, I think we must reject Senator Baxter's amendment even though somebody else may take his arguments and urge them to secure the exclusion of other classes of workers no matter where employed.  I know that anomalies will arise.  The fact that the Bill is not universally applicable means that these anomalies are unavoidable, but I submit that we must not, in our anxiety to avoid anomalies, take the risk of creating a much larger number <Col N="701" /> of them and that I think is what would result from the adoption of this amendment.  Senator Hayes made a reference to clever debating.  One of the commonest tricks in debate is to present a picture and to get it accepted as a typical picture of the condition of affairs by the other party to the debate.  I submit that the picture which Senator Hayes depicted on Senator Baxter's inspiration, was not in any sense typical.  The ordinary case will not be the case of an employer with half a dozen employees, one of whom will get holidays and the rest of whom will not.  It will be quite the reverse.  It will be the case of an employer with half a dozen workers, all of whom, with the exception of perhaps one, will be entitled to holidays.  So far as numbers are concerned that case will arise perhaps nine times for every one case of the kind to which Senator Baxter refers.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the ordinary employer in a suburban area who employs a domestic servant, a chauffeur, and a gardener.  His domestic servant, his stableman and his chauffeur would be entitled to holidays, but his gardener, if this amendment were adopted, would not be so entitled. That is clearly a case which would be more likely to cause discontent and the other evils to which Senator Hayes referred to than the other type of case where the employer maintains a number of agricultural workers and one gardener who would come within this definition.  I would urge that Senators should keep that particular case in mind.  We cannot avoid anomalies altogether, but if we proceed on some logical basis, we shall at least reduce them to a minimum.  We want to give these privileges to all workers.  We recognise that certain classes must be excluded, either because of the fact that they are able to protect their own interests, because they receive a remuneration above a certain figure, £350, or because the nature of the regulations are such that it would be difficult to apply them in their case. One of the classes we want to exclude is that of agricultural workers.  Let us exclude them, but let us take care that we are excluding only agricultural workers and not persons who are employed <Col N="702" /> in a suburb of a city or a town who could not be, by any means, classed as agricultural labourers.  We do not regard them as agricultural workers.  They should not be regarded as agricultural workers, and they should be given the same right to annual holidays and public holidays as any other classes to whom the Bill relates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments which I would be inclined to use on this amendment have already been put forward.  The case is the same as on the previous amendment.  As far as my knowledge goes anyway, with regard to market gardening, market gardening in the country is a part-time occupation.  In <Col N="703" /> County Meath, and in a few other districts where market gardening is carried on, it is carried on in conjunction with other types of agricultural activity.  My view is that it should be excluded from the operations of this Bill.  I move, therefore, that the privilege will apply only in the case of gardens situated in an urban area.  I do not know how the Minister is going to meet the amendment, but so far as my knowledge goes, and I have some knowledge in regard to this matter, market gardening in rural areas is carried on in conjunction with other agricultural activities.  If there is to be a holiday for men doing market gardening let them have it as well as their neighbours in city areas, but such men should not be held up amongst their fellow - workers in rural areas as individuals enjoying privileges that others of them cannot enjoy.  The Minister has intimated that he proposes to deal with some of these cases by exclusion.  I should like to hear what he has to say on this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how the Minister can maintain any logical distinction between grazing land and woodland, knowing local conditions. What I am afraid of is that local conditions are not understood by many people in high places.  When men work a few days in the woods there is no actual difference between work in the woods and on the land.  I do not know how this section is going to operate.  If a man works a few days in the woods is he going to claim the benefits of the Act?  I should like to ask another question in reference to another anomaly that may arise.  What about poultry-keeping?  Is that mentioned at all?  Does land used for poultry-farming come within the definition of agricultural land or is it outside it? That is not mentioned in the Bill.</P>

      <P>When the Minister is replying, I should be glad if he would make clear to me a point that does not seem at all clear in relation to the amendment.  The Bill says that the expression &ldquo;agricultural land&rdquo; means, <Col N="704" /> amongst other things, land used for horticulture, but does not include land used as a market garden or a nursery ground.  Would the Minister say what is the distinction between horticulture on the one side and a market garden nursery on the other?  The thing seems to be somewhat mixed up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I must confess that I could not find more lucid terms myself to explain the purpose of the section than those actually contained in the section.  I think that if the Senator takes the trouble to examine it he will find that, under various enactments of one kind or another, each term used in the course of a section is given a special significance, and that applied in this particular case.  However, the matter before the House is Senator Baxter's amendment which proposes to exclude from the Bill workers employed in a market garden situate in an urban area.  As the Bill stands, and as Senators have pointed out, agricultural land does not mean land used as a market garden and, of course, the term &ldquo;agricultural worker,&rdquo; about which there has been so much discussion, is defined by reference to the person by whom he is employed, and the land on which he works.  In order to be an agricultural worker, he must be employed by the owner of agricultural land for work on such land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In consequence of the phraseology of the sub-section which has been quoted, workers in market gardens are not regarded as agricultural workers for the purposes of the Bill.  That is a very narrow distinction.  I always had some doubts about it in my own mind. Senator Baxter proposes to confine the benefits of the Bill to workers in market gardens which are situated in urban areas.  I do not think we should make that distinction.  In my view, we should regard workers in market gardens as being agricultural workers or not.  If we decide to regard them as agricultural workers, then they should come under the general definition and be excluded from the Bill, no matter where the market garden is situate. On the other hand, if we decide that there are some special features about the work done in market gardens, <Col N="705" /> which distinguishes it from work on agricultural land then I suggest that we should hold that such workers are not agricultural workers, and consequently should be entitled to the benefits of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Senator Baxter is quite clear as to the purpose of this section.  He spoke of the possibility of a man being employed one day on one form of work and on another day on another form of work.  I would remind him that in this paragraph of the section we are only dealing with persons who are wholly or mainly employed upon one form of work. Therefore, it should not, in any individual case, be difficult to determine whether a person is wholly or mainly employed as an agricultural worker, a market gardener, or anything else.  I do not think Senators should allow themselves to be confused by the possibility of administrative difficulties arising in individual cases.  If difficulties do arise in individual cases, we will have to find a way of resolving them.  I am prepared to accept the guidance of the Seanad on the question as to whether we should regard workers in market gardens as agricultural workers or not. If Senators think that we should so regard them; that there is such a close similarity between the work they do, that, therefore, they should be subject to the same treatment, then I am prepared to amend the Bill to exclude such workers from its provisions whether they work in urban areas or in rural areas.  If, on the other hand, the Seanad is of opinion that the work done in a market garden is of a different character to that done by the ordinary agricultural worker, and that it is work that should be subject to a different type of regulation, then I am prepared to leave the Bill as it stands. In its present form the Bill secures to workers in market gardens the full privileges which all classes of industrial and non-industrial workers have secured.  I am not, however, prepared to accept the Senator's amendment. I think that we should have regard only to the form of the employment. It is for the Seanad to decide whether we should keep within or without the <Col N="706" /> definition of &ldquo;agricultural worker,&rdquo; those who are employed in market gardens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnLynch" hpid="Mr. E. Lynch Mr. E. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should not consider changing the section.  Market gardening, in my opinion, is more closely allied to an industrial occupation than it is to agriculture as such.  Usually these market gardens are situated close to large urban centres.  The work performed in them is not of that broad character one associates with agriculture as a whole. A good deal of it is concerned with bringing vegetables to the nearest town.  I can find no close alliance between the type of work done within those walled gardens and the work which is ordinarily called agricultural work.  I was amused when I heard some Senators, who put themselves forward here as authorities on agriculture, speak of market gardening as if it were closely allied with agriculture. It seems to me that there is no comparison whatever between the two classes of work.  You have amenities, which are largely domestic gardens, attached to fairly large residences occupied by wealthy people, so that if a change is made as regards a market garden a similar change will have to be made as regards those amenities. Senators, I think, will find that very frequently these amenities perform a dual function.  First of all, they provide vegetables for the use of the <Col N="707" /> owner-occupiers, and the surplus is taken to the nearest town and disposed of commercially.</P>
      <P>Market gardeners in and around cities like Dublin, Cork and Limerick are engaged on work which bears no comparison whatever with agricultural work, properly speaking.  There is quite a good case to be made for market gardeners and their assistants benefiting by the provision of this section, but if these benefits cannot be extended to them at present, presumably they will be extended at a later date.  Market gardening and work in nurseries are very closely allied.  In regard to what Senator Keane said about the caring of woodlands and that type of work, that should be distinguished from work which farmers ordinarily perform in the fields.  The benefits extended to workers in market gardens should be continued, and I hope the Minister will not make any change.  If he does make any change later, there should be a more detailed inquiry into the work done by market gardeners and those who provide vegetables for cities and towns.  Such an inquiry would show that that work is closely related to what is called industrial work, and would distinguish it clearly from agricultural work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator stated that there is a wide distinction between market gardening and agricultural work.  I think he will admit that there is a distinction between agricultural work and horticulture, but while horticulture is excluded, market gardening is included, so that the whole thing is utterly illogical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how much Senator Lynch knows about market gardening or about agriculture generally.  From what I know of market gardening there will not be much of it in the urban centres and cities unless the work is done by men who dig and plough the land.  If the owner of a market garden was asked whether he preferred an industrial worker or a farm labourer, his answer would be a ready one.  The work done <Col N="708" /> in market gardens is the same kind of work that is done in the fields for the production of potatoes or any other root crop.  The soil has to be handled and the crop has to be marketed.  If an industrial worker was sent out to tackle horses and to bring a load of cabbage to market, you can imagine how some industrial workers would go about the work.  When they had the carts empty, if they had to fill them with manure, what would happen? That is the sort of work market gardeners are doing everywhere.  It is purely agricultural and cannot be separated from that class of work.  It is &ldquo;tosh&rdquo; to say that it is industrial work.  We are never going to get anywhere with a line of reasoning to the contrary.  Senator Lynch will go further when trying to get holidays for all workers, by accepting the commonsense point of view.  If I had the Senator's point of view, I would have had amendments down to include all agricultural workers within the scope of the Bill.  I am wondering why we have had no such amendments.  If we are not prepared to accept market gardeners as agricultural workers I do not know how any inspector is going to define &ldquo;agricultural workers&rdquo; when the point arises.  I am glad the Minister appreciates the difficulties of those who are trying to get some sense of proportion with regard to legislation, where work of a similar character is being done by two types of people, supposed to be engaged in different types of occupation.  If the Minister says that he is prepared to exclude these people from the Bill, I believe he will be doing the right thing.  That will not prevent further legislation being enacted later, to give privileges to workers and others engaged in similar types of occupation, who ought to be getting them now if there was equity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see everybody getting holidays.  Market gardeners and agricultural workers are as much entitled to holidays as town workers.  It is very invidious to select certain classes and to say that they will have to get holidays, while other classes doing practically the same work are not to be entitled to holidays. A considerable amount of market gardening <Col N="709" /> is carried on, but men who are working on one farm are said to be doing market garden work, while others doing the same class of work on another farm are not.  The man who sends produce to the Dublin market and sells it in small quantities is termed a market gardener, but the man who produces acres of potatoes is not a market gardener.  For that reason I think the amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>There are other things dealt with in this section that I intended to leave over until the section was being discussed, but I think I can make some reference to them with relevancy at this stage.  As to the definition of &ldquo;agricultural land,&rdquo; horticulture is included in that, but I find that in sub-section (2) the definition of an agricultural worker is a person who is employed by the owner of agricultural land.  Why the owner of agricultural land?  Does the Minister not know that in and around towns, whether on market gardens or on agricultural work, landlords with very large estates will sub-let some of the land to people who will use it for the cultivation of flowers?  Will that mean that these people will not be regarded as agricultural labourers? The section seems to me to give rise to a good deal of anomalies.  It would be very hard to say who is the owner of a good deal of the land of Eire.  I do not know whether it is the Land Commission or annuitants are the owners.  If &ldquo;owner&rdquo; means anything, it means something that is the absolute property and in the possession of a person who claims to own it. Can that be said in reference to a good deal of the land in Eire?  I cannot understand why that definition should be allowed to go, that a man must be employed by the owner of agricultural land.  At the risk of being irrelevant, I refer the Minister to the definition given in the Valuation Bill, where market gardening is included as agricultural land.  This is a point that the Minister should look into.  It is a very difficult section for the Minister to handle, or for anyone to say definitely what is and what is not agricultural land, or what is and <Col N="710" /> what is not an agricultural labourer. If a man is engaged in the cultivation of flowers, must he be employed by the owner of a patch of land before he is an agricultural worker?  The Minister ought to examine these things and see what can be done, as I think they are anomalies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had any clear guidance from Senators as to whether the majority view is in favour of the exclusion or the inclusion of market garden workers.  I decided originally in favour of bringing the workers employed in market gardens within the Bill, although I recognised that it was a very difficult decision to make, as agricultural workers were being excluded.  But, on reconsideration, my mind swung in favour of excluding market garden workers because of the similarity between their employment and the ordinary employment of an agricultural worker.  At the moment I am rather disposed to include as agricultural workers, and therefore to exclude from the Bill, market garden workers, but I would not propose to do so on my own initiative unless there was a fairly strong feeling generally amongst members of the Seanad that that was the right thing to do, because I am not so completely satisfied in my own mind that it is the right thing to do.  But, if there was any indication that the majority of the Seanad favoured the exclusion of market garden workers, then I am prepared to accept their point of view.  If, on the other hand, the matter is not pressed, I would not propose to amend the Bill myself.</P>
      <P>The other matters which were raised in the course of the discussion do not apply to the amendment, and I do not know that I should refer to them now. I presume that the term &ldquo;owner of agricultural land&rdquo; covers the lessee of agricultural land.  I will have that point examined, but I feel certain that the term owner is adequate in the section.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It is a purely drafting point and I shall bring it to the attention of the official draftsman. Personally, I must confess that all these various terms&mdash;tillage, dairy farming, horticulture, grazing, meadow or pasture land, market gardening, nurserymen, etc.&mdash;do not convey any very clear pictures to my mind, not being a farmer and not having been a farmer.  But I feel fairly certain, although I will have to verify it, that each of them has a separate significance. We can look into the matter and see if there is any contradiction in the section, which includes horticulture and excludes a nursery or market garden.</P>

      <P>This will come up again on Report and could be considered then.  To my mind, from a knowledge of market gardening and agriculture in the vicinity of Dublin, they are interchangeable.  A farmer is both an agriculturist and a market gardener.  Of course it will probably become an urban area.  But there is no line of demarcation between market gardening and agriculture.  Certainly what Senator Counihan pointed out would arise&mdash;that you would have one man claiming to be included and another man claiming to be excluded because he was, to a greater or lesser extent, a market gardener.  On the whole I am in favour of the exclusion of market gardening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an open mind with regard to the main point.  I had for a number of years what is commonly called a market garden and I was foolish enough to give a half-holiday and also to give seven days' annual holiday for years.  But I certainly think, with great respect to the Minister's reply to my question, that as the section stands he will certainly have to amend it.  I find that the concise Oxford Dictionary describes horticulture as the art of <Col N="712" /> garden cultivation.  We find under this section that garden cultivation is exempt if the land is used for that purpose.  On the other hand, we find that for market gardening it is not exempt.  The distinction now comes on the word &ldquo;market.&rdquo;  I have not had time to look that up.  I suggest that, as it stands, it is almost impossible to interpret and that until some case came before the courts we would not know whether the first part or the second part of the section really applied to land used for gardening.  I suggest that this should be left over for Report and that there should be a definite amendment brought in on which, if necessary, the House could divide, if the Minister wants the opinion of the House as to whether market gardening generally should be exempt, and that the amendment should not be pressed now.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that it is the word &ldquo;gardening&rdquo; is the trouble.  There is the producing of food from an agricultural holding for the purpose of selling it in the market. It is the terminology that is applied to it, more in the vicinity of Dublin than anywhere else, which matters. It is the use of the words &ldquo;market gardening&rdquo; which is the difficulty. There are farms in the vicinity of the city used to supply food products to the city.  The dictionary definition of horticulture as cultivating a garden does not apply certainly to what we interpret as market gardening, namely, producing food for the purpose of selling it in the city.  The dictionary does not bring us any further than our commonsense in trying to solve that problem. Perhaps, the Minister would, with his various officials and advisers, try to cover this matter on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In County Dublin, at all events, this question is rather mixed up.  In the old days in Dublin there were certain people who did market gardening exclusively, such as Alderman Flanagan, the Beggs and other people.  They have now gone out of business because the Dublin Corporation, in order to meet the housing <Col N="713" /> requirements of the citizens, have taken over all this land which was formerly used as market gardens.  Therefore, market gardening is now carried out largely by those who were formerly engaged in agriculture.  Senator Counihan said that a number of people in Rush and other places in his locality are engaged in market gardening. In places nearer to the city, such as Clondalkin, a number of farmers who formerly did agricultural work now partly engage in the production of vegetables and other things as market gardeners.  Therefore, the question is undoubtedly a very complicated one and very mixed up.  A number of Senators have found it very hard to differentiate between what is exclusively a market gardener and what is an agriculturist.  I would be inclined to agree with the suggestion of Senator O'Donovan that the Minister in his own able way should take the opportunity of going further into the matter before it is finally dealt with.</P>

      <P>My excuse for intervening a second time is that the Minister said that he had not a very clear view of what some terms meant. Previously I suggested that market gardeners, nursery workers, and woodland workers should be excluded and treated as agricultural workers.  I live in a very remote agricultural district where market gardening is carried on.  There is also a considerable amount of nursery work carried on and a good deal of woodland work. I fail to see any logical reason why nursery workers, woodland workers or market gardeners should be treated differently from the agricultural workers in that area.  They breathe the same air, do similar work, but get better pay.  If anybody deserves holidays, it is the agricultural worker.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister develop the definition of &ldquo;full day's pay&rdquo;?  It is set out as meaning the amount payable to a worker in respect of a normal full working day. There are casual workers who earn a very large sum of money one day and very little the next day.  On that general definition it would be impossible to assess what a normal day's pay would be.  I suggest to the Minister that the only logical way of dealing with the matter is to go arithmetically into the matter and ascertain what the earnings for the previous month or fortnight were and divide that by the number of days in the period.  So far as one can see, it will be impossible to assess a full day's pay in the terms of the section if there is a dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that some further definition of &ldquo;domestic worker&rdquo; is necessary. It seems to me that any person entitled to a free room or to a free house, no matter what sort of work they do, provided they are not industrial workers, will come within the definition.  A gamekeeper entitled to a free house would, under the definition, become a domestic worker.  The provisions for domestic workers in this Bill are quite different&mdash;and properly so&mdash;from those for other workers.  Unless I have completely misunderstood the position, this definition will tie us up in a knot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes asked if the definition included an agricultural worker. Clearly, it does not but stablemen, grooms, gamekeepers and others who do not come within the category of industrial workers and who are paid partly by way of accommodation would come within the definition.  That is not satisfactory.  The Bill provides for the calculation of holidays for those workers in a different way from that in which it provides for calculation of holidays of other workers and the arrangement with regard to public holidays is also different.  I did not put down an amendment because I was not clear as to what the Minister intended. I was going to move an amendment with regard to the wording of provision (c), but I thought it better to draw the Minister's attention to the matter and to ask him if it was <Col N="715" /> intended that &ldquo;domestic worker&rdquo; should include every type of worker other than an industrial worker who happens to be partly paid by the provision of a room or a free house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the difficulty of Senator Sir John Keane is.  The definition of &ldquo;full day's pay&rdquo; is inserted to make quite clear that it will not be a half-day's pay or anything less than the worker would get under his contract of service in respect of a normal, full working day.  I do not see that any difficulty will arise or that it is necessary to undertake the mathematical calculation the Senator had in mind. I do not know why he thinks it may be necessary to make that calculation and I do not see where the difficulty will arise in connection with the definition. A worker employed casually as a dock labourer for a particular job, a man taken on at the beginning of the job and discharged when it is finished, will obviously not be affected by this definition at all.  We are dealing here with people employed under a contract of service, and in respect of them I do not think that any real difficulty will arise in determining the amount payable in respect of a normal working day&mdash;a full day's pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither do I understand why Senator Douglas thinks a difficulty will arise by reason of the fact that stablemen or grooms with free lodging will be classed as &ldquo;domestic workers.&rdquo; I think they must be classed as domestic workers for the purpose of this Bill, because the problem which arose and which had to be dealt with applies in their case as in the more ordinary case of the domestic worker who resides in his or her employer's household.  The difficulty that occasioned this division of workers to whom the Bill applies into two classes &mdash;domestic and non-domestic&mdash;was due solely to the fact that part of the remuneration was given in the form of lodging or board and lodging.  If the giving of a holiday involved the deprivation of the worker of that board or board and lodging, it might cause real hardship, and the holiday might be of no benefit to the worker, <Col N="716" /> but rather a source of loss.  Consequently, where a worker got, as part of his remuneration, board and lodging or board or lodging it was necessary to make special provision for him, and that is embodied in the Bill.  That provision is intended to apply just as definitely to the case of the non-industrial worker who gets free lodging, such as a stableman, a groom or a chauffeur, as to the case of the domestic servant, as the term is more generally understood.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;domestic worker&rdquo; may itself be the source of the confusion. It only applies for the purpose of this Bill.  So far as I am concerned, any term will do provided it distinguishes between those workers who get all they earn in cash and those who get paid partly in cash and partly in board and lodging.  In the case of the latter class of workers, special provisions have had to be made and these are in the Bill and are designed to deal with the case of such workers, whether domestic workers in the narrow sense or workers merely classed as domestic workers for the purpose of convenience under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <P>Take the case of a shop.  Certain classes of workers in shops are dealt with under the Shops Bill.  Certain other classes who work in or about a shop are not dealt with under that Bill.  You may have a messenger working out of doors&mdash;I know of one case&mdash;who is entitled to lodging, not in the house of the employer but elsewhere.  If a room or house forms part of the pay of a worker, then he becomes a domestic worker under this definition.  So far as the Minister is anxious to provide that where these workers get a holiday they should get some extra pay to make up for the board or lodging I accept his argument, but I do not accept it in regard to the application of the whole of Section 12. If he were to put in a provision that any type of worker who was paid by means of lodging or board and lodging or either was to get extra payment, I should say that that would be fair and just.  I certainly do not see, however, why he should class them all as domestic workers, because domestic <Col N="717" /> workers are really dealt with in a substantially different way in the Bill.</P>

      <P>With regard to this whole question of the interpretation of the section, and what classes are to be included or excluded, I think it is a matter of great difficulty, and I suggest that the Minister is a very good friend to the lawyers, because this whole thing is obviously bristling with difficulties.  That is only the first view of the matter, because when you look at the section it is not going to operate at all.  The Minister is taking arbitrary power to exclude or include any class he likes, and from the point of view of democratic government, I suggest that it is mere humbug.  The Minister, by an order, can simply throw out anybody or take in anybody.</P>

    <P>Then, the Minister certainly can exclude.  He has power to exclude anybody he likes; so, really, the protection of the courts is nothing in practice.  When any awkward situation arises, the Minister just puts in an order excluding a class.  I suggest that it is worse than the Land Commission, because if there is an adverse decision, the Minister simply makes an order.  There is no protection here, and, as a parliamentary document, the Bill affords no protection.  The matter is simply handed over to the Minister to operate it.</P>

      <P>The last paragraph on page 3 is intended to exclude workers employed upon rotational relief schemes.  Senator Hogan's point is one, I think, that we might consider, although I do not see any way out of it.  Either difficulties of definition or questions concerning the applicability of the Act to individuals will be decided by the courts or by somebody else.  There is, I take it, in Senator Hogan's mind the idea that a decision might be made by the Minister as in the case of the Unemployment Insurance Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought of that, but I do not think it is quite feasible in this particular case.  The State has not got the same responsibility for enforcement in the case of this legislation as in the case of the Unemployment Insurance Act.  That Act is a State scheme.  It is compulsory on every individual to belong to it, and, consequently, when any question of the applicability of that <Col N="719" /> scheme to an individual arises, there must be a decision given.  In this particular case, however, the matter of enforcement is left very largely to the individuals themselves to proceed through the courts and get for themselves the rights which the law gives them.  The bringing in of the Minister would be undesirable and might bring him in in a way that is not intended and make him responsible for supervision of employment conditions generally for the purpose of seeing that the provisions of the Act are observed.  It is not intended to do that, however, but rather that the individual should assert his own rights.  We merely define his rights, and he asserts them and gets recognition of his rights by his own action in the courts.  It would be a further step in the wrong direction, to which we had reference by Senator Sir John Keane.  The section to which Senator Sir John Keane takes exception is one that I think is very necessary and desirable.  Legislation of this kind is, in a sense, experimental.  In legislation of this kind hitherto we have always found that unforeseen difficulties arose.  Some class of persons of whom nobody thought, in respect of whom the ordinary provisions of the measure concerned did not apply, has been discovered, and a clause which gives power to exclude such persons from the scope of such a measure is necessary if a continuous stream of amending Bills is to be avoided.  There might be some ground if we were extending this, but the power of exclusion is merely a safety valve to ensure that, if a difficulty arises because of some circumstance which we do not now anticipate, the matter can be dealt with at once and the <i>status quo</i> restored until some new proposals for legislation are submitted to the Oireachtas.  Without a safety clause of that kind we would be taking the risk of landing ourselves in difficulties.  That has been our experience both under the Conditions of Employment Act of 1936 and the Shops Act of last year.  From the very start of the operation of these measures the powers given by corresponding sections had to be availed of in respect of particular classes of persons if the Acts were to be worked at all.  There is one <Col N="720" /> safeguard with regard to the use of the powers given to the Minister under that section, and that is that it will always be unpopular for the Minister to do so. The class of persons excluded by his order are bound to protest, and the Senator may be quite certain that no Minister will use these powers without very grave grounds for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in a sense it is a drafting amendment.  Sub-section (2) of Section 5 deals with the case of a business that has been transferred. The purpose of the amendment is so to limit, in such circumstances, the new owner's liability in respect to a transferred worker's annual or semi-annual leave.  The new employer will not be liable in respect of a public holiday which occurred in that particular year during which the worker was in the employment of the previous owner.  I think Senator Douglas will agree that it would not be equitable to require the new owner to be <Col N="722" /> responsible for the former owner's default or for what the former owner should have done; he should not be liable to prosecution for that.</P>

      <P>Under Section 9, which is to be excluded, there are certain things which come to the new employer with regard to holidays which come in under Section 7.  I do not quite grasp that point.

      <P>No.  The section provides for the circumstances in which a business is transferred to a new owner. The worker had, as against a new owner, the rights he had against the old owner.  He could exercise these rights against the new owner if the old owner had failed to give relief under the Act; the worker could institute proceedings against the new owner for the default committed by the old owner.  This is to provide that the new owner shall not be responsible for the default of his predecessor.</P>

      <P>The Senator knows that if you legislated to that effect you would leave a loophole which it would be impossible to detect.

      <P>This may be all right in highly organised businesses but I am thinking of quite a different set of circumstances.  In the country you get a sort of man who does a bit of everything, cleans the car, does a bit of gardening, stokes the boiler, cleans the boots and so on.  By this section you prevent that man from coming into his employer's place in the morning.  Indeed, you have got to prevent him and you are forced to do so if you are going to be logical. There is an obligation placed on the employer to forbid that man working or coming into his place.  Things are not worked in that way in the country. That man may have been in your employment for 30 years and are you going to tell him &ldquo;you are not going to come here to-day; the boiler will not be stoked, the boots are not to be cleaned&rdquo;?  That is what the employer has to say to the man.  The man may come only for an hour or two.  Is it the intention of the Bill that such a man shall not put his foot inside his employer's premises on that day?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to say how this Bill is going to work.  I presume that, as under other Acts, we will have inspectors coming to our premises. They will come, say, to Senator Sir John Keane's and find this man who does these various jobs about the place. If the man is there on that particular day the Senator is going to be prosecuted. I was told a story a couple of weeks ago, while discussing this Bill <Col N="724" /> with a number of farmers including prominent supporters of the Government. Peculiarities arising out of other legislation were mentioned.  An inspector went to a farmer's place where he found four men.  He inquired about their wages and he was told what the wages were.  The inspector said: &ldquo;That will not do.&rdquo;  Then the farmer said: &ldquo;That is all right, I will give A so much, B so much and C so much per week and you can take D away with you.&rdquo;  The inspector left and the man went away with him; but the inspector had to clear away very quickly because he would have been seriously maltreated by the man who lost his job as a consequence of the Minister's legislation.  I do not understand the Minister when he tells us that the conditions of employment to-day are such between workers in relation to their employers that the workers are subject to dismissal.  The Minister is wrong when he tells us that the industrialist has the power in his hands to intimidate a worker.  That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am open to correction, but my opinion is that the position of workers in this country to-day is such that they cannot be subjected to such intimidation on the part of any employer.  Their organisation is very strong; they are very independent; they have their rights, and they know their rights.  I cannot understand the Minister when he argues that it is possible for employers to intimidate the workers and deny them the holidays to which they are entitled.  I must say that that is not true of any industry with the conditions of which I am acquainted.  On the other hand, it is quite true that there may be many cases where it will suit both the employer and the employee to give the employee an extra day's wages, and let him stay and do a particular type of work even on a day when he is entitled to a holiday.  I believe it is a bad thing to have all this restriction of liberty.  If the Minister were to argue that there is justification for the inclusion of the section on the grounds that it is going to provide an additional day's work for somebody else, that would be another point of view; it is a point of view I would not accept.  I am quite convinced that that <Col N="725" /> type of section really creates artificial barriers between our people, when they ought to treat one another with humanity rather than because the law has demanded this unreasonable and in my view unnatural thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think possibly the Senator has misunderstood the section, because it does not really deal with the question of giving the worker a day's pay, although that, I think, in certain circumstances, is provided further on in the Act.  I should like to ask the Minister whether it is really necessary to put this into the Act, particularly as it is dealing with domestic workers. Would it not be better to leave it to the courts to give a reasonable definition as to whether holidays are given or not?</P>
      <P>I was asked a question by a lady as to whether if the maid gave her a cup of tea in the morning before going out &mdash;in most cases it is a necessary precaution even to getting a holiday&mdash;would that be doing work?  Technically, I think it would.  It is all very well to say to a maid who is in the habit of bringing up a cup of tea: &ldquo;Do not bring it this morning,&rdquo; but in practice it will not work.  You make it a day of 24 hours, but in practice it will not happen.  It reminds me of an occasion many years ago, when I shared a room with a gentleman who happened to have very strong views with regard to the keeping of the Sabbath.  He had cleaned one of his shoes when 12 o'clock struck on Saturday night, and he would not clean the other.  That will be the effect of the strict interpretation of that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary that we should put somewhere in this Bill a definition of the phrase &ldquo;allow a whole holiday,&rdquo; and no other definition than the one there is possible.  I think when the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, was before the Dáil there was unanimity amongst both the representatives of Labour and the representatives of employers there that not merely should we prevent an employer from employing a man upon a day on which he was to get a holiday, but that we should go further and prevent the man from working either for that employer <Col N="726" /> or any other, the argument being quite properly advanced that the purpose of the Bill was to get holidays for the workers, and that they should not be allowed to do otherwise than take the holiday as a result of the enactment of the measure.  I know there will be cases of individual workers who would rather work and get double pay.  Not merely the employers but the trade union representatives in the Dáil knew that human nature is human nature, here as well as every place else, and that the desire to get something more than somebody else would result in workers going beyond their ordinary employment, and taking casual jobs for the purpose of getting more money, and that, in fact, when certain workers were on holidays from one employer they were found working with another.  It was to prevent that that very stringent provisions were put into the 1936 Act.</P>
      <P>Some such provision has to be inserted here.  There will be some workers who will object to it.  I am quite certain that the slaves in the Southern half of the United States were strongly opposed to the repeal of the slavery laws there, and fought with the Southern armies against the legions of the North who were trying to liberate them, because they thought they would starve&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We had Senator Baxter's statement about the agricultural worker who chased the inspector from his employer's premises because that inspector insisted upon the fulfilment of the Act of Parliament which secured the worker a minimum wage, and consequently lost him his employment. What Senator Baxter said was said by thousands of slave owners in the United States, who told the slaves that if they were liberated they would lose their jobs and probably starve. There is the story of the British Minister who passed an Act forbidding the employment of women in coal mines. When he visited the coal mines he was <Col N="727" /> chased out of them by the women who had lost their jobs.  Neither Senator Baxter nor anybody else would come in here with a private Bill to repeal that measure and provide again for the employment of women workers in coal mines.  The individual who chased that inspector was not objecting to taking the minimum wage which the law prescribed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 7 standing in my name is really consequential to a later amendment, and I think it would be better if you, Sir, would allow it to be postponed, and taken after Senator Sir John Keane's amendment.

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Notwithstanding anything in this Act where the wage of a non-domestic worker is calculated by the week or by a period longer than a week and the person who employs such worker pays such worker a full week's wage for any week and such worker does no work on any public holiday which falls within such week such person shall be deemed to have allowed such worker a whole holiday on such public holiday and to have paid such worker for such public holiday.</P>
      <P>I think this matter is fairly clear.  It is not on the same lines as the rather vague and indeterminate question which we have been discussing heretofore. If the Bill passes in its present form a five-day worker would have to be paid an extra day's pay if the holiday comes on a Saturday, although he receives his full week's wages.  In some trades a five-day week is worked, and a full week's pay is paid.</P>
      <P>If the holiday falls on a Saturday an extra day has to be paid for under the Bill as it is drawn.  In the case of the five and a half day worker, only an extra half day has got to be paid for.  You have the anomaly that the five and a half day worker is going to receive a half day's pay and the five day worker will receive the full day's pay, whereas in both cases they are paid their full week's wages.  There can be no equity in that. There is no logical basis on which that position can be maintained. The object of the Bill is not to give extra pay for holidays, but merely to give pay for holidays.  If you pay a man for a full week's work, you have paid him, and if there is a holiday in the week he is paid for it. Under this Bill you are going to pay him over and above that.  The object of the amendment is to prevent that.</P>

      <P>The week is defined by the number of hours worked and where there is an agreement with the trade union for a 44-hour week a man <Col N="729" /> may work that number of hours in five or five and a half days, as against another man who may be employed for the six days.  The man works the full number of hours which ordinarily constitute the week's work.  Therefore, in one case a man has worked the holiday without pay, whereas the other man gets the day's pay for the holiday without having worked it.</P>

      <P>I submit that the man working the 44-hour week in five or five and a half days is working the holiday as compared with the man who takes six days to work his 44 hours.  The employer who has an agreement with his men to work 44 hours in five or five and a half days has an advantage as compared with the employer of workers who work over a period of six days.  Can you follow that?  I do not see any reason why Senators should laugh.</P>
      <P>The thing is very clear to me, but perhaps it is that I am superior to most Senators.  Is it not reasonable to say that where an employer is obliged to pay for a holiday, it is immaterial whether his men work the 44 hours, which constitute the week, in five or five and a half days?  Is that not reasonable and clear?  In other words, the man who has six days in which to work the 44 hours is going to have an advantage over the man who works his week in five or five and a half days.</P>

      <P>I had hoped that Senator Foran would convince Senator Sir John Keane, or <i>vice versa</i>, but I think we might give it up as a bad job. I have considerable sympathy with Senator Foran in his efforts to make clear a matter which is not very clear to some people.  I think I do understand what he is driving at, though I do not fully agree with him.  He is assuming that a five-day and a six-day worker always work the same number of hours in the week.  I think I can assure him that is not the case.  He says that under the amendment the six-day worker would have an advantage over the five-day worker. The Bill gives the five-day worker an advantage over the six-day worker, because he gets extra pay in the week in which the bank holiday comes on his non-working day, whereas the six-day worker does not get any extra pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would support some such amendment as this, but for a somewhat different reason.  I believe it is exceedingly unsatisfactory to have different classes of people getting different rates for doing practically the same work and in the same type of employment. Let us take the shops, for instance. The number of people employed in shops is very large, possibly it is one of the largest classes in the country. They were partly dealt with under the Shops Act.  Workers who do work outside the shops were not dealt with under that Act, but they are dealt with under this.  The usual shop half-holiday is on Wednesday or Saturday.  In the country it is very often on Thursday. There is always a half-holiday in the week.  If St. Patrick's Day, Christmas Day or St. Stephen's Day comes on that half-holiday, this particular class of outdoor workers have to be paid an extra half-day's wages, although <Col N="731" /> under the Shops Act none of the others have it.</P>
    <P>It is going to be difficult, as time goes on, to distinguish between the two types of workers.  Some of us experienced difficulty in the past and most sane shopkeepers gave the same conditions to all their employees without waiting for this legislation.  I think you will find that most shopkeepers gave that when the last Act was passed.  Now you have a different set of conditions appearing.  I suggest, if the Minister will not accept an amendment on the lines of Senator Sir John Keane's or mine, that he might provide that persons employed in or about a shop should come within the Shops Act so that you will have some sort of uniformity.</P>
    <P>I am not going to attempt at this stage to read statistics, but it has been carefully worked out by some persons in the Chamber of Commerce that over a period of five years an amendment similar to that of Senator Sir John Keane's would work out equitably as between the five- and six-day workers. Senator Foran has pleaded for the principle that the five-day worker in a certain week shall be allowed to work and get two days' pay extra; the six-day worker will not be allowed to work, but he will get his holiday.</P>
    <P>The argument is that the five-day worker works nine hours each day, 45 hours in all, and the six-day worker works 7½ hours each day.  The holiday comes on the sixth day.  The five-day worker has worked the 45 hours and he has, therefore, worked the equivalent of the day which is a holiday. Senator Foran shakes his head and says he has to get two days' pay.  In effect, that is what it amounts to.  The other bank holiday or public holiday came on the following day.</P>
    <P>I understood, as the Minister introduced the Bill, that it was uniform with previous legislation and it would have worked very much the same as the Shops Act.  I think I am correct in stating that.  The principle of this Bill is to provide, to my mind at any rate, one week's annual leave with full pay and seven holidays with full pay. In other words, what it means is that <Col N="732" /> a person shall have his fortnight and shall not lose anything whatever in his remuneration.  I am in favour of any provision that will meet that case and provide for that but, as it stands now, it is really providing that certain classes of workers on certain occasions will have extra pay rather than getting an actual holiday from their work.  I think an amendment on the lines of Senator Sir John Keane's would go a long way, if not entirely, to meet the case.  I prefer it to my own amendment which comes later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the point of view expressed by Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Douglas, but I fear there are practical difficulties, to which they have not adverted at all.  It is true that when we first brought to the Dáil proposals for legislation relating to public holidays our idea was to safeguard workers against loss of pay by reason of the fact that a public holiday occurred. In a large number of occupations that was the position, as Senators know. A public holiday meant for workers merely a day upon which they could not work and, consequently, a day in respect of which they could not be paid.  We set out to ensure that such workers getting their holidays would also get in respect of each holiday the pay they would have received if the day had been a working day and they had been allowed to work on it.  So far, so good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice, the application of that principle was complicated by reason of the fact that some workers are ordinarily employed for six days in the week, some are ordinarily employed for five days in the week and some workers, by reason of depressed conditions in their industries or other temporary circumstances, are employed normally only for four or perhaps even three days in the week and in respect of them the problem immediately arose as to what happened when the public holiday fell upon a day upon which they would not work in any event.  As the 1936 Act was framed and as it was brought into operation, we held, and I think many employers accepted the point of view, that they were obliged to pay their workers a <Col N="733" /> day's pay for a public holiday even if the public holiday fell upon a non-working day.  We tried to regularise that position when introducing this Bill originally by restoring the original idea, the idea of protecting workers against loss by reason of the advent of a public holiday, but objection was taken in the Dáil, and so many arguments were used against this proposal and so many practical difficulties arose in the application of the new proposal that I decided to change the Bill again and, as it now stands, a worker is entitled to be paid in respect of a public holiday even if that public holiday falls upon a non-working day. That is what this amendment is directed against.  It has been a matter which caused considerable discussion in the Dáil, considerable discussion in the Chambers of Commerce throughout the country and the submission of a number of representations to me by various employers' organisations.  I decided, however, that whatever objection there may be in principle to the Bill as it stands, there are practical considerations which make it difficult, if not impossible, to change it.  I do not agree, however, that the case is as clear cut as Senator Douglas submitted. There is a point in the argument which Senator Foran put forward that as between the five-day week worker and the six-day week worker, when a holiday falls upon a Saturday, the five-day week worker may get an extra day's pay but he has in fact in that week done what the six-day week worker has not done and that is a full week's work.  The six-day week worker will get only the normal week's wages but has done less than the normal week's work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>One in every second year, and that is the proportion which Senators must keep in mind.  The problem of the half-day is somewhat different, but there again I think it was a necessary safeguard against possible evasion of the Act.  Having regard to the somewhat different provisions set out here from those in the original 1936 measure and in the Shops Act, we are giving a greater latitude in the substitution of days for public holidays and, consequently, it is necessary to ensure where a public holiday does fall upon a non-working day or half-day a full day's wages must be given.  I am prepared to admit at once that Senators can show that in individual cases that is going to work out somewhat unfairly, unfairly in the sense that a few workers will get advantages which others will not get, but I do submit to them that any alternative course will work out much more unfairly still.  The classic case, if I may so call it, the case which was most frequently quoted in the various discussions we have had upon the matter, was that of the Inchicore shop-workers, who have been working a five-day week for, I think, ten years, and even though, officially, the short week is due to depressed conditions in the railway industry, it has lasted so long now that it can be fairly regarded as the normal practice of the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The great majority are paid on the basis of an hourly rate.  I do say there will be in that case or in other cases workers doing a short week who are paid on the basis of a <Col N="735" /> weekly rate, and the arguments apply in their case as in any other case.  The Inchicore Shop workers do not work on a Monday, and that is a much more significant day when one is to have regard to the question of payment for public holidays than Saturday, because a number of the holidays fall upon a Monday, and only upon a Monday, and they would get, in fact, payment for only three public holidays in the year unless this principle of payment for a public holiday, even when it falls upon a non-working day, was inserted in the Bill.  In fact, I understand their employers have been giving them that payment in respect of public holidays since the 1936 Act was passed, and have accepted the point of view that they were obliged to do so by that Act, even though there was some doubt about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could argue this matter for a long time, I know, because I have argued it for lengthy periods with various deputations from the organisations interested, without getting to any definite conclusion, because no definite conclusion is possible.  In fact, we might even admit that the weight of argument on principle is with those who want to make the change that Senator Sir John Keane suggests, but the weight of argument on the grounds of convenience and practicability is with those who are against it.  Having regard to my own outlook on the matter, I prefer to accept the argument of convenience, the argument based on practicability, even though it does mean that a few workers will occasionally get more money than they would otherwise get.  I admit that if the argument is limited to those workers who are paid on weekly or monthly rates, my case is not so strong, but even in the case of these workers, there are special considerations which must be taken into account.  There may be some workers, working on a short week, working on the basis of the weekly rates, which would be the normal rate.  It is only in very specialised classes that a five-day week is worked.  The great majority of the workers affected by Senator Sir John Keane's amendment are clerical workers paid weekly or monthly <Col N="736" /> salaries, and it is true to say that in the great majority of these cases the normal working week extends over six days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only question that arises in relation to them is the possibility of their receiving, once in a while, a full day's pay in respect of a public holiday on what is ordinarily their half day.  I do not think that it is so serious a matter as to justify us in taking the much wider risk of trying to bring back this legislation to the original basis, involving as it does a very substantial difficulty in the case of workers who may for any temporary reason in any occupation be working less than their normal full working week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has argued for the Bill as it stands as against the Bill as it was introduced. I am in a certain amount of difficulty because the same points are made in this amendment as are made in my own amendment later.  With your permission, Sir, it would save the time of the House if I referred to the alternative amendment which is virtually the same as this.  I should like to point out to the Minister that it would be very rare indeed&mdash;I believe it could happen in a leap year and, I think, for that purpose it could be ignored&mdash;that this will occur more than once every second year.  It will be rare that there will be more than one day concerned.  If you take the five-day worker in a normal working week of 45 hours, he works nine hours for five days.  Normally, the six-day worker works eight hours for five days and five hours on a Saturday.  That is the way in which the 45 hours are made up.  In a year of six public holidays, if the five-day worker has received five days, he has already received with pay his full week&mdash;45 working hours.  The six-day worker will have to receive six days' pay in order to cover his 45 hours, so that, actually, either amendment as it stands would provide relief from a full week's work.  That, I think, was what was originally intended and that is what is equitable.  It is equitable in both cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> The Minister's idea of convenience, of course, naturally would be different from ours, at any rate in present circumstances. Possibly the time may come when he ceases to be Minister and he has to act as employer and to pay wages on a lot of different scales.  He will not then be nearly so much impressed by the convenience of treating on the same conditions workers whose wages should be calculated at different rates and watching a particular week in which the half-day has to be paid for extra.  That does not normally happen and it could be easily overlooked.  I should like to hear the Minister or Senator Foran explain to certain shop workers why one should get a day's pay more than the other. I am sure that Senator Foran could explain it in his own humorous way but the fact remains that it will cause a certain amount of dissatisfaction and it is not, I suggest, convenient.  If the Minister is convinced that there is no possible way to meet this, it is useless in our moving any amendments. I want, however, to draw attention to the second amendment because in that I endeavoured to provide what Senator Sir John Keane has tried to provide in a different way.  It is extremely difficult for a draftsman to draft amendments but it is one hundred times more difficult for a layman to do so.  Nevertheless, we can generally manage to convey an idea of what we want.  What I tried to provide was that when a full week had been given in public holidays during the year, there would not be any obligation to make additional pay.  That would get over the difficulty, I suggest.  There is a genuine difficulty and I can see the Minister appreciates it.  I cannot say that we reciprocate his attitude by saying that we appreciate his difficulty.  I can, of course, see his point in regard to what he calls the classical case of the Inchicore workers.  I do not think that any reasonable person wants to prevent men who are doing only casual work from getting the benefit of holidays with pay I think they are a class of people who need holidays and they should get them, but I believe it should be possible for the brains of the Minister and his staff to find some way by which the difficulty <Col N="738" /> would be met.  Our difficulty really arises from the proposal that people who regularly work five days per week should get during the year, in addition to the full week's holiday, annual leave, six days' public holidays with pay.  If they are five-day a week workers and get five days' public holidays, they get their week's holidays with pay, just as much as the six-day worker who gets six public holidays. One gets eight hours a day for five days and five hours a day on the sixth day&mdash;45 hours in all, and the other gets nine hours a day for five days, also 45.  I think it is quite equitable.  I am assuming, of course, the case of the year where there is only one holiday that is a non-working day.  As far as I can find out the years in which it would occur twice are negligible.  It would only possibly occur in a leap year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Senator Douglas's amendment could be accepted, or that it would prove, in operation, quite as simple as he suggests. I think his idea that an employer in respect of the six public holidays need not be obliged to give more than five days' pay in the case of a five-day a week worker would not work.  I do not think the Senator or employers generally would get away with that.  Take the case of a worker whose employment year begins on the 1st of January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree that the amendment will not cause any difficulty. The six-day worker will get paid for every public holiday.  It is not only in the case of the five-day week worker the difficulty would arise, but more particularly in the case of the four-day week worker on short time whose employer could contend, I think correctly, that the four days' pay represents the normal weekly wage.  I do not think that we should do that. To attempt to do it would be only asking for trouble, apart altogether from the fact that it must be remembered, in the case of the five-day week worker, that where the holiday falls on a non-working <Col N="739" /> day the worker is in fact doing more work in that week than the six-day worker.  Therefore, the fact that he is getting more money is not as inequitable as has been suggested.</P>

These do not relate merely to public and annual holidays, but to a number of other things as well.  I am not at all averse to the idea of seeing the type of worker who has not secured the benefit and the protection of these Acts getting somewhat better treatment under the Bill.  I do not think that, in practice, the better treatment will amount to very much, but in so far as it does, I think it is some compensation for the fact that those workers have not got the benefit of the whole of the shops legislation applied to them.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendments is to dispose of a situation which it was discovered might arise under sub-section (7) where an employer might not be able to give the six consecutive days in lieu of public holidays if a short day occurred in the worker's week.  Sub-section (7) permits an employer to give six such days upon working days, but a working day is not a day on which a worker works less than a full day, according to the provisions of sub-section (8). The three amendments are intended to remedy that situation, and in order to do so the term &ldquo;short day&rdquo; is substituted for paragraph 4 of sub-section (8).  Sub-section (7) is amended so that the intervention of the short day will not break the consecutive nature of the leave granted in lieu of public holidays. It is really a drafting amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (1) of the section provides <Col N="742" />&ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any industrial worker, during any period of annual leave, to do for reward any industrial work.&rdquo;  Before speaking at length on the amendment I should like to hear the Minister's reasons against it.  The principle was accepted more or less by all Parties, Labour Senators and others, on the Second Stage that it is not desirable to allow, as far as you can possibly prevent it by law, people to get holidays with pay, and then to take work during their holidays for some other employer who is not legally obliged to give a holiday. That principle was accepted in the previous Acts and it applies to industrial workers.  For some reason&mdash;there may be excellent reasons for it&mdash;that I do not know, it does not apply to workers governed by this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section as it stands is to prevent a worker who gets annual leave taking industrial work during his holiday leave. The Senator asks why do we confine the prohibition to industrial work.  The only answer is that our belief is that a prohibition as rigid as that which the Senator's amendment would involve might be found in practice to work out very harshly.  We can think of a number of types of cases that might arise.  There are many workers employed in one connection or another who might be hit very harshly by it, those who, for example, are engaged teaching at night in technical schools. If this amendment were accepted they would be required to cease that other work as well as their ordinary work during their period of leave from their ordinary work.  Difficulties would arise in connection with other types of occupation.  You have, for instance, newspaper reporters who work for agencies and papers outside the country. They could not continue that work during their period of leave if this amendment were inserted in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examples could perhaps be multiplied continuously, but it is not necessary to do so.  The matter is one which has been the subject of considerable discussion here, and also, I might mention, the subject of discussion before the committee upon holidays that was set up in the <Col N="743" /> United Kingdom.  Their suggestion, I think, was that possibly a solution should be found by prohibiting a person on holidays from doing any work of the same class as he might be normally doing.  But even that was not a solution of the particular difficulty I mentioned.  Having regard to some of the examples quoted we felt it would be better to leave the position as it stands.  The reason why the prohibition is confined to industrial workers is because the terms of the 1936 Act provide that anyone getting leave under that Act should be doing industrial work, and we thought we should leave it at that rather than extend it. If after experience in enforcing this Bill for some time we find that there is abuse creeping in, we might be able to deal with that when we have more practical experience of the difficulties involved, with a greater possibility of finding an equitable solution.  As things stand, and in the light of present information, I think it would be unwise to risk the very rigid type of prohibition that deletion of the word &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; from the section would create.</P>

      <P>I am not going to press the point.  I believe the Government is making a mistake in leaving it free for other classes, other than industrial workers, to take other work. In the case of a man who teaches in the evening you might provide that he could do any normal work connected with his occupation.  There might be some way to deal with that class of case.  In this case, you are deliberately putting into the Bill what I believe to be a very bad precedent. I will not press the matter, but I feel rather strongly that it will lead to abuse.  There will not be abuse in the case of ordinary trade union workers, except occasionally, as, generally speaking, trade unionists and employers agree in this matter.  You are bringing in a very large class of workers who are not trade unionists, and there is the very great temptation to take other work.  It does happen in some shops on Saturdays, and is very unsatisfactory.  It would be very wise if the Minister could find some way, so as not to leave the position as wide as it is at present.  I am not pressing the amendment, as I have no support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (1) deals with payment in lieu of board and lodgings during leave.  I submit that the figure of 1/- allowed in a county borough or the Borough of Dun Laoghaire in lieu of accommodation is very low.  The sum of 7d. is also very low to allow for board and lodging in other places.  Under the Agricultural Wages Act employers are entitled to deduct 2/4 for board and lodgings while, in this case, they are only obliged to pay 7d. and 1/.  The amounts seem very low.  Sub-section (2) states that accommodation means (a) in relation to a worker who is entitled to board only, board; and (b)  in relation to a worker who is entitled to lodgings only, lodgings.  It would be reasonable in that case to differentiate between board and lodgings.  I suggest that the Minister should reconsider the amounts, having regard to what employers are entitled to deduct, and what they are obliged to pay here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to admit that the amounts indicated are small.  They are, in fact, very little <Col N="747" /> more than token payments but in fixing the amounts we fixed the minimum having regard to the type of cases that will arise.  I mentioned here and in the Dáil cases of domestic workers employed on household work.</P>
      <P>For the farmer the provision of board and lodging is a matter of little difficulty. He can easily provide the accommodation and the food required by a domestic servant.  But the actual provision of cash, even a small amount of cash, in lieu of that in the case of an individual farmer will be a matter of some difficulty.  Certainly he would much prefer to provide the food and lodging rather than the cash.</P>
      <P>I confess that we considered a number of alternatives to the procedure adopted in the Bill before satisfying ourselves that this was the better course.  There was, of course, the obvious alternative, which was adopted in the Shops Act of leaving the amount to be paid in individual cases to be determined by agreement, or, in default of agreement, by the District Court. But it was felt, and I think properly, that the bringing of the courts into the relationship between the employer of a domestic worker and the worker was an undesirable thing.  Alternatively, we could set out some other authority than the courts to decide it, but in the long run that came to the same thing.  Therefore, it was felt that there was only one course practicable, and that was to put the amounts in the Bill and leave it at that.  What the amounts should be was naturally a matter of prolonged consideration and these amounts were arrived at upon the basis of fixing merely a token payment, recognising that in many cases the amounts would not represent any real compensation for the loss of the accommodation referred to.  The Senator will understand that if this should create a position of real difficulty for any domestic servant, she has the alternative of taking extra wages rather than the annual leave, if the leave itself in fact meant having to leave the lodging or surrender the board that she would get by working.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 36, after the word &ldquo;workers&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;other than domestic workers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is not a very big point, but it seems to me that, so far as the ordinary domestic servant is concerned, it is really futile to prescribe the keeping of books and forms in the domestic dwelling-house to be shown.  I think that the Minister would be just as happy if he had not the power to make these orders so far as domestic workers are concerned.  If forms suitable for inspection by the Department are to be kept in relation to domestic servants, the average male member of the household would tell us that he would not get it done, and there would be nothing but trouble.  I, therefore, suggest that the domestic worker should not be included in regard to forms and returns.</P>

      <P>The section gives us power merely to prescribe forms, and that may or may not be exercised.  I am disposed to agree with Senator Douglas that in the case of domestic workers it may prove to be futile to make an order under the section, but we must have regard to the fact that it will probably be in relation to that particular class of workers that the enforcement of the Act will present the greatest difficulty.  Furthermore, these workers are specially of the class who cannot very well afford to assert their own rights.  I should say that it will depend very largely on experience whether it will be necessary to require the employers of domestic workers to <Col N="749" /> keep records, and I can assure the Senator that that power to require them to keep records will not be called upon except there is no other course open, and, if it is called upon, the records will have to be as simple and as conveniently kept as possible.  I would, however, think it unwise to delete the power from the Bill altogether. I think the power should be there, even though we put it in knowing that it may be very difficult to exercise.</P>

      <P>After sub-section (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Minister or an officer appointed by the Minister for the purpose is satisfied that he has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence under this Act in relation to any worker employed in any private dwelling-house has been committed by the employer of such worker, he may by notice in writing require such employer to allow an inspector to do any of the things provided under paragraphs (b), (c) or (d) of sub-section (1) of this section <Col N="750" /> either at such private dwelling-house if the employer so elects or at a convenient place to be fixed by the inspector.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There again I am not to be taken strictly in regard to the exact wording, as I see one mistake myself, but the object is to try to get rid of the right of the Minister to send an inspector to the ordinary private dwelling of the citizen.  We have endeavoured to keep a man's dwelling as his castle.  At the time an inspector would go, the man in the house as a rule is away, and he is, I think, in most cases technically the employer.  It seems to me that it would be very much better to give him the option either of allowing the inspector to call, or allowing the employee and the inspector to go somewhere else.  I admit that in most cases people would prefer that he should call &mdash;probably in nine cases out of ten, unless there was some reason that they particularly did not want it to happen. But I think it is possible to avoid what I consider a highly undesirable provision, that you will send an inspector to a private house and that he is given specific rights of entry, however limited.  I make an alternative suggestion. I do not want to take away the Minister's power to take action if he has reasonable grounds, but I suggest that, instead of having the right to send an inspector, as is provided in the Bill, he should, by notice in writing, require that an inspector be allowed. In practice, what is there to inspect in a private house?  The real point is that the Minister has reason to believe that the Act is not being carried out.</P>
    <P>I want some provision by which a domestic servant can see an inspector by herself and tell her story.  That is practically all there is to inspect. There is nothing in this about what the bedrooms or other rooms are to be like.  The inspector has to be satisfied that they are getting holidays under the Act.  If you force the employer to make provision by which the inspector can see the domestic servant, it seems to me that it will meet the point.  I consider the provision undesirable so far as the dwelling-house is concerned, and if inserted that it will be found very difficult to administer.</P>

      <P>I have some sympathy with the amendment, but I am not sure that it is a practicable one.  It is all very well to talk of a man's house being his castle.  All of us react instinctively in favour of any proposal to keep it inviolate.  In practice, the gas-man, the water-man, and everyone else has access to any house and nobody ever questions it.

      <P>It is open to the householder to give these instructions, but that probably results in the gas, or the electric light, or the water, or the telephone being cut off, or something else which an inspector wants to inspect.  In practice, it is much better to let the inspector in to look at the instruments and put up with what inconvenience is caused.  In the particular case which arises here, the inspector cannot present himself for admission to an employer's house unless he has been furnished with a certificate by the Minister, or an official appointed by the Minister, to the effect that the Minister has reason to believe that an offence against the Act is being committed.  That certificate must be issued, and it must be in the hands of the inspector when he presents himself at the house.  Most Senators are aware that under the National Health Insurance Acts, which apply to domestic servants, inspectors have the right to visit houses and to interview domestic servants and employers and, generally, to conduct inquiries for the purpose of enforcing the Acts.  I do not think that anybody has found it a very great inconvenience, even though these Acts have been in operation for a long number of years.  In practice, of course, an inspection of this kind is of no use unless there is an element of surprise about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the element of surprise be taken away, it is always possible to hoodwink the inspector when he comes.  All that is in favour of leaving the Bill as it stands.  As it stands, it does not involve <Col N="752" /> much.  It gives the inspector the right to go to the dwelling-house when he has got the necessary certificate and he will go there for no other purpose than to interview the domestic servant and hear her story.  If the same facility could be given him, while maintaining the principle which the Senator is anxious to protect, I should have no objection to amending the section.  As it stands, I think the section will do no harm to anybody.  It may not even do any good.  If there is strong objection to it, I am prepared to consider some alternative on the lines mentioned by Senator Douglas even, though it is suggestive of Health Robinson inasmuch as it is putting up very elaborate machinery to do what is, in essence, a very simple thing&mdash;that is, to go and ask the domestic servant if she has got her week's holidays or got pay in lieu of holidays or put some query of that kind.  I am not prepared to press my objection to Senator Douglas's amendment on principle but, as it stands, it would not do and I should like to have an opportunity of considering it further.</P>

      <P>I did not raise this point simply of my own motion. Several people spoke to me about it and I should like the Minister to see if something could be done to improve the position.  I do not think that his argument is entirely fair when he introduces into it the gentleman who comes to inspect the gas meter.  The provision in the Bill enables the inspector to enter the premises at all reasonable times.  In the case of the private house, that can be done only when he has the authority of a person nominated by the Minister to give that authority but, if anybody obstructs him, he is liable to a penalty.  There is a big difference between his entry and the entry of a gas company's inspector.  I do not think that there is any danger of the powers in the Bill being abused but we do know that, in other countries, similar powers have been used for different purposes&mdash;to visit a house for political or other reasons.  I do not want to suggest that that is likely to happen here in the near future but I think that it is a good thing to avoid that type of legislation if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> The Minister knows how extremely difficult it is to draft an amendment of this kind.  I put it down in this form because I wanted to show that I admitted that there was a great deal in the Minister's point.  The difficulty might be met by providing that the inspector could call and interview the maid at the door.  As the provision is, the decision as to what is a &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo; will lie with the inspector. The powers are fairly drastic and I am not objecting to anything that is quite moderate.  If the inspector were to be entitled to call and ask to be permitted to interview the servant at the door, without prior notice, I do not think that I would object but he should not have the right to enter the house in this way.  I do not want to prevent inspection because I do not think that the Bill would work without inspectors.</P>

Employers will have to get copies of this Bill and almost all the provisions, so far as holidays are concerned, with regard to industrial workers, are transferred to this Bill from the previous Act where the section is repealed.

The question whether a particular form of work is industrial work does not arise under this Bill.  This Act applies to all workers except those specifically excluded and the only substantial class excluded are agricultural <Col N="755" /> workers.  While, under the 1936 Act, the question whether a particular individual was engaged in industrial, commercial or transport work might be an important one from the point of view of the employer, it does not arise under this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following motion, standing in my name and that of Senator Lynch:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the opinion of Seanad Eireann it is essential that</P>
      <P>(a)  the Government should guarantee to farmers minimum prices based on the average cost of production for all classes of agricultural produce which will allow them an adequate reward for their labour;</P>
      <P>(b)  adequate facilities should be provided for the rapid transport of agricultural produce to advantageous markets;</P>
      <P>(c)  the breaking up of ranch lands should be expedited so as to establish the maximum number of families on economic holdings;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> (d)  landless men and smallholders provided with land under the scheme of land division should be granted loans which will be free of interest charges for a period of five years, adequate to provide them with working capital, including stock, implements, seeds and manures;</P>
    <P>(e)  the agricultural community should be assured in normal circumstances of reasonable credit facilities at a nominal rate of interest to enable them market their produce to the best advantage, to meet their expenses between seasons, and to replenish stocks depleted by disease;</P>
    <P>(f)  the cost of social services not purely local in character should be borne by the Exchequer so as to relieve ratepayers of those burdens which do not conform to any scientific method of rating,</P>
    <P>and having regard especially to the present depressed condition of agriculture, Seanad Eireann registers the further opinion that long-term loans should be made available at once, free of interest, to farmers burdened with debt or unable otherwise to stock or cultivate their lands so as to re-establish the industry on an economic basis, to increase production, improve the quality of agricultural produce, and to enable the payment of fair rates of remuneration to the landholder and to the agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>This motion, Sir, is a considerable time on the Order Paper, and I am sure all in the Seanad are acquainted with its terms.  Since the motion was put down, the Government have set up a commission to inquire into agricultural conditions, and some people have an idea that, because of that, this motion should not be gone on with.  Well, it is my hope and belief that the commission will get some light or leading from this debate in this House, and I hope that those who are more closely acquainted and associated with agricultural conditions will contribute to the debate.  The motion, as put down <Col N="758" /> on the Order Paper, is the considered opinion of the Labour Party as to their ideas for the relief and help of the agricultural community in this country. The Labour Party are very concerned about the present agricultural conditions. If we are to believe the heads of the Churches, the Press, and the propaganda we see all around us, conditions are certainly very bad in rural Ireland.  The Church deplores the low rate of marriages and the consequent decrease in the birth rate.  The farmers, apparently, are adopting the weapon of the strike to call attention to their predicament.  The strike weapon is a desperate remedy, and when it is applied, it should only be applied in desperate cases.  We see on all sides an exodus from the country into the cities in Ireland and beyond Ireland.  The countryside is rapidly being depopulated of the best possible people.  They are crowding into the cities and going further afield.</P>
    <P>The idea underlying this motion is to make rural Ireland more comfortable and to ensure for the people who labour in agriculture a fairly reasonable standard of living.  Some people have said that this motion represents the ideal.  We do not claim that, but we believe that very serious action must be taken to bring a reasonable measure of comfort into the lives of the agricultural community.  This is not altogether devoid of self-preservation, because we believe that if a reasonable standard of living were available for the agriculturists the overcrowding in the cities would be enormously reduced.  At the present time we have huge numbers of unemployed people, in Dublin at any rate, and I am fairly well satisfied that that represents the condition of things in all the cities in Ireland.  Most of these people have come in here in search of work. Perhaps for a short while they get some kind of casual employment. When that is finished they join the ranks of the unemployed.  Consequently, after that they are available for and dependent on the dole and any charities they can secure.  They are crowding up the slums.</P>
    <P>At one time in Dublin it was generally believed that if a certain number <Col N="759" /> of houses were built the slum problem would be ended.  That number has been built within a time, but the slum problem remains because of the exodus from the country to the cities.  These people come in here and occupy the slums that have been evacuated by the people who became tenants of the better-class houses provided by the corporation. There is ample evidence on all sides that things are very bad in the agricultural industry.  As this country is largely, if not entirely, dependent on agriculture that makes the position worse.  We have no minerals worth talking about.  Our raw material is the land.  The exploitation of the land is capable of maintaining a great number more than we have in the country at the present time.  Those who exploit the land ought to get a better standard of living than they are enjoying.  That is the underlying motive behind this motion.  I have no very close association with agriculture.  Consequently, I cannot go into the details of it.  But looking on and taking notice of events I believe there will have to be a fairer adjustment in this country of ours if we are to get real prosperity whereby the men and women of the country will be given a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>Some people call this Utopia. Utopia is the thing aimed at.  It will never be reached.  In the opinion of the labouring people of 25 or 30 years ago, Utopia would be reached if we had eight hours' work, eight hours' play, eight hours' rest and eight shillings a day.  That would have been Utopia 25 or 30 years ago.  We have gone a long way beyond that now and we are still a long way from Utopia.  Even if the whole of this motion were adopted it would not bring Utopia to the farming community.  It would certainly bring a well deserved improvement or an opportunity of improving their condition. Some of the objects aimed at in this motion are being attempted by charitable organisations which are well worthy of support.  But this is a problem far too big for any charitable organisation.  It is essentially a job for the Government.</P>
    <P>This Government certainly has made some efforts to help the agricultural <Col N="760" /> community, but I fear their efforts have not been properly received by the agricultural community.  The marking of bulls or the fixing of prices has not done much to benefit the farmers. There are a whole lot of middle people in Ireland, retailers and so on, and they are getting far more out of agriculture than the agriculturists themselves. Then the facilities for transporting farm produce to the market could certainly be much improved.  Some people are uneasy about the taking over of the land for distribution amongst the landless men of the country.  The Labour Party do not advocate the confiscation of the land taken over from anybody.  Where land is taken over by the State for the benefit of citizens we believe reasonable compensation should be paid to the land owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is a matter for consideration.  The impression has gone abroad that the Labour Party in this matter advocate confiscation. I sincerely hope this matter will be debated without any advertence to Party, because it is a matter of fundamental importance to the future of the country to see the standard of living of agriculturists substantially improved.  We do not want our young men and our young women crowding into slumdom and congregating in the cities either at home or abroad.  Some one said here to-day that we have got a quota for our export of cattle but no quota for the export of our humans. Our people are fleeing away from natural life in the country to artificial life in factories across the water.  It is a very inhuman life, indeed, our people have to pursue in those cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another feature of this matter to which I would wish to direct attention.  We believe that there are certain charges that should be paid from the Central Funds.  The maintenance of the roads, the upkeep of mental homes and other social services should be defrayed from the Central Funds.  One sees the estimates for the roads going up.  These modern roads are eminently suitable for tourists and motorists but they are not very satisfactory to the farmer. In the frosty weather one sees horses <Col N="761" /> and cattle sliding on these roads and injuring themselves.  Yet the agriculturist has to meet the expense.  If a census were taken of the mental home for which the people of Dublin are responsible it would be found that a great number of the inmates would be first generation citizens of Dublin. Then there are the ever-increasing expenses of the boards of assistance. That is caused by the rush from the country into the city.  People from the country coming to Dublin can only get very casual employment.  Consequently we find them joining up in queues for help of all kinds.</P>
    <P>An association of employers a short time ago tried to justify their claims by complaining of the help given to agriculturists in the past.  They disparaged the claims of agriculturists. In my opinion we have acted very unfairly towards the agricultural community. On everything the farmer buys he has to pay tariffs and his costs are substantially increased. What he has to sell is sold in the open market.  Therefore his purchasing power has been substantially reduced.  Unless steps are taken and very drastic steps, too, it is clear to me that the times will steadily grow worse.  In this country our source of wealth is the land and the people explorting the land are definitely entitled to a reasonable standard of living and to a reasonable opportunity of producing wealth.  Our factories are not producing wealth.  The land produces wealth.</P>
    <P>This motion is the considered opinion of the Labour Party as to how conditions for the agricultural community should be improved and thus the general standard of living in the country improved.  One of the Senators here has a motion down for to-morrow and in that motion agriculture is mentioned in connection with Partition. On that point I just want to say this&mdash;that if we had a happy countryside in this end of Ireland; if we had the smiling, happy people that Goldsmith talked about Partition would be quickly ended.  Unless, as I said early on, drastic steps are taken to help the farmers of this country, Goldsmith will prove to be a prophet as well as a poet.  I hope this motion will get the <Col N="762" /> consideration to which it is entitled, because I know of no more important matter which could be discussed in this House.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the farming community, I have pleasure in congratulating the Labour Senators on the attitude they have taken up in this matter.  Senator Foran went over practically all the ground that a farmer supporter could cover.  On some of the matters he spoke about we might agree to differ.  In regard to (a)  I do not think we need quarrel.  In regard to (b), that is, that adequate facilities should be provided for the rapid transport of agricultural produce to advantageous markets, I would have wished that the Senator had been a little more constructive.  He mentioned that we had a commission set up to go into the agricultural question.  We also have a commission set up to go into the transport question, and I for one would have liked to have heard the Senator's views on the question of transport, particularly relating to the railways.  While this commission is sitting I hope somebody will point out to them that there are two ways in which the railways might be considerably helped.  The main one, in my opinion, is electrification.  I am not going to go into the details; I merely mention these figures.  In this year's Electricity Supply Board's Report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesParkinson" hpid="Mr. Parkinson Mr. Parkinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parkinson</NameTxt>
      <P>In this year's Electricity Supply Board Report they mentioned the fact that we generated 500,000,000 units of electricity.  Of that, 430,000,000 units were sold, leaving a balance of 70,000,000 units, and that includes a wastage of 25,000,000 units. Now, the balance of that would be <Col N="763" /> sufficient, I believe, to electrify our railways and supply power to them to run as many trains on the branch and main lines as they are running at present.  I will mention no more about that.</P>
      <P>On the question of breaking up the ranch lands, I am in absolute agreement with Senator Foran.  He advocates what we all advocate, that if a man's land is to be taken for division, he should be paid at least something approaching the market value.  At the present time it is practically confiscated. When the farmer dies, a valuer is sent down to value the land for probate duty.  Some time afterwards notice may be given that the land is to be taken over by the Land Commission, and in many cases the same man goes down to value it for the Land Commission. These two valuations are absolutely dissimilar.  That may be a legal thing to do, but it is absolutely wrong in equity.  If it is worth so much for taxation it ought to be worth just as much when it is going to be confiscated.</P>
      <P>On the question of credit for the farmers, Senator Foran recommends a Government loan free of interest or at a low rate of interest.  I differ with him there.  I think if the land of this country, which the farmers bought, and which the farmers paid for, was not vested in the Land Commission as it is at present, but revested in the real owners of the land, the farmer would have a collateral security on which he could finance himself.  The farmers of Ireland want neither pensions nor doles.  They are prepared to stand on their own feet and borrow money on their own property to stock the land, to fertilise it, and to drain it.  There is no necessity for those Government grants.  They all come out of the farmers' pocket.  The only way, the only equitable way, and what ought to be the legal way, is that the farmer should own his land.</P>

      <P>When I saw the motion on the Order Paper in the name of Senator Foran I was surprised at the generosity of the Labour Party in recommending long term loans, free of interest, to farmers.  The proposal <Col N="764" /> in this motion is more than the representatives of the farmers in the Dáil or Seanad asked for, and although I feel grateful to Senator Foran for the kindly interest he is taking in the farmers I cannot support the motion. There are clauses in the motion to which I very definitely object.  The Minister for Agriculture has set up a commission to inquire into most of the recommendations which Senator Foran has put down, and I think as Senator Foran and the Labour Party are so concerned about the farmer it is their duty to go and give evidence before that commission, which I am sure would be very much appreciated by the commission.  The one thing on which I agree with the Senator who proposed the motion is that money is urgently needed by the farmers.  I think everybody will agree with that. The farmers, through what they have suffered for the past five or six years, are in a hopeless position.  Their credit is gone.  Their capital is gone, and unless something is done to relieve their financial embarrassment there is no hope for agriculture in this country. The Government should see to it that something is done, and done quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, speaking the other night at the bankers' dinner, said that the prosperity of agriculture and a larger export of our surplus agricultural produce were essential to our very existence.  He said that building and other social services could not be carried on if we did not export agricultural produce, but still neither the Government nor anybody else seems to be inclined to tackle the situation in the way in which it should be tackled.  Many people are inclined to make little of and pay scant regard to the farmers' complaints, but I should like to remind those people of all the farmers have gone through for, I might say, the last 20 years.  Since 1914 this country has gone through a series of wars.  First we had the Great War, which raised the farmers' prices and profits to an enormous extent for a few years.  As a result of that the standard of living of the farmers and the agricultural labourers was improved. After a time there was a collapse in those prices.  In one year they collapsed more than 100 per cent., <Col N="765" /> but the cost of production did not go down.  The interest which the farmers had to pay to the banks on borrowed money was raised at that time, and that contributed to a big reduction in the profits which the farmers received during the Great War.  Indeed, their profits were nullified in the space of a few years.</P>
    <P>Next we had the war with England, and then we had the civil war, and I may tell you these wars did not help towards the prosperity of the agricultural community.  During those years also we had a number of labour wars. We had a war between two labour unions which was as disastrous as anything that occurred in this country for a long time.  They closed our ports for five months over a dispute with which the farmer had nothing to do. Two labour unions were fighting for supremacy, and they kept our ports closed for five months.  We could not export anything out of any port in Éire.  I remember at that time selling 100 fat cattle to an English exporter. The cattle were sent to Greenore, where they were kept for a week, and after that they had to be sent to Belfast, where they were kept for another week before they could be shipped, and finally they went by Ayr down to Manchester.  Their upkeep during that time cost a very considerable amount, half of which I was obliged to pay. That was my experience of the fight between the two labour unions.</P>
    <P>Incidents of that sort have brought the farmers to their present plight. Then we had the economic war, the most disastrous thing that happened since the days of Cromwell.  According to the report of the Banking Commission, in the years of the economic war our agricultural output was reduced from £63,000,000 to £44,000,000.  It has been shown that during the economic war the farmers lost more than £100,000,000, more than the amount which, it was stated, we owed to England. During those years we got very little for anything we could produce. For part of the time the skin of a dead calf was worth more than a live animal. During those years Senator Foran, who has now turned over and has such consideration for the farmers, backed up <Col N="766" /> the policy which brought the farmers to their present plight.  I suppose this is the death-bed repentance of Senator Foran.</P>

      <P>Yes, on the death-bed of the farmer.  We are told that the joint stock banks will give loans to any farmer.  I should like to tell the House that the farmers owe more money to the joint stock banks than the farmers can ever hope to repay. They cannot hope to repay even half of it.  I think the Government should do something, in conjunction with the banks, to liquidate these frozen loans. Such loans are of no use to the banks; they are getting nothing out of them, and I am sure they would be glad to compromise in some way; but the money must be found for the compromise. With conditions as they are, the farmer is more or less disinclined to put his best energies into his work. The heart is knocked out of most farmers, with those loans hanging over their heads.  They should get an opportunity of making a fresh start after all they have gone through.  In one part of the motion there is reference to the splitting up of the lands, and Senator Parkinson agrees thoroughly with the Labour Party that the lands should be split up.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am sorry if I misrepresented the Senator, but I understood him to say that he agreed with Senator Foran that the splitting up of the land was all right, if it was paid for.  I withdraw my statement.  The only cure for our economic ills, according to the Labour Party and others, is to divide the land.  I should like to know has the mover of the motion, or have the members of the Labour Party read the Banking Commission Report.  Are they aware that the Banking Commission has definitely recommended that no more land should be split up?  Are they aware that there are 500,000 applicants for land, and if all the farms in the country were divided into small holdings they <Col N="767" /> would not supply 15 per cent. of the applicants?  Are they aware that it costs £1,125, according to the Banking Commission's Report, to place a landless man on a holding, and £900 of that is a free gift?  Do they expect that the country can stand that?</P>
      <P>Would it not be a more sane proposition to place the farmers, who are on the land, and who are not able to make ends meet, in a way to carry on, instead of creating more distress?  Are they aware that by giving a holding to a landless man or a congest they will not be making him any better off than if he was an agricultural labourer with steady employment?  Senator Foran was talking about the standard of living of the agricultural labourers.  Is it the desire of the Labour Party to put every farmer on the same standard as the congest or the landless man? The splitting up of the land would mean that if you bring all down to holdings of 15 or 30 acres you will reduce every farmer to the standard of living of the congest.  If that is not their intention they should alter their proposal.  It is good electioneering propaganda to advocate the splitting up of the land, but it is dishonest for any responsible politician to raise people's hopes about getting land when they know there is not sufficient land to go round.  This talk of splitting up land and promising holdings to people at every cross-roads is doing a lot of harm, because it is creating unrest and disaffection amongst the landless men and the congests.  The sooner a stop is put to it the better. With all the talk about the condition of the farmers and the necessity for having a prosperous farming community I cannot see that, for the last three or four years and even since the economic war was ended, anything has been done to put farming in a prosperous condition.  The sooner it is done the better it will be for the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nearly becoming nauseating to me to hear all this sympathy for farmers.  God knows, I am sick of the whole thing.  I do not think that there has been an honest effort made by either the previous or the present Government to grapple seriously with the problems of the <Col N="768" /> agricultural community and their conditions, not over a period of six years but over the period of the last 15 years.  I cited in this House before that An Taoiseach, in a remarkable speech in Jury's Hotel in 1927, visualised seriously and, I am perfectly sure, honestly, the condition of the farmers then.  He said that the farmers' welfare was the nation's, and the nation's welfare was the farmers'&mdash;a great and a proper philosophy. Two or three nights ago we had that philosophy enunciated again in very definite terms by the Minister for Finance when he, too, having learned from the error of his ways, realised that the British market was the essential and fundamental market for the surplus wealth of this country and that the agricultural community or a prosperous community of agriculture was the stability on which the whole prosperity and welfare of this country was founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strong agitation was created through the country in February, I think, of 1928, by what was called the Centre Party and by some Party anterior to that particular period pointing out to the Government that derating was essential to the normal prosperity of the agricultural people and they forced the Government to set up a derating commission.  I get sick when I think of commissions.  In the old British days we heard of royal commissions and they finished, as you all know, in having achieved nothing only volumes of tireless and statistical returns, filed in the dusty archives of their offices. The derating commission came amid a flare of sympathetic trumpets and the public bodies of the country were invited to prepare evidence under various heads to submit to that commission. Those who had interest in agriculture and realised its potential worth and advantages to the whole community did prepare that evidence and submitted it to the commission. The council of which I am proud to be a member, the Limerick County Council, selected three representatives. I happened to be one, upon whom rested the responsibility of doing my best, which I did.  For nearly an hour and a half I sat before the commission pointing out the wails of the <Col N="769" /> agricultural people.  That was before the economic war.  What was the result of that commission?  It is down there in the dusty pigeon holes of the Government Departments.  The farmers got nothing.  Now another commission has been appointed and reading down the list of members we find, with all due respect to their economic distinction and pre-eminence, many professors and other people but we find very few of the common or garden working farmers selected to represent their views.  I have not much hope of that commission.</P>
    <P>I respectfully differ from my friend Senator Counihan in attacking the Labour Party.  All credit to them in submitting what they have submitted here.  At least it is something to show that they at least have sympathy with the farmers.  They, too, have awakened to the fact of how essential it is to have agriculture on a proper basis. What is wrong?  1927!&mdash;and this is 1939.  The previous Government, the present Government, the county councils, Deputies, Senators and all kinds of agitators up and down the country, all talk of the farmers but damn all is being done for them.  I use that word with all respect; it is slightly unparliamentary. Nothing is being done for them.  The present Government went out in a drive for industrial activity and we find, according to statistical returns, that 75 per cent. of the people are directly or indirectly engaged in agriculture.  They tell us we must be self-supporting and a self-contained entity, and they say that we must live, maintain and contain ourselves in the home market.  If 75 per cent. of the people in that market are in a state of penury and poverty and unable to meet their commitments how can you have a successful, prosperous, industrial revival here?  We cannot go out to Japan to sell our manufactured articles.  We cannot look to Britain with her hundreds of years of industrial activity.  We cannot look to Germany and the Czechs and those other countries that are the last word in technique in industrial activity.  We must, as has been stated by our Minister, and as every decent intelligent man understands, depend upon ourselves <Col N="770" /> if there is to be any hope for industrial prosperity in this country. But, how can you have industrial prosperity in this country if 75 per cent. of the people on whom that prosperity must depend are in a state of want and in a position that they are not able to make ends meet?</P>
    <P>I believe myself that the solution of the whole difficulty is this: The first thing that ought to be done by the Government is to scrap and do away with local government.  Give derating to the farmers&mdash;that is absolutely essential because local rates are gone beyond the capacity of the farmer to pay, and have certainly gone beyond the power and the administrative right of public bodies to control.  I remember in 1927 as a result of the Centre Party agitation they demanded that a 5/- in the £ rate in my county was as much as the farmers could bear, and ought to meet the commitments of that county, and, an extraordinary thing to tell you, in that particular year, I think it would be 1928-29, the rate in my county was in or around 5/-in the £.  On Saturday last, before we could strike a penny for general commitments there was a charge of 2/3 in the £ to meet the loans that have largely been increased to meet the advanced policy and programme of the Government over a period of six years. That is the position all over the country, but what is the remedy? Everything that the farmer has to buy, as was stated here by Senator Foran, has gone up to about 200 per cent. more than it was in 1914.  I am in a dual capacity, both a dairy farmer and tillage farmer.  Every day, of course, we get the envelopes with the Government stamp: &ldquo;Grow more wheat; grow more wheat.&rdquo; If you control the elements that might be an economic policy for the farmers.  I had two acres of wheat last year myself.  I am watching closely the dawn of every morning to see if I could get an opportunity to set a couple of acres of it again this year.  Up to the present I could not touch it and, remember, you are now facing the 1st February. Every other farmer in my locality is in practically the same position.  The elements are against him; economics <Col N="771" /> are against him, the cost of production is against him; the rates are against him and the markets have been against him.</P>
    <P>What is the remedy?  In 1914 I sold machines which then cost only £12. To-day they cost £22.  In 1914, I could have a horse shod for 2/6 for the whole set.  To-day for one horse I have to pay 7/- and, for smaller ones, 6/-.  So on, with a sickening repetition.  Everything the farmer has to buy has gone up 200 to 300 per cent., while everything he sells to-day is at pre-war level.  How can he fight against such economics as these?  Ten or 15 years ago you could get a labouring man for £17.  To-day he costs £25 and at one time his wages were as high as £40. Even so they are flying from the land and you cannot blame them.  I trust that this discussion will seriously focus the mind of the Government and the commission upon the serious position in which farmers and administrative bodies find themselves at the present moment.  I do not care whether it is a Fianna Fáil or a Fine Gael Government that is concerned; they have been all shouting from the house-tops since 1926 about the appalling condition of agriculture but they have done damn little for the Irish farmer.  You have heard speeches in this House from people dictating a policy for agriculture but they have done nothing about it.  I am sure that many of them, if they went into a farm, could not distinguish between an onion stalk and a potato stalk.  I say that you must scrap local government in this country.  You must give total derating to the agricultural community and you must do that very soon.  Never mind your commission. It will pass the way of all commissions.  It will sit here taking evidence for months upon months and nothing will come of it.  My last suggestion is that the Government should rehabilitate farmers by issuing loans on easy terms and that that should be done immediately.  What do we find to-day&mdash;those of us who sell hay or grass?  Hay was unsaleable last year. I went out four days in the week to find no one could buy hay.  No one was there but the owner of the land and the auctioneer.  I closed my book and <Col N="772" /> came away.  The result was that the hay was left lying on the land.  So it is also with grass.</P>
    <P>The grass is rotting on the land in the county I come from because the farmers cannot find the wherewithal to buy cattle to re-stock their derelict lands and to eat the grass.  I told you here on the last day&mdash;and it is a clear and definite indication of the condition of the farmers&mdash;that sometime in the early part of December my county council dismissed ten rate-collectors.  I repeat that to-day.  It was not that they had not put their best energies into the collection.  They had.  It was not that they failed to close their warrant for the year 1937 and the year 1938 which should have been closed on the 31st October.  That was not the reason that their services were terminated. Their services were terminated because they failed, because they were unable to do it, to close their warrant, for the first levy which should have been closed on the 30th April, 1938.  That is proof positive of the condition of the agricultural community in, as I said before, one of the finest counties, the most productive and the richest, in the whole of Éire.</P>

      <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for some considerable time.  It has been attacked on the ground that it is rather lengthy and of an omnibus character.  It is difficult, in dealing with a subject such as this, to be more brief than we have been.  The motion deals with many aspects of agriculture, and in our opinion, while it will not provide a remedy or cure all the ills at which it aims, still at the same time it will concentrate, we hope, a good deal of thought on the present position of agriculture here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need waste the time of the House in pointing to the great necessity for something to be done along the lines indicated in the motion. This evening two reputable members of the House, intimately conversant I am sure with agriculture, gave us their views in regard to the condition of the farmers in general.  I am quite sure, in view of the intimate knowledge which they possess, they will agree that, so far as agriculture is concerned, the remedies for it propounded in our motion are highly necessary and that something must be done immediately. One of the Senators I refer to is Senator Counihan.  He is inclined to belabour the hide of the Labour Party in regard to some of the ills which, he says, that Party was responsible for bringing on the country.  Still, I think we may say, from the context of his remarks, that he is in favour of the remedies propounded in the motion. The Senator spoke about two Labour unions fighting one another.  I presume <Col N="775" /> he was referring to an incident that took place about 16 years ago.  That was a long time to go back&mdash;to attribute to incidents of that time the depression which hangs over the agricultural industry to-day.  He said that it was the worst that occurred since the time of Cromwell.  He might with equal accuracy have gone back to the battle of Benburb.  Senator Madden, who also has an intimate knowledge of the conditions in the agricultural industry, said that it is necessary that something should be done.</P>
    <P>From my own observations I agree that something must be done, and done soon.  That is why I believe that the Commission which the Government has agreed to set up will, as all commissions are inclined to do, be rather slow in delivering its recommendations. I am of the opinion that the Government could proceed to deal with this question without the aid of any commission. Every aspect of the question must be known to them, and that being so, I agree with Senator Madden that there was no necessity for a commission. The Government without such a commission could, in my opinion, propound the remedies essential to relieve the depression in agriculture, especially amongst the smallholders who, I think, are deserving of first consideration.</P>
    <P>I believe that the ills which our agriculture is suffering from are not peculiar to this country.  If we examine the conditions in other countries we will find that agricultural conditions in them are much the same as they are here.  While naturally we are concerned with the boot which is pinching our own foot, still we should not speak of the problem before us as peculiar to this country.  Senator Johnston, speaking on a motion that was moved some months ago by Senator Counihan, dealing with particular aspects of the agricultural industry, was, I think, rather unduly scathing in his references to the industrial policy which the Governments in this country have been endeavouring to develop during the last 16 years.  Taking agriculture, he compared the position in England with the position here.  He said that over there a large industrial animal&mdash;I think he <Col N="776" /> referred to it as a mastiff&mdash;was feeding the small dog of agriculture, but that the reverse, he said, was true here. Now that may be so.  Still I hope before I sit down to show that agriculture in England is probably passing through a greater crisis at this moment than agriculture is here, difficult and all as the agricultural position is here.</P>
    <P>The Senator, speaking in regard to industrialisation, urged that we here should concentrate exclusively on a sound and sane policy with the complete absence of sentiment and humbug and historical complexes.  Now I do not know what these high-sounding and rhetorical words mean.  They seem to me to be rather meaningless.  He would also lead us to believe that we should liquidate our industrial development and concentrate exclusively on agriculture: that if we did that, we would possibly escape the difficulties confronting agriculture.  I suggest that even to please our best customer&mdash;the Senator was referring to England&mdash;or the economic theories of Trinity College, we will not be able to reverse the policy which has now been embarked upon in this country.  Therefore, the Senator seems to me to have been barking up the wrong gum tree when he talked about a reversal of the industrial engines set in motion here some years ago.  According to the Official Report, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What we really need in this country is a sound and sane national agricultural policy: a policy which will view the position of every size of farm, with a complete absence of sentiment and humbug and of historical complexes, and that will do its best to put every aspect of our farming&mdash;large scale, middle size and small&mdash;on its own economic feet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But if one reads through the whole of Senator Johnston's speech, I venture to say he will find that the Senator propounds no policy to place agriculture on what he calls its economic feet, except he means that we should entirely cease our industrial activities and concentrate exclusively on agriculture. Agriculture in other countries should be taken into consideration when we talk about agriculture here. If we do that, I think we will probably get a cooler and a more reasonable <Col N="777" /> appreciation of our problem than if we simply think that we are the sole pebble on the beach.</P>
    <P>Bernard Shaw at one time said that there were a lot of people in Ireland who thought that the world was made up of Ireland and a few minor continents.  I am inclined to think that that could be accurately applied when we come to discuss agriculture from our particular angle.  Lord Addison who was Minister of Agriculture in the British Labour Government in 1930 has, in my opinion, written a very excellent work on agriculture in England, and from a study of that work, we find that there are great difficulties confronting agriculture there.  There, as here, a large quantity of land was bought some years ago, and a type of agriculturist in England, very analogous to landholders here, increased their holdings from over 3,000,000 acres to 9,000,000 acres.  The economic slump of 1923, which continued up to 1930, and even to the present time has apparently caught out that section of agricultural holders in England.  From my knowledge of agriculture, and of the farming community here, it seems that they have been caught as well as the people in England in the depression of these years.  Speaking of that section of agricultural occupiers in England, Lord Addison's book, which was written last April, states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To expect these men to improve or repair their buildings, to provide water supplies, to drain their land, or to keep their fences in good order is to expect the impossible.  Everywhere you find their buildings in a deplorable state, roofs defective, doors broken down and the walls often affording but little shelter. The farm roads are neglected and the farm yards in wet weather are deep in slush and liquid manure; the gates are broken down, or patched up anyhow, and the fields often enough, with their vistas of weeds and rubbish, cry aloud for land drainage.  They have no money wherewith to put the place in order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the description by a Minister <Col N="778" /> of a very large section of occupiers controlling 9,000,000 acres of land in England.  It seems to me that it is a dreadful picture and could hardly find a comparison in this country.  Again, there was an outcry in England recently, which was given voice to on January 10th at Ipswich by 5,000 farmers, who were extremely vociferous in regard to agricultural conditions over there.  There was another outcry at Oxford in the previous month at which one speaker stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think it should not be beyond the capacity of our financial people to devise some means by which a very considerable sum could be available during the spring and summer of each year for our farmers, which would be more or less automatically repayable after the harvest and the hop crop and the winter markets have taken place.  A very large section of our agricultural community has not only exhausted its own working capital but has exhausted its access to credit under the present system.  If things do not improve very rapidly, insolvency is bound to follow in a very large proportion of cases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On December 10th a meeting of 3,000 farmers was held in Lincoln, at which the present Minister for Agriculture in Great Britain could hardly get a hearing, because, it was stated, he was unable or unwilling to look after the needs of the farmers there who asked for fixed prices for farm produce. The <i>Irish Times</i> in a leading article with the caption: &ldquo;Price Insurance&rdquo; had something which is rather akin to the motion before the House.  Some people may think that the motion was put down for the purposes of propaganda for our Party.  I want to say, as far as we are concerned, that that is not so.  The article stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Representatives from Northern Ireland are attending a joint conference of the English, Scottish and Ulster Farmers' Union in London. The Northern farmers' interests run parallel, for most of the way to those of their cross-Channel colleagues, and any solution which Mr. Chamberlain's Government may devise for the relief of British agriculture will <Col N="779" /> extend automatically to the Six Counties.  At present the demand is for a system of &lsquo;price insurance&rsquo;. The farmers ask that a price shall be fixed for every variety of domestic farm produce, including live stock&mdash; and that this price shall prevail for a &lsquo;long term&rsquo;&mdash;conceivably five years.  It does not follow that the price shall be the same in every locality of the United Kingdom.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is on the lines of the first paragraph of this motion, so that the House will see we are in full alignment with farmers in other portions of what was the United Kingdom, in the demand which we are making regarding agriculture. We are dealing particularly with the small class of farm holders.  It is with that class we are primarily concerned. Somebody said that we were asking for Utopia.  We do not think it so very Utopian that the Government should guarantee farmers minimum prices for agricultural produce.  We are demanding nothing more than farmers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland find they are compelled to seek.  If we are compelled by the exigencies of economic circumstances to do so in Ireland, then, similar exigencies compel people to do the same elsewhere.  In regard to the breaking-up of ranch lands, which Senator Counihan said we were advocating, I suggest to the Senator that long before the motion was put on the Order Paper this Government&mdash;and also the British Government&mdash;had embarked on the policy of breaking up ranch lands.  That may be a good, or it may be a bad policy.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with those who say that land should not be broken up into very small units, but once that policy has been embarked upon, we must accept it, just as we must accept every other fact of life.  I see no possibility now of reverting to larger holdings.  We must accept the policy of breaking up the land, and proceed to deal with that policy. Apart from giving land to landless men, something else is necessary, if they are to be enabled to work their holdings. It becomes then very largely a question of credit facilities.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter, who has a considerable <Col N="780" /> knowledge of agriculture, I notice dealt with this aspect of agriculture when giving evidence before the Banking Commission.  At page 528 of volume 1, paragraph 12, you will find the opinions of Senator Baxter in regard to providing financial facilities for these uneconomic holders and landless men.  Dealing with that he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a farmer who is just below the border line of being credit-worthy. In fairly good times loans to such men would not be a very great risk.  To-day the risk is too great for any commercial institution to take on.  Provision would have to be made for such ample reserves as would make it possible for the Credit Corporation to help these lame dogs in those cases where the borrowers were men of character who, if given a chance, would make good.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have in existence an Agricultural Credit Corporation, and, therefore, in that agency, as indicated by Senator Baxter, lies the mode and the means by which moneys could and should be made available for those who have land and who are in such a financially depressed condition as to require such assistance.  The Banking Commission in their Report have adverted to that, but if the State&mdash;and I know of no other organisation capable of coming to the assistance of the small and uneconomic holder and the landless man &mdash;if the State, as such, is not going to come to their rescue, then their position, parlous and difficult as it is to-day, it seems to me will get progressively worse.</P>
    <P>How, we might ask, as we do in the motion, are stock, implements, seeds, manures, etc., to be provided by these people who have land just merely handed to them?  I am informed that very often such people are not able to use the land, that they have to set it for grazing, and, in fact, there was in the Press a short time before Christmas a very lengthy article referring to that aspect of the breaking up of land; that many of these landless men who had secured land were unable to handle the land and that the Land Commission were thinking of taking it back from them. That is not a remedy.  If these people are to use that land, which was <Col N="781" /> the original purpose and intention of the settlement, then the only way that we can see of having that done is for the State to come to their aid.  Senator Baxter, apparently, could think of no other way, as we cannot either, than that the State should come to their aid through the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  These facilities have also been asked for by the farmers in England.  They, too, find that they are unable to deal with their problem except they are facilitated in this manner.</P>
    <P>In regard to transport, I do not propose to discuss railway transport in reference to this matter.  A tribunal is also inquiring into that aspect of economic life and I presume that it will deal, perhaps in a subsidiary way, with agriculture from the point of view of transport.  But it seems to me that we will have to develop something entirely new in regard to our agriculture if we are to sustain it, not alone sustain it over periods of crisis from which it suffers, especially after great wars, but something that will come to the aid of agriculture in a permanent, stable, and organic way. Lord Addison, in dealing with this aspect of the question, also says, in regard to agriculture in England, that something on the lines suggested is necessary, although he, like Senator Johnston, does not propound in detail the scheme which he considers necessary to sustain the agriculturists in England, especially the smallholders. It seems to me that no method which is not an all-embracing method, going to the foundations of the problem, will ever be successful.</P>
    <P>We have had piecemeal attempts, like the one we had here last year when Senator Counihan put down a motion for the subsidisation of fat cattle.  That was a piecemeal endeavour to sustain a small portion of the agriculturists, and, in my opinion, while it might be good for that particular portion, it was nothing in the nature of an effective, fundamental, or permanent remedy.  We will have to think of agriculture from the standpoint of the paragraph set forth here. In the first, we ask for guaranteed prices.  As I said, our colleagues in</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> Great Britain are similarly asking for guaranteed prices.  Agriculture has been brought to a great state of success in New Zealand, and there guaranteed prices have been given for agricultural produce.  It is only natural that a farmer should be assured of his income, as other sections of the community are assured of their incomes. If he knew in advance what he was to be paid for his produce, it would produce that stability which is lacking. That is one item which would help very greatly towards this end&mdash;the guaranteeing of prices for farm produce.</P>
    <P>The question of transport is one which is somewhat difficult to deal with.  When I was saying that agriculture should be dealt with by something fundamental, I was thinking rather of something in the nature of an economic scheme which might be worked under a special commission, which would take from the farmer his produce and return to him those goods which he has to use domestically and otherwise. I see no reason why, if we have post offices and police barracks in every city, town and village, we should not also have an economic store, a co-operative organisation, run under the ægis of the State and the farming community, which would provide transport, take the goods from the farmer and return to him those things which he requires.  With the prices guaranteed, I should also go so far as to suggest that production should be nominated in advance, and that each farmer should be informed of the type of goods, and the quantity, etc., which he should produce.  Through an economic scheme of that character, with credit facilities provided by the State, you would do something fundamental to lift agriculture out of the depression in which it is at the moment.  I do not think that there is anything novel in the suggestions I am putting forward.  While many people may look upon this scheme as extremely extravagant at the present time, a day will come when some system of the character I have adumbrated will have to be introduced.</P>
    <P>We have heard from Senator <Col N="783" /> Madden and others here to-night that the poverty, privation and destitution in the country is bound inevitably to get worse.  Farmers isolated on their holdings are not in a position, by virtue of their occupation, to organise in the sense that urban communities have organised and will organise for the purpose of protecting their interests.  Consequently, they are at the mercy of factors and others who can take their produce off their hands and give them whatever they like. The middlemen can organise in rings to fix prices and it has been known in this country and other countries that these rings have secured from farmers their produce at the smallest possible price and an hour or so afterwards sold that produce at 500 per cent.  or 600 per cent.  of an increase. If challenged, I can give evidence of that.  We are told that we did not give evidence before the commission of inquiry into these matters.  There is time to do that yet.  What we are saying here will be on public record and any member of the commission who desires to ascertain our views will only have to look up the records.  We do suggest that, unless prices are guaranteed and farmers are told where they stand, unless something is done co-operatively to market the goods they produce and rid them of rings, the position will be infinitely worse than it is.</P>
    <P>With regard to paragraph (f) of the motion, it has often been suggested that main roads might be taken from the control of county councils.  I myself was a member of Cork County Council for many years and listened frequently to discussions of this character relating to main roads and mental hospitals.  It was often suggested that these two services might be handed over to a central authority. Senator Madden suggested that the local control should be destroyed altogether. I should not go so far as that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the whole system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>He suggested that the whole system might be revised.  If <Col N="784" /> main roads were handed over to the central authorities, they might be more economically worked.  Mental hospitals might also lend themselves, as institutions, to central control.  If these were handed over to a central authority, the ratepayers would, undoubtedly, be relieved, and the farmers, of course, constitute a large section of the ratepayers.  That might require complete reorganisation, as indicated by Senator Madden.  The Senator also referred to the price of the commodities which the farmer must buy and the price of the commodities he has to sell.  I shall not vouch for the accuracy of his figures but there is a very great disparity between these two prices and that is, probably, contributing largely to the problem which we are discussing here this evening&mdash;how to level up and bring about some form of equipoise.  I do not think that can be done without some organisation of a co-operative character such as I have outlined this evening.</P>
      <P>If prices were guaranteed, if a co-operative organisation were in existence and if credit facilities were provided, it would lift these people out of the dead level in which they find themselves at the moment.  If the producers could get over their inertia by some such scheme, then I think there would be some hope for this depressed community. Outside the recommendations in this motion and what has been said in support of them, I do not know what can be done for the farming community and I am thinking particularly of the smallholder and the landless man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proposing to say only very few words upon this motion.  I cannot feel that it is worth while to go deeply into the proposals offered for our consideration for two reasons&mdash;(1) because the proper place for discussing such matters will be the Agricultural Commission, now that one has been created, and (2) because there is one flagrant omission in the otherwise excellent speeches&mdash;if I may say so&mdash;of Senators Foran and Lynch. That is, that neither of them has given us even the faintest vestige of an idea <Col N="785" /> as to how these proposals could be financed.  It would seem to me that this country would need to be enormously richer than it is and that the position of the Exchequer would have to be enormously easier than it is if the proposals here set forth were to be carried out.  One statement was made by Senator Foran in his opening remarks to which I would like to call attention because this statement is constantly repeated in speeches.  I found myself in agreement with 99 per cent. of what he said, but one remark that caught my attention, as a repetition of a popular fallacy, was that by the further dividing up of lands we should greatly increase the population that could be maintained on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that is in contradiction with the views of the Banking Commission. I am not going to say that that Banking Commission were necessarily infallible, but they went into the subject very carefully, and that is in contradiction with their views.  Yet, it has been repeated over and over again by most respectable persons throughout all the period that I have been in politics here, and long before, as if it were an undeniable truth that this country could support a far larger population than it has at present.  It is no new thing, either.  It has been a habit for a century to say that kind of thing.  I remember reading a passage of Thomas Davis, at a time when the population of this country was 8,000,000, in which he maintained that, instead of being 8,000,000, it ought to be something between 40,000,000 and 50,000,000.  And so on down the years; the population has decreased, but whatever figure it has been at it has always been the patriotic practice to say with complete confidence that this country could comfortably support a far larger population than it has.  I remember hearing the Taoiseach suggesting in the Dáil on one occasion that the proper population of this country was something like 17,000,000. I took the liberty of jumping up on that occasion and asking him would he be kind enough to elaborate on just how he arrived at that figure.  He took the interruption with something less than his customary courtesy and refrained from giving any explanation, <Col N="786" /> or any figures, or any indication as to what his calculation was based upon.</P>
    <P>I think the time has come when we should not make statements of that sort&mdash;which, if true, are important&mdash; without going deeply into them, and that certainly the time has come when it should not be regarded as a truism that by dividing up lands or any other method we can enable this country to support a far larger population than it has.  Consequently, if Senator Foran really had any basis for his statement &mdash;if he has arrived at it by thought and calculation&mdash;I hope very much that in his reply on the motion he will put the House in possession of the grounds that led him to make that statement.</P>
    <P>There is an allusion in the motion to ranches, and once again I venture to put the question: what is a ranch? I know that a ranch is something wicked, but beyond that I have not been able to discover what it is.  Is it a question merely of size?  Does the Labour Party, or any other Party, denounce a farm merely because it is big, if it is giving its full proportion of employment and if it is achieving its full proportion of production?  If not, I wish they would say so.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, is it all right to have quantities of small holdings that have been turned into agricultural slums?  Is it quite satisfactory if multitudes of small holdings are not being made the best of, or are not giving the full employment they might give, or not giving the full production they might give?  If it is not satisfactory, I wish again that Labour leaders and others would say so instead of going on with this easy and ambiguous talk about ranches, assuming that the remedy for our agricultural ills is to get rid of everything that is on a big scale.  Whether the farm on a big scale is being worked well or is being worked badly would seem to make no difference.</P>
    <P>Apart from that query, and also my question about population and the question as to how it is proposed that these suggestions should be financed, I have no questions to ask, but I should like to take the opportunity of congratulating Senators Foran and Lynch on the attention which they are devoting to this subject and on the <Col N="787" /> very serious and objective speeches which they made in introducing their motion.  It is true that one cannot forget that their hands are still red with the farmers' blood, and I am quite prepared to accept Senator Lynch's assurance that this motion is not brought in for propaganda purposes. I believe rather that it is brought in as a most welcome token of contrition and repentance for the share they have had in the events of the last few years.  It is perfectly true that farming is in a bad way in other countries.  It is perfectly true that farming is in a bad way in England, but it is also beyond dispute that farming would be in a far better way here than it is had it not been for the unfortunate, prolonged incident known as the economic war.  I must say that, sometimes, if I were to judge by speeches of members of the Fianna Fáil and Labour Parties, I would suppose that the settlement of the economic war has been a frightful blow to the farmers, because the account they give of farming conditions now that the economic war is over is very much more unfavourable than the account they used to give when the economic war was in progress.  It was with a very odd feeling that I listened to speeches like Senator Foran's, containing a large number of indisputably true statements that I, like many others, have made a thousand times from platforms all through the country and that, up to a few months ago, or up to a year ago at any rate, would have been hotly disputed by anybody upon the Government Benches.</P>
    <P>Now, Senator Lynch takes Senator Counihan to task for the doubts that he expressed about the policy of breaking up lands.  He says that we have got to face facts, and that the policy that is here has got to stay.  Now, of course, it is true that we cannot undo what has been done, and I, personally, feel as intensely as anyone could the enormous difficulty of reversing such a policy, upon which so many hopes had been based, as the policy of continued sub-division of land in this country.</P>
    <P>It is difficult, but while we cannot undo the past we can change the <Col N="788" /> future to some extent and we must not assume, I submit, that the sub-division of land is to go on through this country <i>in sxcula, in sxculorum,</i> whatever the experts may think and whatever the Agricultural Commission may find about it.  It is a subject of immense difficulty and of immense importance. I agree that the political side of it has got to be considered as well as the economic side.  But do not let us be so defeatist as to say that whatever evidence is laid before the Agricultural Commission, we cannot, in any case, consider any change in the future in the policy of the sub-division of land.  It may be that we shall have to stop, that we are not to go on for ever churning up and churning up the land system of this country and making new distributions.  In that connection, too, I would suggest to Senator Lynch who has been urging that more financial facilities should be given to landless men to acquire land &mdash;that in these days the question of skill has got to be taken into serious consideration.  We are under the imperative necessity of improving our farming technique all over the country if we are, not merely to increase production and to increase our exports as we wish to do, but even to maintain them.  We are up against the competition of other countries where farming technique is higher than our own and where it is constantly improving.  That is one of the elements that have to be considered in the question of sub-division and re-allotment of land, namely you have got to say that so far as possible the land will be in the hands of men who have the energy, the knowledge and the skill to put it to good use.</P>

      <P>On a point of correction, Deputy MacDermot challenges me with regard to the breaking up of ranch lands and he wants our definition of what ranches are.  I want to say that I made it quite clear that we accept that policy and that we had to accept the facts of life.  We have no definition about ranch land.  The Government is dealing with this question of ranches and there is no necessity to ask me or my colleagues for any further definition <Col N="789" /> of it.  In regard to the motion I am glad Deputy MacDermot accepts in good faith our statement that it is brought on here without any political bias in any shape or form&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not suppose there is an item in this motion that everyone of us would not be very glad to see put in force.  The only thing troubling all of us is how is it going to be financed.  One of the speakers here to-night&mdash;I think it was Senator Madden&mdash;told us that the Local Government Department should be scrapped, and that the charges now being borne by the local ratepayers should be put on the Central Fund. Another Senator told us that the main roads of the country should be carried on the Central Fund.  In other words, everything has to be borne by the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather startled by the proposition made by Senator Lynch, and, I take it, seriously made, that one of the principal ways of relieving the farmers would be by the establishment by the Government of a co-operative organisation that would buy the farmers' produce and sell him all he needs.  At the moment I happen to be resident in a small town in Ireland. Anyone familiar with the economic condition of the small Irish towns will agree that they are already in the way of being wiped out.  If Senator Lynch's motion is accepted, and all the farmers' business is to be done by a co-operative organisation, what is to become of the shopkeepers in the small towns?  Who is going to pay the income-tax, and who is going to provide the other revenues that the State will need to finance this relief for the farmers?  God knows we have got enough already in the way of <Col N="790" /> co-operative associations so far as the shopkeepers down the country are concerned. If the shopkeepers are to be wiped out, and all trade is to be carried on between the State and the farmer, where are the taxes to come from?</P>

These suggestions are admirable, but when Senators stand up here and say that all these services are to be paid for by the Central Fund, I am entitled to ask whence is the Central Fund to get the money?  I believe that Senator Madden is himself a resident in a country town, and if Senator Madden's business is to be wiped out, and the business of every other shopkeeper in the country is wiped out, where is the State to get the money from for the purpose of carrying out these services?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the bulk of it was got from the shopkeepers who are now to be wiped out.  But if the shopkeepers are no longer there where is the money to come from?  Let us face facts.  This is all a question of money.  We are asked to guarantee farmers a minimum price.  Does it strike anybody here that that has already been done?  Minimum prices have been fixed for wheat and other varieties of corn.  Minimum prices have been fixed for milk and other things.  There are not very many more things left for which minimum prices can be guaranteed.  Prices for agricultural produce are based on world prices.  If the Irish farmers had to sell many of their products at world prices they would be much worse off than they are.  In many respects the farmers are being subsidised and it is the shopkeepers and the rest of us who are subsidising them.  But for these subsidies what price would the farmer be getting for his milk for the past couple of years? <Col N="791" /> What price would he be getting for his butter?  Yet a great deal of the talk here this evening seems to have been based on the assumption that nothing has been done for the farmers.  A great many things have been done for the farmers.  I stand here against the suggestion that the rest of us must be wiped out for the further benefit of the farmers.  We are anxious to do what we can for them.  It has been said that the farmers are the backbone of the country.  So they are and there is not a Senator in this House who is not anxious to do all he can for them. But there is no use in asking the Government to do impossible things. We ask the Government to do all it possibly can and we hope it will do all it possibly can.  We are not going to ask them to do the impossible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which I spoke here on agriculture I opposed the idea of the setting up of the Agricultural Commission and I gave my reasons for so doing.  But now that the commission has been set up I wish it every success and I hope it will find a solution.  In this document before us I agree that there are many suggestions to which I hope the commission will give serious consideration. If Senators Foran and Lynch were able to achieve all that they suggest in this motion and give the workers on the land an adequate reward for their labour, the whole problem of agriculture would at once be solved.  We would have no flight from the land to-day if the farmers were able to get a living on the land; the farmers are entitled to a living on the land.  The farmer is as much entitled to a living as the industrialist, the shopkeeper or anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it must be admitted that if a man is engaged in any business, and if he has his money sunk in that business, he is entitled at least to the cost of production, and in production I would like to remind everybody that in the farmer's cost of production such things as rates, labour, rent, and so on, should be included.  If we are ever going to make agriculture a success in this country, and get the people to stay <Col N="792" /> on the land, the farmers must get that adequate price for their products.  That is the whole solution.</P>
    <P>Like Senator MacDermot and Senator Goulding, I am still at a loss to see how we are going to achieve that, and I do not see that it can be altogether achieved by a guaranteed price.  I do not see how the Government can give a guaranteed price in all cases.  We farmers are getting a very good lesson from our friends the Irish trade unionists; we should leave politics out of our organisation, and organise our industry on the lines on which they have organised.  We should organise it on some kind of vocational lines; when I say &ldquo;vocational&rdquo; I mean vocational inside agriculture.  We have an example of it from the Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Association and other such organisations, which during the last few months have proved they are able to do things.  If we could get our farmers organised on similar lines, I think we could very shortly achieve many of the things for which we are looking.  Everywhere we go we hear expressions of sympathy with the farmers, and we are told they are entitled to a better show than they are getting, but immediately we succeed in getting a better price for anything we have an outcry about the cost of living.  I should like to say here and now that if we are going to get this adequate price which Senator Foran and Senator Lynch are anxious to get, the cost of living will have to increase.  We farmers have always been put in the position that anywhere we go we have to pay what we are asked for our purchases, while for anything we have to sell we have to take what we are offered.</P>
    <P>With reference to paragraph (b) of this motion I think we are all agreed. We all want better transport, but, as there is some sort of inquiry into that matter, I suppose we had better wait and see what is the result.  Personally, I am in favour of paragraphs (c) and (d).  I agree with Senator Parkinson that it has always been the policy of every national movement in this country to divide up the ranches and put more people on the land.  I do not know whether Senator Counihan is <Col N="793" /> here or not, but I certainly do not see how he works out the suggestion that putting more people on the land means we are going to bring everybody down to 15 or 20 acres.  Personally, I believe that 20 acres is too little for anybody, and I am not in agreement with the Land Commission in giving 20 acres.  I think they should give at least 30 acres, but I also hold that too large a holding is just as uneconomic as too small a holding.  Senator MacDermot has left the House, but he wants to know what is a ranch.  I think many of us in this country know well what we mean by a ranch.  There were days when not only hundreds, but thousands of acres of land were under one or two people who employed nobody.  To-day we can point out men all over the country with less than 100 acres who are employing three, or four or five people, while in other places men with 400 or 500 acres of land do not employ as many.  Those are the things that are wrong.  Surely when we find that we have one-third of the total population of this country living on the worst land in Ireland, on the western seaboard, on the hills of Donegal and in West Cork, there is something wrong.  In my own county, as I think I stated here before, we have 13,000 valuations.  Of those, 9,000 are under £15; another 1,000 are under £20, and certainly 2,000 out of the remaining 3,000 would not be high valuations.  Somebody said here some years ago that one-third of the people were living on two-thirds of the land, while two-thirds of the people were living on one-third of the land.  While that goes on, we will neither have prosperity in the country nor in agriculture. I certainly agree that something should be done on the lines suggested in paragraphs (c) and (d).</P>
    <P>With reference to the next item, I agree that as far as credit facilities are concerned, they are absolutely necessary.  Of course, I realise, as Senator Goulding has said, that the Government cannot cover everything. I am not one of those people who believe that the economic war did all the harm about which we are told.  It did undoubtedly affect a very important branch of agriculture, the cattle industry, but it did not to any great <Col N="794" /> extent affect the rest of agriculture. For the last ten or 12 years agriculture in this country has been suffering from world depression, but things have undoubtedly improved.  In this city 10 years ago, if you went into the average man's house, you would probably find him eating American bacon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I certainly do agree that the whole local government system has reached a stage when it should be revised, but I would not in any way abolish local control by the people elected in each county, or whatever the areas are.  I am not an enthusiast about derating.  I do not think it is going to cure our ills.  I know that in the Six Counties there was a deputation to the Minister for Agriculture, a gentleman who figures very much in the Press, and the farmers told him that derating was no good to them; that it was practically useless and benefited them only to a very little extent.  I do not say I am in agreement with that, but I think it should be borne in mind that there are many services the cost of which it is not fair to ask the ratepayers to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very many services for which the general taxpayer should pay, and which should be taken over into the National Exchequer.  If we do that, and tighten up on our local <Col N="795" /> administration, I think we could carry on local government as successfully as our fathers carried it on since local government was introduced in this country.  I also agree that, as far as possible, long term loans should be given.  I have to agree that it is very hard to achieve all those things, but we would all like to achieve them, and that is why I said at the beginning that I think most of the suggestions here would be matters to which the Agricultural Commission which is now functioning should give very careful consideration.  I certainly congratulate my friends in the Labour Party on bringing this motion forward.  I think it serves a very useful purpose, and I can assure Senator Foran and Senator Lynch that they will have a stout supporter in getting those adequate prices for our produce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem facing the agricultural community, and I do not think we can take that problem apart from the national life and examine it by itself.  We must examine how the position of agriculturists affects the community as a whole and see what we will do in respect of the agricultural section which will react on the entire community.  When the present Government came into office I think they quite honestly set themselves out to rehabilitate agriculture, but whether they succeeded or not in the methods they adopted is a matter that has to be reconsidered.  They set themselves out to give guaranteed prices and it is well worth considering whether the guaranteed prices had the effect that they thought they would have.</P>
      <P>While it is quite true there has been increased production in the matter of wheat and some other grain crops, it is also equally true that there has been a drop in the production of roots and other such products.  I will argue from my knowledge of my own county and, whilst it may not be necessary to make a case that there is an agricultural problem at the present time, it may be no harm to mention a few figures with reference to the position to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1934 there were 1,720 acres of <Col N="796" /> wheat grown in Clare, and in 1936 there were 2,324 acres.  The total corn crops grown in 1934 covered 10,734 acres and in 1936 there were 11,457 acres.  That showed an increase since 1934 of 272 acres, an increase in grain crops, while there was a reduction of 762 acres in root crops. It is difficult to estimate whether the increase in the grain crops has more than cancelled the reduction in the root crops.  The total area under crops and pasture in 1934 was 567,591 acres, and in 1936 the area was 540,356 acres, a reduction of 27,235 acres in two years.</P>
    <P>In passing, it is as well to remark that there is in the statistical returns &mdash;in the last column&mdash;a table showing the amount of lands given as &ldquo;other lands&rdquo;, and these in a footnote are described as woods, plantations, etc. I find that the amount of that land has increased in three years by 27,235 acres.  Has that passed out of production, gone back to waste, or is it planted?  I have serious doubts that it is planted.</P>
    <P>My friend Senator Madden suggested derating as a cure for the position of the farmer.  I do not at all agree that derating is likely to bring about the results Senator Madden indicates.  If we were to have complete derating, out of 15,717 holdings, 11,908 would get less than £10 a year as a result of total derating.  Out of 375,764 holdings, only 278,023 would also get less than £10, assuming an average agricultural rate of about 10/-in the £.</P>
    <P>I am endeavouring to estimate what is the value of the Government's policy in respect of guaranteed prices of wheat and its reaction upon grain crops and cattle production.  The total cattle population in 1934 was 4,086,308, and the cattle population in 1936 was 4,014,035, showing a drop of 72,273 animals.  The total agricultural output is given at £40,536,000, and that works out at something like £2 6s. 0d. per acre.  I think anybody who looks up the abstract of statistics&mdash;an excellent book, available in the Library&mdash; will clearly see that there is an agricultural problem, but whether it is by giving guaranteed prices or not that <Col N="797" /> we are going to solve it is a matter for consideration.</P>
    <P>Whether the Government's policy has had a sufficient trial to be able to say that the guaranteed prices they have given for wheat have reached their maximum effect is a matter for serious consideration.  That it has been productive of extreme good in a great many cases is a rather doubtful statement. Where I think the Government made a mistake in respect of its subsidising policy and its guaranteed price is this, that it made its policy of wheat production too general.  There are some areas in the country that will not grow wheat or where, if it is grown, it will not ripen.  That means that in those areas it cannot be produced economically.  At the same time, while you are asking the small farmer, the type of man with a valuation running up to £10, to pay towards the increased cost of subsidies and guaranteed prices, you are giving him nothing in return.</P>
    <P>I am speaking now with an intimate knowledge of the farming conditions in County Clare.  I know that county is admirably suited as a young cattle-rearing area.  There are similar districts in Cork, Kerry and other places.  While the Government have said in a broad, general way: &ldquo;Grow wheat and increase the productivity of the country,&rdquo; they have not taken into consideration that there are large areas which cannot do that, and while these people are paying towards the cost of the guaranteed prices in the good lands of Laoighis, Offaly, Limerick, Tipperary and elsewhere, you are giving them nothing in return.  I think there ought to be some kind of regional policy adopted by the Government, so that they can decide to encourage wheat production where it is going to be an economic proposition.  They could set aside various regions where the people would be able to grow wheat, and they could arrange those regions with the assistance of the departmental experts, and from the information available in the Department. While you are encouraging wheat production in these areas, it would not be quite fair to allow them to go into competition with the people who are depending almost entirely on young cattle production, without giving <Col N="798" /> those in the small cattle-producing areas something in return, something to make up what they lost in cattle production.</P>
    <P>So far as the distribution of ranch lands is concerned, there can be no doubt whatever that it will aim at increased production.  If we are going to say that £2 6s. or £2 10s. is the average production per acre of land in this country, we have a very poor estimate of the value of the land.  When Senator MacDermot says he does not know what a ranch is, he must have been very far from the realities of things in this country during the last 20 years.  Everybody knows that in the mind of the average person a ranch is land that is not worked up to the average productive capacity by whoever holds it and to some extent is deliberately withheld from its average productive capacity.  I do know thousands of acres of land that are not worked up to the average productive capacity and that the distribution of that land and handing it over to people who are prepared to use it would probably increase the productivity of the wealth of this country enormously.  I cannot say to what extent it would increase it.</P>
    <P>Credit facilities are, of course, absolutely necessary.  It is quite true to say that the joint stock banks are not giving the farmers any credit at the present time.  They will not take land as security nor will they even take land with collateral security in order to advance money and, if one wants to go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for an advance, one must be in the position of not wanting the loan in order to get it.  That is exactly the position.  I know perfectly well that unless you have your rates paid, unless you have your annuities paid, unless you have your shop debts paid, unless you are perfectly free from any kind of debt, there is no chance of getting any grant from the Agricultural Credit Corporation. Therefore, some opportunity must be given to the farmer to get credit and I believe that is the one point where the Government can do effective work or rather the two points&mdash;first, in respect of their policy, in not making it a flat policy in respect of all the <Col N="799" /> State, and secondly, in securing that adequate credits would be afforded for the small farming community.</P>
    <P>There is another matter&mdash;the cost of social services.  Although I quite agree that national facilities should not be made a local charge as they are in a great many cases at the present time&mdash;for instance it is made a local charge in respect of roads though you have motor cars from Dublin and Limerick running over roads in Meath and elsewhere&mdash;I have a very serious doubt that the cost of those things might be put upon the wrong shoulders.  I would like to know before I would in any general terms agree to taking the maintenance of these roads and mental hospitals off the local person who has properly to meet those charges whether they are going to be put upon the breakfast table of the people or where they are going to be put.  I do know that local authorities should not have to bear the cost of national facilities.  In the main, I think everybody will agree that there is a necessity for consideration of the position, but that consideration should be given upon two or three main lines&mdash;first, regional consideration of the Government's policy in respect of its guaranteed prices and in respect of its policy as to wheat and beet growing and other things, that those districts which are not capable of economically producing beet because of their distance from the factories, or economically producing wheat because of their exposed position, ought not be put in competition with districts that are capable of producing these things economically and that they would be subsidised for what they are capable of producing. Secondly, that before we take off local authorities the maintenance of mental hospitals and roads and such things we should know where the taxation for the maintenance of these things is to come from.  Thirdly, that long-term loans should be granted.  This is where the Government can get to work immediately if they take it in hands.  They could give money at a cheap rate of interest to enable farmers to put their land into commission.  There is no good in imagining that a farmer can meet all his liabilities.  The margin <Col N="800" /> between his competency to meet his liabilities and his incompetency to do so might be one milch cow and if he has not that one milch cow he is incapable of meeting his commitments. That is where the Government can step in and do so immediately.  There is no good in waiting for the commission to report.  The problem is there and the Government is there to face it, and I think it ought to be done immediately.</P>

As it is getting late I do not propose to delay the Seanad too long but, at the same time, I wish to direct a few remarks to the speeches that have been made here to-night.  I think we all have heard the old saying of spurring a free horse or pushing an open door and I suggest to you, Sir, and I suggest to the Senators here that, as far as the present Government are concerned, that is exactly what we are doing here to-night&mdash;spurring a free horse and pushing an open door&mdash;as I will endeavour to show in a few minutes. Before doing so I wish to refer to some of the statements made here during the night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I saw Senator Parkinson standing up here I certainly expected to hear something tangible at all events as regards the condition of the farmers.  There is a cause for everything. Tá fáth le gach nídh, mar deirtear sa nGaedhilg.  There is a cause for everything and we should first endeavour, if possible, to find out what the cause is.  I suggest that one of the causes at all events of the condition of the farmers at the present time is the change over from horse traffic to mechanised traffic in this country. When I saw Senator Parkinson standing up, knowing as I do that he has been very keenly, closely and successfully associated with horse flesh I thought he would lay stress upon that matter but instead of laying stress upon that matter he spoke of the electrification of railways, etc.  Some 40 years ago, a Chathaoirligh, you and I well remember in this city that <Col N="801" /> every yard had a smart, tidy, lovely hackney horse doing hackney work. You also remember when every doctor in Merrion Square had his carriage and pair with a footman and coachman sitting in front of him.  Senator Foran should also remember perfectly well when the commercial people of this city had their horses to do their transport.  So that there was a big horse population in Dublin at that time.  We all realise that that big horse population gave employment to the farming community throughout the country.  The farmer who bred the foal and bred the horse got something out of it.  He had to grow the corn and save the hay that fed those animals. Everybody was associated with the horse.  Every penny spent on the horse was spent in this country.  All classes of expert, skilled tradesmen were employed working after the horse&mdash; the wheelwright, the coachbuilder, the cartwright were employed.  Instead of all that employment in this country now we have in most cases the foreign motor car, the foreign lorry, foreign tyres, foreign petrol and foreign lubrication. I suggest to Senator Parkinson that if he applied himself to that aspect of the situation he would be much more in touch with the present condition of the farming community.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan felt that it would be unwise to break up the land into small farms.  It is true that it possibly is unwise to break up the ranches into farms that would be too small.  We would possibly only be creating a very poor class of people such as we have along the Western seaboard whose offspring might have to go off to foreign countries.  I suggest it would be wiser to give a reasonable farm on which a farmer could live in comfort rather than have a great number of very poor farmers.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at Senator Madden, who told us here recently that he had very long experience of public life, which I believe he has, telling us that he was in favour of derating, and that he was in favour of scrapping the local government organisation.  Suppose that derating did take place, where would all the finances come from to carry on the local public services? <Col N="802" /> There are local public services that must be carried on.  The poor of the country must be looked after in the county homes.  Relief must be provided for those who require relief.  I would not mind if it was somebody who had only short association with public life who advocated these things, but when a man with long association with public life tells us that he is in favour of derating and in favour of scrapping the local government system, I cannot see eye to eye with him at all.</P>
    <P>Let us see exactly what the Government are doing at the present time. There are three things necessary for life&mdash;food, clothing, and shelter.  Unquestionably, the present Government are endeavouring to see that the food the people require is produced at home. Senator Hogan gave the House some statistics with regard to the increase in wheat production in Clare.  Wheat is now being grown in almost every county.  In years gone by, when we were depending on the ranches, we were only supposed to grow a fort-night's supply of food in wheat.  We are now able to supply almost all our own requirements in wheat and flour. There was a smile when somebody referred to the fact that in years gone by we were eating foreign bacon. Surely nobody will deny that was so. The term applied to it was &ldquo;a bit of the lad&rdquo;.  Now the farmers are guaranteed that the bacon eaten in this country will be produced here.  So far as clothing is concerned we have our own mills producing all that we require. We get the wool from the sheep on the hills in Clare and Wicklow, Kerry and from the low lands of Roscommon, and as regards shelter, are we not endeavouring to supply good houses for our people?  Not only are we building houses, but we are producing the material required for their construction. We have gone so far in that direction that we now have cement factories producing cement in Limerick and Drogheda.  Brickworks have been opened in many parts of the country, the latest being in Kingscourt, in County Cavan.  Therefore, in a short time we will be able to produce all the cement and bricks we require for our housing schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> The Forestry Department is working hard to make up for the neglect of forestry in this country for years. Young forests are being planted in many parts of the country.  The Department is doing its best to provide a sufficient supply of young plants and trees from its nurseries.  Therefore, so far as the Government is concerned, it is not a question, so far as this motion is concerned, of spurring a free horse or pushing an open door.  The Government are certainly doing their best to try to meet all the requirements of the country, and to provide employment for the people.  I thought we would have heard something to-night that might help the Government to deal with the grievances complained of.  It is a very easy thing to offer adverse criticism, but it is not so easy to be constructive in your criticism. While I am glad that this motion has been tabled by the Labour representatives, it is no harm to point out that the matters it deals with have already received the attention of the Government, and that a commission has been set up to consider the agricultural position.  That commission will address itself to the question as to what can be done for the farmers.  In conclusion, I want to say that in my opinion the present Government are doing their level best to meet the grievances complained of.</P>
