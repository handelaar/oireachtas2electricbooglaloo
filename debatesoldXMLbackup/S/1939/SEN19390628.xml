    <P>Government amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>

      <P>In Special Committee, a certain amendment was carried which, although not exactly as I would have wished, I undertook to have examined with a view to seeing if it could be <Col N="1784" /> made more acceptable to the administration. I think that if these slight amendments were made in the amendment, as adopted by the Special Committee, it would be quite workable. It is proposed, in the first instance, to delete from the amendment as passed by the Special Committee the words &ldquo;constructed or being maintained.&rdquo;  I was advised that these words would make the provision rather difficult to administer.  By removing these words, the provision is left very wide.  I do not think that any Senator would have any objection to the deletion of these words.  My remarks would also apply to amendment No.3.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 16, Section 29, sub-section (1), to delete the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in line 3 and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is necessitated by an oversight of mine in drafting the proposal which I put before the Special Committee.  I overlooked the wording of the original section.  After we had heard the debate at the Special Committee, we realised that it would be advisable to substitute the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; by &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  The Minister made it quite clear on a number of other points that, if decisions were left to him, he would be placed in an extremely uncomfortable position. That might be brought about in the present instance and, if we put in the word &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; the Minister will have no option but to rectify matters in connection with these particular weirs. It is not necessary to go deeply into the question but, for the information of the members of the House who were not present at the Special Committee, I may explain that the reason for the amendment was simply to ensure that henceforth there would be an open passage at all times for fish, through obstructions in the river, to the upper waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for the amendment has arisen by reason of the fact that, although in the year 1863 the British <Col N="1785" /> authorities made an attempt by law to correct abuses which had been going on for generations, means have been found since then to render the legislation, in certain circumstances, entirely and absolutely abortive, to the great disadvantage of other users of the river and of fishermen.  This is an excellent opportunity to do away with these abuses, which have been kept going by large interests amply supplied with money as against the conservators. I hope the House will agree to make this small alteration in the amendment that was passed a fortnight ago after very careful and extremely friendly discussion.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cupla focal do rá ar an leasú so.  I was recently in County Kerry and some members of the Board of Conservators of the Roughty river called attention to the fact that within the past few years a weir had been constructed at the confluence of the Awbeg and Roughty rivers.  The Roughty is a prominent fishing river, and naturally the people in the district object to a weir being constructed across it for the purpose of obstructing the free passage of fish.  We all know that weirs are constructed for certain purposes, such as to provide water for turning mills but, on the Roughty river, the weir constructed within the past four or five years fulfils no purpose except to obstruct the passage of fish and also, as has been suggested to me, in order to keep the fish in the interests of a certain riparian owner in that portion of the river over which he has fishing rights.  The weir is convenient to Ardtully Castle, which was formerly owned by the Orpen family.  During the fight for freedom the castle was destroyed and the surrounding land distributed amongst local uneconomic holders, but the fishing rights evidently were acquired by a gentleman from Dublin who has some interest in property near Kenmare on the Roughty river.  The local conservators are very much upset at the obstruction being allowed to remain in the river, and they say that it has destroyed one of the best spawning beds.  Immediately above the weir, where the water at <Col N="1786" /> one time flowed freely, a pool has been turned where fish will not spawn. They asked me if anything could be done in connection with the matter and I feel it my duty to call the Minister's attention to it.  I am quite satisfied, from the facts put before me, that the weir was constructed for the purpose of obstructing the free passage of fish in the area in which this individual has some fishing rights.  If that is the case I suggest that such an obstruction should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The case mentioned by Senator Healy does not exactly come within this section and certainly does not come under this amendment.  That matter has been dealt with by the Department and I think the Senator may be assured that the law will be enforced as far as the obstruction is concerned.  This section deals with a free gap in a weir, wherever a weir is legally entitled to exist but, as far as the amendment goes, we are only concerned whether we should have the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  Legally, I believe &ldquo;may&rdquo; means &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; means &ldquo;may&rdquo; in certain cases, and the draftsman has asked me to have the wording left as it is, as otherwise the Bill would not be uniform. For instance, Section 44 has the same word.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; remains there and has exactly the same effect. Apart from any legal knowledge, by reading the section it will be found that wherever the Minister is satisfied a proper gap does not exist he may serve a notice.  The amendment is not going to strengthen the hands of the Minister because he must first satisfy himself.  He is not going to say that he is satisfied unless he is going to do something.  Therefore, to have the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo; does not matter a whole lot, and I appeal to the Senator to withdraw the amendment in the interests of the drafting of the section.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied to withdraw the amendment if we have an assurance from the Minister that when he leaves the House he would satisfy himself on the matter, and immediately examine weirs in the country which do not conform to the <Col N="1787" /> spirit of the Act of 1863, and forthwith have them put in proper order.  If we had that assurance I would be satisfied.</P>

      <P>(9) This section shall not apply in respect of any fishing weir which was the subject of an order under Section 11 of the Salmon Fishery (Ireland) Act, 1863.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain that most of the weirs dealt with in the Act of 1863 come under Section 9.  Section 11 deals with narrow rivers under 40 feet wide and, in that case, no provision was made for a gap in the weir, but the weekly close <Col N="1788" /> season was extended to three days.  In fact, the amendment that was inserted would not apply.</P>

      <P>In page 38, Section 67, in sub-section (2), to delete paragraph (a) and substitute therefor the following paragraph&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the arbitrator shall have regard primarily to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  in case such fishery was used during the transition period, the profits of such fishery during the transition period,</P>
      <P>(ii)  in case such fishery was not used during the transition period, the sum which in the opinion of the arbitrator would have been the profits of such fishery if such fishery had been used during the transition period.</P>
      <P>A matter was raised by Senator Sir John Keane before the Special Committee with regard to a special case he had in mind, that of an owner who desisted from netting and thereby enhanced the value of his angling on this particular river, and he asked me if we had provided for such cases in the matter of compensation.  This is an attempt to meet the case the Senator had in mind, or any such case that may arise.  It is provided here in subparagraph (ii)</P>
      <P>&ldquo;in case such fishery was not used during the transition period, the sum which in the opinion of the arbitrator would have been the profits of such fishery if such fishery had been used during the transition period;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Perhaps it would be possible to obtain some indication of the business that will come before the Seanad.  It has been announced in the Press that the Dáil is likely to adjourn at an early date, and it might be of help to Senators if the Chair would give some indication as to how many Bills are to be considered.  In the normal way it might take four or five weeks for a Bill to go through all its stages properly.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to give a short description of the various sections of this Bill as it has been passed by Dáil Éireann. Section 1 is the usual section fixing the rates of income tax and surtax for the current year.  Section 2 makes certain changes in the surtax rate for the year 1938-39, payable during the current year, and increases the amount of surtax on incomes exceeding £3,000. There is also provision to prevent the hardship which would arise if the full amount of the increased rates was applied to incomes slightly above the critical point.</P>
      <P>Section 3 reduces the personal allowance from £225 to £220 in the case of a married man and from £125 to £120 in the case of a single man.  Section 4 provides that the allowance in respect of earned income shall be one-fifth of the income and that the total amount of the allowance shall not exceed £300. Section 5 brings up to date the exemption given by Section 3 of the Finance Act of 1931.  At the time at which that section was passed, all the surplus income from the sweepstakes went to the hospitals organising the sweep.  As is known to Senators, the position now is that all surpluses are payable to the Hospitals Trust Board.  Without this amendment of the law the strictly legal position would be that the sweepstake surpluses would be chargeable to income-tax in the hands of the organisers of the sweepstakes or of the Sweepstakes Committee appointed by them.  As we already secure a stamp duty of 25 per cent. of such surpluses, it is as well to make it clear that these surpluses are exempt from income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 provides for an exemption, in respect of the year beginning on the 6th April, 1937, of allowances payable under Section 3 of the Army Pensions <Col N="1791" /> Act, 1937, to relatives of the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation.  Section 7 alters the method of assessment of certain profits derived from stallion fees from Schedule D to Schedule B of the income-tax laws, so as to put Irish stallion owners in the same position as English owners in regard to the payment of income-tax on such fees. Section 8 imposes the customs duty set out in the First Schedule.  The duties on engine cleaning waste, button blanks, flavouring essences and coffee essences are new, while the remaining ones are existing duties which are being reimposed in an amended form. Section 9 increases the rates of duty on tobacco, the basic increase being 8d. per pound.  Sections 10 and 11 increase the duties on mineral hydrocarbon light oils.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (a) exempts from the duties on films, films which are imported by societies formed mainly for the study of film technique and not conducted for profit.  Section 12 (b) exempts from duty silent films not exceeding seven-tenths of an inch, reimported into this country, which have been produced or processed abroad by the reversion process from exposed undeveloped negative film. Section 13 amends the Finance Acts set out in the Third Schedule.  The first amendment excludes fishing bait from the duty on sports requisites.  The second amendment increases for protection purposes the duty on boot sundries, such as lasts, trees, patterns, etc., and the third amendment reduces the duty on engine blocks and certain other motor-car parts or works.  The fourth amendment exempts from duty certain moulds and machines for making concrete blocks.  The fifth amendment exempts from duty paper imported for use in the printing of paper-covered novels.  Amendments Nos. 6, 7, 9 and 10 impose increased rates of duty for protective purposes. Amendment No. 8 extends the scope of an existing duty for the convenience of customs administration.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill contains various amendments of the Customs Acts.  Sub-section (1) abrogates the prohibition on the importation of extracts, essences or other concentrations <Col N="1792" /> of coffee or chicory contained in Section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876.  This sub-section is rendered necessary by the imposition of a duty on such extracts and essences as are set out in reference No. 15 of the First Schedule to this Bill.  Sub-section (2) exempts from customs entry duty entries for reimported goods in respect of which a bill of store has been issued.  Sub-section (3) is merely a drafting amendment and corrects an error made in a reference in Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1934, and is to substitute &ldquo;13&rdquo; for &ldquo;12&rdquo;.  Sub-section (4) of this section is intended to remove doubts regarding the rate of duty to be applied under Section 15 of the Finance (Agreement with United Kingdom) Act, 1938.  Sub-section (5) redrafts sub-section (6) of Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1938, for purposes of clarification.  Sub-section (6) is merely a drafting amendment to substitute the &ldquo;Revenue Act, 1909&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Finance Act, 1909&rdquo; in Section 24 (4) of the Finance Act of 1938.</P>
    <P>Section 15 makes provision for the importation under licence, without payment of duty, of certain classes of dutiable goods in respect of which no licensing powers exist at present.  The classes affected are set out in the Fourth Schedule.  Section 16 terminates certain customs duties set out in the Fifth Schedule of the Bill, and Section 17 exempts from entertainments duty entertainments promoted by the Contract Bridge Association of Ireland.  It will be remembered that, for some years past, we have been endeavouring to exempt from entertainments duty functions of this sort which may be of an international character and which games are played purely as amateur functions, which, as I say, may have engagements of an international character and in which the participants engage purely for sport and not for purposes of gain.  In that way, we have excluded from the scope of the entertainments duty a considerable number of amusements and sports of this kind.  I thought that, by a rather comprehensive amendment last year, we had cleared up all the tag ends of this exemption but, apparently, this was one case <Col N="1793" /> which was overlooked and did not come within the strict drafting of the section.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the setting up of more effective machinery for preventing abnormally large clearances from revenue control of imported goods, and also for prohibiting excessive deliveries of goods which are liable to excise duty whenever such excessive clearances or deliveries appear unreasonable for the ordinary requirements of trade.  Section 19 (1) raises from £25 to £52 the limit for exemption from estate duty in respect of an insurance annuity payable to the widow or beneficiary of a deceased person.  The present limit of £25 was fixed in 1894, and is now considered to be too low. This section will give relief in a number of necessitous cases.  Sub-section (2) gives a measure of relief in the case of a first annuity, not exceeding £104, which the deceased has contracted for the benefit of any one person.  Section 20 provides for the transfer to the Exchequer of £150,000 from the Road Fund.  Section 21 provides for the repeal, to a limited extent, of the enactments set out in the Sixth Schedule.  The repeal of Section 15 of the Finance (No. 2) Act of 1915, and Section 19 of the Finance Act of 1919, is a necessary consequence of the extended powers to refuse delivery of goods contained in Section 18 of the present Bill.  Section 3 (1) of the Finance Act of 1932, relates to income tax allowances in respect of earned income, and its repeal is necessary owing to the new allowance provided for in Section 4 of the present Bill. Sections 22 and 23 are the usual sections relating to the care and management of taxes and duties, as well as the Short Title, and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLoughlin Mr. McLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the indulgence of the House so that I may read my contribution to the debate on this Bill.  The Budget which is enshrined in the Bill gave me such a shock that my memory is seriously impaired as a result, and my remarks would, if not committed to paper, be disconnected and, perhaps, unintelligible.  I should like to preface my remarks by laying down certain general principles.  If <Col N="1794" /> any taxation is to be considered just and expedient, there are four conditions which it ought to fulfil.  It should be unavoidable; it should be opportune; it should be equitable and it should be reasonable.  It should be unavoidable in the sense that, on a far-sighted, prudent and judicial survery of the present and future circumstances of the community, it is necessary for maintaining the standard of living of the people.  It should be opportune.  It should not be imposed at a time when trade and industry are labouring in depression.  It should be equitable.  It should be distributed fairly and equitably over the several sections of the community according to their ability to pay.  It should be reasonable.  It should be within the taxable capacity of the people as a whole.  Judged by any of these four principles, the proposal which the Minister has submitted to the House cannot be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes to increase taxation and to aggravate the already too heavy burden upon our people and upon their industry.  Is any member of the House satisfied that new taxation is unavoidable?  The word &ldquo;income&rdquo; connotes to some people a bloated plutocrat and petrol is invariably associated with a Rolls Royce. But there are many weekly wage-earners, not merely pen slaves, but manual workers, now paying income-tax. Many farmers, many artisans, many labourers and many unemployed will be hit by the petrol tax.  If by reasonable economies these taxes could have been avoided, the workers would have been spared.  We, on these benches, feel that the ultimate incidence of any tax is very rarely restricted to the individual upon whom it first falls.  We believe that the burden of it is passed down the social scale until ultimately the greater portion of it is transferred to the producers and wage-earners.  If we want money for our social services, we should endeavour to secure it by cutting down, ruthlessly cutting down, wasteful and unproductive expenditure. We should rely on economies rather than on taxation.  We have pointed out the wretched chicanery of segregating certain items of expenditure as abnormal <Col N="1795" /> and defraying the cost of them by borrowing.  We have opposed borrowing because we are not prepared to mortgage the future of our country in order to indulge Ministers in their present extravagance.  The principal result of such borrowing is to leave less and less of our annual revenue available for social and productive services.</P>
    <P>There are many Departments in which economies might be sought.  Are any of us in this House certain, before we impose these taxes and make it a little harder for our poorer folk to secure bread for their children, that considerable waste does not still prevail in the Army?  Are any of us satisfied that no portion of the sum which it is proposed to spend this year on the Army could be saved?  Or take the sum which it is proposed to spend on that circumlocution Department known as the Land Commission.  Is there any member who is not satisfied that, if there was a thoroughly business administration in charge, the work of that Department could not be done with half the staff or in half the time it now occupies?  Do we really need £1,600,000 worth of police in this country?  What about the £1,700,000 we provide for pensions?  There are, within the State, resources out of which the Budget could be balanced without imposing an additional 6d. on income or 4d. on petrol.  Is this taxation opportune?  The trade returns should make us hesitate before imposing an additional burden on our declining trade, upon our farmers, our workers, our unemployed and those who will soon swell that hungry army if we do not hold back the hand of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Competition in the British market is likely to increase and in face of this intensified competition, in the very pit of our depression, when our producers are gasping for breath, the Minister for Finance and the Government tighten their grasp upon the throats of our people.  Is the House going to connive at that process of industrial strangulation?  Is it going to cry halt, face up to the Executive Council and say boldly: &ldquo;You are taking more than <Col N="1796" /> the country can give, more than industry can afford and survive.&rdquo;  The Minister proposes to increase the standard rate of income tax but he does not propose any corresponding increase in the allowances.  We, on these benches, believe that we are only at the edge of the cyclone.  When we get to the real storm centre conditions will be very much worse.  This thing can not go on.  The country cannot bear any further increase in the burdens that are already crippling our trade and our industry.</P>
    <P>A few years ago we could fling our millions broadcast.  It was necessary that the channels of patronage should be wide and that every possible element of support that could be procured in the country should be bought or suborned.  Now we are faced with a different position.  The spendthrift has come to reckon with the moneylenders and the debt charges which were infini-testimal in 1924-25 have gone up year by year.  After six years of the Minister's optimistic Couéism our people, this once joyous Irish nation, have been turned into a nation of pessimists without hope.  How can there be hope when life's burdens become intolerable?  The burden of taxation upon the people has become intolerable.</P>
    <P>It is sad and chastening to reflect how office may corrupt even the best of men.  This taxation will represent an increase in the cost of production for which the producer cannot seek to compensate himself by asking higher prices.  He will be between two fires&mdash; I had almost said two thieves&mdash;his competitors abroad and the Minister's tax-gatherers at home.  What will happen? He will either give up the ghost and cease to produce or he will endeavour to reduce the immediate, but not the ultimate, cost of production by decreasing wages and reducing personal expenditure. By ceasing to produce, he directly creates unemployment and becomes unemployed himself.  By reducing wages, he reduces the purchasing power of his employee.  The cost ought to be met, not by imposing fresh taxation, but by retrenchment in respect of services which are non-productive and some of which are parasitical.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> With that advice I conclude.  But in concluding this speech&mdash;the best, I modestly claim, I have ever made in this House&mdash;may I express my deep indebtedness to the present Minister for Finance, the scintillations of whose financial genius, as enshrined in the Dáil debates of 1928-30, have been my chief source of inspiration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesParkinson" hpid="Mr. Parkinson Mr. Parkinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parkinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of thanking the Minister on behalf of the horse breeders, the racing community, and the people connected with the horse trade.  We are deeply grateful for the assistance he has given in this Budget to racing. We are particularly thankful to him for having removed the tax from stallions. It was really a very generous gesture on his part towards that part of the community who are engaged in this industry, and I am sure that the people who will benefit by it will feel deeply grateful to the Minister for what he has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another question, namely, that of alternative markets, into which, although it may not come within the scope of the Minister's Department, I should like him to look, and perhaps, give us the benefit of his sympathetic interest.  In the various countries, outside Great Britain, with which we trade, we spent last year £20,000,000.  In return these countries bought a little over £2,000,000 worth of goods from us.  Except the trade agreement that we have with Germany, there is not another agreement with any of the outside countries worth anything. I think that if the Minister were to handle that £20,000,000 himself he would certainly spend it to much better advantage than it has been spent in these various countries.  I do not want to tax the Minister's memory or to put him to the trouble of looking up various documents to quote the adverse balances in our trade with these various countries but take just one country which the Irish people would regard as being friendly towards us, the United States.  Last year in the United States we bought goods to the value of £4,704,000 odd, which shows an adverse balance of £4,591,029.  That is a country in which <Col N="1798" /> everything which we want to sell is taxed on import, whereas very little tax is imposed on the amount of goods we take from the United States. Certainly if the Minister were in a position to propose that he should spend £5,000,000 in the United States, and if he could deal directly with the American Government, I am sure that we would have a very much better arrangement than spending so many millions there and getting so little trade from them in return.  There are various other countries in which a lot could be done.  Much could be done to develop home industries.  The main things we have to export are agricultural produce and it would be a great help to the farmers if they could secure alternative markets to Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed with the Minister's statement because it was a mere dull explanation of the rather technical clauses of the Finance Bill.  We thought and hoped, in view of the limited opportunity this House has for discussing the broader aspects of public finance, that the Minister would have explained in some way why it is necessary to place on the country this heavy additional burden of taxation. I remember talking to the late Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Patrick Hogan, very shortly after the present Government came into office.  He said to me, what was afterwards borne out by his own conduct, &ldquo;I am not going to take much practical interest in politics from now on.  I know the Government have got to learn by bitter experience and nothing will stop them. As long as there is money there to spend it will be spent, and it is only when the time comes that the money is running short that it will be much good taking an active part in public life.&rdquo; I cannot help feeling that that is somehow borne out by events and that if Mr. Hogan were alive this would be the time that he might be disposed again to take an active part in public affairs because the country is undoubtedly faced by a very serious financial position. Let us cast our minds back to the days of another great Irishman, who did much to found this new State&mdash; Michael Collins.  I remember very well, <Col N="1799" /> in the early days of the Provisional Government, when he said there would be a great inducement for the North to join with the Free State because our income-tax would be so low.  I have not got the document here but I recollect that very clearly.  I also remember, not very many years ago, when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance said that it would be a great move on the part of the Government to have no tax at all on income arising in this country.  We have reached the stage now when, personally, I do not think it is any good going into all these niceties of tables and figures.  There is only one thing to do and that is clear. Someone once said that he could see a parish church by day-light, and I think we can see pretty clearly what should be done.  There is only one sound thing to be done and that is drastic retrenchment all along the line. That is, perhaps not in so many words, but practically what is implicit in the Report of the Banking Commission.  I think it is serious and ominous that with this report before the public for well over a year there has been no serious suggestion on the part of the Government that they intend to apply the remedies which are contained in that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very disappointed by the Minister in the Dáil.  He takes the line that it is really no concern of the Government. He first of all suggests that the people want all this expenditure and that the Government are their servants and have to give it to them or, alternatively, that it is the business of the Opposition to suggest economies; that they have suggested nothing; all they have suggested is more expenditure; therefore, the Government are justified in doing what they have done. I do suggest that that is entirely the wrong attitude.  There is a serious responsibility on the Government to face up to the situation.  I do not think for a moment that the Minister himself is happy.  His Budget speech did not suggest he was at all happy about the State finances.  That being so, it being perfectly clear that we cannot go on the way we are going, it should be the duty of the Government <Col N="1800" /> to tell the country it cannot go on, that something must be done.  It is for them to suggest the remedy.  There are doctrinaires who say that it is quite easy to go on spending gaily and nothing happens but I cannot believe that the Minister will say that.  As far as one can see, in the light of sound commonsense, there is only one remedy and that is drastic retrenchment all along the line, unpleasant though it may be, and recognition of the fact that the country cannot afford all these social services, generous or otherwise. The money is not there.  It would be gratifying to the House and to the country if the Minister would say that the Government has under consideration a means of examining in detail all our public expenditure by a special committee composed of people in no way connected with politics, concerned solely with sound finance, who would suggest what can be done.</P>
    <P>Does anybody suggest for a moment that nothing can be done?  Does anybody suggest that it is necessary to spend £1,000,000 more on the Land Commission than we did seven or eight years ago, or that it is necessary to spend another £1,000,000 more on relief schemes than we did seven or eight years ago?  The country really cannot affort it.  It is very disconcerting to find the Minister for Finance suggesting that it is not the duty of the Government to tell the country about it and to take steps to check this alarming growth of expenditure, a growth of expenditure which in the last year amounted to £2,000,000 and was only set off in any substantial measure by the cessation of payments for bounties, a thing that cannot recur, which is finally settled once for all, whereas the tendency of expenditure seems to be steadily increasing.</P>
    <P>As I say, there is not much object in making one's case in detail, the case is so clear.  In the Minister's own Budget statement we are told that the dead weight debt per head of our people has gone up £7 since 1932.  We see an increase of some £5,000,000 in taxation, bearing in mind that £2,000,000 was saved on the payments to Great Britain.  I must confess I was not very much impressed by the <Col N="1801" /> Minister's explanation of that point. He dealt with the point that when Fianna Fáil were in opposition they intended to save £2,000,000, and he showed how they did, but surely it would be more realistic if the Minister had said when in opposition &ldquo;But we are hoping to spend another £7,000,000 or £8,000,000.&rdquo;  Anybody who heard their statement at that time would not imagine that there was going to be an expenditure of £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 in spite of a saving, which was undoubtedly carried out, of £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>There is another not very reassuring feature of the financial position in that the Budget is helped by a sugar tax owing to the fact that apparently a lesser acreage of beet is being grown.  One hears in the country that it seems to be rather doubtful that the present acreage of beet will continue, unless higher prices are given for the produce.  This is bound to mean increased taxation, the increased cost of sugar and such commodities.  Therefore, I do feel that the Minister in this House ought, to impress Senators, to make a frank and straightforward statement on the whole subject of public finance and say that there is an intention of appointing some body of men expert in finance and not connected with politics, to look into the whole thing with a view to bringing our expenditure within the country's means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was in a broadcast from the United States that I heard a description of a true democrat as &ldquo;a man who never voted in favour of a tax and never voted in against an expenditure&rdquo;.  Now, I think there might be a certain justification found for that idea if I had been as diligent as another Senator in reading speeches made, not solely by the Minister but by other members of his party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite sure that anybody else ever exceeded the Minister on the same line; but I want to suggest that those of us in opposition are always placed in a certain amount of difficulty. Nevertheless, if an Opposition does not frankly and definitely criticise the <Col N="1802" /> expenditure, I do not see how one can maintain the parliamentary system effectively.  I have a very strong suspicion&mdash;which is not altogether without some justification&mdash;that there are many members of the Party supporting the present Government who would like to feel perfectly free to say exactly what they think of the present financial position. I would like to support Sir John Keane in stating that, while not for a moment suggesting that the Opposition have not got responsibility for expenditure and taxation, a lead must come from the Executive of the day.  That was the attitude taken by the Minister when in opposition and I think it is the attitude that he should take now he is Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Most of us who have had experience in business have had to face, at one time or another, a period when we have had to call together our principal staff and say: &ldquo;The fact is, this business cannot stand this expenditure, and there will be disaster if something is not done.&rdquo;  You have got to get together your most experienced men and have them start with the axiom that you cannot go on increasing expenditure.  When you are dealing with a business, as distinct from a State, that axiom can be rather easily accepted, because if you do not take action you simply go on until you are forced into liquidation.  The State can carry on for a very considerable time before the evil effect of a bad financial system is felt, or felt to the full extent. I believe that it would be a good thing if the Government would take their courage in their hands, state that we cannot go on increasing expenditure, that there will have to be adjustments in the coming year, and state frankly what the position is.  If necessary, the Opposition can challenge that point of view if they wish.</P>
    <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister's brevity in introducing this Bill.  In the first place he did not need to go into a lot of detail, because I think this is one of the Bills &mdash;at least, so far as his Budget speech is concerned&mdash;which everyone of us reads, and, therefore, we have most of the points before us.  He passed over an increase in income-tax from 4/6 to <Col N="1803" /> 5/6 in the £ by simply mentioning &ldquo;the usual provision for income-tax&rdquo;. It seems to me that the Government made a blunder, a blunder which I think they will regret, in not maintaining income-tax at any rate at something lower than Great Britain and Northern Ireland, even though certain other taxes had to be imposed in order to make up the difference.  The Minister may say that we would have equally objected to the other taxes. We cannot say, until we see the alternative; but I believe that a definite mistake was made.</P>
    <P>I think there is a good deal of very genuine uneasiness as to the future. The income-tax in Great Britain is 5/6 in the £ when that country is undertaking, I think, the greatest armament and most expensive armament programme in its history.  We, rightly I think, and probably of necessity, are not attempting any such programme, but our income-tax is at the same rate as that of Great Britain. What would it be if we were forced&mdash; as I hope we never shall be&mdash;to even increase our armaments at a proportionate rate to that of Great Britain, if, with our present expenditure, income-tax is 5/6?  I think, recognising that, if the worst happens and Europe is again at war, there will have to be a further increase in income-tax, the Minister made a mistake in going to 5/6 at the present time.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another reason. Part of our State policy, and particularly the policy of the present Government, has been an attempt to establish and develop a number of industries.  The income-tax at the rate of 5/6 is a very great hardship on those industries, especially when that 5/6 is charged on the full amount of such profits as are kept within the business or placed to reserve.  In most other countries&mdash;certainly in Great Britain &mdash;where you have a large number of industries which are financially strong, you find that their strength to a very large extent lies in the fact that they were able, during a prosperous period, to build up substantial reserves.  With those reserves they can meet a period of difficulty without endangering their <Col N="1804" /> existence and without any undue addition to the price to the public generally.  Industries which have not adequate reserves are faced with the fact that their existence is seriously endangered unless they can hand on this increased taxation to the public. Now, the period in which the principal and largest reserves were built up in Britain was the period in which the income-tax varied from 2d. to 1/- in the £ and it is going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the industries here to build up large reserves with an income-tax of 5/6 in the £.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have always felt and I still feel, that the Government should carefully consider whether it would not be possible to make some concession, something on the lines on which earned income is allowed to individuals, to limited companies to the extent of the profits as ascertained for the year, which have not been divided or paid out in that year.  If dividends were paid out of previous reserves, that would have to be counted against the assessment for the year in which they were divided.  Every business finds that there is a certain amount of absolutely essential expenditure which must be made if the business is to be kept up to date.  These are regarded&mdash;and no doubt properly regarded within the present law&mdash;by the Revenue Commissioners as capital expenditure, and it is very rare indeed that the sum assessed for income-tax represents the actual sum in cash which the business has made for the year.  The 5/6, instead of representing something over 25 per cent., generally represents a very much larger proportion of the actual cash which has been made in profits and which can be divided to shareholders or remain in the business. I recognise that there might be certain administrative difficulties in a scheme of this kind, but I do not think that they would be insurmountable and, certainly, they should not be serious in the case of businesses where the profit is small&mdash;say under £2,000 a year.  If that profit is retained, it is for the benefit of the business and the benefit of employment.  I certainly think it would be a very wise step if the Government could see their way <Col N="1805" /> to make some concession, especially now that income-tax is at the high rate of 5/6 in the £.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the next largest increase in taxation in this Bill is on petrol.  I am inclined to agree&mdash;not that I like it&mdash; that it was natural that, when the Minister had to obtain additional money he should see whether some of it, at any rate, could not be obtained from petrol; but I think again he has made a mistake by not making an effort to meet certain difficulties arising out of that tax.  We will have before us, possibly to-day, a Bill to provide for very considerable expenditure on the tourist industry.  The same day we are expected to approve of taxation which adds to the cost of petrol for tourists who may come here.  This is a country which is becoming an excellent country for motorists.  There are few places where, within such a reasonable area, it is possible to obtain so great a variety of scenery and, if, as we hope, we get an improvement in hotels all over the country, it should be a country which should have a very considerable attraction for motorists; but if you are going to make motoring expensive, you are not going to induce tourists to come.</P>
    <P>A few years ago, I visited Switzerland with a car.  When I arrived at the boundary, I was given a card on which the number of my passport was duly entered and it was explained to me that if I had all the petrol which I purchased in Switzerland entered on that card and stayed the requisite number of days&mdash;I am not sure of the exact period, but I think it was a week or six days&mdash;I would be allowed a refund up to a fixed amount.  It prevented evasions by providing that it did not apply in respect of all the petrol I wanted, but only a reasonable amount.  I could therefore go to Switzerland feeling that if that State wanted their people to pay an increased tax, it did not want to take it out of tourists.  I suggest that something of the kind here would not to any substantial extent reduce the State income, but would be a definite attraction to tourists.  Small concessions made to tourists in Europe have undoubtedly been a very good advertisement, <Col N="1806" /> and, although they do not amount to very large sums, they are definitely an attraction.</P>
    <P>I was very much surprised to find that when an amendment was moved in the Dáil with regard to the position of taxi-drivers, the Minister&mdash;I did not listen to his speech and I saw only the newspaper report&mdash;appeared to be unsympathetic, and I think he said the proposal was impracticable.  These taxi-drivers are poor men, who need, to my mind, to spend any spare money they have in improving their vehicles and in other ways.  They have to charge a fixed sum, which they cannot change, if they ply on the streets, and this tax is therefore something which they cannot possibly pass on.  I cannot see why a concession could not be made in their case.  There is definite registration.  They have to be registered as owners of hackney vehicles and I cannot see why, with that registration, they could not receive a card and obtain a refund of the additional tax on petrol to a fixed amount.  I quite agree that it should not be unlimited, but I think the actual cost could not be very large and a hardship on a certain class would thereby be avoided.  I personally cannot see&mdash; perhaps it is due to my ignorance of administration&mdash;why that could not be done fairly easily in the case of drivers of hackney vehicles because there is specific registration and it could easily be ascertained whether or not a man has a hackney vehicle for hire.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other important matters more or less indirectly arising out of the Bill to which I should like to refer, but, before doing so, I should like to refer to one or two minor, though interesting, items in the Bill. I have for a very considerable time advocated some concession with regard to films.  This is now provided in Section 14, and I am very glad the Government have seen their way to make the concession with regard to film societies.  I take it that is the purpose of the section.  There is a second concession which enables development to take place outside the country of films exposed here.  It applies, I take it to, 16 mm. and smaller films, and I am very glad to <Col N="1807" /> see that concession made.  I have used these films for a long time, and when I saw in the Press a photograph of the Minister for Finance with one of these cine-cameras, I hoped that he would see the point I had in mind for a number of years.  I should like to ask him, however, why exclude sound on film, if it is sub-standard?  I admit that at the moment practically nobody uses it here, but it is used by amateurs in other countries, and particularly in the United States.  It is a coming thing, and I cannot see how a concession could be abused.  One of the reasons why I could not consider sound film myself is that the cost of processing by sending it outside would be prohibitive.  This section definitely excludes it and I cannot see the reason for that exclusion, but perhaps the Minister could give a good reason. I am not a bridge player, but I was interested in the Minister's description of the concession made with regard to bridge when he spoke of exempting bridge players who did not play for the purpose of gain.  I began to wonder whether it was going to help very many.  However, I think that is not exactly what he meant.</P>
    <P>Senator Parkinson raised a point, which I think is of considerable importance, when he referred to the possibilities of export trade.  If you speak of the possibilities of export trade from this country, you are liable to be laughed at here.  Most of our people have the idea that prices are too high and ask: &ldquo;What can we expect to do in the way of export trade.&rdquo;  There may be a certain amount of truth in that, but I believe that attitude is fundamentally wrong.  I think we need an export trade and I believe it is possible to get it, but I do not believe that, in the present world conditions, it is possible to do it without active Government assistance.  Perhaps I have used too strong a phrase in speaking of &ldquo;active Government assistance,&rdquo; and should say without active interest on the part of the Government because practically no international trade of any substance is possible nowadays, except as a result of agreements between Governments.  I should like to see a section of one of the State <Col N="1808" /> Departments, with one or two officials, paying its attention almost entirely to the question of export trade.  I believe that, after a few years, the results would be more than satisfactory, but I am quite sure that certain things would have to be done.  I am interested in some export trade.  Manufacturers here who try to carry on export trade are very much handicapped, as compared with similar firms in Belfast, or Great Britain, because there is no export credit guarantee system in operation here.  An exporter in Belfast can go to a British Government Department, pay a percentage, which varies from a half to 1 per cent., and, provided the people to whom he is exporting are approved, can, by paying that small sum as an insurance, get from the British Government a 75 per cent. guarantee that his money will be paid to him.  With that guarantee, he can go to his banker and borrow more money, to continue his trade at a very low rate of interest indeed.</P>
    <P>Without some such conditions, I do not see that our manufacturers here could hope to do an export trade.  My experience is not that there have been heavy losses in export trade and I understand that the British Government does not lose money because the percentage charged is sufficient to cover losses taken over a number of years.  One of the greatest difficulties exporters have to face at present is not bad debts, of which the percentage is not any higher than in home trade, but the possibility of a moratorium or exchange restrictions under which a firm may not get its money for years. No Irish manufacturers, with perhaps one or two obvious exceptions, are strong enough financially to face anything of the kind even where they could get the business.  Consequently, I believe that you will never do a satisfactory export trade, so far as manufacturers are concerned, unless you have some system of export credit guarantees.  Now that we have a trade agreement with Great Britain, I feel almost certain&mdash;I have no right to say this officially, because I do not know &mdash;that if our Government were to set up a similar department here, the British Government would give their <Col N="1809" /> experience by way of reference, so that a great deal of information would be available which would minimise the loss, if any, to the Government here. It would at present be taken advantage of only by a small number of firms, but I believe it is a matter of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>As usual this Finance Bill includes a number of adjustments in tariffs.  It is, I think, inevitable in any tariff system that every year and almost every month there have to be certain changes and adjustments.  I do not criticise that because I regard it as something that is quite inevitable.  I would like, however, to take this opportunity of suggesting to the Minister that the whole basis on which tariffs are charged here ought to be carefully considered and probably revised.  I cannot see how this Government or their successors can properly take any steps which are going to injure the industrial policy of this country or injure the manufacturers provided they are reasonably efficient &mdash; manufacturers who have been set up or have set themselves up as a result of State policy in the last six or seven years.  I am therefore assuming that this or any other Government will consider itself bound&mdash;assuming that there is reasonable efficiency&mdash;to maintain adequate protection for these manufacturers. Nevertheless, I believe that in order to provide that adequate protection, of necessity in many cases tariffs now have to be at a much higher rate than would be necessary if a better and a more efficient system was in use.  At the present time almost all import duties are charged <i>ad valorem.</i>  They are charged on the invoiced price of the goods.  The Revenue Commissioners take great pains, I am quite satisfied, to do everything they can, and I believe they are very effective, generally speaking, in preventing wrong invoices and in providing that the prices on the invoices are the prices paid by the importer for the goods, whether that duty be 100 per cent., or 75 per cent., or 40 per cent., or 25 per cent., as the case may be.</P>
    <P>It is well known that many industrial countries, or rather, many manufacturers in industrial countries find it <Col N="1810" /> expedient to export goods from time to time at prices considerably below the cost of production and at a rate below the market price in their own country.  That is very often described by a word which I very much dislike, the word &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; because it is often misleading.  This action on the part of manufacturers in other countries is generally a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> effort on the part of those countries to get rid of surplus manufacturers at a price at which they could not sell the goods if they were not surplus goods.  They can only do it because they get a higher price for the goods in their own country.  I think it is reasonably clear that if goods of that kind are imported here that the invoiced price can be a genuine price, but nevertheless even with the duty added a comparatively low price that is actually paid for the goods on importation.  Now a comparatively small quantity of that kind of &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; may be disastrous to our manufacturers because we are such a small country and the number of manufacturers in any one industry is relatively small.  In a country like Great Britain, which may have some 20, 30, or more factories making one class of goods as they have in many industries, the manufacturers there can reasonably afford to ignore a relatively small quantity of imported goods at &ldquo;dumped&rdquo; prices. Similar quantities could not be imported here without injuring the Irish manufacturer very seriously.  Because of the fact that such a position exists it has become absolutely necessary for manufacturers to ask the Government to keep import duty at a high rate, a rate higher than would be absolutely necessary if one were certain that the fair market price would be charged with the duty.  In Canada, duty is not charged <i>ad valorem</i> on the invoiced price, which is the custom here.  I think to a certain extent that the same system exists in the United States, but I am more familiar with the position in Canada.  The customs system here is the system that we took over from the British Government. The figure on which duty is payable in Canada is the figure which the Canadian Commissioners are satisfied to be the fair market value of the goods <Col N="1811" /> there.  As a rule, they take the figure as the average price at which the goods would be normally sold in the country from which they were imported, but may adjust the price where the price is regarded as an abnormal one owing to extraordinary conditions, such as are to be faced with goods from Japan at the present moment. For that purpose they maintain commissioners in Great Britain.  I do not know whether they have them in other countries.  The British manufacturers, I believe, recognise that the Canadian system is fair, that it prevents unfair and unreasonable price cutting amongst manufacturers.  They are quite willing to give correct information to the Canadian Commissioners. The result is that the system in Canada has worked reasonably and efficiently. The fair market value has been made the basis upon which the tariffs are charged.  I am satisfied that it would be a great advantage if some such system could be worked here.  I see no reason if it works well in Canada why it should not work well here after time and experience.  I am quite satisfied that in that event our manufacturers here would be able to obtain the adequate protection which is absolutely necessary for them without such high tariffs being continued in this country.  This would mean that the duty would not have to be as high on such goods as would actually have to be imported.</P>
    <P>With a limited number of manufacturers there must always be some imports.  I know that in that case the Minister for Finance may lose something in tariff revenue.  He will lose if tariffs are more effective and if the tariffs are at a smaller rate.  I say that because I believe that under the Canadian system the amount of goods imported would be less and the rate would be less.  The Minister would probably have to impose other import duties in order to make up for the loss. Something would have to be substituted. But if so these would be duties put on frankly for the purpose of revenue.</P>
    <P>To my mind unless this matter is faced carefully and fairly there is grave <Col N="1812" /> danger that there will be amongst the public a sort of reaction against Irish manufacturers because of high import duties which are put on goods which have to be imported because they cannot be obtained here, and the duty is at a high rate.  The public, perhaps naturally, is inclined to blame the Irish manufacturers for these high rates, whereas in fact the provision is necessary because the Government at present has no other way of dealing with the import of goods at less than their usual market value, which is usually called &ldquo;dumping&rdquo;.  I want to suggest that the system in vogue in Canada and other countries should be carefully investigated.  I would suggest that the Senators would carefully look into it themselves.  I would also advise the manufacturers to examine it and try to get all the information they can. This question should be very fully examined. I believe if this were done we would discover something which would be of very definite advantage to the country and prove it so clearly that the Government would have to adopt it.</P>
    <P>I think there is a danger that you may get an ill-considered, an unreasonable and not fully thought out demand for a reduction of tariffs: that reductions may be carried through political feeling or through political exigencies, and that if you have that done without any change in the system under which the duty is payable it may be disastrous to industry and that no matter what Government was in power it would be obliged to make changes again.  I, therefore, suggest to the Minister that in considering his policy this year he ought to carefully look into the whole plan adopted, particularly by Canada, and those other countries where the duty is chargeable on the fair market value and not on the <i>ad valorem</i> value as is the case in this country.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill, which the Minister is asking the House to give its assent to, may be said, I suppose, to epitomise the policy of the Administration.  In approaching a discussion on this measure none of us, I suppose, can do better than approach it from the angle we best understand. <Col N="1813" /> The man from the country must inevitably look on the Government's policy, as expressed in the Finance Bill, in its effects and consequences on the land of the country, and on the people who occupy that land.  I always feel at a slight disadvantage in attempting to discuss our agricultural problems in the presence of the Minister for Finance. It is difficult to talk about things in rural Ireland with a desire to have them bettered unless you feel that you are talking to a Minister who has got it in his bones and in his blood: who will know and understand your language, as he ought to, if he is to deal adequately with the problems which this country has to face.</P>
      <P>The great trouble, unfortunately, is that we have enunciated through this Finance Bill the policy of an Executive which, as I have said before and repeat now, is of a predominantly urban mind.  While that is so, we have here an agricultural country, composed mainly of small farmers.  The members of the Executive, however well-meaning they may be, have the urban outlook, and from the start have attempted to build up here an urban civilisation.  It was what they knew best: the kind of life they understood, and, being naturally accustomed to this more comfortable kind of life, they felt when they came into office that it was the best type of existence for us.  During the years that have since elapsed, they have proceeded along that line.  I would not quarrel with the Executive in the administration of its policy, the policy that we find enunciated in this finance measure, for the reconstruction of our urban life and the bettering of our urban civilisation, if they had managed to bring that about before they broke the other, but to-day we have reached the stage when they have almost broken the one and have got nothing to replace it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, I do not think&mdash;I do not say this with any feeling of pleasure&mdash;that any country in Europe, which won its freedom 17 years ago, can to-day show as little evidence of progress in those 17 years as the Government of this country.  Neither in the cultural nor in the economic sense can we see any evidence around us of that advance <Col N="1814" /> which we had hoped would come to us when we had the management and control of our own affairs in our own hands.  We have misused our opportunities, and we cannot, as other small nations in Europe can, truthfully leave the blame on the disturbed conditions outside.  Most of the disturbance was made by ourselves, by our own people on our own people, and so it is we have a declining population.  Is there any other small country in Europe that has lost such a big percentage of its population, in the same period of time, as we have?  We have a declining populalation, our land is impoverished and our people are broken and apathetic. In addition, you have here to-day the destruction of moral values which it would be impossible to estimate.</P>
    <P>One could get up here and say, as the Minister would like, that he and those associated with him have achieved very remarkable things.  One could say quite a number of pleasant things, but I agree with Senator Douglas that that is not the function of responsible Senators.  The responsibility is on us to speak the truth, to speak of things as we know them to be.  If things are going to be improved, then that can only be brought about by facing the facts.  We must try to understand the facts, and, most important of all, try to get the other fellow to understand them.  None of us finds fault with the Minister in the discharge of his function of levying taxation.  He must do that.  My quarrel with him is, not so much that the amount of taxation is so overwhelmingly great and so much beyond our capacity to bear, as that he is levying it in such a manner and distributing it over our people in such a way as to create here a situation which displays sterility, as far as the Minister is concerned, to attempt anything constructive. The Minister is spreading that heavy burden of taxation&mdash;the heaviest that this country has ever had to carry, except on one occasion since the signing of the Treaty&mdash;over fewer people and over a lower level of production. The last report in our trade Journal indicated that our volume of exports last year was down by 7 per cent. as compared with the previous period.  The Minister is seeking to <Col N="1815" /> raise off a debilitated nation a huge sum of money, so very little of which is going to be applied in any constructive fashion whatever.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, will tell us that he need not raise so much taxation if it be pointed out to him wherein savings can be made.  I remember that many years ago, in the other House, when the level of expenditure was not anything approaching what it is to-day, we sat down and pointed out where savings could be effected.  The Minister came along in his own time, and, in going through the same Estimates, pointed out where, in his opinion, savings could be effected.  It is, of course, always easy to spend the other fellow's money.  The truth of the situation is that the Minister, and the Ministry of which he is a member, are spending other people's money.  My quarrel is not so much that the money is being spent or that they are leaving us with less than we had before, but that none of it is being spent in a constructive way to help to increase the production which the country so badly needs, if even a lower level of expenditure is to be maintained in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself, in discussing in the other House this question of agricultural production particularly, said &ldquo;Like Deputy Dillon, I, too, feel that we have to expand our agricultural exports.  I feel that we must do that in order, as I said before, to compensate ourselves for the loss of externally derived income which results from the fact that we have had, for one reason or another, to realise our investments abroad.&rdquo;  I should like the Minister to point out to us where in his Budget he is making any provision for the production of agricultural commodities that are going to get into the export market.  My quarrel with the Minister's Budget is that he is spending money foolishly, and he has spent it very foolishly in the past.  Had he spent it more wisely &mdash;had he even attempted to do some of the things that were urged upon him in this House&mdash;we would have a greater volume of agricultural exports available for sale which would go to some extent to maintain the position <Col N="1816" /> that, unless we are to come down to a much lower standard of living in this country, can only be maintained by depleting our external assets year after year.  The economic war left the country and the farmer very much poorer than the Minister is prepared to admit.  I am speaking of farmers who have to try to live on their farms, and if I am to be contradicted, let me be contradicted by such a farmer, or at least by one who has to live on his farm, say, with the addition of £200 or £300 a year from some external source other than his land.  I am prepared to state that, in my judgement, the farmer was much better able to pay the full annuity before the economic war than to pay the half-annuity to-day, and that when he had paid the full annuity in those days he had much more left than he has to-day after paying the half-annuity.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether or not the Senator comes within the category which I have classified as being able to answer me, but he can make his own case from his own point of view.  The farmers of this country had their resources depleted to an alarming degree during the economic war.  What did they get for it?  We paid £35,000,000 to Britain, and we paid £10,000,000 afterwards to settle the war which we had expected to win.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the trouble; that is the matter to which I want to refer. We see no signs of that whatever.  We are told we saved it.  It may be saved for a future generation, but it is of no great value to me to tell me that my son in 25 years' time may be a great deal better off than I am.  The Minister says we won the war.  The farmers have no doubt that it was lost.  They <Col N="1817" /> lost, even though there may have been a victory from the Minister's point of view or the point of view of the political Party which waged the war.  None of the proofs of that victory has been made available to the farmer.  He had to spend and spend in order to carry on; he had to deplete his capital resources of every description.  His land is poorer; he himself is poorer&mdash; poorer in physique and poorer in spirit. His land is poorer.  His cattle are poorer.  Look how many thousands of them were taken from the farmers this year.  Why are they poorer?  They are poorer because the farmers were too poor to buy the necessary food for them.  In addition to his stock being poorer and producing poorer progeny, his machines on the land are not what they ought to be, and generally the position of our farming community to-day is much lower than it was in 1932.</P>
      <P>In addition to the economic war, the Minister has to remember that he started another policy side by side with it.  Perhaps it was not he who started it; it was started by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Cabinet assented to it.  The fruits of that campaign, as far as the farmer is concerned, are that to-day we have the position that when the farmer goes out to buy he has got to have £170 or £175 in order to buy what he would get for £100 in 1914, but when he goes out to sell he gets only £112 or £113 or £115 as against £100 in 1914.  How is he going to get £175 worth of goods for £115, unless he goes out and sells more off his land than he ought to sell off his land if he is to keep the capital goods which are essential for his production? That is the problem we are facing in the country.  While the Minister, in his flights of poetic imagination, can tell the farmers that they are getting £10,000,000 free, and ought to be very thankful for their treatment, the farmer sees no signs of it.  The only result of this situation is that conditions in the country are much graver than the present political Party in power are prepared to admit.  The trouble, as I see it, is that that cannot be put right unless there is admission of the fact that the situation is grave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have evidence here that our <Col N="1818" /> external assets have been depleted from the figure of £72,000,000 in 1934 to £61,000,000 in 1938.  As I said earlier, if we are going to keep up the standard of life which we would like to see our people enjoying, and without which they cannot pretend to be living up to any recognised modern standard of culture or the like, our production has got to be increased to a much greater extent than we are capable of doing to-day.  My feeling is that the policy of the Minister which, on the one hand, admits that increased agricultural exports are essential for our well-being here, and his policy, on the other hand&mdash;sterile, fruitless as it is&mdash; which is making no effort whatever to get us the increased agricultural production or increased agricultural exports, are most inconsistent.  If the Minister were doing something to get us increased agricultural production, he would have any amount of backing from this side of the House, and the criticisms that are offered about his Finance Bill and his finance policy would not be anything like what they are.  We quarrel, of course, and rightly so, with all the hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on the alcohol factories, and with all this money that is being spent on peat, although there is a good deal to be said for experimenting on peat, when so much of it could be profitably employed on the land, the possibilities of which we fully understand.</P>
    <P>That is what is disturbing the people in the country who believe in the land, and believe in the possibility of giving our people a future here.  The Minister has been urged time and again to make it possible for our people to go into greater production.  A couple of weeks ago here we had a motion in this House, sponsored by Senator Counihan and Senator Johnston.  It was not, apparently, acceptable to the right-hand side of the House.  Whether they were right or wrong is a matter of history now.  But, whether the Minister likes it or not, unless he is prepared to make provision for credit to enable us to go into greater agricultural production in this country he is seriously imperilling the whole future financial stability of the State.  As Senator <Col N="1819" /> Johnston pointed out on another occasion, the position of our sterling assets day after day is being weakened if the volume of our agricultural exports continues to fall.  With fewer people to work on the land and less capacity on the part of those who stay to produce, these exports must inevitably fall.  Unless that is counterbalanced by some action on the part of the Minister he will have some day, perhaps, or his successor will have, to take very bold action to put right a position which is not too difficult to save at the moment, but which, apparently, the Minister has not the courage to tackle.</P>
    <P>In days like these when people are thinking in terms of war, and thinking how futile any efforts of ours in the matter of expenditure on armaments must be for the protection of our State, or our lives, it is natural that our people should turn to those other fields where money can be usefully and fruitfully spent.  What is the justification for spending money on armaments, either on ports or guns, or anything else, to defend a country where the land is not being worked and will not be worked by the people because the Minister for Finance will not give them a chance?  What is the justification for spending money on the production of armaments, or a scheme of defence in this country when a much better scheme of defence would be the production of more food?  In war what is as essential as food?  Is not food the life of all?  While the Minister will spend money on the ports and alcohol factories, and the like of that, he will spend no money to enable the farmers to produce more food.  Food can be sold outside the country just as well as it can be consumed inside the country.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, later on, is faced with the cry, which is growing in the country, that because the credit position of this country is not right we must break the link with sterling, we must depreciate the value of our currency and so on, make no mistake about it, the Minister will have played his part in creating that situation.  You cannot keep thousands and thousands of people idle in the country when <Col N="1820" /> they see that they could be usefully employed if there was money to employ them, and when they realise that the Minister could make that money available by an effort on his part, and that he will not do it, either because he has not the courage to do it, or because he does not understand his country.  It may be a combination of both.</P>
    <P>I believe that what we want in the way of a financial policy is to consider particularly the capacity of the people to carry the burden of taxation which the Minister levies.  The Minister, in our present condition, has put upon the people a burden far beyond their capacity to bear.  He has done that without making any effort to make them better fitted to bear the burden which they have to carry.  If he played his part, and exercised the power which he can get, as a Minister of the State, to make our people better fitted to do the work that is there for them to do in their own country by obtaining the credits that are necessary for the working of our land, there would not be half as much criticism about heavy budgetary expenditure, because expenditure is great or small in accordance with the capacity of the man to bear the expenditure.</P>
    <P>When the Minister tells us that there is no credit available for agriculture and, at the same time, the Minister declares that greater agricultural exports are essential for our stability, financial and otherwise, when we know the Minister himself has, perhaps from £14,000,000 to £16,000,000 of securities over which he has control, in England, and when, apparently, none of that can be made available for the farmers; when we are told that there is £35,000,000 on deposit in the Irish banks, the property of farmers, invested at 1 per cent., and that none of that seems to be available to invest in further farming effort in this country except at a rate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the men who have the deposits.  I am talking about the people who have no deposits and about the money which is <Col N="1821" /> on deposit in the banks at 1 per cent., and 1½ per cent. if the amount be over £2,000.  None of that money can go to these people except at 6 per cent. interest, and then only with security which, apparently, a great many are not able to produce.  It is creating a situation in this country which is very dangerous indeed.  The Minister has resolutely refused to face up to that situation.  I believe his failure is going to create a very unhappy condition. We are going to have in the matter of our production a continuous drop at the very time when we should be getting greater yields of every kind and description.  That situation has arisen because of the waste and the dissipation of effort which has gone on since we got the government of the country into our own hands.  Until the Minister, or his successor, sees fit to understand and to realise that the land of the country and the farmers are the country's greatest asset and is prepared to adopt a financial policy that will give these producers a chance, every finance measure which the Minister may bring in, based on the conditions which we find to-day, must meet with opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the feeling of Senator Sir John Keane that on a Bill as important as this we are entitled to expect some statement of policy from the Minister, and I hope confidently that, when replying to this debate, the Minister will atone for the rather arid nature of the remarks by which he introduced the Bill to us by telling us frankly and fully what the ideas of the Government are about the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we to assume that the Government see no hope of reducing the size of future Budgets?  Are we to assume even that Budgets in future are to go on increasing, as they have increased during the past few years?  Or may we, on the contrary, believe that some careful examination is being made by somebody, either in the Government, or out of the Government but under the instruction of the Government, to see where economies are possible?  In the second year of office of the present Government they introduced a Bill which was called the Temporary Economies Bill, and which has been rather generally forgotten by this time.  The <Col N="1822" /> fate of that Bill was unhappy.  It may have been ill-conceived, but, at any rate, the Minister introduced it, as I think in good faith, as a measure of economy.  It was received with most bitter hostility by all Parties (other than supporters of the Government) except the Centre Party, and even by the supporters of the Government, the support given to the Bill was very tepid.  An experience of that kind, no doubt, tends to discourage a Government from doing anything in the way of economy because, even if the particular provisions in that Bill were ill-conceived, were badly chosen, the general course of the debates upon the Bill were such as to intimidate a Government from proposing any sort of economy at all.</P>
    <P>It is true, as several Senators have said, that a Government itself must take the responsibility of considering whether economy is possible and making proposals for it, and that it is not discharging its duties by merely saying to the Opposition, &ldquo;You criticise all this expenditure; very well, suggest what is to be done in the way of economy.&rdquo;  The Government's responsibilities are heavier than that; but I do think that, at the same time, it ought to be fully realised that there is a responsibility also on Opposition Deputies and Senators, and that those who are at all influenced by love of their country must resist the temptation that is offered to them by every proposal of a Government for any sort of economy to oppose it and use it as a lever for putting the Government out of office or making the Government unpopular.  The responsibility of producing a change of mind in this country on the subject of public expenditure is a responsibility that rests on the shoulders of every Deputy and every Senator, and if, in speechifying all through the country, every public representative were to remember that he could do something along those lines, a great deal might be accomplished. It has not been my experience, at any rate, that the country people resent being talked to about the importance of public thrift or the importance of private thrift, but they hear all too little about it.  There <Col N="1823" /> have been one or two speeches lately on the subject from a strong supporter of the Government, Deputy Childers, and it would be very interesting to know to what extent, if at all, his views are shared by his colleagues in that Party.  I cannot believe that any Government will have the courage to do anything really important in the way of economising unless the rank and file of Deputies and Senators prepare the way for them throughout the country by explaining to the people the seriousness of the financial position.</P>
    <P>It is not an exaggeration to call our financial position &ldquo;serious&rdquo;.  Needless to say, we are by no means alone in the world in that respect.  There are unpleasantly few countries whose financial position is not serious in the appalling times in which we are living, but we differ from other countries in this: that we have hardly any excuse for having got into a serious financial position.  That we have done so is the most amazing upset of the theories and doctrines preached by nationalists ever since the Union&mdash;and, indeed, before the Union.  It has always been maintained that, if only we could escape from the grasp of the British, if only we could escape from British taxation, from the brutal hand of the Saxon which was suppressing our trade&mdash;the moment that was accomplished we would, in the words of Wolfe Tone, &ldquo;go up like a balloon&rdquo;. We have not gone up &ldquo;like a balloon&rdquo;. Our taxes are heavier than they were under the British, and what have we to show for it?  Has the material prosperity of our people been enhanced to any appreciable extent by the fact that we have been managing our own finances for the last 17 years?  It does really look as if, as Senator Baxter says, we have been mismanaging our affairs very badly.  Or, perhaps, we have only been mismanaging them rather badly; but the ideas that were held about our financial situation by nationalists throughout the whole of the nineteenth century were absolutely false.  It has got to be realised that the whole claim that we were overtaxed by the British was based on the belief that our taxable capacity was <Col N="1824" /> lower than that of the British.  It was not alleged that we were overtaxed because more was being drawn from us in taxation than was being spent upon us.  That was not the allegation and that was not the fact&mdash;certainly, as regards the latter part of the British régime.  The idea was that there was something fundamentally wrong in a people as poor as we were being subjected to anything like the same taxation as the British were.</P>
    <P>Here we are on our own, without having to join in this terrific armament race except to a comparatively paltry extent, without any disabilities to prevent us from starting any industry in the world we like and, nevertheless, we have these high taxes.  It is not alone that we have escaped the appalling military dangers of other countries which have forced them to extravagant expenditure, but we have also escaped economic disadvantages of other countries, because what other country is there in the entire world that had, at the same time, a free hand to put on any tariffs it liked in order to start any industries it liked within its shores, and also a free market for its agricultural produce at its door&mdash;a market into which the whole of the other agricultural countries of the world were eager to get?  In spite of these amazing advantages and exemptions, we have managed to get into a serious financial position.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in the other House that the position would become far more serious if there was a European war.  That I do not doubt.  But I must say that a large number of people in this country behave as if they did not realise that at all, behave as if they thought that the thing that would be the salvation of this country would be a European war.  A large number of people who are seeking to weaken British power and British prestige in every part of the world seem to be utterly regardless of the fact that the result of doing so might be to contribute to a European war, and that that European war might mean not merely the temporary but the permanent downfall of British prosperity and power.  Still less do they seem to realise that the downfall of British <Col N="1825" /> prosperity would mean, with absolute certainty, the downfall of any such prosperity as we do possess in this country.</P>

At any rate, I do not know of any argument that could be used to the contrary.  I should like to know what is going to happen even if there is not a European war.  What is the Minister's view about the future?  Does he see any hope of improvement?  Is he able to tell us if he can see a situation coming when taxes will be less or, at any rate, when taxes will not be more?  Can he see a situation coming in which borrowing at low rates will be easier or, at any rate, will not be more difficult? In a debate like this, on a Bill imposing such extremely heavy taxes, we have a right to expect that when the Minister comes to reply he will tell us as frankly and as fully as he can what his view of the future is, and what is the Government's policy to meet it.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to follow Senator Baxter in discussing the economic war.  I am sure we have all heard enough about the economic war, and that we are all anxious to forget it.  For my part, I never want to hear another word about the economic war. I agree with Senator Baxter, that the principal reason why appeals to the Minister and to the Government for relief for farmers are turned down is because they have, to a great extent, the city or the urban outlook.  Their associations are with the cities and the urban areas, and they do not understand the difficulties under which agriculturists suffer.  That is the principal reason why they have been so callous regarding appeals for relief for farmers. The Minister is always able to procure money for every purpose except for the relief of farmers.  The Government seem to be satisfied if they see Dublin expanding.  Everything is considered prosperous if there <Col N="1826" /> are more houses being built in every direction around the city.  They forget where the money is coming from.  The house-building schemes and the prosperity that Dublin enjoys at present at the expense of the country will suddenly cease unless we are able to expand our agricultural exports.  The only hope we have of maintaining our present standard of living, our present social services, or continuing, even in a smaller way, the building schemes is by greater exports of agricultural produce. After all, agricultural produce is the only thing we have to export.</P>
      <P>The first necessity for expanding our agricultural produce is the creation of credit or working capital for farmers.  When we get that credit and working capital it will enable this country to export very much more, and to export better quality produce of the right sort.  The principal reason I intervened in the debate is to mention that some months ago I sent an outline of a proposal to the Minister which would create credit or working capital for farmers.  The Minister received that proposal sympathetically, but nothing has been done.  It was a scheme that was approved of by the best brains in this House, by financial experts, and to a limited extent by banks; but the Minister and the Government do not seem to be inclined to do anything about it.  I want publicly to appeal to the Minister to do what the motion passed by the Seanad asked him to do&mdash;to convene a conference representative of the Government, the banks and farmers to consider the whole question of credit or working capital for farmers.  The scheme sent in need not come into it, but I am sure if the Minister called a conference, some scheme would be evolved from their united efforts that would be of the greatest advantage to the farmers and to the country as a whole.  I hope the Minister will see his way to concede to that appeal.</P>

      <P>Some of the other speakers have dealt with many of the things that I proposed to refer to on this Bill.  There are one or two important points that arise, and in view of the fact that a Finance Bill puts on paper proposals by which the Government is going to collect money to carry out its policy, I think a very definite pronouncement should be made by the responsible Minister on the important questions raised in a House like this, where we are endeavouring, as far as we possibly can, to do things from a non-Party and non-political point of view.  I wish to make only constructive suggestions.  In this particular case I find it extremely hard, when one disagrees with a very great deal of the economic policy which the Government is adopting, to find anything to say that is really constructive. I must, therefore, ask the Minister whether it is proposed to go on spending, as he suggested, if the position is worse next year, and whether it is the intention of the Government to implement in any direction whatsoever the report of the Banking Commission.  I admit that in some directions that report was very conservative, or a sort of text book not to be used actually for such work. We have taken no notice of it whatever, but go on in a rather highly irresponsible way, thinking in millions when we ought to be really thinking in pounds.  When we remember the figures quoted by Senator Baxter &mdash; a reduction from £74,000,000 to £61,000,000 in external investments&mdash; we ought to look at these figures with all the noughts taken off.  The farmer found that £74 was reduced to £61, and that last year that amount was further reduced by £3 10s.&mdash;that is the way we should look at finance in this <Col N="1828" /> country.  Instead of being more careful, we go on spending at the same rate as before.  Our Government financial structure is built up with subsidies, guarantees and taxes.  That is a very fragile thing, and from day to day is being altered.  It is quite clear that while the balance is checked by expenditure on wages and salaries, if war comes it will fall to pieces like a pack of cards.</P>
      <P>Senator Parkinson mentioned our export trade.  I agree with him thoroughly that, if the Minister could possibly do it, some better arrangement should be made with the United States of America, where millions of our young people are living.  The United States have an adverse balance of some £4,000,000 with us instead of it being the other way round.  There might, for instance, be some arrangement made in connection with the Baltimore fish trade, or they could take thousands of horses from us.  All those things should be gone into with a view to improving matters.</P>
      <P>I think the increase in the rate of income-tax is an unfortunate thing, not because it bears more on one class than another, but because in actual fact we have not got anything like the responsibilities which England has.  Although the actual figure in regard to income-tax in England and Ireland is the same, the operation of the tax in this country is much more considerable than it is in England.</P>
      <P>There are one or two things that occurred in the debate with which I do not agree.  Senator MacDermot mentioned the Economy Act.  The Minister, at one time in the last Parliament, made an attempt to effect some economies.  In certain directions we resisted them because, I think, they were not very well picked.  I do not think any credit should be given for that economy legislation, because it arose simply out of difficulties connected with the economic war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point was raised by Senator Baxter on the question of armaments. In this connection we should not seek to shirk our responsibilities.  We aspire to be a sovereign nation; we hear people saying that every day.  The Prime Minister came here about a <Col N="1829" /> month ago and talked to us on that subject for an hour.  If we aspire to be a sovereign nation, we must shoulder some portion of our responsibilities. We cannot remain entirely unarmed and endeavour to hide behind the British forces, whom we have done all we can to get rid of, and still be a sovereign nation.  If there is a war, the British forces will be fighting to keep themselves and, incidentally, to prevent our becoming a German colony.</P>

      <P>It was not my intention to engage in the debate, but a challenge has been more or less thrown out to the Senators on this side of the House, and I feel disposed to accept that challenge.  I think that the Budget, generally speaking, was taken very favourably throughout the country, and I think it is generally accepted that the weight that is put on the shoulders of the taxpayers has been fairly distributed.  I admit that the income-tax payer is not now the luxury man that he was in days gone by, and the income-tax claim has come to the door of people with very small incomes at the present time, but, generally speaking, I think it is accepted throughout the country and throughout the State that those who are best able to pay are called upon to pay, and that the poorer classes have been allowed to amble along in their own way without the weight of any extra taxation being put on such commodities as tea, sugar or other necessary foodstuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about the disabilities under which a certain section of the community, the farmers, have been suffering.  I am not going to dispute that, nor am I going to dispute that they have their own anxieties and responsibilities.  But what surprises me most is that nobody ever seems to discuss the troubles or disabilities of the big section of the community that lives in the towns and villages, and even in the cities, of this country. Some Senator mentioned the economic war and said, I think, that he hoped never to see such a thing here again, and neither do I, but during the general depression&mdash;even leaving the economic war out of it altogether&mdash; although the farmers certainly had a very bad time, they were the one section of the community that the Government took into consideration at the time.  The farmers got a reduction of one-half of their annuities; all their produce was subsidised, and everything that could be done, within reasonable bounds, was done to help to tide the farmers over that particular period.  Take the case, however, of the people living in the towns and villages, who depend on the farmer <Col N="1832" /> and whose incomes entirely depend on the prosperity of the farmer.  When the farmer went down, the people living in the towns and villages went down proportionately, but no Department of the Government, no Minister, nor even our public representatives, ever thought of putting the case of these people before the Government. They got no reduction in their rents. Their rates actually increased; the property tax increased very considerably, and in every way their living expenses increased without their getting any subsidy of any kind whatsoever.</P>
    <P>They are the one section of the community, to my mind, that have suffered most during the depression here.  We hear from time to time that there is a Town Tenants Bill coming along; but it never seems to come along, and the fact is that, at the present time, when a person's lease of his house falls in, instead of getting a reduction in the rent, there is an immediate increase.  The townspeople are suffering very severely in that way, and, in addition to that, it must be remembered that business has left the towns.  Owing to lorries, vans, and various other means of transport, the people are not going into the towns now, because their goods are now delivered right at their doors, with the result that business in the towns is seriously injured.</P>
    <P>I can see the time coming&mdash;whether we like to admit it or not, and whether it will be embodied in some future Bill&mdash;when the towns must be de-urbanised. Any town with about 10,000 of a population is incapable of carrying two heavy rates at the present time, that is, an urban rate and the town rate.  We will have to be de-urbanised.  I admit, of course, that where moneys are being borrowed for certain purposes in an urban area, provision must be made within the urban area for the repayment of that money.  In most cases, however, moneys borrowed are what I should describe as self-satisfying, for want of a better word.  What I mean is that the various building schemes, to my personal knowledge, are paying their way, and there is no loss on them. <Col N="1833" /> For instance, there was the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, and to my own knowledge that has been most successful, and the plan has paid its way, and in our area we had not a single penny of arrears in connection with any of the houses built under that plan.  The same applies to the Workmen's Dwellings Act.  The plans there are paying their way, and there will be no loss to any future Administration.</P>
    <P>The position at the present moment is, you have really, as it were, two systems of government in these areas where one should suffice.  You have the urban council in a county, and the county council, and there is no reason why the one body should not suffice.  As things are, the urban areas will not be in a position to meet the dual liability that is on them at the present time.  Perhaps that does not entirely come within the scope of this Finance Bill, but as I understand that there is a Bill to deal with this matter on the way, I should like these considerations to be borne in mind, and that more interest should be taken in the people who live in the towns because something must be done for them.</P>
    <P>As far as the Finance Bill is concerned, I do say, of course, that due consideration should be had to the necessities of the State, and that due consideration should also be had to the amount of money that has to be raised in order to keep up the various services and to see that the money is distributed in the most equitable way possible.  Some Senator who spoke previously&mdash;I think it was Senator MacDermot&mdash;said that the taxes had increased very considerably, and he put the query: &ldquo;What can we see for them?&rdquo; Well now, I think he would be a very blind man who could not see something for these taxes.  If you go down the country, either by road or rail, you can see myriads of lovely new houses springing up everywhere instead of the dirty cabins and mud hovels in which the people had to exist previously&mdash;I say exist, because you could not call it living.  You can see these lovely new houses everywhere, and new suburban districts have <Col N="1834" /> sprung up around all the towns and villages.  The same is true of the rural areas also.  Most of the farmers are either improving their houses or building new houses with the aid the Government has provided through the taxpayer.  That is what we have to see from the taxes.  In the same way, if you go along any country road you can see that, in many cases, where big ranches of land that were run by a herd and a dog existed previously, there are now 10 or 12 prosperous families existing on that one ranch, with nice houses and nice gardens and nicely laid-out fields.  Surely, as I say, he is a very blind person who cannot see that something has been done for the money that has been taken from the people in taxes.  Generally speaking, I think any fair-minded man will say that there is reasonably good value given for the taxes which the people are called upon to pay.</P>

      <P>Listening to Senator MacDermot, who told us that some of us were inclined to look forward some 20 years ago to the time when we would go up in a balloon, and listening afterwards to my friend who has just spoken about the flight from the towns back to the land, it seems to me tolerably certain that somebody is in a balloon at the moment.  Possibly it may be myself.  But to come back to solid earth, I think that if I ask the Minister to restore the £150,000 taken from the Road Fund, to which public bodies fondly look forward, I think it will be agreed that I am dealing with practical politics.  I think it cannot be denied, no matter how much Senator Honan and others may deplore the fact, that there has been a war, and I venture to suggest as a farmer, again on solid ground, an economic war.  I would further venture to contradict the last speaker when he told us that the farmers have their own grievances.  I should say that the farmers have the nation's grievances, and have borne them. How they have borne them is reflected in the fact that there are now 40,000 less agricultural labourers employed on the land than there were six years ago.  That speaks more eloquently than any words could convey the <Col N="1835" /> state of the agricultural industry to-day.</P>
      <P>I think it must be admitted that county councils have been very severely hit by the fact that it is possible to bring forward any scheme that the county may require and that only one-third of the expenditure is provided by the national Exchequer.  The balance must be borne by the rates. The fact that over a period of almost 30 years unceasing demands have been made on public bodies for expenditure of various kinds, has driven the rates from the level at which they stood some years ago to the present impossible position.  We are told, of course, that the annuities have been remitted but that, in my opinion, is no justification for the increasing burdens thrown on local authorities.  The annuities were a fixed figure that could be paid with a greater degree of stability, or solidity if you like, and you knew exactly where you were, but nowadays when you come to pay rates and when you try to look forward for, say, two years, you find it impossible to know where you will be.  Then, as a further embarrassment to public bodies, the Minister comes forward and collars £150,000 out of the Road Fund. It is universally felt that a serious effort should be made to restore that deficiency in the Road Fund.  Although it may not be strictly within the rules of order, I think it is not out of place in this debate to refer to the fact that a sum of £600,000 is being provided to promote the tourist industry.  We, on public bodies, think that it would be far better, in the intrinsic interests of the country, if that £600,000 were spent on some measure to provide remission of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which reference has been made is the depopulation of rural areas.  If people in the towns find it difficult to exist at present, as Senator Honan says, it is due to the fact that there is a scarcity of money in rural areas to purchase the necessaries of life which are sold in the towns.  The lands are left idle and the credit of the farmers is absolutely gone.  Yet, when the Government is asked to implement legislation so that the credit of the farmers may be restored, they decline <Col N="1836" /> to do so.  I think the proper people to ask if rural credit is sufficient are people of the type of Sir John Keane and Irish bankers.  With regard to the development of the country generally, I think Senator Parkinson was on very solid ground when he spoke of the necessity of developing an export trade, particularly to countries like America.  The American people talk beautifully.  We have all friends out there who speak beautifully, too, but when it comes to putting down solid cash that would bring trade to this country, the results are scarcely in keeping with all this beautiful talk.  I think the Minister might take some steps to explore the possibility of extending our export trade with these countries.</P>
    <P>It must be admitted that the chief agricultural output of the country is the cattle trade, and I think that some of this £600,000, which has been spoken of as a contribution towards the tourist traffic, might very well be devoted to the development of the cattle trade.  It is impossible at the present time for an Irish agriculturist feeding cattle beyond the first or the second year into the stage of maturity where labour is required, to compete with the exporter to England, because the exporter to England is buying for a market that has the advantage of a bounty of 5/- to 7/6 per cwt. payable after three months.  If we who are not exactly breeders but feeders, are to be expected to enter into competition with the exporters for the best cattle in Ireland, I think something should be done for Irish feeders to neutralise that disadvantage of 7/6 per cwt.  Further, I think that it is only equitable that the £150,000 which the Minister has taken out of the Road Fund should be restored to our public bodies.</P>

      <P>After the illuminating remarks of Senator Mac Fhionnlaoich and Senator Honan, I feel that my request for enlightenment on Government policy in relation to the Finance Bill has been met, and that I am now free to make my contribution to the debate with a clear conscience.  I also feel rather tempted to speak sympathetically with reference <Col N="1837" /> to the Bill, and to the Minister responsible for the Bill, partly by way of balancing the oratory in this House, because most of the oratory seems to have come from this side of the House, and most of it has been rather unsympathetic. I suppose the Minister would agree that it would be quite possible to disapprove of a Budget of £32,500,000 to be spent on one set of objects, and yet approve of a Budget of £32,500,000 to be spent on a different set of objects.  In other words, there are two aspects of the matter.  One is the amount proposed to be raised by way of public taxation, and the other is the way in which this amount is being distributed by way of public expenditure.  For a full discussion of our financial position and policy, we would need to consider both aspects of the matter together.  However, I am not prepared to go further into that aspect of the matter to-day, as it would take too long.  I shall assume, for the purposes of the rest of my remarks, that the Minister has decided, and that we accept his decision, that in one way or another he must get £32,500,000 by way of taxation, by hook or by crook.  Most of my remarks will be concerned mainly with the wisdom of the various methods which he has elected to use in order to obtain that very considerable sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before coming to that, I should like to point out certain relative figures which ought to be in the minds of all public representatives, and one of them is the relation between public taxation and national income.  In 1929-1930 we collected by way of revenue something over £24,000,000, and in that year the national income, as estimated in the report of the Banking Commission, was something short of £162,000,000.  In other words, taxation represented in that year one-seventh of the national income.  In 1936-1937 the revenue receipts were over £31,000,000.  In that year the national income could not have been much in excess of £150,000,000. In this year I doubt very much whether the national income is in excess of £150,000,000 at all.  In this year taxation must be over £32,500,000 out of a national income which I am estimating at £150,000,000.  Therefore, we have this year one-fifth of the national <Col N="1838" /> income represented by the amount taken by way of public taxation.  In other words, the proportion which the public revenue receipts is bearing to the national income tends to increase.  I am more alarmed by that increase in the proportion which taxation bears to the national income than I am by the absolute increase in the amount taken by way of public taxation.  Because in a situation in which the national income was steadily increasing we might contemplate with equanimity an increase in taxation, or the Government taking year by year a greater absolute amount in taxation so long as the proportion which that represented or bore to the national income was a diminishing one and not an increasing one.</P>
    <P>What alarms me about this Budget is that the proportion of the national income taken in taxation is increasing in addition, of course, to the increase in absolute amount taken.  As things stand at present, we appear to be taking as much of the national income proportionately as our neighbours in Great Britain are taking.  The national income of Great Britain is estimated at £5,000,000,000, and their Budget is well up to the £1,000,000,000 mark. That is a lot of money, and the proportion appears to be much the same as ours, but the proportion with reference to a national income which is more than £100 per head of the population in their case, is a very different thing in comparison with ours, where the national income is only about £50 per head of the population.  If we go on increasing that proportion we are bound to have increasing national stringency and serious economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>Our experience with regard to the national income has been rather an unhappy experience in recent years. I do not intend at the moment to go into the reasons for that.  But I would like to say that other countries whose circumstances were in many respects similar to ours have been more fortunate than we in their experience with regard to their national income in the last six to eight years.  Let us take, for instance, Denmark.  Denmark was badly hit in the crisis of 1931, and by the British commercial policy in 1932, but in 1934 Denmark had reached and passed the national income which it <Col N="1839" /> had obtained in 1929.  The United Kingdom was badly hit in 1931-1932, but already in 1935 the national income of that country had risen to the figure at which it stood in 1929.  Since 1935 the national income in Great Britain has continued steadily to rise. I do not want to hold the British up to admiration in any spirit of slavish imitation.  But I think Senators will admit that, like &ldquo;Old Man River,&rdquo; John Bull does know something.  One of the things which he seems to have done with reference to his financial difficulties was in the first year or two after 1931 when he reduced public taxation.  Then, when the national income afterwards began to rise again &mdash;which it did in 1933&mdash;the public revenue began to increase automatically. Great Britain did not have to increase taxation until some years later, when the armament crisis came upon them headlong.  In Great Britain it is clear that they tried, and succeeded, in keeping down taxation at times when the national income was showing signs of stagnation.  Then when the national income is showing buoyancy there is less reason for keeping down taxation. We in the last six to eight years attempted adjustment of our whole economy in a different way, though to what precisely we have been attempting to adjust it I do not know.  Up to 1938 there was, as our official policy, the effort to obtain a maximum degree of self-sufficiency and industrial development.  But after making the agreement with the British in 1938, we got back our free export market for agricultural produce.  The whole circumstances of our national economy were, in consequence, different, and therefore we required a different kind of economic policy if we were to make the best possible adjustment of our new and happier situation.  For a time we made a certain amount of limited progress.</P>
    <P>Our national income, even after the bleak years 1933-1935, showed a certain slow increase.  That increase continued not as rapidly and vigorously as I would have liked.  But nevertheless it showed an upward trend until 1936-1937.  Since 1936-1937 there are indications of a certain stagnation in <Col N="1840" /> our economic expansion, and certain evidence that the national income has not continued to make a satisfactory increase.  For one thing, according to the information at my disposal, the physical output of agriculture has now sunk again, after having risen between 1933 and 1937.  It has now fallen below the level of 1929.  For another thing, the recently published report of the trend of employment and unemployment gives rise to a certain feeling of disquietude as to the economic value of the protected industries.  There are indications that unemployment is breaking out amongst these protected industries.  We have still further evidence that the number of people employed in agriculture has diminished by 17,000 people in these few years. These are figures which give evidence that the position with regard to economic stagnation is one that gives rise to alarm.</P>
    <P>If the Minister really wants to get £32,500,000 from the taxpayers' pockets, I could suggest various ways in which he could obtain that money much more easily than the methods he has chosen to adopt.  His object is to increase the yield from public revenue. The best way to do that would be to reduce certain rates of taxation.  By reducing the rate of public taxation he can increase revenue.  Why not do it?  To give an example.  In 1929-1930 the tax on boots and shoes imported to this country was fixed at 15 per cent. and the revenue obtained in respect of imported boots and shoes that year was £268,000.  In 1937-1938 the tax was at the rate of between 30 and 60 per cent., with quotas in addition, and the revenue received was a beggarly £42,000.  In the case of clothes, in the earlier year when the tax was between 15 and 20 per cent., the sum of £680,000 came into the public treasury from the import duty on clothes.  In 1937-38, when the tax was at an almost prohibitive level, that amount diminished to £380,000.  In other words, by raising the tax to the region of 50 or 60 per cent. we diminished the yield to the public revenue from boots and clothes by as much as £500,000.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, if he <Col N="1841" /> wants to raise revenue, the easiest possible way for him is to bring down the tax again to something like the 15 or 20 per cent. level, and let us have this easy money from the import of increasing quantities of shoes and clothes.  Of course, the answer that I will get to that suggestion is that we have put 10,000 additional people into employment in making clothes and boots.  But, it does not follow that, if those 10,000 people were not making clothes and boots they would be completely idle. Some of them, at any rate, to my own personal knowledge, are the sons and daughters of farmers living conveniently near the factories where boots are being made, and, instead of looking after pigs and poultry, of acquiring a knowledge of housekeeping duties to fit them to be the future wives and mothers of a race of peasants, of a people devoted to the soil, they are learning the outlook on life of the typical factory worker&mdash;of quick money easily earned and easily spent&mdash;and are probably not developing the kind of virtues that we like to look upon as being characteristically Irish and characteristically rural. Therefore, I do not regard this additional employment of 10,000 people in boot factories as a clear national gain. For my part, I would gladly see less people employed in those projects, provided that the tax was so adjusted as to increase the revenue from the imports of boots and clothes.  I feel that even if they disappeared from the statistics of employment, it would not mean that those people disappeared from the statistics of useful occupations, even though that meant remaining at home engaged on domestic and agricultural work.</P>
    <P>Now, the real cause of our financial stringency is the economic policy that we have been pursuing for the last six or eight years.  I sympathise with the Minister in regard to that, because, in his capacity as Minister for Finance, it is his business to incur all the unpopularity which he must know is the indirect and inevitable result of the economic policies to which he has to give his approval in other capacities. The general nature of our economic policies has been to make it possible for sections of the community to levy <Col N="1842" /> taxation on the rest of the community. In this way each section in turn gets an advantage, but when the wheel has come full circle, and when everybody had had his whack&mdash;his quota&mdash;at the expense of everybody else, we find that everybody is in the same relative position as before, except that we are all much poorer.</P>
    <P>There is a proverb in the North of Ireland, from which country the Minister, like myself, is a willing exile, and it is to the effect that it is an easy thing to be generous at somebody else's expense.  They call it &ldquo;cutting the whang out of another person's leather.&rdquo;  It strikes me that the Government's policy has been directed to encourage one section of the community after another to cut whangs out of the leather belonging to the community as a whole.  In the end they suffer more as members of the general community by this effort of the Government to please one section after another.</P>
    <P>The whole of the Government's economic scheme is subject to the same criticism: how difficult is the effort to raise oneself from the ground by pulling one's shoe laces?  As part of the consequence of this effort to improve things generally by giving each section privileges at the expense of everybody else, we have in fact allowed and encouraged sectional interests to levy, for their own advantage, what amounts to private taxation on the community as a whole. We have had in a public report&mdash;I congratulate the Government on having had the courage to publish it&mdash; clear evidence that the bacon-curing industry was levying as much as £500,000 a year on the community as a whole by way of excess prices for bacon in a recent year.  But bacon is only one of a dozen things.  To-day, certain interests have been put in the position of levying taxation on the community as a whole.  That occurs mostly, of course, in industry.  But it also occurs in agriculture.  Certain sections of the agricultural community&mdash;for example, the dairy producers &mdash;have been enabled to levy taxation on taxpayer-consumers.  In the case of <Col N="1843" /> butter that private taxation may well amount to as much as £1,000,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Then again, we have the case of the 14,000 people who have been given allotments of land at the expense of the taxpayers by way of a dead-weight debt amounting to £600 per person. Those 14,000 persons are really in the position in which they are levying on the rest of the community, including the unsuccessful applicants for land, taxation amounting to a sum in the neighbourhood of £350,000 a year. You get in or about that figure if you multiply the £600 per person by 14,000 and calculate interest at 4 per cent. And so we may go through the whole list and analyse it in detail.  If we were to do that, I believe there would be no difficulty in showing that our economic policy has brought about private taxation which does not come into the public revenue at all but which does come out of the pockets of the consumers, amounting to as much as £10,000,000 a year.</P>
    <P>In other words, our economic policies have diminished the real taxable capacity of the community by some formidable amount which, I think, is at least £10,000,000 a year.  If you want to bring about a buoyancy in the public revenue, and to relieve the financial stringency that we find to-day, what you need to do is to reverse that economic policy and mobilise for real public objects some portion of that £10,000,000 of taxable capacity that has been diverted to private interests.</P>
    <P>One aspect of our economic policy has been the substantial increase in the net industrial output between 1929 and 1936.  It has increased by as much as £8,500,000.  Most of those goods produced at home, under conditions of artificial encouragement in many cases, were of the kind known as &ldquo;consumers' goods.&rdquo;  In fact, we may say that practically all of them belong to that category.  According to the figures given in the Census of Industrial Production in 1936, we imported, in 1929, £33,000,000 worth of goods &ldquo;ready for use&rdquo; which, presumably, means &ldquo;consumers' goods,&rdquo; and in 1936, only £16,000,000 worth of goods <Col N="1844" />&ldquo;ready for use.&rdquo;  In other words, between these two periods the imports of &ldquo;consumers' goods&rdquo; diminished by £17,000,000, but the provision of &ldquo;consumers' goods&rdquo; by our own factories and workshops only increased by £8,500,000, so that from that point of view the community as a whole appears to have been, so to speak, £8,500,000 worth of &ldquo;consumers' goods&rdquo; down on balance.  It had much less &ldquo;consumers' goods&rdquo; to use in 1936 than it had in 1929.  My suggestion to the Minister is that if he wants to increase the yield of public taxation, and, at the same time, reduce the cost of living, all he has to do is to reduce certain absolutely prohibitive and very unproductive taxes.</P>
    <P>I had the curiosity to go through in the financial accounts the list of goods which bear customs duty, and, with reference to some 100 articles, the total revenue yield amounted to less than £50,000.  I do not know how much employment was given in the production of those goods at home, but I doubt very much whether the employment given with reference to that kind of small matter amounts to much, either individually or in the aggregate. It would greatly simplify our commercial tariffs, as well as greatly reduce the cost of doing business and the cost of living, if you could wash out some hundred tariffs which affect small things, and with reference to which no national object is really served.</P>
    <P>Another obvious source of a rapidly expanding yield to revenue would be provided if we could destroy at least three out of our four sugar factories. There may be an advantage in having one sugar factory, in case of an international emergency, to provide us with a certain minimum of that necessity of life, although sugar is a commodity that could easily be imported and stored, and there seems no reason why a nation should not provide against all reasonable contingencies by storing enough sugar to tide over any foreseen emergency.  However, there they are, and it would be a pity, perhaps, to destroy them all, but if you could wash out about three-fourths of the sugar-producing capacity of the country, the imports of sugar bearing <Col N="1845" /> the ordinary customs duty would immediately bring into the public revenue something approximating to three-quarters of a million of money, and the consumers would be paying no more for their sugar than they now pay for mainly home-grown sugar.  In that way, the Minister would find a considerable buoyancy coming to his financial position.</P>
    <P>In the eighth Table published with the Financial Statement, there is an interesting series of figures purporting to show the assistance given by the Government to agriculture.  It amounts in the aggregate to 10½ million pounds, and includes such items as the cost to the taxpayer of the beet subsidy, which is put at about £1,000,000, and the additional yield to the farmer from the growing of wheat, and so on.  Surely this is rather a poor sort of joke.  The growing of beet on some 40,000 acres of land cannot possibly benefit more than a few thousand farmers who happen to grow that beet, and is a positive injury to the rest of our agriculture, because the people concerned have to pay in one way or another more for that sugar than they would if it were merely imported. The same general remark applies to wheat.  Wheat, also, may possibly benefit a few farmers whose land is suitable for growing wheat, but, as it has had the effect of greatly increasing the cost of flour and bread for the rest of the community, including the rest of the agricultural community, the injury to agriculture, as a whole, is far more serious than the benefit conferred on a small section of it.  Similar remarks might be applied with reference to securing a high price for home-grown cereals at the expense of the people who must buy those cereals in order to feed pigs and poultry in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to emphasise again some remarks made by previous speakers on this side of the House about the terrific importance of expanding our agricultural production.  I think the present situation is one in which we should take the fullest possible advantage of our new freedom of export, and that agriculture is and must remain our chief <Col N="1846" /> national asset.  The Minister knows how important an asset it is from every point of view, and not least from the point of view of the building up of our somewhat diminished sterling balances.  I am convinced that there are important directions in which our agricultural production could rapidly and properly expand if only the farmers had the working capital which would enable them to acquire the additional equipment and employ the additional labour which they would need in connection with such expansion. Consequently, I would ask the Minister to give his most serious attention to the scheme for agricultural credit recommended by Senator Counihan, or indeed to any scheme of agricultural credit which would enable our agriculturists rapidly to get under way in the direction of increasing production. With that final request&mdash; almost a petition&mdash;I sit down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of those who have spoken have dwelt on the necessity for reducing expenditure.  They have pointed out that our expenditure has been continually increasing, and that, if it is not greatly reduced, we will have to face a serious situation. I do not think they have looked the facts squarely in the face.  I doubt if they have asked themselves whether it is possible greatly to reduce expenditure in this country.  I agree that it might be possible to make small economies in all departments, and that it might be desirable to do so, but I do not think it is possible to obtain such drastic reductions as would greatly help our financial position. It is easy to criticise expenditure without giving any indication of the lines on which reductions should take place.  It has been suggested, no doubt, that a committee should be set up with the view to devising means of reduction.  At the same time, we all know what the main heads of expenditure are, and any opportunity for a big reduction must be apparent to every member of this House.  I wonder if it would be seriously proposed that we should make a big reduction in the cost of the Army in spite of the international situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that proposal would <Col N="1847" /> be seriously advanced.  I do not believe it would be seriously proposed that there should be a big reduction in the Vote for Education.  The general impression seems to be that it must increase.  I do not believe anyone would seriously propose that there should be a reduction in the agricultural grant, or that there should be a reduction in any part of the Vote for agricultural services.  Nearly everybody who knows the situation is agreed that instead of a reduction there must be a large increase in the money expended on agriculture.  I do not believe it would be seriously suggested that there should be a reduction in housing.  I do not think anybody believes that the Government should reduce the number of houses being built.  Above all, and it is one of the biggest items, perhaps, I do not think it is proposed to reduce the expenditure on unemployment assistance.  In the present situation I do not believe any Government could seriously curtail the expenditure on that service.  It has been suggested&mdash;I am sure everybody would like to see it done&mdash;that, instead of unemployment assistance, work should be provided, but that does not mean less expenditure, but greater expenditure.</P>
    <P>I think, if we examine the situation fairly and squarely, we must realize that expenditure in this country has got to grow.  What we look upon as working expenditure is really more or less capital expenditure.  We got over an undeveloped country.  The economic war and the slump in agricultural prices due to the world situation created a crisis in the history of this country which we have got to tide over as best we can.  Our expenditure on unemployment assistance, housing, and all the rest of it, so far from being regarded as normal, everyday expenditure must be regarded as a capital investment for the future.  The same applies to education and everything else.  I think, looking at the matter squarely, we must realize that, this being an undeveloped country, our expenditure must be increased.  There is no doubt of the fact that there must be largely increased expenditure in respect of agriculture.  Professor Johnston <Col N="1848" /> and several others have pointed out that our only hope for the future is by increasing our exports of agricultural products.</P>

      <P>That is the point with which I am going to deal.  We must realize that that cannot be done without increased capital being available. It has been pointed out that we cannot even maintain our present expenditure without precipitating something like a financial crisis.  We want to ascertain, not alone whether there is a possibility of reducing expenditure, but whether it is possible to maintain the development of this country under the present financial system.  There is no way out of it.  The thing is forcing itself upon us.  None of us would like to do anything rash by any means, but the feeling is growing that there must be something radically wrong in a financial system under which there is such great poverty in a country with such vast potentialities.  It would be worth while to inquire seriously whether any modification of the present financial system is necessary if the country is to progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I ought to begin by congratulating Senator McLoughlin on his excellent speech. I think I might say that it is the best I have yet heard him deliver upon a Finance Bill.  Several Senators, including particularly Senator Sir John Keane and Senator MacDermot, expressed their disappointment that I had not taken this opportunity to make a very full statement upon the financial position of the State and of the community.  I think that that would be to occupy quite unnecessarily an undue proportion of the time of this House.  It is true that, under the Constitution, the Government, through the Minister for Finance, has once a year to make what is known as a financial statement, and that statement is made at the proper time and in the proper place under the Constitution. It is made to Dáil Eireann, which is particularly charged with responsibility for the national finances.  I made that statement six weeks ago&mdash;a very full <Col N="1849" /> statement, I think.  It is on the records of the Oireachtas, and it was accompanied by a very full set of tables which I thought would have enabled any Senator to participate in the debate here on this Bill as effectively as Senator Johnston has shown can be done.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the Finance Bill, I followed the usual custom, a custom which I have not established, but which I inherited from my predecessor, and which prevails as the custom, not only in this House, but as the custom in the Dáil, by briefly explaining the main proposals in the Bill.  I trust that the House will not think it was due to any lack of regard for its position that I failed to repeat here the statement which I had already made in regard to the financial position of the State and, so far as it was relevant, of the country to the Dáil.  Two Senators&mdash;Senator Sir John Keane and Senator MacDermot&mdash;in referring to that statement, asked whether I regard the present financial position as serious.  I do not think that I should allow it to be understood that I accept either &ldquo;serious&rdquo; or &ldquo;grave&rdquo; as adjectives that can be properly applied to the present financial position here.  Undoubtedly, I make no concealment of the fact that it would be advantageous if a retrenchment in certain non-productive expenditure could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Dwyer has pointed out that a great deal more money might be expended here in the improvement of agriculture, in the development of educational facilities and in the development of various national resources. But, in my view, the natural limitations which are imposed upon mankind are such that there is only a limited pool out of which we can draw for all purposes, whether it is to maintain ourselves, to develop our country, or to defend it.  If we have to spend money upon national defence, that expenditure is largely exhaustive&mdash;it is not reproductive.  It may become, in certain circumstances, quite useless, or the things in which it is invested may never have to be utilised, and therefore it may never give any return, economic or otherwise.  But it has to come out of the common pool and, to <Col N="1850" /> the extent that we have to provide for services of that kind, we have naturally to curtail our expenditure on other services, which most people might perhaps regard as being productive and the creators of wealth, or else, as we have in this case, to increase the general burden of taxation upon the community.  But as I was saying, while it would be, in my view, undoubtedly advantageous if expenditure upon these services, which most people would say without question were not productive, could be reduced, and while it is undoubtedly true that, in these circumstances, proposals for further expenditure must be closely scrutinised, and demands for expenditure, even for the most beneficial purpose, not lightly to be acceded to, I do think that to apply the adjective &ldquo;serious&rdquo; or &ldquo;grave&rdquo; to the present position is to do an injury, I am sure unwittingly, not perhaps a grave or serious injury, because the words of politicians, even in the Seanad, are largely discounted by the people on both sides outside, but still an injury to the public credit.  That injury would be much more serious if I were to accept, even by silent acquiescence, the position that there was any justification for applying such an adjective to our position at the present time.</P>
    <P>I have been also asked whether I can see any sign of improvement, whether I think there is any prospect that public expenditure will be reduced, and, with that reduction in public expenditure, that there would ensue a reduction in the weight of taxation.  I have been asked to say whether conditions of credit would be easier, or whether the position of the Exchequer in regard to the raising of public finance is going to be more grave.  I think that those who put questions of that sort to me have, perhaps, lost some touch with the realities of the situation, because to answer these questions satisfactorily, at least to give an answer which would imply a conviction in my own mind, would mean that I should have either to be a prophet, which I am not, or a world dictator, which I am still less.  Of what value would any opinions of mine be upon such a subject?  I expressed my view of the position some six weeks <Col N="1851" /> ago and I have no reason to believe that the position since then has appreciably improved.  Undoubtedly, if this crisis in world affairs should break in war, I think that the difficulties both of the Exchequer and of our people are going to be considerably aggravated, and that it is not going to be an easy thing for all of us to meet and to solve the problems which will then confront us.</P>
    <P>There were a number of miscellaneous items raised in the course of the debate which makes it very difficult to make a considered or connected statement in reply.  Senator Douglas, for instance, suggested that I ought to consider making, in respect of undivided profits retained within a business, allowances similar to the earnedincome relief extended to private individuals. One of the reasons he gave for making that suggestion was that very often the rates of earnings upon these reserves in the business were comparatively small.  If the Senator would consider the matter for a moment, he would see that income-tax takes no cognisance of the rate of earning of an individual.  It takes cognisance only of the amount of the earnings within the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not exempt him altogether when below a certain rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because the assumption is that the individual requires a certain amount for his maintenance. A public company could not be put in that position.  It either pays its way and makes profits, or it does not.  Where it makes profits it does so after maintaining itself, and therefore it is not in exactly the same position as an individual, and the surplus must fall for taxation.  I think that it would be quite impossible to administer a relief of that sort without leaving the door open to evasion. Profits accrue from year to year, and tax is imposed upon the profits as they fall due.  There is no reason in equity, or from the point of view of public interest, that I can see, why, after providing a proper amount for depreciation, any portion of the earnings <Col N="1852" /> of a company should go scot free of tax or enjoy a reduced rate of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>My contention was that this was part and parcel of what was necessary for maintenance.  Otherwise, I agree entirely with what the Minister has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Every company which puts aside reserves does so largely in order to maintain the income of its stockholders or its owners in times of stress, and as a safeguard in the event of its making losses which would not permit of proper provision for depreciation and such matters.  If the reserves are utilised for the purpose of making proper provision for depreciation and wear and tear, I think that an allowance is recoverable from the Revenue Commissioners. But if money is invested in the business for the purpose of extending and enlarging it, and thereby earning increased money for its owners, it is on all fours with any other investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to extend the concession now suggested to the man who invests his profits over and above what he requires for his own maintenance in his own business &mdash;if we were to give him a concession or exemption in respect of income-tax &mdash;we should have to extend that concession to the person who has invested his surplus income, not in his own business, in which the risks would be less because it would be under his own control, but to the man who would invest his money in the business of another man.  That would mean that all profits derived from investments in public companies and in undertakings not under the immediate control and ownership of the individual would have to be free of income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The basic principle in assessing an individual to income-tax <Col N="1853" /> is that he must maintain himself in order to maintain his earning capacity.  The principle in regard to profits is quite a different thing, and you cannot relate the position of an impersonal entity, such as a corporation or a public company, to that of an individual who has to maintain himself.</P>
      <P>I should like to correct the Senator, if he is under any misapprehension, as to how long my interest in cinematography extends.  It extends over a considerable number of years, and my personal interest had nothing whatever to do with the concession granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with considerable difficulty that my opposition to this concession was overcome.  For years it has been pressed upon me, and I opposed it very largely for the reason that some people might think I had a personal interest in the matter. However, the amount is infinitesimal. Senator Douglas made reference to the fact that we have no export guarantee system here, as in Great Britain, and said that if the suggestions of Senator Parkinson regarding extension of our trade with countries other than Great Britain were to be considered, it would be necessary to institute such a system here.  I propose to bring that matter to the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also suggested that the basis of our tariff charges here might be reviewed with the object, I think, of substituting for the existing system, whereby the <i>ad valorem</i> tariff is charged on the invoice of the goods, a system whereby the <i>ad valorem</i> tariff would be charged on the market value of the goods.  That, I think, would lead to a great many difficulties <Col N="1854" /> and would involve a fairly considerable increase in our revenue staff, which would have to be paid for by the general body of primary producers in this country for the benefit of the secondary producers and others.  It would be very difficult to determine, with any relation to the reality of the position, what the Senator has referred to as the &ldquo;fair market value&rdquo; of the goods.  I take it that the fair market value in any country is what the goods in question can be sold for there, or what they are being sold for.  That is the present situation.  It may mean that the <i>ad valorem</i> rates have to be slightly higher than they would be in other circumstances but, whatever the quantum of protection, it has two components&mdash;the <i>ad valorem</i> rate and the basis on which it is charged.  We have a fairly fixed and definite thing under the present system.  It is what people in other countries can afford to sell their goods at here, as determined by the price at which they are, in fact, sold.  We have something fairly fixed, definite and constant.  If we want to find out what that basis is, we do not have to send investigators to other countries.  We do not have to have a sort of jury system or investigation to determine that basis.  It is fixed by the invoice price on the assumption that the invoice is an honest record of the transaction. Having arrived at that, we have only to determine the <i>ad valorem</i> rate.  If we were to change to the basis the Senator recommends we would have two determinations.  We would have to find out the fair market value, which might be a matter of some difficulty.  Unless we were going to have protection on the basis of this assumed higher value, because I think it was mentioned that the fair market value would be higher in particular cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that in all cases.  In some cases it would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On that ground, we have to legislate really for a particular and not a general case.  That would make our legislation cumbersome and inequitable.  If it is only in a particular case in which the <i>ad valorem</i> tariff and <Col N="1855" /> the invoice price would be too low to afford fair protection, and if we were to legislate so as to raise the general basis, we should create a great deal of inequalities over a wide area.  The matter is one that requires closer consideration than I can give it extempore, but I am prepared to have it examined, and to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to look into it from the point of view which the Senator has asked me to look into it&mdash;that is to say, that a great deal of the prejudice that at present exists against Irish manufactures would be reduced if the <i>ad valorem</i> rates could be fixed on the basis he suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if I can undertake to follow Senator Baxter through his long speech.  I note that the Senator felt he had difficulty in speaking on agriculture before the Minister for Finance.  Perhaps, the difficulty might be greater if the rules of the House were more stringent, because I am not responsible for agricultural policy.  I take it that my colleague's policy is the best that can be devised to meet the present situation, and while I am not going to contend that I am competent to defend it, I have not yet heard Senator Baxter offer cogent criticism upon it.  The Senator does occasionally make very sweeping statements.  Perhaps, it might be no harm if at a later stage he would justify some of them to the House.  He said in the course of this debate that no country in Europe showed so little evidence of progress as this country.  I think he was even much more categorical, and said that no country showed so little economic, cultural or political progress.  It would be advantageous, since we are all here in council, if the Senator would take another opportunity of disclosing to the House the facts upon which he bases that statement.  No doubt he must be familiar with conditions in a great many countries&mdash;I am not prepared to say with all countries&mdash;in Europe. Perhaps, comparing conditions there, as he knows them, with conditions here, as they are known to all, we might see whether the Senator, who talked about the functions and responsibilities of Senators, was indeed justified <Col N="1856" /> in stating that there had been general destruction of all moral values in this country during the last four or five years, or whatever period might be covered by his condemnation.  I know that it is difficult to deal with the Senator because he has a dual personality. He is penurious in June but a few months ago, I am sure, he was almost profligate in the expenditure he was asking the Minister for Finance to sanction.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I might refer, because I think it touches slightly upon what has been said by one or two other speakers.  The Senator said that a much better scheme of defence would be the production of more food.  I find it very difficult to appreciate what he meant by that.  If his suggestion is that we have not enough food of the sort that we can produce, in order to tide us over such a critical situation as we would have to face on the outbreak of a general European war, then I take it that is an argument in favour of the Government's tillage policy, and is really a call to us to increase and to intensify our wheat production campaign, as well as the campaign for the production of beet sugar.  With the exception of these two commodities I do not think there is any essential article of food of which there would be any shortage in this country in the event of a European war.  We certainly supply our won beef, butter, eggs and milk.  We might have to go on short commons in regard to wheat, but perhaps we might make that up with some other cereal.  The only real necessary of life of which there might be any shortage would be sugar.  Tea we might be able to do without.</P>
    <P>I think that if Senator Baxter really believed what he said, he will take an early opportunity of telling the people that he has become converted to the policy of the Minister for Agriculture in regard, at any rate, to wheat and beet.  It may be that the Senator thinks, perhaps, we might be even more drastic in our efforts to ensure a full supply of these essential commodities in the event of a European war, and that he would really wish, indirectly, to advocate making <Col N="1857" /> tillage compulsory.  I do not know whether that would meet with general acceptance on the part of his farming colleagues who sit on those benches. I know that I would feel a great deal of reluctance in going before the people of the country upon such a policy.  Perhaps that is what Senator Baxter has in mind.</P>
    <P>I hope, when he is making this comparison of conditions here and conditions in other European countries which I have asked him to make, that he will be good enough to open his mind a little more to us in regard to the expression of opinion which he has given. My own view in regard to this matter is that by all means we ought to increase production, but it must be production of the kind which we can dispose of at profitable prices.  My view is that once prices are right, the production will follow.  I feel that once prices are right, the credit for which Senator Baxter has been clamouring, and for which Senator Counihan has asked, and which Senator Johnston has begged me to extend, will be extended by the normal organs which have been built up over generations for the provision of such credit by the banks.  Once the prices are right, and once we can have production at a profit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The one covers the other.  Price is a comprehensive term. As I have said, once the prices are right&mdash;and, naturally, that means that once there can be production at a profit&mdash;then the credit position can quite easily be solved.  I may be wrong, and I may be a bit conservative, but I have seen many people go down because, to use a colloquialism, they have bitten off more than they could chew, commercially as well as in other ventures.  Whatever our difficulties may be at the moment, the best way of getting out of them is to work with the resources that we have in our hands and endeavour to save a little.  If our resources are not much, then let us not rush off to become a borrower.  Let us try to save a little <Col N="1858" /> and to expand our resources.  There may be special circumstances which have to be considered.  It may be that there are peculiar circumstances that have to be considered, and special people who may have to be helped.  I do not favour any large expansions, in an ill-considered way, of any facilities we may possess.</P>
      <P>We hear quite a lot about credit for farmers, and credit for this and for that section of the population.  The Senator referred to a statement I made that the farmers have £35,000,000 on deposit.  There is £35,000,000 on deposit in the Irish banks.  That money may belong to the small farmer, the large farmer, or the middle-class farmer.  I think, in fact, that that £35,000,000 is very largely built up of small deposit receipts of one sort or another.  The bulk of the depositors in the Irish banks are not the big Irish farmers.  I rather think the depositors in the Irish banks are very largely the small Irish farmers, the men who have built up a nest egg, who have earned the money pretty hard, and who have entrusted it to the banks for safe keeping, knowing they will get a small allowance on it each year, and knowing it will be there in case of emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk about our resources, our investments and our deposits.  I do wish most sincerely that we would stop misusing the possessive adjective in that way.  We hear talk of our deposits and of all these millions, when the fact is that most of us who talk in that way do not own one penny of them.  Mostly they belong to the small man, the other fellow, who has put them there for safe keeping and who trusts he can rely on them in an emergency.  Very often what are we asked to do here with the moneys of these people, who have put their funds in the banks in order to be held there in safe custody, and so that they may be available when they want them?  We are asked that we should give that money to somebody who thinks he has a right to it and who has no such right under God.  Many people, through self-denial, prudence and foresight, put by a little money which they entrust to the safe <Col N="1859" /> keeping of the banks so that it may be available when the need arises.</P>
    <P>I do wish that we would try to get rid of the type of request I have referred to, because the fact of the matter is this, that this cry for credit for this section or that section of the population is fast becoming in the months of Senator Baxter and those others who follow him, a cry for confiscation and expropriation.  That is what it is becoming, and it is time that those who profess to speak as leaders of public opinion in this country should make quite clear what this might ultimately involve.  Supposing that we were to say that the banks would have to give this or that or the other thing, this amount or that amount, to this section or that section, do you think that the other sections of the community are going to stand idly by when they see these funds ladled out for the use of one or two privileged elements in the community?  Not at all.  They will soon start extending their hands, and what will be the consequence?  The small man, who has put that money in the banks for safe keeping would do what the small man did in France and what the small has done in other countries. I do not like to start pointing the finger at one country or another, but the small man would do what the small man has done in countries all over Europe, and further afield than Europe; he would start taking his money out, and he would make certain that no one except himself would use it, and when that happens the last state of public and private credit would be infinitely worse than the first.</P>
    <P>When we come to realise that there are certain rights involved in this question of credit, rights of private property, no matter how praiseworthy is the purpose for which that credit is demanded, it is only then we are going to get a proper spirit in the country which will tend to make us go ahead and prosper and be able to build ourselves up in the same way as did the people whose fathers and grand-fathers were serfs on the land, whose fathers and grandfathers had to work pretty hard to eke out a miserable existence here.  They, through their <Col N="1860" /> efforts, have become the owners of the soil in this country, and are the masters of their own destinies.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is described in its Title as an Act to make further and better provision for the encouragement and development of the tourist traffic and, for that purpose, to establish a board having certain wide powers.  In the opinion of the Government, the time is opportune to develop in a systematic way the holiday resorts of the country and to reorganise the business of catering for holiday-makers.  It is believed that many considerable benefits can be obtained for the country and, more particularly, for transport undertakings, for those who are concerned in the business of catering for holiday-makers, for the farming industry, and for many other similar classes more directly dependent on the expenditure of holiday-makers.  Furthermore, the holiday habit has grown considerably amongst all sections of the people and it is desirable, from every point of view, that they should be encouraged and facilitated to provide themselves and their families with suitable holidays in this country.  There is also the important business of attracting holiday-makers from other countries to visit this country and the provision of suitable and adequate accommodation for them if our efforts in that direction should prove successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the Tourist Traffic Bill is, as defined in the Title, to make better provision for the organisation and development of holiday traffic and <Col N="1861" /> to set up a tourist board having the necessary powers and having the necessary funds to deal with every phase of the problem.  The full significance of the tourist business in the industrial life of a country, although well recognised on the Continent, for more than a generation, has, until recent years, aroused comparatively little interest in this country or in the neighbouring country of Great Britain.  In France, immense sums of money are made available from the public purse, not merely for purposes of publicity, but also for the development of health and pleasure resorts, and the improvement and expansion of hotel accommodation.  In Switzerland, catering for visitors is the principal industry, and the amount invested in hotels in that country is probably not less than £50,000,000. Germany, in recent years, has provided a special currency for tourists and imposed serious restrictions on the expenditure of her own nationals when travelling abroad, while Italy has maintained a costly system of propaganda for the attraction of visitors, who are also accorded special transport and other facilities.</P>
    <P>These are a few of the indications of the important place which the industry fills in Continental countries, and the lesson has not been lost either on the other side of the Atlantic, in America, or in the Far East.  Canada's tourist revenue is one of the principal factors in her trade and good relations with the United States of America.  The New England States, and California and Florida, owe much of their prosperity to carefully-organised plans for attracting visitors from other parts of the country.  In Japan, they have established a tourist association, concerned mainly with publicity, and a tourist bureau providing a ticket sales organisation at home and abroad, during recent years.</P>
    <P>By comparison with other countries, England has lagged behind, but the lost ground is being quickly recovered, if it has not been already fully recovered.  The stimulus was provided by the remarkable growth of the holiday habit, to which I have referred and which is an outstanding feature <Col N="1862" /> of our times, and one that seems destined to become more marked during the next ten years under the influence of social legislation bringing to the workers the advantages of holidays with pay.  In this country the possibilities of the industry have not been entirely ignored, more particularly during the past 14 or 15 years, during which useful work has been done by the Irish Tourist Association, but it has to be recognised that the measures taken have proved inadequate and that something more must be done if Ireland, with its great natural advantages as a health and pleasure resort, is to reap the harvest it might reasonably expect from that rich source of invisible income.</P>
    <P>State intervention for the promotion of the industry here dates from the enactment of the Local Government Act of 1925.  That Act empowered local authorities to strike a rate within prescribed limits and to apply the proceeds to the advertising of their own health and pleasure resorts. Alternatively, with the consent of the central authority, a local authority could contribute the proceeds, in whole or in part, to an association formed with the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the purpose of advertising Irish tourist centres in general.  The funds thus contributed could be expended by an approved association only on schemes sanctioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and these schemes were restricted to advertising in its commonly accepted forms. It was felt that the funds could be expended more advantageously by an approved central organisation, and such a body came into being when the Irish Tourist Association was incorporated as a public company in 1925. Throughout its career of 14 years the Irish Tourist Association has been hampered by want of sufficient funds, even for its strictly limited programme. The association's position, however, was strengthened when the relevant section of the Act of 1925 was replaced by the Tourist Traffic (Development) Act, 1931, which still remains in force. That Act, however, aimed at little more than the repair of the obvious defects <Col N="1863" /> of the earlier legislation.  It gave the Minister wider discretion in the expenditure of contributions from public bodies, and went some distance towards securing a more stable income for the association by making it obligatory on local authorities which elected to strike a tourist rate to contribute the proceeds in full to the association, save in exceptional circumstances. It also empowered local authorities to contract with the association for a contribution of the proceeds of the tourist rate for a period not exceeding five years.</P>
    <P>Except for what has been done in the ordinary way of private and commercial enterprise and by sporadic and often unsystematic local effort, the Irish Tourist Association remains the only organised machinery for promoting the development of the holiday business.  The total annual revenue of the association is about £18,000, made up of £14,000 subscribed by local authorities and £4,000 received from other sources, mainly from advertisements and subscriptions from hotel and transport interests.  Its activities, in the main, are confined to advertising and to hotel inspection.  That small revenue is clearly insufficient for publicity purposes alone, and, in point of fact, money has never been available to the association for advertising in important countries such as the United States of America, Australia and other countries where we have racial connections and good will.  Increased publicity, however, must fail in its purpose unless there is a sufficiency of suitable accommodation for every class of visitor, and it is precisely in that respect that our arrangements for holiday-makers are open to the most unfavourable criticism.  We have, of course, a number of first-class hotels and boarding-houses, but taken as a whole the accommodation is entirely insufficient and, to a large extent, in need of modernisation.</P>
    <P>In the matter of ordinary amenities and essential public services, Irish holiday resorts, in many instances, are lacking, and no serious effort is being made to repair the deficiencies.  In some places, local authorities have no <Col N="1864" /> borrowing powers to meet the necessary capital expenditure, while in most of the resorts the only local authority is the county board of health which, not unnaturally, is concerned with more general problems.  A special weakness is the absence of suitable accommodation for the man with strictly limited means.  No effort has been made to cater for the worker and his family, a class of traffic which, under a proper system of organisation, might well be expected in constantly growing volume, not merely from this country but also from other countries. It must be expected that holidays with pay legislation will release a substantial block of such traffic which, in the absence of suitable facilities and attractions, would be diverted to places like Blackpool and the Isle of Man.</P>
    <P>Figures relating to tourists' traffic must always be quoted with great reserve but, from the best information available, it would appear that the annual value of this traffic is in the neighbourhood of £2,500,000 sterling, while the annual expenditure of our own nationals touring abroad is estimated at £2,000,000.  The net gain which these figures reveal cannot be regarded as satisfactory.  The Government has reached the conclusion that it is not in the public interest to allow the existing conditions to continue and that the time is ripe for the introduction of more effective machinery for the promotion of this important industry, having regard particularly to the holiday facilities required by our own people and keeping in mind also the international situation and the specially favourable position of this country from the point of view of the holiday-maker. After a full examination of the whole problem, the Government is convinced that in view of the complexity of the work to be done and of the expedition desirable in its execution, the best prospect of recovering the ground to be made up lies in the creation of a board vested with wide statutory powers and having sufficient funds to carry through an intensive programme.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House outlines the machinery which, in the Government's opinion, is best calculated to place the industry on a satisfactory <Col N="1865" /> footing.  The principal proposals in the Bill are the creation of an Irish Tourist Board charged with the responsibility for dealing with every important phase of tourist development, State subventions to the funds of the board, a system of compulsory registration for premises described or holding themselves out as hotels, guest houses, holiday hostels, holiday camps and youth hostels; the grading and registering of premises; the control of certain hotel signs and advertisements; the compulsory exhibition of price lists in registered premises; machinery for constituting an area as a special area in which exceptional powers may be exercised by the board, and the amendment of the Tourist Traffic (Development) Act, 1931.</P>
    <P>Part I deals with the general powers proposed to be given to the Irish Tourist Board, which will consist of not more than five members appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Section 14 defines the general powers conferred on the board. It empowers them to assist financially in the provision, extension and improvement of holiday accommodation, to build, establish, equip, or to operate or to assist financially or otherwise in building, establishing, equipping or operating hotels, guest houses, hostels, holiday camps, etc.; to provide or assist financially in providing, services, sports, amusements and other facilities likely to improve holiday traffic.  Financial assistance may take the form of a loan.  The board are empowered to maintain amenities and conditions likely to affect tourist traffic, to engage in publicity work, and to publish guide books or other holiday literature, and to provide or to assist in providing for the training of persons who may be engaged in work connected with holiday traffic.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16 deal with the State contribution to the funds of the board, consisting, firstly, of a nonrepayable grant, not exceeding £45,000 a year, to cover administrative and other expenses, and a second advance, not to exceed in the aggregate £600,000, to be applied to works, investments <Col N="1866" /> or loans under the Act of a profit-earning character, save as may be otherwise provided by the Minister for Finance on the recommendation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The annual grant is intended to supplement the normal revenue of the board from registration and other fees, and will be devoted to administrative and publicity expenses, estimated roughly in the proportion of £20,000 and £25,000 per annum, respectively. Apart from that non-repayable contribution, the Bill provides for advances to the board not exceeding in the aggregate £600,000, which are to be repayable and which will be devoted to works of a capital or profit-earning character.  It is, however, provided that the Minister for Finance, on the recommendation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, may waive repayment of expenditure on works which, through of a capital nature, may not be capable of yielding a financial return, as, for instance, the provision of amenities, sanitation, etc., at centres in which the necessary finances cannot otherwise be provided.  An annual report will be furnished by the board and laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The accounts of the board will be audited annually by auditors appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the balance sheet, profit and loss accounts and auditor's report will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and will be printed for sale.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with the establishment of a compulsory registration system for hotels and other similar institutions, in accordance with standards to be prescribed by the board. As from a date appointed by the Minister, it will not be lawful to apply these descriptions to premises which will not be registered.  Part IV of the Bill empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to declare an area a special tourist area, by order to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and to authorise the board, in respect of that area, to establish registers of boarding houses, and other forms of residential accommodation, camping sites, restaurants, cafés <Col N="1867" /> and similar establishments, cinemas, theatres, sports grounds, band promenades, premises in which games or entertainments are provided for the public, and similar places of public entertainment, and local transport services. The Minister can also grant powers to the board to enable them to preserve amenities and to restrict the erection of advertisements.  He may also confer upon the board powers in relation to the provision of guides, beach guards, attendants at parking places, and so forth.  In granting these special powers, the Minister will have regard to any special claim which may exist under the Town and Regional Planning Act.  The intention of that part of the Bill is to safeguard in a special way the interests of parts of the country which are holiday centres, and to ensure their more ordered development.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill provides for the amendment of the Tourist Traffic (Development) Act, 1931, so as to increase the rate that may be voluntarily levied for tourist publicity from 1d. to 3d. in the £ in the case of county boroughs.  While the rate for other local authorities has not been raised, it is expected that these will, as a result of the increased benefits to all parts of the country from increased tourist traffic, endeavour to extend the amounts voted for tourist publicity purposes within the limits of the maximum rates already laid down in the Act.</P>
    <P>The second amendment transfers from the Minister to the board control of the expenditure of moneys contributed by local authorities for tourist publicity purposes.  That step is dictated by the general aim of the Bill, which is to hand over full responsibility for tourist development to the Irish Tourist Board.</P>
    <P>The final amendment is designed to overcome a difficulty arising out of the definition given to the term &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; in the Act of 1931.  The effect of the amendment will be to enable public bodies which are not embraced by the definition to contribute, if they are so disposed, to the funds of the Irish Tourist Association.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1868" /> I recommend the Bill to the Seanad. It is a Bill which has received the welcome of all sections and all parties, and although some differences of opinion have arisen concerning some of its provisions, there were no such differences concerning its general principle.  Any proposals voiced here for the amendment of the Bill will be carefully considered. I do not regard it as a contentious measure, and I would be very glad to receive the assistance of Senators in the improvement of it, so long as the general aim as set out in the title of the Bill is borne in mind.</P>

      <P>I cannot claim to be a section or an organisation.  I can only speak as an humble individual, and I wish to say at the outset that although I naturally support the ideals of the Bill, which I am sure appeal to everybody, I cannot see my way to support the machinery in the financial proposals that are embodied in that measure.  The Minister and I had many encounters on broad principles of State organisation versus private enterprise. We began that a good many years ago, and I return with increased confidence in the support of private enterprise.  I think the records of the last few years have shown that in the matter of this country in only one instance has State control justified itself, and that is in the case of the Electricity Supply Board, which, I admit, I opposed at the outset.  I think there is nothing in the whole of the evolution of this State for the last ten years to lead us to believe that we are going to get things better by a system of State control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This board is given very considerable statutory powers, and it is analogous to a Government Department.  I am not going into the minor details, but is there any reason to believe that it is so necessary?  Surely in the last few years the tourist traffic has gone ahead very considerably.  It is only this desire to hurry things and the belief that things will go much faster by State regulation that seem to justify this Bill.  It would be much sounder to go ahead slowly, to let experience develop, to give credit&mdash;not State credit, but credit through the ordinary <Col N="1869" /> system of banking&mdash;and assistance to those people who are successful.  I do not believe that by spending a lot of public money the tourist traffic is going to develop more quickly.  I know that in Switzerland, which is a great tourist country, the standard of the hotel management is infinitely higher than anything one sees in this country.  I refer to the general standard.  There may be individual exceptions.  That is not a question of money, in my opinion.  It is a national tradition of the Swiss to be hotel-keepers.  If I really wanted to improve the hotels in this country I would rather subsidise one or two Swiss to come in here and run hotels.  I believe that would do far more good.  Of course, if the Swiss were brought in here on favourable terms there would be a public outcry that we were handing over our resources to aliens, and all that kind of thing.  One of the advantages they have in Switzerland, which Senator Douglas referred to already, is the concession in petrol.  That costs money, but it is a simple thing to administer.  It does not require a board.  Another advantage in Switzerland is the concession on railway fares.  That does not require a board. It may require money.  I believe a great deal could be done without any of this elaborate machinery.</P>
    <P>My main objection to it is that with a heavy and growing financial burden upon us and with the report of the Banking Commission that there is danger ahead of a growing deterioration of the financial position of the country, I think it is very unwise to spend £600,000 of public money to be devoted to this industry, some of which I feel sure, will never come back again, and, in addition, to spend £40,000 or £50,000 in an annual grant.  Where are we going to economise?  Everybody is alarmed about these economies and the Government is saying that nobody offers a suggestion.  I believe this expenditure is unnecessary.  If we had plenty of money it might be worth the risk, but in the present position it is unnecessary to spend all this money.  I believe the tourist industry will grow of its own accord.  For that reason&mdash;I may <Col N="1870" /> be playing a lone hand&mdash;I cannot accept the principle enshrined in this Bill.  I do not think it is going to do good commensurate with the money involved.  I doubt if it is going to do very much more than is done at present.  I realise there are attractions for tourists in this country.  I do not want to discriminate and I do not want anyone to suggest I wish to discriminate, but Switzerland has certain attractions which this country can never have.  Switzerland has winter sports which are an enormous attraction and which can never be available here.  I do not think we are justified in believing that we can ever attain to a position comparable with that of Switzerland.  Therefore, though I quite agree with the ideals of the Bill, I think it is a very unwise expenditure of public money, and I very much doubt if this elaborate machinery is going to effect the purpose that the Minister believes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather against this Bill myself, but the speech we have just heard has furnished a number of reasons for being against the Bill, with none of which I am in sympathy.  I am entirely and wholeheartedly in favour of the development and the encouragement of the tourist traffic in this country.  I have sufficient courage and sufficient belief in the people of this country, and in ourselves, not to be a bit afraid, from the point of view of the Irish language or of Irish nationality, of any influx of tourists from any country, and if the Minister or the board can help to get us, not every class of tourist, but a decent class of tourist to spend money, I am all for it.  Like another Senator who has spoken here I am not so sure that the machinery in this Bill is worth the money or will accomplish the purpose which the Bill sets out and which the Minister has in mind. Before I go into that I would like to put on record that as far as I am concerned&mdash;and I think I speak for a number of those who are interested in the revival of the Irish language and who are passionately concerned over the survival of the natural Irish speakers in this country&mdash;I do not believe that the Irish language is a tender plant which will die if wind from the outside plays on it.  If it is as tender as that, no action of any Government or of any people can save it.  The notion that the Gaeltacht is a place where the people must be kept in a <Col N="1873" /> reservation like Indians are kept in North America, is absurd.</P>
    <P>I know several Gaeltacht areas extremely well&mdash;I know two well and one extremely well&mdash;and the notion that visitors from outside are responsible for the decay of the language is entirely false.  The decay comes from inside, from the people themselves, and from the normal home conditions, and not from the special conditions that obtain when tourists are present. At any rate I feel that there is no danger at all to our nationality in the tourist traffic.  As a matter of fact, I am sure that the Senator who has just spoken would agree with me that if we were more distinctly national and the Irish language more widely spoken and Irish customs and practices more widespread than they are, the country would be the more attractive to visitors.  Therefore, it seems to me you can develop a distinctive Irish civilisation and foster it, without in any way interfering with&mdash;but rather helping&mdash;the tourist traffic.</P>
    <P>The Senator, for example, told us that we ought to encourage forestry. There is no reason why we should not encourage the tourist traffic also.  The blunt fact of the matter is that if we develop the tourist traffic we are going to get the bulk of our tourists from England.  Now, things are happening in England at the present moment which are preventing that development. The Minister and his colleagues by their conduct in not so recent times are not without responsibility.  Even recently their speeches on Partition made a contribution to the present position.</P>
    <P>When one goes to England and drives in a motor car&mdash;I never drove in a motor car there&mdash;the first thing, driving through any part of England on Easter Monday or any time of the year, that strikes one forcibly is that if those English people were brought over to the good Irish roads which are practically empty, they would never go to the continent of Europe again.  There is enormous scope for development here.  Picnicking on the road between Waterford and Kilkenny on the last Saturday in <Col N="1874" /> August, I remember spending about an hour and a quarter on the roadside and the only things that passed in that time were three asses, one motor car and one lorry&mdash;and the motor car was an Irish one.  But, as regards the particular machinery set up in this Bill I myself feel that the Minister is only following a tendency which existed before he came into office, which has been strengthened very much since he came into office and which is a world tendency&mdash;to take power more and more into the hands of Governments, which, in effect, means taking power more and more into the hands of civil servants, or persons who are to all intents and purposes permanent civil servants.</P>
    <P>That is a very lamentable tendency, but one which perhaps cannot be avoided.  A board, when it has been set up, has many defects, and one of the principal is that its enthusiastic members begin to think that their business is the most important in the State. Experience of most boards is that, if they have powers, they want to exercise them.  This board is to have a most extraordinary variety of functions. Endeavours were made in the Dáil to find out precisely what the Minister had in his mind about the board, and I think I am not being unfair to him when I say that he was able to shed no light whatever on the question of what the board was going to do.  His position in a nutshell is: &ldquo;Here is a beautiful country.  We ought to have more tourists.  Here is a board and here are very ample powers and money for them. Do not ask me what they are going to do.&rdquo;  That is a very dangerous position for us.</P>
    <P>There are a great many things that could be done to encourage tourist traffic, for example, low taxes, low rates, low costs for hotel keepers and low costs of transport, and a healthy financial position which would enable us to make concessions to tourists, such as are made in other countries, with regard to petrol and railway and bus fares.  All these things would help tourist traffic, and none of these things would require a board, but all these things have been, in fact, worsened <Col N="1875" /> considerably, rather than improved, by the present Government.  We have higher costs of living, higher taxes, higher rates and, instead of improving the roads, the Minister for Finance, the colleague of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is at the moment engaged in robbing the Road Fund and has made a promise that he is going to destroy it in its entirety.  It is quite possible that we are going to set up a board which will set out to do big things, while a number of small things remain undone.  The Minister is going to have the appointing of the board. That is inevitable.  The Minister, I think, has already stated that he is not sure whom he is going to appoint, but we have a great many precedents to go on and we can be pretty certain that the Minister will appoint political friends of his own to the board.  There have been occasionally persons found, accidentally perhaps, who were quite good members of a board, but, in the main, the policy of the Government has been to pick their political friends, put them on boards and pay them salaries for being on the boards.</P>
    <P>The board is going to have a staff which is going to pick itself because the Minister thinks the machinery of the Civil Service Commission or the Local Appointments Commission is too slow. I think the machinery of these commissions could, in special cases, be speeded up.  I have some experience myself, and I know that, on occasion, they can be fairly rapid, and can break through a good deal of the red tape which is perhaps wrapped around a good many of their normal activities. But here we are going to have a board composed entirely, if we are to be guided by recent operations, of political friends of the Government.  They are not necessarily politicians, but, being a rather intelligent person myself, I think I have already seen in the precincts of this House candidates for membership of this board.  I am sure the Minister has met them and I am sure that he is not entirely pleased to see them all. That board will appoint inspectors. There are a great many hotels in the country to which practically nobody but <Col N="1876" /> Government inspectors go.  I was in a hotel one night and there were seven of them, and if the Minister made judicious inquiries in Government Buildings, he could get more information about hotels than any board could gather in the next ten years.  Civil servants are the mainstay of certain hotels in the country, inspectors of local government, inspectors of education, and inspectors of various kinds doing various things, doing them together and in the same hotel, or rather from the same hotel.</P>

      <P>By, with or from the same hotel.  There must be a great many reports already available, and, as a matter of fact, I believe there is a special association of civil servants who have to travel and who have special information about hotels.  Their information would be very valuable and would not require the setting up of a board, or the expenditure of this very big sum of money.  The growth of Parliament was a struggle by certain people against a strong Executive, but the modern development of Parliament is that, without turning a hair, Parliament hands over millions of pounds to Governments and to boards to spend and, in effect, loses all control over the spending of that money.  That may be an inevitable development, but it has brought dictatorship in many places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of things that would make for the improvement of tourist traffic&mdash;confidence and peace here, and rational relations with our nearest neighbours, who, I am told by every class of hotel keeper and by everybody who makes money out of the tourist traffic, are the people who are pleasantest to deal with, who spend the most money, and who, as Senator Sir John Keane said, are coming here in increasing numbers.  I was in a district near Dungarvan last year and I was frequently on the road from Dungarvan to Youghal and Cork.  The amusement of my youngsters in the car was to make out the letters of the English cars such as DOG and SAX. <Col N="1877" /> There was an immense number of English cars last year, and, without any expenditure by a board, that number could be increased by a rational form of government and a rational outlook on the part of the Irish people.  I agree that great improvement has been made in other countries, notably France and Italy, by Government intervention in the hotel business.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that we need accommodation for every class of visitor and that accommodation is insufficient at present.  I wonder is it insufficient?  My experience is that we have quite a sufficiency of what is called first-class accommodation which, putting it in another way, means accommodation which charges you first-class prices.  There is quite a good deal of that, and it is quite good of its class, but we have very little accommodation at all which is good and clean and reasonable in its costs. Perhaps the reason for that is that we have such a small fall of people here. If our accommodation is insufficient, I wonder how are we going to make it sufficient and, at the same time, profit-making?  The season is very short.  That perhaps is due to our climate.  I do not think there is any difficulty at all in getting into a hotel, even in our crowded resorts, in June, July or September.  Certainly, I have experienced no difficulty at all in September. You can turn up anywhere you please, even in the most beautiful parts of the country, and have no difficulty in getting accommodation.  I do not know whether the board could do anything to prolong the tourist season here, but, if it does not, it seems to me that we have sufficient accommodation, because it is not an economic proposition to increase your accommodation enormously merely for one month in the year.</P>
    <P>There are many other things that could be done.  I think there has been an enormous improvement in hotels. Whether it is due to the circumstances of the country, or to the Tourist Development Association, or to some other influence, I do not know, but there seems to me to be a very big <Col N="1878" /> improvement in recent years.  What I feel is the worst feature of all of Irish hotels is the complete lack of any welcome when you get there.  When you reach a hotel in France, and particularly a small hotel, the man who owns the hotel and his wife are there, and they have the appearance and the behaviour which suggest that if you had not arrived that evening on the 6 o'clock train, they would have died, that they would not have been able to last out the night in the absence of this visitor from Ireland.  When you go into an Irish hotel, you stand in the nall.  After a while, a girl passes by and you say: &ldquo;Hello.  Could I have a room?&rdquo; She calls &ldquo;Johnnie&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Johnnie&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tommy&rdquo; arrives.  I have had that experience on several occasions and the worst of that experience is that it happens in an hotel which otherwise is extremely good.  If it were a bad hotel, one would not mind.  When a thing like that happens in an hotel which is really a good hotel I think you have cause for complaint.  These are small points and they require very little money to remedy.</P>
    <P>I suppose there is no doubt that this Tourist Traffic Bill will become law and that the tourist board will be set up, but I think the Minister should certainly allow the posts under the board to be filled by some machinery other than the board itself.  I agree with all the Minister's arguments about business. But there is a difference between the staffing of this board and the selection by a businessman of his assistants. The businessman can dismiss his staff. He hires them quickly and he can fire them quickly.  But we all know that the staff of this tourist board will not be fired quickly.  I think that staff should be hired by machinery which could give fair play to all comers and not by machinery which would leave these posts open to influence and pull.</P>
    <P>With regard to the expenditure of money there is a very considerable sum involved in the end.  I do not know whether in the circumstances of Ireland and England at the moment and in the European circumstances, we are going <Col N="1879" /> to get very much out of that type of expenditure.  For example does anybody think that it is possible to start in this country holiday camps on a large scale?  I very much doubt it. But I would like to see a development of the tourist traffic which would bring people who are not wealthy and would enable them to spend their money without having to spend it in the very biggest hotels.  That seems to be the greatest flaw in the present situation. It is a well-known fact that if a civil servant who gets the low scale of allowances and the head of a Department in the Civil Service arrive together in a town they must both stay in a very good hotel or in a very bad one.  If anything could be done to improve that situation it should be done.</P>
    <P>I think there is in this Bill nothing that contains any danger whatever to what is left of our ancient civilisation or to the Irish language.  Steps can be taken to see that no such danger arises. I think we should have confidence in ourselves rather than in endeavouring to put up some kind of wall around this country.  The people who will strongly object to that wall are the people who live in these tourist Irish-speaking places, people who want to live a normal life and get a share of what is going.  I do not think we are going to do any good by keeping their share of what is going from them.  A number of things under this Bill will be dealt with on the Committee Stage.  Like the Senator who spoke last I do not propose to divide the House on the Second Reading Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to confess that when I first made contact with the Tourist Traffic Bill I was not prepared to give it a hearty welcome. That was principally because I thought it ill-timed and premature.  Ill-timed in a world whose tempo is set to the fierce pace of the race for rearmament, whose interests are rather in A.R.P. and bomb-proof shelters rather than in tourist accommodation and attractions. Premature in a nation like ours, which has not yet had time to make a national clean-up of the litter of the past, to <Col N="1880" /> clear away the debris of the old dilapidated house and build itself a new house, fit not only for heroes but for tourists whose standards and demands are much more exacting.  Indeed, I envisaged our position as that of the tenant of a half-finished house inviting his friends and neighbours to come and stay with him though neither the cooking equipment nor the plumbing is properly installed and the domestic staff is not yet recruited and may be not recruitable.  So, for all the millions of visible and invisible incomings tourist traffic holds <i>in esse</i> and <i>in posse</i> for our country, I thought this Bill could very well wait and that the £645,000 it proposes to place forthwith at the disposal of the board, to be set up under it, might for the present find a more urgent national need to satisfy. But perhaps I was misled by the title of the Bill and the connotation of the word &ldquo;tourist&rdquo; which dominates it. That word made me think only of visitors from other countries as if the Bill was designed for their beguilement to our shores, while I should rather have been thinking, as the Minister has been thinking, of our own people, of the hundreds of thousands of our workers who, in consequence of the social legislation for which he is mainly responsible will enter this year into the enjoyment of the right to holidays with pay.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of that legislation, the health and refreshment of our working population would be largely nullified if there was no proper provision for their accommodation and no thought to provide amenities and attractions.  Amenities and attractions for the refreshment of our tired workers will mean, I hope, if we have a board with the proper outlook, a great and permanent improvement in our own country, a general &ldquo;spring-cleaning,&rdquo; a clean-up of unsightly rubbish heaps, a toning-up in our standards of cooking and house-keeping, both public and private.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For this big and exacting programme the personnel of the board must be carefully chosen, and I am sure the House will agree with me when I say that it is of the utmost importance, in <Col N="1881" /> view of the nature of their task, that there should be at least one good woman amongst them.  Most of our Senators are married men.  That is in keeping with traditional Senatorial wisdom and for them, therefore, I need not labour the point.  They will know that the &ldquo;woman's eye&rdquo; with its quick sizing-up of requirements and possibilities is distinctly needed for the kind of work the board is to do.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties that the development of tourist traffic will have to face is the finding of an adequately trained staff for hotels, hostels, camps, etc.  The hotel industry in this country is greatly hampered by the scarcity of trained workers.  I note with satisfaction that one of the powers of the board under Section 14 (8) is to &ldquo;provide or assist in providing schemes for the training of persons to do work which is wholly or mainly connected with tourist traffic.&rdquo;  In so far as these workers are needed for the domestic side of tourist traffic it will be most desirable that there should be on the board a woman with experience and proved capability in this field.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be wise, too, in selecting the personnel of the board to choose people who know that the best way to bring visitors to our shores, to please them when we get them, to make our own workers' holidays pleasant, invigorating and refreshing is to keep this land of ours &ldquo;kindly Irish of the Irish, neither Saxon nor Italian.&rdquo;  We have qualities and gifts that only need strengthening and developing to make our country a haven of peace in a hag-ridden world. We have a lovely land, but we have allowed its beauty to be disfigured by our own neglect and carelessness.  We have the best food in the world, but we spoil it often by careless and ignorant methods of cookery or what is worse by a stupid attempt at copying other people's methods.  We have the grandest people in the world, but they often spoil themselves by trying to pass themselves off as imitations of other people.  Nobody wants imitations. Everybody wants the real article.  Let the aim of the tourist <Col N="1882" /> traffic board be to develop Ireland's attractions and amenities on genuine Irish-Ireland lines and the hopes the Minister places in this Bill and the risk he takes in providing so much public money will be justified.</P>

      <P>It has appeared from the course of the debate that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was, perhaps, a little optimistic in his belief that this Bill was going to get through without any opposition whatever. A good many of the speeches already made have indicated fairly considerable opposition to the principle of the Bill.  Even speeches which tended to accept the Bill in principle contained so much criticism of its general terms that they might almost be regarded as expressing opposition to it.  I find myself in the rather peculiar position on the matter of being largely in agreement with Senator McGinley.  I dislike the whole idea of this Bill.  In the first place, I think that a great deal of what is proposed under it will lead to the waste of money on objects which, in the long run, will be found not to be worth the money.  In the second place, I believe that the machinery proposed to be set up under the Bill, even if we grant that a certain amount ought to be done for the development of tourist traffic, is entirely excessive for the purpose in view.  Senator McGinley attacked the Bill on the grounds that we in this country cannot, at the present time, afford the sort of highpower mass development of tourist traffic that the Bill envisages.  I must say that, in spite of all that Senator Hayes has said, I find myself in very considerable agreement with Senator McGinley.</P>

      <P>It is all very well to say that we ought to hold our heads up: that we ought not to be afraid of having things changed, and that we are not such a tender plant that we can be destroyed by such a thing as tourism. The fact is that the Gaeltacht&mdash;again, with all deference to Senator Hayes&mdash; is an area which will be very closely <Col N="1883" /> involved in this matter, and it is a very tender plant.  When you find yourself in the position that you have to pay the people in the Gaeltacht areas to speak their own language, surely that is a sufficient indication that you cannot afford to take the sort of risk that is involved in this go-getting development of tourism.</P>
      <P>It is a well-known fact that already the colleges that have been founded during the last 30 years in the Irish-speaking districts, in order to bring non-Irish speakers to those districts, although animated by the best intentions in the world have contributed quite a good deal to weaken the position of the Irish language, and to destroy it in some cases where it existed.  As regards certain parts of Kerry, I have heard it said, again and again, that the enthusiasm of entirely well-meaning people who go down there from Dublin to learn the Irish language and crowd into certain country districts, has already gone a long distance towards destroying the Irish language entirely.  You are dealing with a thing that is extraordinarily delicate: a thing that has been attacked already, and that is being continually attacked in spite of whatever may be done for it every other day.  You are dealing with a thing that is so delicate, that has been so much attacked and weakened already, that anything more done to weaken it may very easily be the last straw&mdash;may give it the final blow which will destroy it altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe quite seriously that if the development contemplated in this Bill takes a certain form, if all the money that it is proposed to hand out to this tourist board is spent in a particular way by enthusiastic, earnest, gogetters and tourist developers in certain parts of Ireland, it certainly will end in a short time in wiping out entirely all that is left of the native speech and the native habits and ways in those areas.  The parts of the country that are going to be affected by this measure are, to a very large extent, the parts that, to my mind, in spite of what Senator Hayes has said, had much better be left alone.  Senator <Col N="1884" /> Hayes talked with a certain amount of sorrow, I gathered, about the roads. It seems that you still find roads in parts of the South of Ireland where you only meet a motor car once in every 20 miles.  Apparently, Senator Hayes thinks that is a bad thing: that it ought to be done away with, and that we ought to hate strings of motor cars going end to end, say, from Waterford to Cork, and from Dublin to Waterford, and when we have reached that happy state of affairs at a cost of £600,000 to the country, plus £45,000 a year, then according to him we shall have reached a state of perfect felicity.</P>
    <P>Personally, it would rejoice me to think that even the main roads of Ireland were such that you would only meet a motor car once every 20 miles. I look forward with horror to the idea of this development taking such a form &mdash;becoming so intense that you will have strings of motor cars filled with tourists &mdash; whether from England, Dublin or Cork, it does not matter where they come from so long as they come from urban centres&mdash;scattered all over the country, and all the time helping to give the countryman the idea that he has far too much of already, the idea that he is stuck there, an unfortunate living in misery on the land, and that the only happy people are those that he sees careering along the roads in motor cars, chars-a-bancs and motor cycles.</P>

      <P>Sensible business people, who do not know the first thing of what they are talking about, are inclined to think that these ideas are childish and foolish, but that is the sort of development that has led every country in Europe to the edge of barbarism. The big cities, business at all costs, motor cars, speed and all the energy that is expended in going around in circles&mdash;that is the kind of thing that has half barbarised the world already.  If we are to have any chance at all in Ireland of creating anything of our own, for heaven's sake let us keep away this excessive development of tourism.  If you like to <Col N="1885" /> have a certain amount of natural holiday-making, I do not object to it, but, even then, anyone who lives on the outskirts of Dublin is familiar with the masses of people who are vomited out from the city for the week-end, spoiling the country for miles around, putting up huts, scattering orange peels and papers, and ruining everything around them.</P>

      <P>I would not allow them into the cities to begin with.  We have a system here&mdash;Senator McEllin thinks it is modern development, and civilisation, and so on, but, fundamentally, it is crazy&mdash;by which we bring up all the healthiest and best young people from the country and give them poor jobs in the towns, and when we have them in the towns we pass elaborate legislation and spend a lot of money to enable them to go out and destroy the country.  That is exactly what we are doing, and we seem to think it is healthy, sensible, and intelligent.  I regard all this tourist development as one of the greatest dangers we have to face.  It might be all right if tourism were allowed to take its normal course. Even then, take the North of Ireland as an instance; most Senators are familiar with places around Belfast, places like Portstewart and Portrush, where they have not needed all this elaborate expenditure of money, because they have a natural instinct for all that sort of thing, because they are Anglicised small-town people and have developed that kind of tourist amenity to the fullest extent.  You have places like Bangor, near Belfast, and it is just the same as any other 20 dozen small English towns, with everybody in a bowler hat, going to the pictures in the evening, looking at the lovely amenities, seeing the bathing places, and all the rest of it.  The Minister talked about losing a lot of tourist traffic to places like Blackpool.  The remedy for that is apparently to have a lot of Blackpools of our own.  If people are anxious to go to Blackpool, I would <Col N="1886" /> far rather see them going there and leaving me alone to enjoy peace and quiet at home.</P>
      <P>Even if you concede that a certain amount of tourist development may do no harm&mdash;mind you, I think a small amount is calculated to do no harm, but I am very doubtful whether we have not more than enough already&mdash; it seems to me that the machinery being set up by this Bill is wildly excessive. You are getting a sort of one-sided development, due to the one-sided energy of one or two people who are more or less professionals in this matter, people who are very keen on it, and have been able to &ldquo;put it across&rdquo; on the Minister and his Department.  Suppose I, on the other hand, were to go to the Minister to-morrow morning and tell him I wanted £45,000 a year, and £600,000, in order to build University College, Dublin&mdash;in order to do a thing which has been left neglected for the last 30 years since the British Government washed its hands of Irish University education; in order to take the young students of this country and give them an adequate building in which to do their work and pursue their studies, instead of having them stuck in Earlsfort Terrace against Lord Iveagh's back wall &mdash;I would be thrown out.</P>

      <P>That is only one of scores of things infinitely more desirable and infinitely more necessary, if we are going to have civilised people in this country, than all this one-sided tourist development and invitations to people to come over here instead of going to Blackpool.  If you took that £600,000 proposed to be made available under this Bill and made it available for developing the Gaeltacht as a place to live in for the people who are there, or made it available for promoting the use of the Irish language, you would be doing a far better thing for the country.  Senator Concannon talked about the necessity for getting good cooks in hotels.  Suppose the money were spent on a scheme which I think was put up to the Government long <Col N="1887" /> ago, a scheme for taking Irish speaking girls from the Gaeltacht, training them in nursing and cookery, and making them fit to take up positions in families where they are wanted to teach the children to speak Irish, as well as doing other work, you would go a long way towards solving at least a part of the problem of the Gaeltacht. If you were to spend £45,000 a year on it, you certainly would go a long way towards solving it.  To my mind, the idea of spending all that money, in the present circumstances of the country, on such a very equivocal benefit as this tourist development, is not worth considering, and I would be ashamed to give a vote to a Bill of this kind.</P>
      <P>There are scores and scores of other projects far more apt than this is to do good to the country.  Then take the present conditions under which it is proposed to set up this board and spend all this money, when almost every week we are threatened with a European war.  We do not know at what moment the war clouds will burst over Europe, and we will have to cease everything connected with tourism for six or eight years.  Suppose that in six months or a year&mdash;after we have spent a good deal of that money, after we have set up a board and given it funds &mdash;we have a war, and no tourists come, where will we be?  It is a most unfortunate time, from that point of view, to indulge in such extravagant expenditure as this.  Even from our own internal point of view, considering all the difficulties we have recently gone through, considering the position of our farmers and of the ordinary workers up and down the country and how hard they are finding it to make ends meet, it seems to me that we could very well afford to postpone this expenditure for quite a considerable time, at least until our export and import trades have to some extent righted themselves, and until we know where we are as an economic proposition, which we are far from knowing at present.  I do not think you could pick a more unsuitable moment than the present for this kind of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an alternative to all this national expenditure and all this expansion of <Col N="1888" /> bureaucracy, which will probably do no good at all, I would suggest that we should attempt to make the hotel-keepers organise themselves.  You have here an industry, so called.  The Minister spoke about it as an industry with invisible benefits.  I must say I have never been able to see very clearly where the benefits come in, except to one or two classes of the community. The hotel-keepers are the principal beneficiaries.  The railway companies may benefit to a certain extent.  Whatever benefits the railway companies get, in all probability the rest of the community loses by reason of the extravagant development that this sort of thing would entail.  Why not make the hotel-keepers themselves get together and, if money is necessary for developing the hotel industry, put up the money out of their own pockets? The Minister for Finance told us this afternoon how unhealthy it was to talk about extending credit to farmers.  He told us how much better it would be for the farmers to spend their own money. Why not make the hotel-keepers spend their own money on their own industry, and in their own interests?  If we say that the tourist industry is of value to other classes of the community, surely to heavens the agricultural industry is of far more value?  The whole community depends on it, and yet, whenever a proposal is made to spend a farthing on agriculture, it is met with lectures about propriety and morals from the Minister for Finance.  We are prepared to spend money on an entirely problematical pseudo-industry, in regard to which we have no guarantee that any benefits are going to come to anybody, except perhaps to a small and relatively unimportant section of the community.  We will not spend money when it is a question of the biggest industry in the whole country, an industry which, as everybody knows, has been particularly hard hit in recent times, and is very badly in need, if not of extensive credit, at least of a breathing space, so that the industry may get a chance to recover.</P>
    <P>No matter how much tourism you have, and no matter how much the benefits of holidays with pay are extended, it still remains&mdash;and I hope <Col N="1889" /> always will remain&mdash;a fact that the big majority of the people of this country are farmers, people who do not go out on holidays with or without pay, but stay at home on their land and in their own houses.  It is towards their benefit that all national activity and all public expenditure should be directed, and I would suggest that if the other interests in the country, like the hotel interest, want an organisation to help them, there should be some way of compelling them to organise themselves for their own benefit, and spend their own money on it, before calling on the public for the expenditure envisaged in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Senator who has spoken has had his own faults to find with and his own doubts about this Bill.  I certainly have mine, too, and I have listened to several Senators voicing theirs.  Without going into the political objections in the political speech of Senator Hayes&mdash;because to my mind it was one of the most sinister&mdash;I wish first of all to give my own remarks on the smaller items of tourist traffic.  I understand that this Bill&mdash;I do not say mainly, but certainly it is my interpretation of it&mdash;is to help our own tourists, or our own visitors. from place to place within the country. I am sorry Senator Tierney is going, because I intend to speak on a point which he referred to sarcastically a while ago.  I want to speak of the traffic from Dublin to the strands in the vicinity.  That is tourism on a minor scale.  These people spend money, even if it is given to costermongers who sell them stuff at the seaside. If the Bill does not cover facilities for people visiting seaside resorts or coasts in the vicinity of cities and towns, it will not serve a purpose which I would like it to serve.  If any Senator visits Dollymount strand with me I will show him the outrageous condition in which that strand is maintained. On a day like Whit Monday I suppose 10,000 people visit that strand.  The first thing they see towards the middle of the Bull Wall is a 6 ft. by 4 ft. notice stating that anyone bathing there is in great danger of drowning.  There <Col N="1890" /> are five of these notices along the strand put up by the Port and Docks Board who, I understand, have no interest in anybody going there.  In fact, I expect they would prefer to keep the people away from it.  Within 100 yards of the first notice, the corporation have put up shelters to facilitate people bathing but, as I say, the Port and Docks Board have put up a series of notices stating that anybody bathing there is in grave danger of drowning.  Several people have been drowned there.</P>
      <P>I live in the vicinity and I am satisfied that it is owing to these notices that people do not know the places where there is real danger, and there is a real danger.  Senators have heard of Curley's Hole from reading of accidents in the papers.  As a matter of fact, there is no Curley's Hole there now; it is perfectly safe there.  Yet there is a notice there telling you to beware. There are also other notices along the strand at places where there is no more danger of drowning than there would be on the floor of the Seanad.  There is at present a channel there which is positively dangerous.  When the tide is going out there may be only one foot of water in one part, but if you go in further it is like walking off the bank of a river&mdash;you will drop into three or four feet of water.  Children playing and chasing one another might drop into four feet of water and be drowned. I suggest to the Minister that in this Bill we should make provision for the people visiting such places as that.  I do not know whose property it is&mdash; whether it belongs to the State.  It does not belong to the corporation, although they have spent a good deal of money in improving the amenities there by concreting the Bull Wall and erecting bathing shelters.  I feel very strongly about the position of thousands of children for whom there is danger there.  There are notices in places where there is no danger, but actually they are in the presence of danger where there are no notices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one mention of life guards in the Bill and that brings me to what I often thought would be a solution of this question.  There are sea <Col N="1891" /> scouts and other voluntary organisations of that kind in the vicinity of many towns and cities and it might be possible to get these scouts to take on the job of safeguarding strands like Dollymount, which possibly 10,000 people visit, as I say, on a day like Whit Monday.  They would probably voluntarily accept the service of guarding that strand during the bathing season.  They could be placed where the danger is greatest.  I have bathed in many districts in the country and there certainly are places where there is danger if a person does not know the strand.  A proper system of marking or guarding these strands would be an immense improvement.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Board of Health have made many improvements in Portmarnock, Rush and Skerries.  That brings me to the question of family tourism, as I will call it.  I certainly agree with Senator Tierney when he states that he does not wish to have Blackpools or Douglases in this country.  It would appal me to think that such a thing would develop here and I hope it will not develop from this Bill.  I might as well say that I have never spent a holiday across the water, except the holidays I spent there at the expense of the British Government when I was under lock and key.  But I have heard so much about the tourist resorts there that I would not like to see anything similar developing here.  The village of Rush for a family holiday is one of the nicest places you could get.  I mention that because the same thing applies to many districts in the country, especially in the Gaeltacht.  I would ask the Minister to see that the board will consider the provision of facilities for families visiting such resorts, whether for a holiday or for educational purposes, as in the case of Irish colleges in the Gaeltacht.  There are some facilities afforded at present, but not to the extent that I should like to see for families who visit them for educational purposes as well as for pleasure.</P>
    <P>I now come to a point which I should like an assurance from the Minister <Col N="1892" /> will be covered and that is in connection with associations with branches in Ireland and in Great Britain whose annual meetings are sometimes held in Ireland and sometimes in England. Provision is available through the municipalities in England for the reception of these conferences.  I do not think that there is any such provision in Ireland; it does not obtain in Dublin, at any rate.  It should be within the province of the tourist board to grant facilities to the Irish branches of these associations to entertain and provide for the reception of the members visiting this country.  If such a thing were provided for it would facilitate many associations, which have branches both in Ireland and in England, in coming here, and many of them who have come here before are very anxious to come again.  I have not touched at all upon the other points as to the board or government because other Senators have referred to them. Senator Hayes referred to the board from the political point of view assuming, because the present Government is in office, that everybody nominated on the board and every employee will be a political partisan.  I do not think that that is Senator Hayes' experience. I am afraid he is just using it as political propaganda.  On the other hand, I do not see why, because one is a supporter of the Government, that should prejudice him.</P>

I am neither impressed nor convinced by the arguments adduced against this Bill this evening.  I shall not delay the House, as I intend to speak on the Committee Stage, but I, for one, welcome this Bill. I am perfectly sure that if some of the Senators who have already spoken had been associated, as I happen to have been, with the development of the Irish Tourist Association in the last 14 years, they would not have submitted to the consideration of this House the arguments to which we are compelled to listen this evening.  Do they admit that this industry is a great industry? They will have either to admit or deny that.  As to the details of their arguments, these are matters for consideration and, perhaps, arrangement by the Minister.  The county councils of this country, bodies of hard-headed business men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The county councils of this country for the last 14 years or 15 years&mdash;bodies who toil hard and whom I have tried to defend here&mdash;must have been convinced that this was an industry beneficial to the whole community because, during all these continuing years, they have subscribed not liberally but just sufficiently to maintain the nucleus of an organisation and to help the initiative, the courage and the vision of the men who laboured in one of these rooms in O'Connell Street to bring this industry to the position in which we find it to-day&mdash;a great, progressive and developing industry.  But our funds were limited.  Thirteen years or 14 years ago, the entire revenue at the disposal of the Irish Tourist Association to create contact not only <Col N="1894" /> with England but with other places was in the region of £10,000 or £12,000.  In recent years, it ran to about £14,000. That was the limit of the revenue at the disposal of the men who constituted the tourist association.  We felt that the time had come for Government intervention so that we might be brought out of the deadlock that had been created.  A few years ago, we sent our general manager to make a tour of the great United States and to broadcast the attractions of this country so as to excite the interest of tourists from that country who were coming to other parts of Europe and spending very lavishly and generously there.  It would surprise Senators to know the absolute apathy and ignorance of a great part of the western portion of America and of the States about the beauty spots and attractions of this country and of the many other things that bring tourists into a country.  Consequently, I say the time was ripe and most opportune for the intervention of the Government so as to take over a work in which we had reached the maximum of our effort.  We could not develop any further as regards the attraction of tourists from England, America and other countries. We had reached the limits of our resources.  Therefore, I personally welcome this Bill.  It is really a piece of belated legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was really amazed to hear the contradictions of the speeches here to-night.  One suggestion was that this Bill was going to destroy the spirit of the Gaelic movement.  Another was that tourism would have a deleterious effect on the Irish people and the life of the country.  Another Senator said that it was one of the greatest dangers in modern times.  Still another Senator said that the hotel people should be called upon to throw in all their energies and resources in the development of their organisation without Government interference.  I wish to tell Senators that hoteliers have thrown a very considerable amount of energy and money into this business in harmony with the efforts of the Irish Tourist Association. It was by their unified efforts that that association was brought to the maximum <Col N="1895" /> of success.  I hold that it is imperative on the Government to come in and show that they appreciate and visualise the importance of this great organisation which we, as representatives of the county councils, constituted over a period of 14 years.  It is an industry which is set into agriculture. I am absolutely convinced of that.  Hoteliers have done everything conceivably possible in energy and finance to help the steady growth of this industry for a period of 14 years.  They have reached the maximum of their efforts and, perhaps, the limits of their purse.  I hope to have some other comments to make about details of the Bill, particularly Section 5, but I shall postpone them until the Committee Stage.  I happen to have been one of the pioneers of this organisation.  A few of us met in O'Connell Street and, largely due to the skill and organising capacity of the general manager, implemented by the efforts of the members of the association, we made it what it unquestionably has been&mdash;a success.  As I have said, the limits of success, so far as we are concerned, have been reached and we want the Government to take a due and proper interest in the development of this industry.  I welcome this Bill and I think we ought to be grateful to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for coming in even at this belated hour, to help this industry to greater prosperity.</P>

This Bill has been brought before the House for the specific purpose of developing tourist traffic.  Under these circumstances, we are entitled to deal with it by asking whether the Minister is using that money in a proper fashion for the development of tourist traffic.  A Bill that could bring on the same platform Senator Cu Uladh, Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Professor Tierney is certainly a remarkable measure.</P>

      <P>B'fheidir nach bhfuil.  I am convinced that Senator Cu Uladh's speech, like the curate's egg was good in spots, but the spots were very few. I have no doubt that the money would be very valuably spent in the development of forestry, or in the development of fisheries.  I see no reason why it could not be spent usefully and successfully in the development of these industries.  That is not saying that it could not be spent in the successful development of tourist traffic.  Even a voluntary organisation has developed that industry to a point that is very remarkable.  I have no fears, such as Senator Cu Uladh had, as to the difficulties that people speaking the Irish language will have if there is an influx of tourists into those areas.  I do not believe the Irish language will suffer or that Irish culture or Irish development will suffer from such an influx.  Are the French people different because people who speak different languages go there?  Anybody who does not know French can get a booklet in Wool-worth's in which they will find passages that will enable them to say &ldquo;Parlez vous; donnez moi&rdquo;.  Why should people who go to the Gaeltacht not have phrase books with &ldquo;Dia agus Muire dhuit; tabhair dom é sin; ba mhaith liom mo dhinéir d'fháil.&rdquo;  Perhaps that would induce these people to have a different outlook in the Gaeltacht, just as there is a different outlook about France.  Senator Tierney told us that the Irish people had to be paid now to speak their own language. <Col N="1897" /> Does the Senator think that by cutting off this source of revenue from them at the present time they are more likely to speak their own language?  Does he think that by keeping tourists out of the Gaeltacht the people there are more likely to speak their own language?  Would not that have the opposite effect?  If Senator Cu Uladh wants to carry his ideas to a logical conclusion he should abolish the Fianna Fáil Party, or 75 per cent. of it, and, possibly, with the exception of two, should not let any Ministers speak west of the Shannon.  He should prevent English-speaking institutions and a very important national institution going to the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Ní feidir é sin do dhéanamh. We heard it suggested that farmers should get consideration.  I agree. I suggest that farmers are going to get some consideration from the expenditure of the £600,000 and the £45,000.  I live in a county that has many tourist resorts, and I know that farm produce will be bought as a result of tourists coming to these places.  I know that in Lahinch, Kilkee, Lisdoonvarna, Spanish Point and other districts, farmers will benefit because tourists go there.  All this talk about the Irish language being injured and Irish culture being injured by tourists is superstition&mdash;nothing more and nothing less. I heard some Senators refer to Blackpool, to Brighton and to Douglas. What is wrong with Brighton, Douglas and Blackpool as tourist resorts in England?  Must we always put moral barbed-wire around our people to prevent what has been described as the deleterious effects of tourist traffic? Should it not be our ideal to develop Irish character so that it could resist such influences?  Should it not be the ideal to develop Irish character so that it would be able to resist anything from outside sources that would be demoralising rather than to be putting up barbed-wire?  I have no use for that kind of thing.  I think the Irish language will survive even the Tourist Bill, or any other Bill that is brought <Col N="1898" /> in if we are in earnest about it.  What is wrong about the development of the Irish language is that it is not extended from the schools into the homes, and I suggest to Senator Cu Uladh, with all his knowledge, and his undoubted earnestness about the revival of Irish, that he should set himself the task of having a bridge built joining the schools and the homes, and to see what effect that would have on the Irish revival.</P>
      <P>I read the Minister's speech in the Dáil carefully as I was anxious to find out what exactly is his policy respecting the Irish Tourist Association.  I was listening on one occasion to the Minister and I thought his speech was the funeral oration of the Irish Tourist Development Association.  I wonder if that is right.  Is the Irish Tourist Association to be killed, is it to be asked to commit suicide, or is it to exist as a distinct and separate entity? I notice that the board to be set up under the Bill is taking power to carry on all the activities of the present Tourist Association in regard to publicity, hotel registration, etc.  But I can see no provision in the Bill to give the board authority to transfer its power to another institution.  That is the only way I can see the present association existing, that the board that is being set up would have such powers and would carry on the work of the Tourist Association. There are interests concerned in the Tourist Association which should be considered.  For instance, there is a staff, and there are many other things that should be considered.  Are the members of that staff going to be dispensed with, and will no consideration be given to them?  They are highly trained&mdash;they comprise a most efficient staff.  The Minister ought to give us some idea whether the Tourist Association is going to die, or is going to be kicked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I had not listened to Senator Cú Uladh, Senator Sir John Keane, and Senator Tierney I probably would have had to content myself with asking these few questions.  I am satisfied that there is an opportunity here for the development of roads in the <Col N="1899" /> tourist areas and the expenditure of a considerable sum of money in that development.  I am satisfied there is an opportunity for the development of swimming facilities, hotel accommodation, the prevention of coast erosion, and the advancement of other things connected with the tourist industry where the expenditure of the sum contemplated could be carried out with benefit to the unemployed and to many of the farming community.  I am satisfied that this Bill is one that can do much useful work.  I should like the Minister to make quite clear what he proposes to do with the existing organisation that did such remarkably good work during the few years it was in existence.</P>

It was quite obvious that Senator Madden was speaking on a subject with which he was fully conversant, and he was definitely convinced as to what benefits could derive from this measure.</P>

    <P>Many of the things I had intended to say in support of the measure have been said by Senator Hogan.  I agree with what he said with reference to the speech made by my friend, Senator Cú Uladh.  I believe there is no danger whatever to come from the further development of the tourist industry in this country.  I believe the people can withstand such developments as even the most optimistic of us can visualise. I believe the people in the Gaeltacht will not be influenced in the slightest by any influx of visitors which may come as a result of this measure.  Some people may say that that is not so, and it has been pointed out by other <Col N="1900" /> speakers that situations in other countries can be compared with the situation which may possibly develop here.  All I can say with regard to the language is that one of the principal tourist countries that we know is Switzerland and, notwithstanding the very heavy influx of visitors from England and other countries into Switzerland, that has not in the least affected the people there from the point of view of language.  They still boast they have four languages, and those languages do not include English.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Hogan pointed out, it is possible for people to get along in any country, irrespective of the language of that country.  It is possible for visitors to do their business and get their meals and, if anybody is influenced as a result of the visit, it is the tourist and not the native of the country or State.  I believe this is a very desirable measure from various points of view.  If I were to look at it from the purely material standpoint &mdash;and I may say that that is an aspect on which the Bill has been criticised by the speakers who expressed themselves in opposition&mdash;then I would say without any hesitation that it deserves the support of Senators.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening speech, explained that the outside tourist industry was worth about £2,500,000 and, even confining it to our own citizens, it was worth something like £2,000,000. The expenditure proposed under this Bill consists of an annual grant of £45,000, plus an advance of £600,000, which is to be repayable.  I do not want to go into the mathematics of the thing, but I think any reasonable man looking at the figures will agree that the money proposed to be advanced is very definitely, so far as anybody can judge, a good investment.</P>
    <P>People have criticised this Bill and said it is ridiculous to spend that much money on the development of the tourist industry.  It would be just as reasonable for a man to criticise the expenditure of 10/- or £1 on a fishing-rod to catch £5 worth of fish.  I am sorry to find men, otherwise regarded as very sensible persons and sound <Col N="1901" /> businessmen, trying here to justify a criticism along those lines.  I do not believe it can be justified.</P>
    <P>With regard to the people who live in our own country, I believe it is as important to keep them here, to induce them to take their holidays in their own land, as it is to induce people from outside to come here.  As the Minister pointed out, we already have legislation providing holidays for various sections of our people.  I believe it is only in keeping with Government policy, following up Government policy already implemented, to develop our holiday resorts and our tourist industry and to try, if possible, to keep every possible penny of Irish money in this country.  Apart from that, there is the possibility of bringing in people from outside, inducing people who would normally take their holidays in other European countries, to spend their money here.  It is an extraordinary thing to find people, who tell us at other times that we should increase our revenue here and develop various industries, criticising this measure, suggesting it is a bad and insane policy to induce people to spend money in Ireland.  I do not believe in that and I doubt very much if those people seriously considered the measure before they made speeches of that kind.</P>
    <P>This Bill has also been criticised on the ground that it is the intention to compete with existing hotels.  I have read the Bill pretty carefully, I have read the Minister's statement in the Dáil, and I have listened to him here, and it must be quite evident that such is not the case.  As I take it, the intention of the Bill is merely to supplement private enterprise rather than compete with it, and if in certain places private enterprise is looking after the tourist industry as far as it is necessary to do so, then I do not believe it is the intention of the Minister, or will be the intention of the board, to interfere.</P>
    <P>I believe that a lot of good can be done by the proper development of the tourist industry here, and while I do not propose to go into the various things which could be done, I think it <Col N="1902" /> must be quite obvious to every Senator that there is very great room for improvement in existing conditions.  We have, as various Senators pointed out, some very good hotels in the country; we have some very good roads in the country; we have some very good fisheries here and many other very good things; but still I think every reasonable Senator will admit that there is plenty of room for improvement. The purpose of this Bill, as far as I can see, is to see where such improvements are necessary and, as far as possible, to remedy any such defects as may exist.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan has referred to the various things which could be done.  It is quite reasonable, I suppose, to say that several other things could be done in the country, but I am glad to see that, while Senator Hogan took advantage of this measure to refer to things that could be done, he was wholeheartedly in support of the measure and took the attitude that the measure is a good one and said, in effect: &ldquo;therefore, I support this Bill.&rdquo;  That was his attitude, but I am sorry to say that it was not the attitude of some of the other Senators who spoke. Senator Tierney made what I considered a most extraordinary speech. He made some very extraordinary suggestions. First of all, he suggested that, in the case of this Bill, as in the case of various other Bills, it was merely a matter of some enthusiast on some subject or another coming along and, in the wildness of his enthusiasm, putting something over on the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not know whether or not the Senator ever tried putting anything over on the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but I have and I know what has been the result.  It is ridiculous to make such statements.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the Minister came here to the House fully prepared to receive practically the unanimous congratulations of the members of the House.  However, he does not seem to be very worried because the Bill met with opposition from a few quarters from which he did not expect it, but it was quite reasonable to surmise that <Col N="1903" /> the Minister came here and expected to get out of the House in about an hour and a half and that the only delay that he could possibly meet with would be that a few people would insist on congratulating him.  In the Dáil, from every part of the House, people stood up and said that they believed that this was a good measure and that it was long overdue, and that the result of this would be to help, not alone the hotel proprietors, but the various other sections of the community.  Now we have Senators here saying that it is ridiculous to spend all this money on tourism while we have the farmers and workers in such a position and while we have various other people in such a position.  My attitude with regard to this measure is that, if and when it is implemented, it will benefit every section of the community.  I believe that we cannot have an influx of tourists here, that we cannot have a great development of the tourist industry here, without benefiting the hotels, and that we cannot have any great benefit to the hotels of this country without having a similar benefit to the workers of the country by way of employment.  I believe that we cannot have an influx of tourists without having a proportionate benefit, if you like, to the farming community&mdash; to the people who will be providing vegetables, fish, and other commodities. I believe that the proper development of the tourist industry cannot but help to react advantageously on practically every section of the community.</P>
    <P>Now, I was about to leave the House in order to have a cup of tea when Senator Sir John Keane took the floor, and I must say that I was amazed at his opening remarks.  He apparently set out to criticise the Bill because he objected to State interference.  The Senator went on, as far as I could hear, or as far as I could gather, to point out that this was really unique as far as tourist development was concerned in most countries in the world.</P>

      <P>I am open to correction <Col N="1904" /> if I am wrong.  He did not say it in so many words, but he went on to say that the tourist industry in Switzerland was developed to a very great extent without State interference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I stand corrected, but that is what I gathered.  I have pointed out several times already that there is something wrong with this House as far as sound is concerned. However, that was the general impression I got.  I should like to point out to the Senator that the same kind of State interference, if you like, exists in Switzerland; that the tourist industry there is run by the Federal Railways there; that the Federal Railways are, of course, a State institution, and that similar interference, as far as State interference is concerned, exists in France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Russia, Poland, and perhaps in a few other countries which existed 24 hours ago, but which may not exist at the moment.  I am not exactly up-to-date as far as world geography is concerned. However, the one thing that surprises me is that a man like Senator Sir John Keane should make such a suggestion and object to the mild State interference, if you like, here in this country, when he knows what has happened in other countries.  It is regrettable that Senator Sir John Keane should take that line.  I suppose that, if he happened to be reading the <i>Sunday Times</i>, as some of the rest of us have, he would be more in touch with the affairs of the world and not take that particular line.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to take the time of the House in replying to any number of the various points raised in the debate.  I rise principally to make my own position in the matter clear, or as clear as I can.  First of all, perhaps I might express my surprise that Senator Quirke has not yet discovered that Senator Sir John Keane is against State interference and that he was surprised when he heard that Senator Sir John Keane is against it.  I thought <Col N="1905" /> that if there was one thing which every member of this House knew it was that Senator Sir John Keane can always be counted on to make a speech against any kind of State interference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, I have put my foot into it, but I had no intention of creating difficulty between the two Senators.  I was merely going on to suggest that I have sympathy with Senator Sir John Keane, but that I do not believe it is possible at the present time to have developments of this kind without some State interference, although I believe that the less State interference that is possible along a line of development in any industry, and certainly in the tourist industry, the more likely the industry is to be successful.  I was amused to find Senator Hogan drawing attention to the bed-fellows that this Bill created, and suggested that to have Cú Uladh, Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Tierney in agreement was something remarkable.  Well, I find it nearly as strange that I should be, to some extent at any rate, in agreement with Senators Quirke and Hogan: to the extent, at any rate, that I am prepared to support the Second Reading of this Bill.  I am prepared to support it because I believe that you are living in a fool's paradise if you think you can develop a country on the lines of taking care of <Col N="1906" /> what, I think, Senator Tierney called the tender plants which cannot be allowed to have contact with outside, because, whether you like it or not, people are going to visit this country, and whether you like it or not the people of this country are going to travel about.  I think it is far better for people who do visit this country that we should have some measure, at any rate, of efficiency in the way in which we treat them and have a definite standard which would, I hope, be Irish and not an imitation of, say, Blackpool or any other city in any other country, so that we could have something to be proud of and that we could offer to those who visit us.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is not because I want to see the development of Ireland along English lines that I would like to see adequate development of the tourist industry, but because I believe that if we are going to get a considerable number of people coming here, we have an opportunity now, if there is wisdom and efficiency, of developing something, which, while not peculiarly Irish, will, at any rate, enable Irishmen to show themselves in a good light to the people who visit these shores without catering for&mdash;I cannot remember the very effective word used by Senator Tierney&mdash;the kind of thing that exists at certain resorts of which Douglas and Blackpool are typical.  I am satisfied that we could not do that with all the money in the world, for the kind of person who wants such attractions.  It would be lunacy, even from the materialistic point of view, to try to cater for that kind of thing here.  I hope that will always be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe, if the Irish language revival movement fails, it will be because of tourists.  It will be because of ourselves.  I do not think that you will find, in that respect, that the case of Switzerland is a very convincing argument.  I think that much nearer home you can find convincing proof of the fact that tourists have very little, if any, effect on the native language of the people.  In the tourist districts of North Wales you find that while people will talk to you in <Col N="1907" /> English, amongst themselves they will converse in their own language.  All the tourists in the world have not prevented the Welsh people from retaining their language.  At any rate, I must confess that there is no time at which I more strongly wish that I had a more fluent knowledge of the Irish language than when I am travelling abroad and when I would like to speak in a language that was peculiarly my own.  I do not think I am the only Irish person who experiences the same feeling.  I think it is quite erroneous to suggest that this Bill will have any effect, either for or against the development of the Irish language, which I think must stand or fall on something altogether different.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I am not convinced that this Bill is the best way of achieving its purpose.  I am not convinced that there is any case for the expenditure of this money except on the basis that it is going to yield a financial return.  I believe that properly administered you can get in a short time an adequate financial return which will justify the expenditure and if it were put to me whether you could expend this money on things which would meet with much less favour from the public, I would emphatically say you could.  However, I have an instinctive mistrust and dislike of boards and I do not think it is at all clearly defined, either in this Bill or the Minister's speeches, what the exact function of the board is to be.  If the money is to be expended along lines of development which will represent something of the minds and the wishes of the people of the country, we must guard against any development which would make, as an American friend of mine remarked, Portmarnock a sort of Coney Island.  If that were to happen I believe the people would soon vigorously express their feelings.</P>
    <P>I think it would be much better to administer this Bill along the lines of a Ministerial Department for which the Minister would be frankly responsible. I would prefer to see the best official in his Department appointed on his <Col N="1908" /> merits as head of this Department, working this scheme within the limits of the Bill, with the Minister responsible for all questions or discussions that might arise.  If you were to have a business company with a clear definite policy, I would have a totally different view.  Something along the lines of the Electricity Supply Board would be far more effective.  But when you are dealing with something on which we have not yet got a clear, definite policy, I would much prefer to see a responsible official at the head of this section of the Department, responsible to the Minister, with the Minister responsible, in turn, to Parliament.  If you give this board powers, it may sound a little more democratic than if the Minister were to make an order on the advice of an official, but we know, in practice, that it is not more democratic.  In regard to the appointments to be made by the board, it is bad enough to have the Minister accused of making political appointments, but it is worse to have the same thing alleged against a board which is supposed to be wholly or partially independent.  I find a difficulty in understanding exactly what the position will be.  The Minister can remove at any time, I take it, a member of the board.  Does that mean that by question in the House, by reasoned debate on an Administration Bill, or by a specific resolution, the Minister can be challenged on any act of the board?  Does not all this maintain parliamentary control?  I do not mean by saying that we want parliamentary control, that I believe we should start to debate these things continuously. We know at present that there are many Departments functioning on which very little public light is thrown except on rare occasions.  I still believe that tourist development here requires considerable care.  I cannot at all believe in the millennium immediately following the Bill pictured for us by Senator Quirke nor can I believe that it will have the opposite effect, though I do not know what is the polite contrary to the millennium which was pictured for us by Senator Tierney.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty of saying anything about a Bill like this, at least <Col N="1909" /> one of the difficulties, is that in this House when you disagree with Ministerial policy you appear to have no rights at all.  Unless you appear to be patted on the back by Senator Quirke, as he was good enough to do with quite a number of people all over the House, or unless you are prepared to agree with the Minister's action in all matters, your views receive very scant attention.  One feels that the disposition is completely to Nazify this House, just as efforts have been made in the case of a great many schemes outside to silence those who cannot subordinate their individual points of view to Government policy.  When we have reached that stage, this House will have no purpose whatever.  We are treated as so many figureheads, because we cannot see eye to eye with the Minister in his proposals.  From what I have heard in the debate, I am struck by the fundamental difference in the approach which various members of the House have to the whole problem of the future life of this country. That brings me back to the case I made earlier to-day, how influenced the great bulk of us seem to be by town life, the social conditions that exist in our town, and the consideration that we are always prepared to give to town life and the amenities that have to be provided for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Minister himself it seems to me, at least in any conflicts I have had with him, that he is always so concerned about holidays that they dominate all his legislation or, at least, most of the legislation of which he has been in charge since he came into office&mdash;holidays with pay, holidays for these people and holidays for other people.  Now he is making provision for improving holiday accommodation for people of the towns both inside and outside this country.  My feeling on this question is that first things should come first.  We were told to-day by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, about the wisdom of a  existence, that it was better to live within our own resources and not to ask for money for investment, which could not secure an adequate return. He told us to save a bit, to keep the <Col N="1910" /> money in hand until we are satisfied that its investment will show an adequate return.  That was the point of view of the Minister for Finance.  Here we have the Minister for Industry and Commerce asking for a lump sum of £600,000 and an annual sum of £45,000. To me it seems like trying to put a slate on the roof while at the same time digging at the foundations.  It is difficult to contemplate the effect of this sort of legislation on the minds of the people down the country.  They are rather amused at this sort of legislation. Make no mistake about it. Leaving aside the people who are interested in the hotel business, who live in our few and rather unfrequented seaside resorts, and the people in the immediate vicinity who may do a little bit of vegetable growing and that sort of thing, the great bulk of our people have not much interest in legislation like this at all.  What is it going to bring?  How much extra is it going to bring us?  We have had calculations made here that the tourist business is worth £2,500,000 a year to the country. Perhaps the Minister will tell us how these figures are arrived at?  We see these repeatedly.  I do not know how they are arrived at.  Do I understand that £2,000,000 of this money is spent by our own people and £500,000 comes from the stranger?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the Minister said.  The Minister said that £2,000,000 was spent by our citizens travelling abroad, if I understood him aright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, anyhow, I would like to know what we are calculating on receiving out of this kind of expenditure because, in the first place, there is expenditure.  There is expenditure of cash.  In the second place, it has certain consequences.  There is no doubt about it.  You cannot with a scap of your finger dismiss the point of view so ably expressed by Senator Tierney.  The facts are there and unless Senator Quirke forgets the days when he was in the hayfield or any other sort of field, he will know that if one happens to be down the country, particularly in the West, there is nothing <Col N="1911" /> but a whirl of dust created by tourists travelling to and from seaside resorts.  I have calculated from my own place that in these days a motor-car will pass every two or three minutes.  That goes on day by day. One begins to wonder what sort of a country it is.  One feels that the world is a strange place.  There does not seem to be any connection between that sort of thing and our rural life. That is how I look on it.  We have gone a long way towards demoralising our people.  There is no doubt about it.  They are running away from the country.  The Minister on another occasion in this House used a phrase that he was rather anxious to qualify later.  They are going.  Why are they going?  Make no mistake about it, all this business of tourism and tourists, all the noise and apparent ease and the readiness with which you can get money is influencing life in the country. The more you go on spending money to make that side of life attractive the more difficult it is going to be to get the development in the country which the country wants first.  Wants first, I say.  I am not the sort of individual who believes that we should stick in the mud.  Not at all.  I think we ought to do our best to put our wares in the window but I would like to put our best wares in the window first.  I am not the sort of person who would like to go about pretending that we are ever so much better off than we are, bringing strangers or our own people to our seaside resorts, and making them think that this is really a magnificent country and behind it all something else going on, a grave danger and a leakage which must be stopped but which cannot be stopped in face of this kind of legislation.  The Minister may be very eloquent and may make magnificent speeches about the position of agriculture at meetings of the Industrial Development Association but none of these speeches is going to do the thing that this country needs when legislation of this kind is brought in immediately afterwards.  That point of view may not be pleasant or acceptable but there are some of us who hold it quite strongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1912" /> While, undoubtedly, our seaside resorts could be made more attractive, I think altogether too much stress is being laid on that side of life.  Too much emphasis is being laid on the attitude that leisure and holidays are more important to this country than work.  I do not believe it, and I think that what should be said much more frequently in this House and outside is that what this country wants to build it up are not holidays with pay but more hard work.  It is very difficult to preach that sort of philosophy side by side with the enunciation of the philosophy that is enshrined in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a somewhat odd and paradoxical debate, and I confess that when I recall having listened in debate after debate in this House to Senator Johnston and Senator Baxter and others expressing sentiments, with which I cordially agreed, about the absolute necessity of increasing our exports, it astonishes me that Senator Baxter to-day should speak so slightingly of the value of this invisible export that is provided by a tourist trade.  If the tourist trade has already reached anything like the figures, mentioned by the Minister and if it is capable of reaching much higher figures, then it is not a kind of luxury to encourage it.  It is, on the contrary, absolutely in the line of the soundest national economy.  It is increasing our invisible exports; it is balancing that realisation of our assets abroad of which so much complaint is being made; it is enabling us to pay for the things we are importing from outside in such large quantities.  So that I find myself very much at issue with anybody who throws cold water on the value from a material point of view of the tourist trade coming in from outside.  The spiritual point of view is another matter.  There, I confess, my feelings are mixed.  Like Senator Tierney, I personally detest crowds swarming over the countryside. When I go for a holiday myself I much prefer to go to unfrequented places than to frequented places.  It is a question that demands serious consideration from the Minister and this <Col N="1913" /> board, if created, whether things may not be done, with the best intentions, that have the effect of spoiling the charm of the Irish countryside by bringing in from outside, or from inside, to country places too many people of the wrong sort who spoil the pleasure of everybody else without attaining any great pleasure themselves.</P>
      <P>On the subject of the Irish language, of course, I cannot speak with authority, because I do not share the views of the majority of this House.  I do confess, however, that it makes me somewhat indignant if anyone should set up the specialised interests of the Irish language as something that debars them from even considering the material value of something that might be so important to us as the tourist trade, as the influx of tourists bringing in foreign money and spending it here. In seeking to prevent the growth of towns and the vomiting forth of the inhabitants of the towns over the countryside I am very much afraid that Senator Tierney is pleading a lost cause.  It is too late to preach such a policy as he would apparently wish to see adopted here.  There comes to my mind a description which has been given of Shelley: &ldquo;A beautiful but ineffectual angel beating the air with luminous wings in vain.&rdquo;  The Senator's ideas arouse great sympathy in my heart, but they are not realisable.</P>
      <P>In ordinary times my feelings about this Bill would be very mixed, but at the present time I find myself definitely unable to support the Second Reading and for a very simple reason, for the reason that Europe&mdash;and, indeed, the world&mdash;is trembling upon the verge of a very possible war.  If that war occurs there will be no problem about keeping our people to take their holidays here instead of going elsewhere: they will be automatically kept here.  Equally, there will be no chance of attracting any tourists from outside: that will be taken care of by the general course of events.  Yet we are proposing now, at a time of great financial stringency, to embark on a very large expenditure which we may find, in a month or two, is absolutely money thrown away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1914" /> I do press upon the Minister the point, that this Bill ought to be held over until the autumn.  We all know that the critical period is in the next few months.  If Europe survives the next few months without a war we can, I think, see our way to act as if there was not going to be a war.  At the present moment I do not think we can prudently do so.  I do not think it reasonable to make any such expenditure as is here proposed until the situation clears up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When I concluded my remarks in introducing this measure, Senator Sir John Keane jumped up to defend private enterprise against another attack from the totalitarian Minister.  I have joined issue with Sir John Keane on many occasions in the past, on the comparative values of private enterprise and State enterprise, but we need not fear about it to-day, because on this occasion I am on the Senator's side.  I am all in favour of private enterprise in this matter of the development of our country.  I think, if we are going to develop our holiday facilities here and take the greatest advantage from the opportunities that we have, we must really largely depend on private enterprise. The Senator and myself, therefore, will be on the same side for the moment, because I share his views in that regard largely&mdash;much to his astonishment, no doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I do think that private enterprise will require both stimulation and direction.  The Senator may not agree with me, but I think it is very easy to demonstrate that stimulation and direction are required.  One cannot stimulate private enterprise to do many of the things that must be done if the facilities available are to be fully developed, if we are to take full advantage of the position that exists here.  Private enterprise is not going to work except for private profit.  Private enterprise will not build public conveniences in holiday resorts, will not put up bathing pools which will be accessible free to the public, it will not stock a river with fish and have that river open to the <Col N="1915" /> public, or do any of a thousand and one things that must be done if we are to make this country more attractive as a holiday centre than it now is.  Similarly, no matter how energetic hotel-keepers are, no matter how willing they may be to invest new capital in enterprise, they will have the temptation to fleece occasional tourists when they come along.  No matter how anxious they may be to clear out the old furniture and put in more modern conveniences for visitors, they will not do that unless assisted and directed by some central authority, so that the enterprising hotelier will be protected to ensure that the use of the name &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; will not be abused, that such name will not be associated with the place that is in no sense an hotel but nothing more than a public house.</P>
    <P>The particular advantages that offer in particular districts can be fully developed under this Bill.  No individual will be allowed, for his own profit, to destroy the amenities of some scenic district or other holiday centre which should be developed along particular lines.  We have all heard a lot of condemnation of the type of holiday resort that exists at Blackpool. Now, no one would like to see another Blackpool set up in, say, Killarney, or in some other beautiful part of the country; but there may be some places where something akin to what exists in Blackpool at present might be suitable. Someone must see to it that the gentleman who wants to make money out of hobby-horses or merry-go-rounds will not try to do it at Glen-gariff. If he wants to use that type of equipment and that type of attraction to entertain holiday-makers, he will have to do it at some place that will be more suitable for the purpose than Glengariff or Killarney.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if the board would have power to prevent the setting up of hobby-horses by a person wherever he likes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are giving power to define special areas where an Order may be made by the Minister enabling the board to do anything that is necessary to preserve the amenities of such an area, subject to whatever limitations the Minister may impose on them by the Order.  That will be under Section 49 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The main question that arises here is, whether it is worth our while undertaking this expenditure, and, furthermore, whether we should undertake it now.  This is a business concern.  This is a business undertaking, and we are concerned here in the conduct of this business, for the purpose of getting a livelihood for ourselves.  We want to get the best livelihood we can in this country.  We are getting some sort of livelihood from manufacture of a certain range of commodities.  Can we add to our activities and improve the revenue of our business?  If we were managers of a departmental store and we saw the possibility of developing a new department, recognising that we would have to divert to the purpose of that department some of the revenue from the existing activities of the business and invest new capital in the equipment of that new department, we would do it, if we thought that we would obtain more revenue thereby and that we would increase the income of the business and consequently increase the yield of profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the expenditure which is to be made in relation to this undertaking is going to yield a profit.  There will be an expenditure of capital.  Some £600,000 will be spent in providing facilities for holiday-makers and there is provision for the payment of £45,000 a year to the Tourist Association for such period as may be required.  Is this going to increase the national income?  Is it going to yield a profit <Col N="1917" /> for the nation?  Is it going to make it easier for us to finance the various activities on which we are engaged and to maintain the social services we think are necessary?</P>
    <P>Senator MacDermot was somewhat astonished at Senator Baxter's inconsistency. I was not.  I expected it.  I knew that Senator Baxter would oppose the Government in any event, and, even though we were in fact in this Bill proceeding along lines which, on other occasions, he would advocate. I knew he would oppose us on this occasion.  We are doing here precisely what everybody who realises the requirements of the national situation will undoubtedly urge.  We are trying to increase the national revenue.  We are trying to expand a form of productive enterprise which will raise the national income and, consequently, make it easier for us to bear the burden of government and governmental services which may now, in our opinion, be costing more than we can afford.  If governmental services are, in fact, costing more than we can afford, as Senator Sir John Keane has said, and as the Banking Commission Report suggested, there are two ways of dealing with the situation.  One is to reduce the costs and the other to increase our income so that we can afford them.  There is a third way, of course&mdash;to try to do both.  We are here trying to increase the national income, and if we do increase the national income as a result of increased activity in the tourist business, we are making it easier for the nation to carry on.  We are raising the standard of living of the people and benefiting every section in direct consequence thereof.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>We should like to see a bit of the other as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We can discuss that on another occasion.  In relation to this particular project, the one question I want Senators to ask themselves is: will it pay and is it worth while?  It is easy enough to say that we could put £600,000 into forestry, fisheries or some other enterprise, some other department of the business.  Let us ask ourselves <Col N="1918" /> the question: Is it going to pay us more and to pay us more quickly to put £600,000 into forestry than into tourist development?  That is a question worth asking and worth answering. Will these Senators who have been talking on that line give us their opinion?  Will they consider it carefully? If they had £600,000 of their own money to invest, from which form of activity would they expect to get the biggest and the quickest result?  I think we are going to get a much bigger and much quicker return from the expenditure of that money in the manner suggested by this Bill than in many of the ways suggested here.  I may be wrong in that.  In any event, the expenditure of that money on this particular project is not going to prevent the expenditure of similar sums, or even larger sums, upon other projects, if these other projects are worth while.  There is no limit, or almost no limit, to the amount of capital we can afford to invest in projects that are going to yield a profit, and if this project is going to yield a profit, this money is well worth investing in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator M. Hayes said that we could get on without this board; that if we could reduce taxation, reduce the cost of living, reduce the cost of travelling and get upon more friendly relations with our neighbours, and generally make this country the little bit of heaven that some song-writers say it is, we could attract so many tourists that we would not need a tourist board at all.  He is quite right.  If all the other nationalities started to fight with one another, but not with us, so that international relations became so bad that those who wanted foreign travel would have nowhere to go but to this country, we would have a different type of problem, the problem of trying to keep tourists out because too many would be coming.  It is easy for Senator Hayes to say that, because it means nothing.  We are dealing with the situation as it exists, having regard to the prevailing taxation, the cost of living, cost of travelling and the circumstances which may affect our relations with other countries, and, in these circumstances, can we do anything to increase this item in our <Col N="1919" /> business, to get a higher revenue for the country from this particular source? I think we can.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the possibility of attracting visitors from England and other countries, and to the effect of visitors coming from England upon our nationality.  One of the first objectives to be attained under this measure has no relation to foreigners at all.  It is to provide facilities here for our own people to get satisfactory holidays in Ireland.  I have no patience at all with the point of view of those Senators who object to masses of people being vomited out from the city to destroy the countryside with orange-peels and broken bottles.  That sort of humbug is not going to influence opinion anywhere.  We have, however, a number of people living in the cities and in the countryside who like to get a holiday, and some of whom have now been put in a position to get a holiday for the first time.  Even if there were no legislation about holidays with pay, even if the general standard of living had not so improved that people are now able to afford holidays who could not afford them before&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there has been a development in the mentality of the people which would have raised a problem for us in any event.  People are becoming conscious of the value of holidays, of the effect of a holiday upon their own efficiency.  The holiday habit has grown, not merely in this, but in all countries, and it has created a business problem, the problem of catering for that new traffic which has arisen and of keeping in this country, if we can, the revenue to be derived from it.  Is there any difference between providing a hotel or holiday camp at an Irish resort for the Irish worker spending his week's holidays with pay, in order to prevent him from going to a similar hotel or hostel in North Wales, and putting up a boot factory to manufacture boots which we would otherwise buy from a boot factory in England?  There is no difference <Col N="1920" /> in principle.  We are doing it, if we are doing it at all, because we think it good business to do it; and if we are doing that, can we not, at the same time, consider whether we cannot do something more?  Undoubtedly, let us provide these holiday facilities for our people and let us see that they can get not merely good and cheap holidays in this country, but holidays as good as they can get anywhere else, if we can possibly secure it.</P>
      <P>We think it will pay to do it, but, over and above that, we can attract visitors from abroad.  Seventy-five per cent. of these visitors will be people with racial associations here. They are not going to be foreigners coming in for the purpose of destroying Irish nationality and undermining the Irish language, but Irish people coming home to their own country to see their own folk and to renew their associations with the old country.  That is what they will be.  Will anyone deny that of the visitors who came to this country from the United States of America last year, 99 per cent. were people of Irish origin or descent, who were coming to Ireland because they had herd Ireland spoken of in their homes in the United States, who knew that they had originated here and who wanted to come back here for the purpose of seeing the old country?  The same applies to people coming even from England and it certainly applies to people coming from other countries. These people are not coming in here to destroy the Irish language or to undermine Irish nationality.  Their coming will have quite a contrary effect altogether, but, by bringing them in here, we can make a profit. These people are not going to take holidays in any event, and if they do not come here, they will go elsewhere.  Is there any reason why we should not set out systematically to organise the bringing of them here, so that whatever profit is to be got will be secured for this country, instead of leaving it to other countries, such as England, France, Switzerland, or some other country, the Governments of which have more business foresight than we have displayed here in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1921" /> I do not like talking about this question of the relationship between this Bill and the problem of preserving the Gaeltacht, protecting the language and preserving Irish nationality.

      <P>and most unusual in my case.  However, in order to try to keep the question distinct, because I think there would be some value in doing so, I invite Senator McGinley, Senator Tierney, or any other senator interested, to put down an amendment to this Bill to provide that the activities of this board will have nothing to do with the Gaeltacht, and that the money provided by the Bill shall not be spent in the Gaeltacht, and let us see what case they can make for it.  This is not a Bill for the Gaeltacht, but for the whole of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>That part which is under our jurisdiction.  We shall be very glad to extend the benefits of the Bill to the whole of Ireland, if we get the opportunity.  It is designed to facilitate the carrying on of a profitable business in whatever part of Ireland that business is best suited to be carried on. If we can carry on that business in the Gaeltacht, well and good.  I think we can carry it on there without any danger whatever to the preservation of the Irish language and without any danger whatever to Irish nationality or Irish culture.  But if Senator Cú Uladh or any other Senator thinks otherwise, if they are fearful of what the effect on the Gaeltacht might be, let them put down an amendment asking that the provisions of the Bill be not extended to the Gaeltacht and let them make their case for the exclusion of the Gaeltacht from this Bill.  I do not think that the operations of this Bill are going to interfere with the preservation <Col N="1922" /> of the Irish language or affect prejudicially Gaelic culture.</P>

      <P>The Suggestion has been made in the course of the debate that we are over-fond of centralising authority and that this Bill means a further step in the development of transferring to the central authority powers of control over social and commercial activities which the central authority should not have.  Senator Hayes described that as a lamentable tendency.  I would like the Senator to develop that point.  I do not know why he used that phrase.  I suggest that he used it because it was the first to occur to him.  Are we justified in refusing to increase the efficiency of the nation by the setting-up of such authorities, by the creation of such statutory bodies in order to get the best out of our various national activities? I do not think so.  If it could be shown that better results could be achieved otherwise I would be prepared to act otherwise.  We are doing this because it is the best system.  If anyone can show us a better way of doing it we are quite prepared to fall in with him.  It is a question of expediency. When it comes to particular matters with which this board will deal, when one has regard to the work that has to be done and how it can best be done, one almost automatically <Col N="1923" /> visualises some such organisation as this, some organisation which will have certain powers, certain resources and which will be charged with the responsibility of getting that work done.</P>
      <P>Senator Douglas asked why set up this board?  He asked why should we not give the Minister this power.  Now, if I came here with a Bill giving these powers to the Minister and proposing to have the functions carried out by civil servants, I am quite sure Senator Douglas would be the first to propose an amendment taking the powers away from the Minister and giving them to a board.  I think it best that the powers should be given to a board.  I have already said that I do not deal in matters of this kind as a politician.  It would never enter my head, when considering the allocation of a grant for the building of a promenade or the construction of a swimming pool or a bathing place, to consider whether there was a bye-election in Dublin or whether the Government required support in a particular quarter or not or whether influence could be used for a particular Deputy.</P>

      <P>It is precisely because I know my personal position in the matter that I am saying this.  I know my personal wishes.  I know that if the powers in this Bill were given to me as Minister, every member of the Dáil, irrespective of Party, would be sitting on my doorstep seeking to get a grant for his home town and making the refusal or the getting of the grant a political matter.  That is why I decided that these powers should not be given to the Minister but to a board that would be independent of him at least in so far as the detailed carrying out of the plans is concerned.</P>

Let the Senator cast his eyes over the personnel of the various boards, let him take for instance the Sugar board and the Electricity Supply Board.  He would find on these boards a number of people who are not supporters of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not get that point of Senator Hogan's interjection.  The fact is that in the appointment of staffs I have never known political considerations to be taken into account. Nobody will allege that in the recruitment of the staff in the case of the Electricity Supply Board, the Government were ever influenced to any appreciable extent by political considerations. Now, the section here in this Bill is, word for word, the same as that which deals with the Electricity Supply Board.  You have there in that section the experience of its operation in a similar organisation which has been in existence for over ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested by Senator MacDermot that it is unwise to proceed with this measure at present because there may be a war.  I admit that that is possible and it is a possibility which we must take into account in developing our plans.  But to what extent are <Col N="1925" /> we to allow our activities to be curtailed by the possibility of the outbreak of war?  That is a problem that has arisen for me ever since September last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and you have got to make a decision regardless of that possibility.  Now, as to the question of the outbreak of war, there may not be a war.  Are we to suspend activities that may be useful, though there may not be a war?  Are we to have such regard to the possibility of war arising that we should do nothing which is not directly preparatory to the outbreak of war?  In this case we can go ahead, because there are various presumptions on which we can proceed.  Senator MacDermot asked that the Bill should be postponed till the autumn because of the war danger.  I am prepared to give the Senator an undertaking that the money now being voted will not be spent immediately.  The Act will not come into operation before three or four months.  At least three months will elapse before we can proceed to put it into operation.  There may be another danger point looming ahead.  Should that be reached, a further decision may have to be taken, but I think that we can go ahead now and set up this organisation.  When the organisation is functioning we will have to take into account the extent to which international affairs are likely to react on the situation here.  Reference has been made to the £600,000.  The board is not being given £600,000 to spend.  The Bill authorises the Government to make advances to the board up to £600,000, but each advance must be sanctioned. The purpose of the advance must be approved of, and the possibility of the money being repaid examined.  That system is copied from the system in operation in relation to the Electricity Supply Board.  Senators know that Bills are occasionally introduced in the Oireachtas which propose to give power to increase the limit by which advances may be made to the Electricity Supply Board.  We will have one in the next <Col N="1926" /> session.  When that limit is increased the Government gets authority to authorise new advances to the Electricity Supply Board up to the new limit, but each advance has to be approved of.  We are adopting the same system in relation to this board.  The system has worked fairly satisfactorily in connection with the Electricity Supply Board, and we think that it should work with equal satisfaction here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that not one penny of the £600,000 will be spent before October.  There may have to be some money spent out of the £45,000 to meet immediate administrative costs.  A question was asked concerning the future of the Irish Tourist Development Association.  It is intended that it should continue in existence as at present, although it is to be assumed that its future activities will be confined to publicity work.  The particular work it does at present in relation to hotel inspection and registration will, presumably, stop.  It will be subject to the new board to the extent that it is now subject to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The expenditure of the association has at present to be approved of each year by the Minister for Industry and commerce. In future, that approval will be given by this board.  The new board may arrange to conduct its publicity work through the Irish Tourist Association. One of the provisions of the Bill authorises the board to operate through an agency for any of the purposes associated with the tourist development business, if they think fit.  I should imagine that the two organisations will be able to work hand in hand, and without any serious overlapping in their activities.  The Irish Tourist Association is at the present time doing publicity work in this country and in Great Britain, in addition to doing a certain amount of hotel inspection work and registration.  The board may arrange for the Irish Tourist Association to continue to do that work <Col N="1927" /> in the future, and probably to expand it.  In fact, the new situation may mean an expansion in the functions of the Irish Tourist Association rather than a contraction.  It is not intended that the Irish Tourist Association should cease to exist.  Quite the reverse is the intention.</P>
      <P>I think that these are the only points that call for reply at the moment.  Many of the other matters raised on the Bill can be more appropriately dealt with on the Committee Stage, matters relating to individual sections.  I shall be very glad then to deal with any difficulties which Senators may have.  A number of Senators suggested that, while they approved of the principle of the Bill, they thought they could improve on the details of it.  I shall be very glad to hear their attempts to do so on Committee.</P>
