      <P>It is with very deep regret that I announce to the House the death, on the 9th July, of Senator Thomas W. Delany.</P>
      <P>Senator Delany was only a short time associated with us in the work of the Oireachtas, and, unfortunately, owing to illness was unable to be present on many occasions in the Seanad.  But during our acquaintance with him I think I can say, on behalf of all members of the House, that we found him at all times courteous and helpful.  His death will be a loss to the public life of his native county, and to the professional organisations with which he was so prominently and actively associated.</P>
      <P>With the assent of the House I shall convey to the widow and to the relatives of the deceased Senator the expression of our sincere sympathy. Would Senators be good enough to signalise their assent by rising in their places?</P>
      <P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the progress of this Bill any further, except in adverting very briefly to what has been already said on the subject.  The Minister came into office on a promise to reduce expenditure, to reduce taxation, to abolish unemployment and, inferentially, to abolish the greater part of the need for social services.  In this Bill, apart altogether from the special circumstances of the moment, we can see the result of a policy which has increased expenditure, increased taxation, increased social services, and reduced the number of those working upon the land and produced more emigration.  That result, which we see in this Bill, is not peculiar to this Bill, or to this particular year.  It has been going on steadily since the Minister came into office.  It is pleaded this year that the need is for money for armaments, but I think the figures disclose that, before any such crisis arose, the Minister was already increasing expenditure, and I think that, by this time 12 months, it will be found that the Minister will have succeeded in spending comparatively little on armaments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for social services has apparently grown, but the increase in expenditure, generally, is by no means <Col N="161" /> attributable entirely to the increase upon social services.  The Minister appended to his Budget speech a list of social services, which, quite manifestly, was made out, not by a person looking on the matter with the objective impartiality of a civil servant, but by a politician anxious to justify his own mistakes.  He gave us a number of instances of social services, many of which, I think, could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be deemed to be social services.  The example which has become classic is the salary of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government.  To attribute that salary to social services, in the light of what we know of the Parliamentary Secretary's activities, is worse than a joke.</P>
    <P>Apart from the costs which this Finance Bill imposes, following upon the higher costs imposed for the past six or seven years, we have still higher rates, higher cost of everything we buy, and, as was demonstrated here on the Committee Stage, a complete failure on the part of the Minister to do another thing which he said he would do, namely, to tax the rich to help the poor.  Although he has increased the rate of income-tax, and, in a greater proportion still, increased the super-tax rates, he has not succeeded in getting any substantially increased sum of money from those who might be accepted as the rich, that is, those people who have incomes of over £1,500 a year.  Naturally, therefore, he has not succeeded in increasing employment, or in abolishing unemployment, or in going any distance towards it, as he said he would.  In the circumstances where you have increased expenditure, increased taxation, increased rates and increased cost of production, there is absolutely no possibility of an industrial policy succeeding.  One does not need the report of any Banking Commission, or the advice of experts of any kind whatever to realise that in a country which, by its very nature, must have agricultural exports you cannot have industrial expansion which is accompanied by high taxation and high rates.  The two things do not go together.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> The Minister, in spite of all this expenditure, and subsidies to agriculture, has accomplished very little of what he set out to accomplish.  His colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, told us here recently that between the policy of his predecessors and the policy pursued since 1932, there is very little difference with regard to tillage. Tillage, in spite of enormous subsidies, has not increased.  There has been a certain increase in certain crops, but that has been mainly substitution, and I think that in the last few years the actual amount of increased tillage over 1932 has gone down to a couple of hundred thousand acres, a very insignificant figure at the price.  Our export trade has not increased; our old industries are being hampered, and the Minister himself has been persistent in only one thing, that is, in increasing the imposition of taxes.</P>
    <P>In his style of introducing Budgets and his general speech on finance matters, the Minister has changed substantially. He began&mdash;and I think I remember hearing him in the Dáil in 1932&mdash;in a very literary, high-faluting, rhetorical manner, as if he were proud of what he were doing, but recently he has changed his tune.  He gives lip service now to what one might call orthodox finance, but, as we were taught long ago at school, faith without good works is dead.  The Minister, no matter how calm he may be now, and no matter how orthodox his professions may be now, by his policy which has depressed agriculture and made it impossible for industrial revival really to take place, has brought us to the position where easy remedies, or so-called easy remedies, may very well be adopted.  We have had advocacy even from the ranks of his own Party of a simple so-called remedy, that is to say, the printing off of banknotes.  The Minister, I think, does not subscribe to that at all, but it may very well be that this policy which is enshrined in this Bill and which has been so persistently followed up may bring us to the position where that kind of thing will get a hold upon the country, and, after that, little would be left, either for the rich or for the poor, and certainly <Col N="163" /> employment will not be increased.</P>
    <P>The thing that strikes one about the Finance Bill is that, in spite of great expenditure, we have not an increased agriculture production, and we have, in our industrial position, a certain number of good things mixed with a certain number of bad.  It is difficult for agriculture to prosper under this policy.  In addition, not only will the bad industrial experiments fail, but, in failing, they may bring down sound industries, long established and with the prospect of permanency.  That is a very bad picture, and I think the Minister will have to do something more than merely profess his devotion to orthodox finance.  He will have to take some steps to see that the country is brought back to the course upon which he found it in 1932, and which did show increasing production and increasing employment.  One can say that the situation is one which calls for careful examination and great courage, rather than constant debate, and we can only hope that the Minister will follow up his professions of faith&mdash; by some substantial acts.</P>

      <P>I also do not want to delay the House very long, particularly as I feel, in a way, that, with the Minister for Finance here defending this Bill, there is not much good in our arguing, because, in one way, the Minister for Finance is the last Minister who should come in here to defend this Bill.  We know the Cabinet system. Before the present Government came into power the Minister went around telling everybody of the marvellous economies that could be made in national finance.  This Party came into power and he became Minister for Finance.  How does that work?  Each Minister is responsible for one Department. The Cabinet meets, and each individual Minister in charge of a spending Department urges further expenditure on his Department, and, as a matter of fact, one can almost form a judgment as to what happens at Cabinet meetings by seeing the way in which money is spent by different Departments.  One will notice that the worst Departments for wasting money, <Col N="164" /> if I may use that word, are those in charge of Ministers who&mdash;again, if I may use the term&mdash;have the habit of throwing their weight about very considerably. I have no doubt that the Minister in those secret gatherings of the Executive Council fights very hard against this scandalous expenditure which is disastrous for the country. What is his function?  The Ministers for Industry and Commerce, for Agriculture, for Local Government, and all the others, come up and demand vast sums of money to be thrown broadcast by their Departments.  The Minister for Finance, ultimately, has the aggregate of the bills presented by each of them before him.  His function is merely to decide that all that money is to be extracted from the unfortunate people of this country.  In the present situation everybody knows perfectly well&mdash; though Ministers make speeches denying it&mdash;that the country has been living upon its accumulated capital, that it has been living upon the savings accumulated in years of greater prosperity. These savings were an enormous asset to this country.  It was by reason of these savings that the standard of living has gone up to what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the present conditions the Minister is not able to say: &ldquo;The taxable capacity of this country is so much; therefore, we must not, during this year, extract more than that.&rdquo; But as the matter stands the sum which he is to extract from the unfortunate taxpayers is fixed by the other Ministers and his business is to find the best, quickest, and most adequate means of getting in that money.  The Minister for Finance is in reality the least guilty member of the Executive Council.  The truth is that every representative of the spending Departments should be here present to defend the money which he proposes to get away with for the current year.  I would like to suggest that the Cabinet system should be this:&mdash;That the Minister for Finance and his officials, who presumably are best qualified to consider the financial position of this country, should come before the Cabinet and say: &ldquo;The maximum that we can legitimately gather from the people of <Col N="165" /> this country during this year is £x.&rdquo; Then he could say to the other Ministers: &ldquo;You can now decide amongst yourselves what proportion of that £x goes to each one of you.&rdquo;  At present in determining the amount of money to he extracted in taxation and in considering the whole financial position no consideration whatever is given to the amount of taxation which the country can stand.  The position is that each Department, because of certain sentimental ideas now prevalent in this country, has decided that it is to spend so much on such and such services.</P>
    <P>When our annual national expenditure is calculated what happened normally is that each year is treated in this way&mdash;what is the amount that can be paid out of taxation?  Everything else is treated as exceptional and therefore as capital expenditure.  It is true that in our Government finances the method is this:&mdash;That as soon as the Government borrows it begins paying back.  Because if it borrows £10,000,000 to-morrow, in its accounting it will immediately allow for interest and sinking fund to pay off that £10,000,000.  If the Government spend £25,000,000 a calculation is made that say, £10,000,000 is borrowed for capital or abnormal expenditure.  That capital borrowing involves paying back immediately interest and sinking fund. That is quite true as regards one year, but when you take this position of affairs over a number of years you will find that we are miscalculating.  In the year 1932 there was clearly abnormal borrowing.  So many millions were borrowed.  In the year following more money was borrowed.  If you take a series of years you must recognise that there is one type of expenditure which is recurrent every year.  There are other types of expenditure which are not recurrent.  Strictly speaking if one takes any period one likes in the last seven or ten years, one finds that every year we borrowed a certain amount and our national debt increased.  There is no reason to believe that this was strictly for abnormal expenditure. There was nothing abnormal in relation to the business for which the money was borrowed.  Every year we <Col N="166" /> have to borrow before we pay back on previous debts and our national debt is accumulating because our calculations are wrong.  We only regard as normal expenditure that which occurs every year and anything else is regarded as abnormal.  We take no account of the fact that ever since the State existed money is being borrowed and the result is that our debt is accumulating all the more.</P>
    <P>In the debate in the other House in relation to finances all sorts of specious arguments were put up.  When the Opposition speaks of reducing taxation all sorts of propagandist organs are dragged in and immediately the interest of large sections of people in the country is being appealed to.  We were told we can only reduce taxation by reducing social services.  The greatest condemnation of this Government&mdash;and of the last Government of which I was a member&mdash;is that this country requires so many social services.  Now, I am not blaming the Government for not working a miracle.  We in the last Government did not work the miracle. What I would like to see is a movement towards a trend of affairs in which the necessity for so many social services would not be present.  What the Government has to work towards is such a state of affairs that every man in this country willing and able to work will know there is work available for him and that he will have the right to the reward that is appropriate to the work he does.</P>
    <P>For years past we are constantly increasing these social services, social service that are necessary because you cannot stand by and allow men to starve merely because a peculiar position exists in which a man is willing to work; in which he is capable of providing by his labour for himself and his family, while there is no opening there for him to do so.  But the Government comes along and boasts of the growth of social services.  That should be the one thing that they should conceal. They do this for propagandist purposes.  They try to put the Opposition into the position of advocating a reduction of the social services.  Now the great object of this and of any <Col N="167" /> other Government in this country should be to abolish, in a proper way, this wasteful expenditure on a great many of these things that we call social services.</P>
    <P>We are told about housing.  Strictly speaking the fact that public bodies in this country are forced to build houses which must be let at uneconomic rents is really a condemnation of the Government. What should be the right condition in regard to housing?  The right condition should be that a man who pursues his reproductive labour should be paid such a wage that he should be able to pay an economic rent for his house and be able to maintain his family.  These social services are each year actually accumulating a fresh debt.  There is a vast number of houses built by public bodies and we know that whatever rent comes in for these houses is nothing like sufficient to pay the debt, the interest on the debt, the up-keep of the house, the rates and so on.  There is another argument put up when we talk about the economic position of this country at the present time.  We are told that the country is now much better than in 1934.  One might as well say that a man who finds that his overdraft has accumulated by over £1,000 one year can point to an improvement when he sees that his overdraft has gone up in the succeeding year by only £500.  During the period when we are spending more than we are producing we are accumulating an actual debt.  Now we are told to rejoice not because we are paying the old debt back but because the old debt is still growing but growing at a slower tempo than previously.</P>
    <P>I would prefer that the Opposition and the Government would face up to this thing and cut out propagandist arguments.  These propagandist arguments have been used against us. Government speakers have said when we are arguing for a reduction in taxation that what we are really arguing for is a reduction in social services.  I believe in one way that a reduction in taxation will lead to a reduction in social services.  The need for them will disappear.  That is because the present enormous burden of taxation is putting <Col N="168" /> this country slowly but continually out of production.  We have less production and fewer people employed.  In addition the more people who are employed at a rate which requires help through the social services such as housing, unemployment assistance and relief works, the more social services will be needed and the worse it will be for the country.  The result is that you have taxation increased and, as a consequence, reduced production calling for still more social services which again require further increased taxation.</P>
    <P>I do think that we ought to get away from the Party argument, face up to the situation and to any unpopularity which that may involve in certain quarters. The country was in a bad condition in 1934, so bad that even those who were responsible for it are ready to admit now that it was in a bad condition at that time.  The Coal-Cattle Pact of 1935, the renewal of it in later years, and the Agreement with England last year were all calculated to relieve the situation, but there can be no real relief of the situation until we find our people are able to live, all of them, on a fair standard on what the country can produce.  At the risk of being unpopular&mdash;I like being unpopular&mdash;I may say that one of the social services, of which we have heard so much, has provided for a reduction in the working hours of town workers and an increase in the holidays given to town workers.  The necessary result of that, just as the necessary result of the policy of mad tariffs, was to increase the cost of production.  It is no good saying that every agricultural worker shall have a 40-hour week, shall have a minimum wage of £3, and shall have a fortnight's holiday in the year.  It simply is not possible and this country lives on agriculture.</P>
    <P>Another argument is put up.  We are told that 800 new factories have been established in this country, but we are not invited to examine that at all.  I remember when Ministers were in opposition, and when periodically they read out the number of businesses that had gone bankrupt.  It is a fact&mdash; though it may not be a popular thing  say it&mdash;that it would be to the <Col N="169" /> national benefit if a good number of the new factories were to make up their minds to become bankrupt.  Just to illustrate how the imposition of tariffs, and the creation of industries thereby, may be wasteful we shall take an extreme case, a case in which, say, a tariff of 100 per cent. is imposed on any commodity, boots, for example.  The price of boots is then increased by 100 per cent., so that what you got for £1 formerly now costs £2.  What does that mean?  It is quite obvious that there must be a certain amount of waste in material and so on.  Inasmuch as the boots can be produced in England for £1 per pair, it is quite certain that the whole of the additional £1 does not go in wages to the workers.  I take 100 per cent. because it gives a clearer picture than a fractional figure.  It would be much better if you were to bring in all the boots you required from England, sell them at £1 per pair, and distribute the extra £1 amongst the poor people who require it.  When you can buy the imported article for one-half the figure you have to pay when it is manufactured at home, it is quite obvious that there is absolute waste, that it would be really better to import the article and distribute that 100 per cent. amongst the people who have been making the article here and wasting their time.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that when the Government slaps on a tariff of 70 per cent., as they have frequently done, automatically, factories will grow up, but does it follow that these factories are economic?  You are paying for them by imposing taxation on the people. The Government, since it came into office, has increased taxation by £8,000,000 or £9,000,000.  That is what you find in the Government accounts, but the fact is that the Government has also farmed out taxation.  If the Government tell me that they will put a tariff of 100 per cent. on an article and that I undertake to make that article after such a tariff is imposed, it means that the unfortunate people of the country, every time they buy one of these articles, is paying 100 per cent. tax on them.  That tariff, of course, is not going into the Exchequer.  The Government only gets it if the article <Col N="170" /> happens to be imported.  Nobody has taken the trouble to ascertain how far the actual taxation on consumers in this country has been increased since 1932, but if you balance that with a real calculation as to what is the relative production of this country in 1939 as compared with 1931, you will find that production has diminished and taxation has increased and that it was perfectly natural that unemployment and the various other social evils should increase with it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House in this matter but there is just one other aspect of the question to which I should like to refer.  There is this argument that all additional taxation goes either in increased social services or is due to the present war scare in Europe. That is not true.  When I took over the Army&mdash;I think it was in 1927&mdash;the cost of the Army was £2,300,000.  I think when I handed it over to my successor&mdash;I cannot be exact about the figures&mdash;the figure had been reduced to £1,300,000.  I may be wrong as to the exact figure but £100,000 either way does not much matter.  That was roughly the figure at any rate.  What happened when the Government came in?  The Army is not a social service. There was then no war scare in Europe. Immediately following their advent to office, they sent even to the Antipodes for men who had taken part in the civil war against the National Army and appointed them to the Army with officer rank.  It is to be presumed also that the police are not a social service. There was a party here one night and there was a fire.  There were suggestions, at least it was rather hinted, that that fire was the result of sabotage and that therefore we required additional police.  I never heard what was the cause of that fire but, at any rate, the police force was increased and so was the Army considerably at a time when there was no war scare. Now we are told that there has been an enormous increase in the cost of the Army as a result of the newspaper scare about war and people think that that is eminently justified.</P>
    <P>Personally, I do not think&mdash;though I would not like to prophesy with any degree of confidence or to wager any <Col N="171" /> large amount of money on it&mdash;that there is going to be a war in Europe. If there is going to be a war, I do not think the preparations which the Government is making for it have any relation to the situation which is likely to arise.  I have seen articles suggesting that, in the event of a war between the western and the mid-European Powers, our western ports were likely to be attacked by mid-European aircraft.  Surely we give these people credit for more common-sense than to think that they would face the barrage which would be directed against them from fortified centres in England, when crossing that country, and that they would pass over centres like London and Birmingham to come over and drop their bombs in Connemara?  It might of course happen, but in all these matters one uses a certain amount of prudence and common-sense.  What you see here is a country with production decreased, taxation increased, a country which had to face an economic war crisis and so on.  We are going to spend additional millions, and on what are we spending them?  I am satisfied that much of the money spent in regard to this defence ramp is a waste of public money.  We are, as usual, following the English model.  It does seem to me, and I have good reason for believing, that a great amount of what is being done so ostentatiously in England is done to placate public opinion in England and that it has not very much utility.  What we are doing here with A.R.P. and all sorts of preparations with the Army has not even that justification, looking at the thing in a common-sense way.  A certain amount of damage was done when the Government took over the ports.  The British, as the Government must know, argued with me in 1928 that we would have to take over those ports.  But, as they say in America, &ldquo;I come from Missouri, and you will have to show me&rdquo;, so I wanted to know what the result would be.  The British argued then that we would have to take over the ports within ten years.  This Government came along and took over the ports.  Then they came back and made an awful cry about the thing.  There <Col N="172" /> was talk to the effect that while the British were in those ports our neutrality and sovereignty were impinged upon.  They were nothing of the sort.  I myself think that the present position, with the Government wasting money in equipping those ports which the British equipped previously, and the Government taking responsibility, as I think it will have to do, for running those ports in time of war, endangers our neutrality much more than if we were simply able to say: &ldquo;The British hold those ports, and we are not responsible for what they do.&rdquo; But that is only an aside.</P>
    <P>We have taken over those ports. What is going to happen if there is a war?  I am not in a better position to prophesy than anybody else, but we have got to use common sense.  When people talk about a war, they talk about a war in which Great Britain will be involved, with certain other countries, as against certain European countries banded together.  Are we going to be involved here in this country? Why should we be?  People say: &ldquo;We send food to England.&rdquo;  Of course we do, and I have no doubt that a country fighting against England would like to see that stopped, but in every human activity you put first things first.  In order to drop bombs on the docks in Dublin an enemy would have to come right over England, facing the barrages there, and if I were the enemy, having an economic sense, I would say: &ldquo;We will drop bombs in London, and do a lot more damage, rather than risk losing planes and lives crossing over England first of all.  Even if we do get across and drop bombs on the Dublin mountains, we have got to get back again.&rdquo;  It does seem to me that, in the case of war, as long as Great Britain is not beaten, as long as the British fleet holds its position on the seas, no enemy will be in a position to come to this country and do any damage.</P>
    <P>If that position is changed, if it does happen that we are involved in a war, and that the enemy of Great Britain declares us their enemy, and that they overcome the British fleet, what are we to do?  We are increasing the Army. Last night I saw bands going around <Col N="173" /> calling for recruits for the Volunteers. What Army can we put up&mdash;I realise that this is an unpopular thing to say &mdash;against, a combination of great powers that have overcome England, and are free to land their troops in this country without let or hindrance from Great Britain and its Navy and its Allies' Navy?  I think&mdash;again this will be called unnational and unpatriotic and all the rest of it&mdash;as soon as you have the Central Powers, with England beaten, landing their troops in this country the best thing to do is to say: &ldquo;What are the best terms you are offering us?&rdquo; All this ramp about the situation in Europe and the special crisis which calls for additional expenditure in this country, which for years past has been spending and not producing, seems to me to be the sort of thing about which the newspapers make headings, but which has no basis of reality.  When you are responsible for running a country you have to use your prudence.  You have to run certain risks; you have to run the risk of a certain amount of unpopularity.  When you are the Government that is your responsibility.  The Opposition really ought to be in a position to get up and say the nice popular things all the time, while the Government, with its responsibility, ought to be fathering everything unpopular.  But the Government gets me so upset that I have to get up and say unpopular things, while they go ramping around the country saying that everything is splendid, that there will be more doles and more social services, and nobody must ask where the money is to come from.  I do think it would be much better if we had all the other members of the Cabinet in here, and dealt with them. We could put the Minister for Finance on a pedestal and say: &ldquo;We know he did his best.  We deem him innocent, but he is the only one who is innocent. All the others we mark down as very definitely guilty.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Senator Quirke says it is too bad.  If the Senators on the right-hand side of the House, on this question or on other questions, had the courage to face the problems which this country has to face with the clarity of vision and the frankness which Senator Fitzgerald has displayed, we would have more hope for the country, and we might get a policy from the Minister for Finance that would give more heart and more courage to the country than the country has to-day.  It may indeed be true, as Senator Fitzgerald says, that the Minister has the best intentions in the world, and that in the councils of his Cabinet he tells the Minister for Industry and Commerce: &ldquo;You cannot do that because it is going to cost so much&rdquo; and tells the Minister for Defence: &ldquo;You cannot do that either,&rdquo; but they are too strong and powerful and succeed in getting their way.  That may be so, but what can the Minister do when many Senators on the right come along behind the Minister for Industry and Commerce and possibly behind the Minister for Defence and drive them on, going down the country with all sorts of war-cries and demands which it is impossible for the Minister to resist.  I feel that the Minister for Finance and his colleagues, having been for years cheering the people along the roads, have led them now into a position of utter darkness. There they are, afraid to put a foot out in either one direction or the other. They cannot retreat.  They have burnt their boats, and they are afraid to go forward.  It is that feeling of want of faith, that lack of courage, that sort of inertia which seems to have taken possession of them, which makes one so hopeless about the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has produced the most extravagant Budget which the country ever saw, except on one occasion. Senator Hayes put into the shortest possible speech all the arguments indicating the present plight of the country.  The heaviest burden of taxation that we have ever borne is now being carried by fewer people, with a lower purchasing capacity, with a lower standard of living and with a lower <Col N="175" /> productive capacity than we have had here for years.  It is all right for the Minister to impose his burden of taxation if he has huge combines or trusts ready to shoulder it for him, and prepared not to pass it on.  We have an instance of that in the tobacco tax. In three Budgets we had a tax on tobacco.  In 1932 we had a tax of 1/2 per lb.  In 1934 we had an extra 8d. and this year we have 8d. again.  As far as one can see, we had no increase in the cost of cigarettes to the consumers until this year.  Although the Minister has actually imposed a tax of 2/6 in the lb., until this year we had no increase in the price of cigarettes to the consumer.  But this time the cigarette manufacturers have passed it on, and now the people are beginning to realise in every sphere of activity that the burdens which the Minister for Finance imposes have to be borne. I should like the Minister to address himself to that point later on, because, as far as I can see, all sorts of things are being alleged against the tobacco manufacturers.  I should like the Minister to clarify the position somewhat. Are those the facts&mdash;that we have had a tobacco tax of 2/6 in the lb. imposed in three Budgets?  Two lbs. of tobacco would produce 1,000 cigarettes, which means a 5/- tax on 1,000 cigarettes. Out of that, apparently, the tobacco manufacturers are getting 3/6 for the tax of 5/- which the Minister's Budgets have imposed.  There has been an outcry against the manufacturers in the country, but it is better that this bird should come home to roost and that the responsibility should be laid where it truly belongs.  My complaint is not about the burden of taxation which the Minister has imposed, but our incapacity to bear it and the inability of the Minister to do anything to make us more capable of bearing it.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald addressed himself at some length to the extravagant expenditure on our policy of defence.  It seems to me, after listening to the Minister for Defence last week, that it is very doubtful if there is any policy of defence whatever.  I think that we will only realise the chaos and confusion in this policy if, unfortunately, the <Col N="176" /> storm breaks over Europe.  I put it to the Minister on the last day, and he took me to task for saying it, that the best defensive policy in which we could engage in this country and the best way in which we could spend money on a defensive policy would be to produce more food.  The Minister wanted to know what I meant&mdash;were we not producing sufficient of the essential foods here at present?  That is the difficulty that one is up against in dealing with a Minister who puts that sort of question, because one expects in a country like this, and in times like these, when we are up against a crisis as we really are&mdash;even members of the Minister's own Party as well as those on the other side of the House know we are coming up against a crisis&mdash;a sensible question from the Minister for Finance.  He asked what is the connection between a policy of food production and a policy of defence.  Suppose we have a war. I add my view to what Senator Fitzgerald said, that we might as well be spending £1,500,000 on an army for defensive purposes as £3,500,000 or £4,000,000.  My view is that the position of our people would be very greatly altered if we adopted a policy which would make it possible for them to increase the production of food twofold, threefold, or fourfold.</P>
    <P>During a war, obviously, money will not have the same value it has in times of peace.  Goods, at any rate, would be much more valuable than money. If our standard of living is to be maintained at any reasonable level, that will only be possible by our having goods to exchange for goods from other countries which we require and cannot produce for ourselves.  These goods will be more essential to our country and to our people here than arms.  If the Minister wants to have stable, sensible conditions here in time of war, he would try to get our people to produce more and more food and give them the facilities for doing it.  He has done nothing of the kind; he seems helpless and hopeless.  I know nothing more discouraging than to try to address oneself to this problem in presence of the Minister.  We heard him here last week and we listened to him for hours in the other House, when his <Col N="177" /> words dropped one a minute, or one every two minutes, and nothing constructive came from him.  Everything was lovely in the garden.  What is the use of telling farmers that all is well with them, that the future is bright, and that they do not need any help, when three-quarters of the farmers know that they must get help and must get it from forces external to themselves. I have been talking here about credit for farmers and so have other Senators, like Senator Johnston and Senator Counihan.  Everybody in the country is talking about it, but they are talking about credit for people other than farmers as well.  Whether the Minister likes it or not, this is going to be a much more vital problem for him in the future than he is prepared to accept it as being.</P>
    <P>My view is that if we want to prepare this country either for peace or for war, the country cannot hold together and bear the present burden of taxation unless we can increase production. I can only buy when I have sold something, or when I have something to sell.  People in the towns will tell you that life in our towns, big towns as well as small, is stagnant and there is no business.  The farmers are not coming in to buy because they have not a penny to spend.  I have heard that in towns with populations ranging from 12,000 to 15,000 as well as in towns with populations of 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000.  The farmers are not coming in to buy because, as I pointed out on the last day, a farmer has to have £170 to buy what was worth only £100 pre-war. When he sells stock at a fair, he can only get £113 for what he sells as compared with £100 pre-war.  The Minister for Finance, with his scheme of taxation, expects a farmer to live and thrive, to buy and keep the new industrial policy going, keep our towns going, and keep our social services going when he has only £113 with which to buy £170 worth.  I would love to see the Minister farming under these conditions.  He would not smile the gracious smile he throws out here when he wants to try to disarm the Opposition.  The Minister and his Party may as well take the country's problems seriously, because they are very serious and grave.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="178" /> Last week I took a certain line with regard to this matter of credit.  When I was addressing myself to the position with regard to deposits in the banks he stated,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do wish that we would try to get rid of the type of request I have referred to because the fact of the matter is this, that this cry for credit for this section or that section of the population is fast becoming, in the mouths of Senator Baxter and those others who follow him, a cry for confiscation and expropriation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a statement the Minister should not make, even if it were true.  It is not the kind of statement that a wise Minister for Finance ought to make in a country like this.  Perhaps we have gone too close to confiscation and too close to expropriation to have too much talk like that from a Minister for Finance.  If you want stability and confidence in the banking system, or in our Ministers or other public men, there is no use in trying to raise storms where there are no storms. There is no use in trying to put into the mouths of people like myself, who never believed in expropriation or confiscation of one kind or another and will not stand for them to-day, things that we never have said and do not want to say.  Having said that, it is better that the Minister should recognise the fact that those of us who want to see stable conditions maintained, and progress and development, believe that these things can only be brought about by getting the people to work as hard as some of ourselves have worked and are working.  We would like to see all the people do that, but, above all, the people on the land, either those who own land or who want to work on the land.  These conditions are not present for two reasons: the Minister's policy of altering the whole balance and trend of trade; altering the whole position with regard to the relative income in towns and counties, by a system of tariffs and all the rest, and the additional fact that credits are not obtainable to-day for production in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Somebody may come after me and <Col N="179" /> talk about profitable agriculture.  I put it to them now, that there is no use in talking about cow farming being profitable if a man has only six cows. That man cannot engage in profitable agriculture if he has a ten-cow farm, but only six cows.  He can only be in agriculture profitably if he has ten good cows&mdash;not ten bad ones.  If he has not the money and cannot get the security which, apparently, money demands at present by those engaged in money making, and cannot get the credit, that credit must be forthcoming, because he can only engage in agriculture profitably if his land is fully stocked.  If that statement is untrue let some Senator in the Government Party stand up and contradict it.  I go so far as to say that possibly 40 or 50 per cent. of our farmers want credit to enable them to bring their stock of six cows up to ten cows.  Probably 25 per cent. of them have only got two cows, and there may be 10 per cent. who have no cow at all when they should have ten cows.  How can we have production or have purchasing capacity under such circumstances? How could these people pay their relative share of taxation if that is their plight?  That is their plight.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that a great many people here are quite convinced that the whole monetary policy of the Government will have to be changed, and that the one way to do it is to get our £ away from present parity with the British £.  The Minister has heard that policy advocated.  I presume that a number of people, as well as members of his Party, in town and country believe in that policy.  If, in his responsible position as Minister for Finance, he cannot devise a scheme whereby credit can be made available for people who want credit, and who will wisely use credit on the basis of the savings that the people have stored to their credit as a result of their work in the past, what I am greatly afraid you are going to have them driven to is that credit must be made available on the work and earnings of people in the future.  As between the two, the Minister may as well face up to the <Col N="180" /> fact that that will frighten and terrify many people.  It is going to destroy the work and the savings of half a generation that liked to think in terms of thrift and industry.</P>
    <P>There may be losses to the Minister for Finance in securing that certain people will get credit, and that, ultimately, if that is so, the State will have responsibility.  In my judgment it would be better to face up to that, and to take the responsibility, rather than run the risk of the other thing happening.  I put it to the Minister, that if he only took the £600,000, plus the £45,000 yearly, that he is going to make available under the Tourist Bill, and handed that to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, it would be able to underwrite 90 per cent. of the loans that are necessary for agriculture.  If, to these amounts, he added the £500,000 which the Minister for Defence asked for in a recent Bill, he would go very far indeed to solve this problem of agricultural credit.  If he did that, it would keep boys and girls from running to England, as he would be giving more stable conditions to farming at home, by making it possible to produce, as a result of which people would be able to buy the products of our industries in towns and cities.  In addition the Unemployment Bill and other schemes, for which he had to find £1,500,000 in the Budget, would not be so heavy, and the whole vicious circle which he by his policy has created, would be reversed.  In my view that would be a wise policy for the Minister for Finance.  I know that he is not prepared to take much advice.  The Government have sown their wild oats and they know what the reaping has been like.  The economic war is a case in point.  Now we have a depopulated countryside as well as other consequences. Land that should be in full production is now lying waste, being neither stocked nor producing crops. Perhaps some Senators who are farmers, and who may disagree with my views, when replying, will tell the House when last they heard of a farmer's marriage.</P>

      <P>It was tantamount to that.  They decried expenditure by the Government on defence.  Senator Fitzgerald said, in effect, that it would have been better to leave the defence of this nation to the British than to spend money on defence ourselves. That is no way for Irishmen to talk. When we started out to work this country in 1916, and in subsequent years, we held the view that Ireland was worth defending, and that it should not depend on fountain pens for its defence.  For that reason it is a terrible thing at this time to see men standing up and decrying the defence of their own country.  We are spending money on defence and we are justified in spending it.  When attacks are made in this or in the other House I say that we must strive to defend this country in every way so as to resist attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general policy of the Government has been criticised.  Many years ago Irishmen preached the doctrine that we should not be dependent on foreigners. The greatest industry we have is agriculture. I hold that this Government has done its best and has, at least, gone a long way to defend that industry.  One would imagine from the speeches that have been made that nothing had been done for it, and that Irish farmers were in a worse position than farmers in any other country.  I wonder would English farmers or American farmers agree with that.  In both of these countries, as we know <Col N="182" /> from reading the newspapers, there have been strong agitations by agricultural interests against these Governments on account of the position of the agricultural industry.  Here we have done as much, if not more, than any other country to defend agriculture.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter spoke of the credit of the farming community.  Credit has been given on the best possible terms to farmers.  It should be remembered that credit is a thing that has to be dealt with very delicately.  Senator Baxter must remember there are other people in this country besides farmers. The Government cannot concentrate on one particular section of the people. The Senator must realise there are other people who may need help, and the funds at the disposal of the Government have to be so arranged that no section of the people will suffer unduly.  It is unfair and unjust to say that practically nothing has been done for the farmers.  Quite a lot has been done.  Were the farmers given what many of them apparently want, were they given free markets, free imports, free exports, and if they had to sell many of their products in the world market at world prices, would their position have been any better?  Were it not for the support given by the Government to milk and milk products, and to other items of farming, I hold that the farmers would be far worse off.  Although I agree that more should be done for them if it were possible to do it, I do not agree with the statement that nothing has been done for the farming community.  I would be glad, and I am sure we all would be glad, to do everything we possibly could to help the farmers more than we are helping them.  If any feasible scheme is put up, I am sure the Government would be only glad to consider it, consistent with being careful to see that the other sections of the people are not unduly interfered with.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of money has been spent on housing.  If there is anything that this Government can be proud of it is the money they spent on housing.  They found this country in a very bad way as regards housing.  Many of our people were living under terrible conditions in the larger towns and <Col N="183" /> cities.  Many of the farmers were living in what are known as rural slums.  If one travels through Ireland to-day one will observe the change that has taken place in a period of five years.  I hold, and I believe that any reasonable man will hold, that the expenditure on housing sanctioned by this Government has been a justifiable expenditure.  If that money had not been expended on improving the housing position, no doubt the Government would be considered worthy of the greatest condemnation. I hold that, wherever the money may be got, housing subsidies should not stop until every family needing a house is provided with a decent one.</P>
    <P>This is a young country, comparatively speaking.  The Government of this country was placed in our hands only a few years ago.  The initial expenditure in organising and developing the country is bound to be heavy. When reference is made to the so-called economic war, one must realise that such a thing as the economic war is a type of investment for the future.  I may be told that it was a very expensive investment and an unwise investment.  I do not hold it was.  I think the sacrifices made by the Irish farmers during the economic war were justified and, in the end, it will prove to have been a very good war for this country.  The hardships suffered during the period of that struggle were undoubtedly severe, but you get nothing in this world without sacrifices.  The people of this nation made many sacrifices in the past for what they considered right and justice, and I am sure that if ever they were called upon again, the Irish people, not alone the farmers but the people as a whole, will be prepared to make any sacrifice that may be required to put this nation where it should be.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about social services.  We on this side of the House speak of them in order to justify the action of the Government. Senators on the other side more or less decry them.  They hold that they are uneconomic and that any money we are spending on social services might be better expended in other ways.  I am <Col N="184" /> not charging the men on the other side with entirely decrying social services. They claim to be as anxious to improve the social conditions of the people as we are.  But when we improve social services, when we increase them and do all we possibly can for the underdog, we are accused of extravagance. You cannot do these things without expenditure.  I am a taxpayer and I am aware that any taxpayer would be glad to see taxation reduced.  But you cannot have it both ways.  If you want to develop and defend your country, and improve the social conditions of your people, you have to spend money, and in order to get that money you have to tax your people.</P>
    <P>Many arguments could be brought forward to prove that the policy of the Government is wrong.  I am not going to stand here and say that everything the Government have done is right. This Government, as other Governments, have made mistakes, and possibly they will make more mistakes, but, on the whole, the Government have acted as well and as fairly as any Government could be expected to do under the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak in this debate, but I have been stung into saying a few words by some of the speeches that have already been made.  We seem inevitably, whenever we talk of finance, to get back in some degree to a discussion of the economic war and its consequences.  I do not think, at this time of day, there is much to be gained by thrashing out again the pros and cons of the economic war.  I would just remind Senator Goulding of one thing, and that is that in the view of some of us, the financial settlement by which that dispute was ended could have been made in 1932 instead of when it was made, but for the fact that our Government wished to go on with the policy of removing every Commonwealth taint from our Constitution and getting the King out of our Constitution.</P>

If we really, in our hearts, cared as deeply about that subject as we ought to, we would not have got the Commonwealth taint out of the Constitution and we would not have got the King out of the Constitution either.  If we are to get rid of Partition we will have to go laboriously back and undo much of what was done in these matters during the last few years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wish to make is that the Irish farmers, in the course of the so-called economic war, were paying the price, not of a financial dispute really; they were paying the price of the constitutional advances or regressions, according to the point of view from which you look at them, that the present Government chose to make, and the price of what Deputy Goulding would call our new won liberties and our new won glories has been paid by the Irish farmers and by the Irish farmers almost solely.  That is a fact that ought to be borne in mind when we are considering their needs.  I do not think that the economic condition of the Irish farmers is satisfactory.  I admit the condition of farmers is pretty bad everywhere, but I maintain that the economic condition of the Irish farmers would be enormously better than it is were it not for the destruction of so much of their capital during what is called the economic war, by Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I say that, at the same time I must admit that what really called me to my feet was not the speech by Senator Goulding, but some of the observations made by those who were criticising the Government.  I do not know if there are many who feel like me, but, at any rate, I, for one, am filled with weariness when, in discussions on Finance Bills and Budgets, year after year, I hear terrific onslaughts being made on the Government for alleged extravagance.  I have <Col N="186" /> never seen any opportunities availed of throughout the year to enforce or advocate economy by the very people who make those attacks.  During the six years or so when I was in the Dáil, I saw many expensive measures brought in.  I am not going to stop and argue as to whether those measures were good or bad measures, but, at any rate, there were a great many expensive measures brought in&mdash; Unemployment Assistance Acts, pensions for widows and orphans, enlargement of old age pensions, more and more military pensions and, within my recollection, the Opposition have never criticised any Government schemes for social services involving expense, except on the ground that they were too mean and too niggardly and that much more ought to have been spent.</P>
    <P>We have had lately, it is true, a Tourist Traffic Bill, involving expense, which has been criticised by some individual members of the Opposition in this House, but has not been opposed officially by the Opposition in the other House; and it is not really a good illustration of opposing extravagance, because, whether the Government are right or wrong, they look upon the money that is proposed to be spent on the Tourist Bill as a sprat to catch a whale.  They do not expect it to impoverish the country.  They expect it, rightly or wrongly, to bring wealth into the country, to create new invisible exports of which we stand badly in need, and, incidentally, to bring money into the country that would be of benefit to the farming class among other classes.  Speaking in general, however, those who attack the Government at Budget time for its wild extravagance are themselves, during the year, egging on the Government to more and more expenditure. When, as I pointed out at an earlier stage of this Bill, the Minister brought in a Bill for temporary economies, they opposed that most fiercely, and when we had an opportunity, a little while ago, of giving the country an example of that sort of self-abnegation, which we now want the people of the country as a whole to have&mdash;the spirit of asking as little as possible from the public <Col N="187" /> funds, and so on&mdash;we did not take that opportunity and the Opposition did not advocate that we should take that opportunity.  Instead of that, we laid ourselves open, in fact, to the retort that if we wanted to preach self-sacrifice to the people, we might have set an example of it ourselves in relation to our own persons, and we did not do it.  Consequently, I find that the discrepancy between these sweeping attacks on the Government at Budget times and what is done during the rest of the year on individual measures is a discrepancy that is really too wide to be endured with any patience.</P>
    <P>The other point on which I wish to touch is what Senator Fitzgerald said in regard to defence.  I do not agree with him.  To this extent I agree with him&mdash;I wish we were told more about our defence arrangements&mdash;that I suspect that a lot of this money that is going to be spent on anti-aircraft measures is going to be thrown away. I strongly suspect it, and I am extremely sceptical as to the probability of any air raid taking place on this country during a European war. Moreover, I should like to know whether we have got the best technical talent working on our defence schemes that is to be got.  I should like to have more assurance that the money that is being spent on defence is not being misspent.</P>
    <P>That, however, is not to say that I consider that we should not spend any money on defence at all.  The logical consequence of what Senator Fitzgerald said was, certainly, that we should not have an army at all&mdash;a police force, yes, to deal with internal order, but an army, no.  The basis of his contention seemed to be the theory that the British Navy would keep any prospective enemy from getting through at all, or else that the enemies would get through in such overwhelming numbers that it would be no use our trying to defend ourselves against them.  Now, that basis seems to me to be unsound.  It is possible that the British Navy will not be supreme in another European War.  It is possible that the British Navy will have to fight for its life.  It is possible <Col N="188" /> that sea power will be a great deal more balanced than it was in the last war.  At the same time, while that may be so, it does not follow that enormous invading armies may be able to make their way to this country.  We may get a situation such as we had in the 18th century when it was possible for a small force or a moderate force to make its way to this country.  Even though the British Navy was the most powerful navy in Europe at the time, it was possible for a force to get here. Now, if that should happen, ought we not be able to deal with it?  I think we ought.  I would even go so far as to favour the general principle of universal military training for the youth of this country, because I regard it as the proper democratic principle everywhere&mdash;and I regard it, indeed, as a pacifist measure and not a jingo measure&mdash;so that everyone may feel a responsibility in regard to war and the stirring up of the kind of hatred that brings war.  I think we are perfectly right to have an army in this country, and my feeling is, in fact, that we could usefully spend less than we are proposing to spend on measures against air-raids and more than we are proposing to spend on our Army as a whole.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised about the ports.  Senator Fitzgerald says that we made a mistake in taking them over.  Well, now, that all depends on your point of view.  I, being a believer in the Commonwealth and our membership of it, regard the British Navy as my navy&mdash;as our navy &mdash;but how many people in this country do feel that?  How many people in this House do feel that: How many people in Senator Fitzgerald's Party do feel that?  That is the question; and if we do not feel that, well, then, it appears to me that national prestige, national honour, national pride, do demand the taking over of our own ports and the defence of them by ourselves, and I do not think that anyone who has the fashionable point of view about what our nationality involves can be heard to complain of the expense entailed. If you hold certain principles and ideals, you have got to pay the expenses that they involve.  I think we would be in a contemptible position <Col N="189" /> if we went on regarding the British Navy as a foreign navy, regarding England as a foreign Power, regarding ourselves as in no way bound up with the general welfare or general foreign policy of the Commonwealth, and yet refusing to look after our own defences.  Obviously, if we take that line, it is our job to look after our own defences and I do not think anyone has the right to complain of money being spent in that way.</P>

      <P>Like the last speaker, I have been stung into taking part in this debate and that is largely due to the people who call themselves the Opposition in this House.  Lest we might be accused of agreeing with the people who call themselves the Opposition in this House, I want to try and put our views on this Bill.  When Senator Fitzgerald was speaking I was wondering if I was in Ireland or in a foreign country dominated by what is known as a dictator.  I wondered why this man should take up the attitude he did on this Bill.  I pondered for a long time, and then a blue shirt came into my vision and I immediately understood.  I remember a time in this House when this man, representing the Government, came in here and deprived the old age pensioners of a shilling a week in their pensions.  At the same time, or about that period the unemployed people happened to be in credit in the Unemployment Fund and the attitude of these people was to reduce the employers' contribution to this Fund and thereby deprive the unfortunate unemployed people of their rights through the Unemployment Fund.  Apparently, many people in the country saw that as well as I, and at the election the then Government got short shrift.  Consequently, we had Senator Fitzgerald in this House advising the present Government to take the same line as they had taken with the democracy, the working class people, of this country.  I give the Government credit for having sufficient sense to see the horrible example of the people who wore the blue shirts and who were prepared to persecute the common people of this country. They are in the wilderness now, and <Col N="190" /> so long as they advocate that policy they will remain in the wilderness and no Government with any common sense is going to imitate their policy with the people of this country.</P>
      <P>There is a sinister atmosphere about the whole discussion here.  Senator Baxter and Senator Fitzgerald concentrated on reducing the social services in this country and every time they advocated that a certain representative in this House of the Bank of Ireland was very audible with a &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo;! That makes me very apprehensive of the line-up of the financial interests with certain other interests in this country.  As an example of that line up the Corporation of Dublin, the capital city of Ireland, recently went for a loan of, I think, £1,500,000.  The Government guaranteed the loan; the banks did nothing to make the loan a success. The amount subscribed was in or about £1,000,000 or something less. The object of the loan was housing. It is very easy to see what is happening there.  The banks are going to make the Government toe the line if they can.  It happened in a neighbouring country not so many years ago when a Labour Government were in power.  They were determined to give the common people of the country a fair deal.  The banks stepped in and sabotaged them.  I merely mention that so that the Government will take a strong line with the financial interests in this country.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter deplored the condition of the farmers and regretted that the Government were allocating £40,000 to tourist development.  He regarded that as wasted money.  I have very little hope for the mentality that considers that as wasted money. If there is any direct way of helping the farmers it is to a great extent through the tourist development.  I want to explain for Senator Baxter's benefit.  We have tourists coming in here and consuming the products of the farmer, thereby improving his market and his price.  That is very easy to understand, at least to me it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding defence, Senator Fitzgerald says it is futile, hopeless, for <Col N="191" /> Ireland to think of defending herself. Irishmen are regarded as being somewhat foolish but that is an old-standing folly.  Centuries ago Irish people thought it was worth while defending the country and I think as long as the country lasts they will go on defending it and I believe it is very well worth while.  Possibly there is some connection between the blue and the black shirt and those who wore the blue shirt may have something in common with some of the people who are disturbing the peace of the world at the present time and, consequently, may not be in favour of defending the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald deplored tariffs. I do not regard tariffs in themselves as an evil in the country.  I have a commonsense way of looking at tariffs.  If we produce our requirements in this country they may cost £2 but the £2 is kept in the country.  If we buy a foreign article which costs £1 we are exporting money to the extent of £1. The country is at that much loss.</P>

      <P>I do not know that there is very much more for me to say except that the housing problem in this country is a cancer.  The Government must insist on money being provided to ensure that the housing problem in this country is very substantially improved. Until the slums are eliminated, they should accept no dictation from the financiers or the bankers.  We cannot have prosperity so long as we have a big slum problem, and so long as we have unemployment standing at the figure at which we know it to-day.  So long as we have that unemployment the resources of the country must be made available for those people.</P>

      <P>I am perhaps rather fortunate that I only gave the last Senator the opportunity of a sort of anticipatory back-handry to draw conclusions from reactions of mine to certain remarks made by other speakers.  I really cannot remember now whether I approved of all they said or not, but, in so far as they said that we had to live within our means I certainly approve of that.  I have no recollection of applauding any remarks that were made about social services. I do say that if, in order to live within our means, we have to reduce the social services, in conjunction with other services, then I say that has got to be done or else we have got to embark on financial methods, some of which were referred to in the other House last week: methods of which we hear a great deal from amateurs on the Labour Benches.  One may say that such methods have brought disaster on every other country in which they have been employed and will bring disaster on this country if employed here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that later.  I am sorry that the Minister should have to suffer this fortnight of financial fire.  He had a long dose of it in the Dáil, ending up last week with the debate on the Adjournment. But Senators get so few opportunities <Col N="193" /> of discussing these matters that I feel sure the Minister will forbear with me and with the others in the remarks that we have to make.  I rise chiefly for the purpose of commenting further on certain remarks made by the Minister in his reply in the Second Reading debate on the Finance Bill in this House.  I do not for a moment imagine that the Minister's remarks were made intentionally, but it is a very favourite method for people of responsibility to accuse their critics of making remarks calculated, perhaps unwittingly, to destroy public credit.  Of course, nobody who has to live in the country and pay taxes here wants to destroy public credit, but a public representative, seeing certain things staring him in the face, has to say them even if they may be held to be a criticism of public finance and public credit.  The Minister contended&mdash;he actually mentioned Senator MacDermot and myself &mdash;that certain adjectives used in our remarks on the Second Reading, such as &ldquo;grave&rdquo; and &ldquo;serious,&rdquo; in relation to our finances were not justified.</P>
      <P>I would like to say why I consider those statements well justified.  Some four or five years ago the Government appointed a body of experts, not all bankers, to carry out an investigation into our whole position.  In passing, I may say that the mention of bankers here seems to have much the same effect on some members of the House as the use of a red rag to a bull.  But this body of experts, on which there was a minority of bankers, was set up to examine, as I have said, our whole position.  The commission is wrongly called a Banking Commission.  The commission investigated a very wide range of subjects, banking being, incidentally, one of them.  One of the conclusions arrived at by this body&mdash; it is prefaced by a long series of statistical statements, and may I express the hope that Senator Foran has read it and that, having read it, he understands it&mdash;was this:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The figures here reviewed indicate that there has been a marked deterioration in recent years in the state of the public finances.  That this deterioration should be checked is, in our view, a matter of urgent <Col N="194" /> necessity.  We are of opinion that as the main resources of the country are still comparatively intact it is the trend, and not the absolute impairment already suffered, that chiefly calls for criticism.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If any remarks could be said to be calculated to injure public credit you have them there in that reasoned opinion of a body of Irishmen drawn from all Parties.  That statement has behind it the support of an overwhelming majority of the members of that commission.  It is because of the reactions of the Government to that report that I feel the matter is really serious.  I know, of course, that there must be a time lag.  The Minister dealt with that aspect of the question in the Dáil.  One could not reasonably expect a Government to have remedies ready to deal with all the matters that come up for review in a comprehensive report of that kind.  What I do feel is that if the Government were serious in dealing with this report, they would have done something to give effect to its recommendations.  Instead, what do we find?  A record Budget and a number of schemes involving further expenditure of a revenue and capital character.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to enter into any defence of the banking system.  I could not very well do so without indirectly disclosing matters which are confidential. I do want to say this to Senator Foran that, apart from any views that he may hold about the banking system, he was utterly misinformed on the matters to which he made reference a short time ago.  There seems to be the idea in this country that banks are there to give out money for every kind of enterprise, productive or unproductive.  It seems to be a foregone conclusion that it is the business of the banks to find from £5,000,000 to £7,000,000 to finance housing schemes. I wonder does Senator Foran ever ask himself the question: whose money is it that the banks are handling?  The Senator talked as if the money in the custody of the banks belonged to a lot of rich men.  I think that if an examination were made of the capital of the banks, it would be found that a very small percentage belongs to <Col N="195" /> really rich men, and that the people who really own it are comparatively small men.  In fact, I should not be surprised if some of them were members of the Labour Party.  The bulk of this money, which Senator Foran wants to give out, represents, to a very large extent, I would venture to say, the hard earned savings of the small farmers of the country, the men of whom Senator Baxter speaks so frequently in this House.  The banks are simply holding their money on trust, but, according to Senator Foran, this is money that the banks should give out with a lavish hand for every kind of scheme of what they call social reform and community amelioration that they choose to think about.  Who is holding up the public?  Now, I want to come to that.  Senator Foran and the citizens are holding up the public. Why, if there is such great confidence, do the public not find the money themselves? Nobody seems to deal with that.  Why is it so difficult for the corporation to find money?  It is because the people of the country, the investors, for some reason or other are not forthcoming with the money. Why is that?  I leave others to draw their own conclusions, but I do not suggest for a moment that there is any anti-social or anti-national spirit among the investors.</P>
    <P>There are two things to be considered. In the first place there is alarm, in my opinion, at remarks and utterances like those which I have read out of the Banking Commission's report, taken in conjunction with the expanding expenditure and the further schemes for borrowing money.  Furthermore, the measure of borrowing is outstripping and going ahead of the measure of saving.  There was a heavy loan raised&mdash;and I think everybody will agree that it was generously supported by the public&mdash;last year to find money for the Financial Agreement.  You cannot go on expecting £10,000,000 a year out of public savings.  I am not in a position, and I do not suppose that anybody in the House is in a position, to say what the amount of public savings is, that one can expect a new investment every year.  They are certainly <Col N="196" /> not that amount, and I believe that they are less, and certainly not sufficient for the schemes that the Government is so lightheartedly embarking upon.  I welcome the recommendations of the Banking Commission Report that there should be some body like a debt and investment council to examine these matters and advise the Government as to how far they can go and expect public response.</P>
    <P>Let it be clearly understood that it is not the business of the Government or of the banks to find money for every sort of scheme put up, whether by the Government or by local authorities or by the Labour Party, for expenditure, a lot of which has been proved in the past to be unproductive.  Even housing and the very admirable and necessary social services must be conditioned by our means.  We see to-day that, in spite of two-thirds of the debt charges on houses being borne by the State there is a deficit on the ratepayers of 16/- per flat per week.  In the face of that there has been a recent substantial rise, I think, of about £200 in the cost of building a flat, of which 17 per cent. is a result of the increased demand of labour.  Senator Foran speaks as if labour had no responsibility in this matter, as if investors, banks, and others are to issue the money and labour is to make whatever demands it chooses.  In this matter of social services, and especially that of housing, labour has every bit as great a responsibility on its shoulders as any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>This is again a matter of opinion: a lot of us, and probably the majority in the country, feel that this expenditure can go on for ever; but finance is the acid test, and there are vested interests, people who have the money, who have got to be persuaded that the finances of the country are economically and soundly managed; and they believe that we have reached the limit in expenditure and that we are borrowing beyond our saving power and investing capacity.  What is to be done about it?  Senator Baxter has adumbrated the opinion that we can go into some reform by which we can try to produce new money.  We hear <Col N="197" /> that policy also from a Deputy in the Dáil.  It is really the policy of the printing press&mdash;of bringing money into being without an equivalent in production. That cannot be done.  We know what has been experienced all over the world by that policy and what disastrous effects it has had.  There is the other method which, I submit, has always been the only method, that is the policy of living within our means.</P>
    <P>That policy is applied to the individual and it has some analogy when applied also to the State.  Of course, the State has wider resources and can go on much longer, but it has been going to the limit of its powers.  It is now felt that the time has come for a parting of the ways.  We have got to retrench, stop borrowing&mdash;however estimable the services may be&mdash;and give up the talk of unlimited social services and houses for everybody, until we can see that they can be soundly financed.  That is the acid test. We can print paper money but it means inflation, it means rising prices; it means that there will be houses built, but that the cost of labour will be running after the housing costs and the costs of the houses will be running higher and higher in consequence, until eventually we find ourselves in an economic desert.</P>
    <P>The difficulty that I see is the political one.  As far as I can see, any Party would run considerable risks in going to the country on this question of sound finance, because it means the stopping of the rake's progress, it means the reduction of expenditure and the cessation of borrowing.  I do feel, however, that the country and the Government should be serious about it; it is a crisis which should be faced by the united Parties of the country. I feel that, if there ever was a time for some form of united action, that time is now.  A National Government could go to the country and tell the truth and give up the dangerous line of least resistance.  If we all do it together that would be a safeguard, but no Party could run the risk of doing it alone.  It is an unpopular thing to do and any Party would have to face the loss of its reputation, which is an <Col N="198" /> important factor in a democracy.  Even that does not alter the facts, because the country does not understand that the arithmetic tables remain the same.</P>
    <P>This system is repeating what has happened in Australia.  We know&mdash;I have not got the exact figures&mdash;that about seven or eight years ago the Australian people were in the same difficulties.  The situation there was somewhat different in its structure to the situation here: there were several State Governments and there was also a Central Government.  They were all borrowing in the manner in which Senator Foran thinks that borrowing is possible everywhere.  But they found that it was absolutely impossible, that there was the risk of repudiation and disaster.  In this country, a responsible Deputy here in the Dáil the other day said that our people come first and our credit afterwards.  These are the people who ruin our national credit. Australia at that time faced the reality of the situation.  One man&mdash; whose name is not generally known&mdash; was responsible for the action taken, and that man was the Attorney-General of one State.  The salaries of the civil servants were cut by 20 per cent.  That had to be done.  I see not so much by his remarks as by his facial expression, that Senator Foran considers that it is dreadful that anybody's salary should be cut 20 per cent., but surely it is better to have one's salary cut by 20 per cent. than to get the sack altogether, and have the whole show closed down.  The doctrine of inflation reached the point where it could go no further and the Australians came back to orthodox finance and got right again.</P>
    <P>Senator Foran will say that New Zealand has gone right.  New Zealand, I know, has been reaping the first fruits of a new monetary policy, of those doctrines that control of credit and currency by the State will result in the stimulation of production.  It has only been going on in New Zealand for about two years, however, and we see already that they are full of anxiety there about discharging their obligations.  He thinks that we should be light-hearted about dis- <Col N="199" /> charging our obligations.  If we are going to discharge them we are not going to do it except on the basis of sound finance.  Does he wish to have rising prices, followed by rising demands, going the whole vicious circle until we reach the point where the pound would be worth a shilling, where you could buy, as you could in Germany some time ago, 5,000 pound notes for a penny, when people papered their walls with repudiated notes.  It may be that that is the course that is recommended to-day.</P>
    <P>Australia is all right now, on the basis of sound economics.  It is too soon yet to say anything about New Zealand, but it is a matter of anxiety there for those people who are in a position to judge.  I suggest to the Government to follow the example of Australia by getting back to the orthodox method of paying its debts and putting its house in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to put some questions to the Minister with regard to the tobacco tax.  I understand that the tax imposed here is 8d. per lb., while the tax on the other side is 2/- per lb., and yet the increase in the price of tobacco and cigarettes is the same here as in England.  I gather that this question is before the Prices Commission and that leads me to another question. In the case of a firm or manufacturer brought before the Prices Commission and found to have charged an exorbitant price, where does the money go?  Are the people who charge that extra price allowed to get away with it?  I think that is a matter which should be examined and that steps should be taken to rectify a position of that kind.  We can all see a position arising in which the Prices Commission would be asked to investigate the price of an article, and that investigation taking probably six or eight months. While the investigation was proceeding, the people would be paying the extra price, and if it is found that they have been overcharged, the Minister, I think, should seek power to recoup them.  Undoubtedly, he is blamed for <Col N="200" /> it, and when he is blamed, I think he should also have the gain.</P>
      <P>We have heard much criticism from the other side because of exorbitant taxation, but the only suggestion which I have heard from the Opposition as to economies is in relation to social services, and also the argument that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government should not be set down as a social service. These are the only suggestions I heard offered.  I should like to ask the Opposition whether they propose to economise on old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, unemployment assistance, or any of these schemes?</P>

    <P>Senator Fitzgerald stated that the British Government at one time offered him the ports, and that he had refused to take them over.  I should like to ask the Senator if that offer is on record in his Department.  I think it should have been recorded, because it is such a big item that it should not be passed over lightly or left unrecorded. Senator MacDermot, of course, says <Col N="201" /> that the reason we had to pay over £10,000,000 to England was that we abandoned the King and made changes in the Constitution, and that, on account of that, we can never hope to end Partition.</P>

      <P>With regard to the plea of the Senator who is now leaving the House that more money should be spent on food production, I am in thorough accord with it.  That plea has been put forward many a time, and, if the country is to be defended, its defence and that of other countries who may possibly be allied with this country in that defence, will be largely based on food supplies.  I believe it is necessary for the Government to take time by the forelock and to see that the foundation for meeting that situation should be laid, and laid immediately, and I think that some of the moneys voted for defence should be spent in this direction.  A part of our physical defence training might be the inculcation of agricultural and food production principles in a food production army, a supplies army, with our workers placed on the land, and that food production of such a nature that it could be conserved, either by tilling or by preserving, in some such way as is operated in other countries, should be embarked upon.  There should be a large scheme of food production and if there was not a market for beef in England and Germany, there are ways of conserving beef which could be profitably employed.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the State should take this matter in hand and should use the Army as one of the channels through which this process could be worked out.  There is undoubtedly food going to waste in the country at the moment.  Rich grass lands are lying derelict because the farmers are not in the position to stock them.  We have heard about the six much cows on lands on which ten could profitably be used, and the same applies to stock of all descriptions.  The farmers at present cannot stock their lands and the best food factory we have, the land, is standing idle.  That should be worked, and not alone would it place us in a secure position in time of war, if the war clouds should break upon us, but it would bring our people back to the land.  I believe that the food conserved on the land by tilling processes could be used and would be found to be a valuable asset in time of difficulty.</P>

      <Col N="203" /> I was astonished at the attitude of Senator Fitzgerald in this matter.  He was once Minister for War in this country. Surely, if he were in similar position to-day, he would not adopt the pacific attitude to which he has given expression here to-day.  I think it would be contrary to our people's record and history to suggest that we have reached the stage at which we lie quiescent when danger threatens from any quarter, when we should at least do everything possible within our means, and exert the last ounce of strength physically, financially and otherwise.  It can never be said that Irishmen at this stage of their history are no longer prepared to do their duty towards the protection of their country. These are some of the things to which the Minister should apply himself.</P>
    <P>With regard to the moneys to be devoted for the tourist business, I am not altogether so convinced that these will bring the promised results.  Certainly they will not bring them this year and they will not bring them next year. I believe that the money could be more profitably used in some other way. Whether certain things happen or do not happen in the next few years, I believe that the tourist trade will not bring the relief to the farmers that was suggested by some of the speakers to-day.  I support the Senator who drew the attention of the Minister to the rise in the price of tobacco. Tobacco can hardly any longer be regarded as a luxury&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane was, I think, very unfair to New Zealand.  It is not true that New Zealand has not been given a fair test.  The Labour Government there have been much longer in power than Senator Sir John Keane stated.  They were re-elected <Col N="204" /> last year, after three periods of office, and by a very large majority too.  They did not bring about the resuscitation of their country by cutting salaries by 20 per cent.  I do not know what Australia does, but it was a standard measure there to cut down salaries all round.  Railwaymen, old age pensioners, school teachers and professors, all had their salaries cut.  The late Government in this country tried this.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Government in this country tried it, and where did it leave us?  Very well stranded.  They have lost their powers of government, and if they come back again they will probably try the same experiment and end where they began.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those people who are pessimistic about the country. There is a future before it.  The right methods are being pursued, and though the question of tariffs is not sufficiently examined or enforced with due care, I admit that on general lines an effort has been made for a balanced policy between industrial and agricultural life in this country.  New Zealand has not got justice from the speakers here to-day. In 1935 New Zealand was bankrupt. The farmers could not embark upon any productive course of agriculture. They could not pay wages.  The wages of civil servants were cut to the last penny, and a reduction of social services had been embarked on for a number of years by a Government similar to the Government in England, consisting of Unionists and Liberals. That Government was tried for years. If New Zealand is now in trouble, it is in trouble by reason of the fact that its predecessors embarked upon borrowing very big loans from England, and paid millions and millions of pounds in interest and sinking fund in respect of these loans.  If anything is wrong to-day in New Zealand, it is the predecessors of the present Government who should be blamed.  I would ask the Senators who have spoken to-day and the Minister himself to be fair to New Zealand, and I suggest that if he studies their methods he will in due time be converted to following the policy that has been followed there. That policy will get this country out of the financial state to which the present policy has brought it.</P>

      <P>I will not detain the House very long.  Before I speak on general lines there are three matters on which I want to speak.  These were somewhat irrelevantly raised here, and with these I must express my dissent. I am amazed to find that tobacco is a luxury for women and not for men.  I am amazed to find that it is only men who are entitled to have their nerves soothed, and that women are not so entitled.  That is a policy from which I dissent.  I also dissent from what Senator MacDermot said.  As one who believes in the Association of the British Commonwealth of Nations, I dissent from him when he speaks of the British Navy as our navy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>May I infer from that, that if the Senator's son proposes to join the British Navy to-morrow, he would regard him as going into a foreign navy, or would he consider it necessary, in order to satisfy his national aspirations, to send him down to one of our few boats in Cobh?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am still an unconverted pacifist and I hope my son will not join any navy.  That is the only honest answer I can give to the Senator.  The third point to which I would like to refer is the look of complete horror on the face of Senator O'Donovan when somebody suggested that there might be a change in the Constitution.  We started here with a Constitution and we amended that Constitution nineteen times.  It is quite in order to further amend that Constitution. Still it is the law.  It is constitutional law and I think we are bound by it just as we are bound by any other law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> My principal reason for speaking is the question of the general policy.  It seems to me that a great deal of wild, loose talk was indulged in with regard to our financial position.  If it is to be the policy of this State to try the experiment of inflation by printing money let it be the national policy, sponsored by the Government, and let us try it and take the consequences, whether good or bad.  Do not let us mix up what I conceive to be the general policy of the present Government&mdash;together with the policy of their predecessors&mdash;which is to live within our means, or at any rate, try to do so.  Do not mix that up with the policy which would have to be a very carefully thought out State policy and which would have to be sanctioned by the people as a deliberate policy.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that you cannot do all the things that have been advocated here within the widest limits of the present Government's policy.  Many Senators have advocated an extended defence policy; others have said that our social services should be increased, that we should provide more money for capital enterprises and that we ought not to reduce any salaries.  You cannot do all of these things.  The world, in my opinion, cannot go on increasing social services, increasing employment and piling up defence expenditure at the present rate.  We, as a small country, cannot do it either. I am probably the only Senator who would advocate for small nations, such as ours, a policy of non-defence.  I do not believe that it is possible for us to spend enough money, within our means, to provide what would be regarded as an adequate military defence.  For my part, I would much prefer that we should take courage and simply say that we would be a nation of non-resisters.  I do not agree with those who believe that the strength of our national position depends on the times at which we are prepared to defend our position by violence.  I believe the strength of Irish nationhood lay in the fact that the Irish people stuck to it, because that strength was displayed even in times of peace, and that, though our country had in a measure to accept <Col N="207" /> government by an outside people, the country never actually accepted it.  I do not think you can successfully defend this country simply by military means.  We have to make up our minds either to do without social services or, if you like, to increase defence because we cannot do both.  To my mind, it is not much use discussing finances, in the present state of the world, from a Party point of view.</P>
    <P>We had the technique of unreasoning opposition from some members of the present Government when they were in opposition.  Everything was wrong; every expenditure could be less.  We have certain persons now in opposition who would like to take exactly the same point of view, but I do not think it is the point of view of the more responsible members of this House or of the Dáil.  There must be differences of opinion as to how and where you should spend money. As far as I can gauge the position&mdash; and I am not here to defend the Government; in any case, the Minister is here for that purpose&mdash;our national policy at the moment is to endeavour to live within our means. If that is so, while there may be differences as to the way in which money can be spent, we can be united about it.  As I think I said on the Second Reading of the Bill, we ought to be in the same position as I and others had to face in business.  We would like to do many things, but we have to look at our resources.  We have to take a certain element of risk, but we have to be careful that when that risk is past we shall be able to get back to living within our income. There should be, and I think there can be, a very considerable amount of national unity on that question. I should like to see a tacit agreement between the more responsible leaders on that question.  Criticism we may have, and healthy criticism is a good thing in democracy; but there should be a measure of agreement that, in telling the people you cannot do all the things they want, the Government will be supported by all sections in this House and in the Dáil.  I think that is necessary, <Col N="208" /> because any alternative Government would be in exactly the same position.  I repeat that you cannot do all the things you would like to have done; but that does not prevent me from advocating certain measures which, within our resources, I think might be adopted with advantage.</P>
    <P>I do not like the attitude which seems to look upon social services as a virtue.  They are, in my opinion, only a regrettable necessity, a necessity because financial conditions do not permit of our undertaking other measures.  They are not something which should be permanently continued or something about which we should speak with pride.  If we could get to the stage, which most of us would like to see, in which there would be no necessity for old age pensions, because people would be able to save sufficient during early life to provide for their old age, a thing they cannot do at present, that would be the ideal state. In present conditions you must have social services, and no sane person proposes to abolish them, but the aim should be to get rid of them or, at any rate, to get rid of as many of them as you can, by providing sufficient production in the country to give a decent livelihood to everyone.  That, I admit, is rather vague talk, and it does not seem possible that we can reach that desirable state in my lifetime, but it is the aim of one side just as much as the other.  I, personally, believe you cannot reach it simply by printing money.  That is being tried elsewhere, and I do not believe that anybody who believes in that method will ever be convinced that it will not work until it is proved unworkable.  However, if that method is to be tried, let some Party come along with that specifically as its programme.  Let it be put to the people and let the people decide upon it.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to take up the time of the House for a prolonged period, but on an important question such as this I venture to submit some observations, particularly in view of the criticisms that have been put forward from the other side, and particularly in view of the fact that on this occasion some <Col N="209" /> Senators have referred to Senators on this side of the House as &ldquo;those people on the right.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a lot of criticism from these Senators, not alone on this Bill but on almost every Bill that has come before the House. Senators on the other side seem to have a whole stock-in-trade of arguments about tariffs, and we hear frequent references to squandermania and wild-cat schemes.  I feel, honestly speaking, that they should be ashamed of persisting in the use of these remarks, because they have been using the same terms for quite a long number of years.  They used them in 1934, in 1935, in 1936, 1937 and 1938, and they are still using them in 1939.  They will, I presume, continue using them until the next general election and until the country gives the same decision as it gave in 1937 and 1938.  It is a mystery to me that some of these people who seemingly sympathise so much with the taxpayers at the present time, cannot submit something to the people, or something to this House or the other House, to justify their statements.  We can all criticise.  It is much easier to criticise than to offer something of a constructive nature. We have heard much to-day about the price paid for the Constitution.  I think we might go further back than the enactment of the Constitution.  As far as I am concerned, I will go back to the old Sinn Féin policy.  The first occasion on which I got an explanation of it was in a statement by the late Arthur Griffith in 1908 or 1907, when he outlined the policy of Sinn Féin at that time.  The policy which the Sinn Féin organisation pursued then is the policy which Fianna Fáil is pursuing at the present time, and it is the policy, I think, which is best and will be best for the people of this country. It is the policy of which the people of this country approved when they got an opportunity of expressing their opinion, without threats of any description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter to which I want <Col N="210" /> to draw particular attention.  Some Senators on the other side, who never tire of talking about the economic war, should stop and ask themselves: Who was the cause of the economic war? They should put themselves in the position of the people in any other civilised country, who had an ideal of nationality, and who found the Government of their country up in arms against the most powerful Empire in the world.  Is there any Party in any civilised country in the world who would at that time have supported the enemies of their own country, who would have encouraged them, and pointed out that such and such a thing should be done?  Is there any Party in any other country who would have pointed out to the enemy of that country that if they taxed the country's products and put so much per head on their cattle they would soon bring them to their senses?  It is shameful. If they had a spark of decency, or if they had a drop of Irish blood in their veins, they would be ashamed to talk about the economic war, when they brought it on and carried it on.  It was brought to a fairly successful conclusion in spite of them.  That is all I have to say on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think those who have participated in this debate will agree as readily as those who have listened to it, as I have done during the last two or three hours, that it has not been a very satisfactory one.  It seemed to be a sort of free-for-all, in which every range of the Government's activity and the Government's inactivity was passed under review.  There are, however, one or two statements with which I desire to deal before you, Sir, put the Motion to the House.  The first point is quite a simple one.  A question was raised by Senator Hawkins as to what were the Minister's powers should the Prices Commission find that the present <Col N="211" /> price of cigarettes and tobacco is unduly high.  He wanted to know what powers the Minister had to compel the tobacco manufacturers to code to someone&mdash;he did not say to whom&mdash; the undue profits which they had earned.  Unfortunately, as far as I know, there are no powers in the Control of Prices Act, under which the commission operates, which would enable the Minister to recover&mdash; whether for the public or for the State &mdash;the undue profits which any manufacturer might have secured for himself by reason of the high prices which he had charged.</P>
      <P>I should, however, like to point out to Senators, who may be under some misunderstanding with regard to this matter, that the comparisons which are generally made between the rate of tax on tobacco in Great Britain and the rate of tax on that commodity here are based largely upon a misunderstanding of the real position.  I understand that the nominal rate of tax on tobacco in Great Britain is 11/6 in the lb., but they have a very extensive range of preferences in Great Britain which reduces to about 10/10 what may be described as the average rate of duty paid on the commodity there.  Here, the position is that our rate is about 10/6, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also happens that on the last occasion upon which the tax on tobacco was increased the tobacco manufacturers, particularly the manufacturers of cigarettes, did not make any corresponding increase in the price to the public.  Perhaps they were able to recoup themselves in some other way.  In any event, I think the nominal rate to the public was not increased.  It happens that on this occasion they have made such an increase.  It should not be forgotten either that a certain amount of the criticism which has been levelled against tobacco manufacturers, because they have increased the price of cigarettes to the public, is not entirely disinterested.  It might happen that some of the larger firms would have been able to shoulder the burden of this tax for some time without passing it on to the public.  They would do <Col N="212" /> that perhaps in the hope that they might crush out some of the smaller manufacturers, and then, when they had the market and the public at their mercy, no doubt they would have taken steps to recompense themselves for their former generosity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On other occasions I think it was passed on by reducing the size or the density of the cigarette. I am only dealing in terms of nominal price.  Two other statements were made here, one of which was quite a surprise to me, and that is the statement made by Senator MacDermot that the dispute with Great Britain regarding the land annuities could have been settled for a payment of £10,000,000 in 1932.  I do not know of any justification for that statement. I was engaged in the negotiations which took place in October, 1932, and I think I can say, as the Taoiseach has said on other occasions when this matter was under discussion, that the furthest we were able to get on that occasion was that, provided we were prepared to accept the point of view of the British Government in regard to the Oath of Allegiance&mdash;the Oath of Allegiance at that time was in our Constitution&mdash;they might consider some mitigation of the Agreements of 1923 and 1926.  That was the utmost concession which, in my opinion, would have been made at that time to our point of view on that matter. I certainly am not aware of any fact which would justify Senator MacDermot in making the statement which he has made here to-day.  He may have more knowledge on this matter than I have, but I am giving the House, for what it may be worth, such information as I have in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other statement to which I want to refer is the statement by Senator <Col N="213" /> Fitzgerald that the Treaty ports were offered to him when he was Minister for Defence; that he could have had them for the asking, but he would not take them.  A statement in similar terms was made in the Dáil during the course of the discussion, I think, on the Agreement with Great Britain.  It was then pointed out that, although the records had been carefully searched, there was no record of such an offer being made, and that as far as could be seen from the records the position would seem to be that, although the British Government might have been prepared to entrust us with the custody of the ports, it was on the understanding that the ports would be at their disposal in time of war or strained relations, and that all the other provisos relating to facilities for defence which occur in certain Articles of the Treaty were to subsist and were to become operative should the British Government at any time so desire.  The position now is quite different.</P>
    <P>The ports were handed over to us unconditionally and, of course, since we have full sovereignty over the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties, there now rests upon us the natural obligation of defending that territory and seeing, not merely that we ourselves will not be attacked in it, but that it will not be used as a base of attack on, or as a potential menace to any other Power.  Accordingly, for what it may be worth, since we have to that extent secured the complete acceptance of the claims which we have been making to be a free country and a free people, we have also to accept with that what I may describe as the natural obligation of free men; we have got to put ourselves in a position to defend this country from attack.</P>
    <P>It might be said that such criticisms as have been directed against the Government on account of their defence policy in the course of this debate have been based upon the assumption that we are not likely to be attacked.  It would be very consoling if we had such an assurance in that regard that we could refrain from spending any money upon defence, <Col N="214" /> that we could arrive at the logical conclusion and disband the Army and return to the taxpayers such money as we may be taking from them in order to maintain that Army.  But unfortunately, that is not exactly the position. Senator Baxter says, of course, that our best defence policy would be to go on and increase our production of food; I think Senator Cummins took the same point of view.  But what are we going to produce the food for? When the dispute with Great Britain was in its initial stages I remember we had a very careful survey made of our agricultural production, particularly so far as our live-stock industry was concerned, and it was found, I think, that we were exporting about 800,000 head of cattle per annum.</P>
    <P>As a result of that examination, it was pointed out that, even if we were to give every man, woman and child in this country, I think, about 8 ounces of meat additional per day, we could not consume more than one-fourth of our exportable surplus.  So, quite obviously, if we are going to produce more food in this country, we are not going to produce it for the purpose of consuming it here, but for the purpose of exporting it abroad and getting in return for it such commodities as we ourselves do not produce and of which we are in need.  To whom are we going to export it?  I presume that in time of war we could only export it to our nearest customer.  We have no navy to keep the seas.  Therefore, we could not undertake the risk, and I should like to listen to Deputy Baxter's speech in the Seanad if we announced here that we were going to entrust the produce of Irish farmers to some sort of freighter which is going to try to deliver it in Hamburg or some of the Baltic ports, without a navy to defend it.  Therefore, it comes to this, that in time of war we have only practically one customer, and that for that customer our food supply is likely to be a very vital element.</P>
    <P>I remember reading some articles which appeared in an authoritative publication here about 18 months or two years ago, in which an analysis of the position which arose during the <Col N="215" /> latter stages of the last world war was made, and there it was pointed out that during one period of the submarine campaign, if only the Irish food supplies could be cut off from Great Britain for an appreciable period of time, it looked as if Great Britain was going to be reduced simply by the process of starvation.  Accordingly, we may take it that this question of our food supplies to Great Britain will become one of vital necessity to Great Britain in time of war, and to those who are at war with Great Britain, and will be so recognised.  Accordingly, the time may come when, notwithstanding what Senator Fitzgerald has said here, they may say to themselves: &ldquo;It would pay us much better to try to attack Dublin rather than attack London, because we know that London is in a state of perfect defence.&rdquo; The British have immense resources; they are able to provide all the equipment and all the man-power, and it does not impose an undue strain upon their economic system to try to defend London or any of their chief centres.</P>
    <P>When a body of raiders set off they may have one definite objective in mind, but they are also opportunists, and if they find that they cannot get through to London they are not going to turn back for want of looking for a target.  They may go on to Liverpool: naturally they will try to hit the target nearest to their point of departure; but if these and other cities are so heavily defended that they cannot be attacked, they are going to go on until they get some objective, and our cities as objectives might, as I have tried to point out to Senators, in certain circumstances be just as important to them as the City of London.  Are we going, then, in face of that possibility, to do nothing to defend this country?</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald said, of course, that the Government have to be prudent in regard to matters of expenditure, and that the Government should take risks.  But it is not the Government that is going to be at risk in a matter of this sort, nor is it going to <Col N="216" /> be Senators like Senator Baxter and some of the others who spoke in regard to our defensive policy and of our position here.  They might be up in Cavan or down in Kerry or over in Galway.  It is this densely populated area of Dublin and other densely populated areas like Cork, Waterford and Wexford&mdash;all our eastern sea-ports&mdash;which are going to take the risk.  I do not think that those people would feel very safe and very secure if they were relying simply upon the scepticism of Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Baxter in order to safeguard them against attack in the event of a great war.  While we might like to be able to take up the position that Senator Baxter and Senator Fitzgerald have taken up in this House, nevertheless we have to think of our people and we have to go to them and say to them, &ldquo;It is an unpleasant thing to have to do, but we feel that, in these circumstances, with your lives and your interests depending upon it, with all your productive machinery at stake, with all your economic organisation at stake, we must ask you to tax yourselves, and when we feel that the limits of your taxable capacity in this regard during this one year have been exhausted, we have to ask you to give us authority to borrow money in your name, bearing in mind every circumstance and every factor, our resources, the risks of attack, and all these other things, to put the Government in the best possible position they can be in to defend you against the risks of attack, for whatever they may be worth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no person in Ireland at this day who is going to exaggerate the risks of attack, but certainly no person is justified in going to the people and saying that there is no risk of attack and in telling the people that the money that is now being spent upon defence is money that is wasted.  I hope and pray it may never be used, but we have got to take these precautions.  We have to have this machine ready in case we might be called upon to use it.  I do not think there is anything more I need say on this Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to know if anything has been done in connection with insurance against war risks.  It is most important that property should be adequately insured against war risks because it is beyond the capacity of owners to deal with it.  I do not think any country has ever asked them to do so.  It is always done by some form of State scheme.  I am, as a rule, opposed to State action but in a time of war I think it is inevitable.  For that reason I would be very glad to see all the resources of the State mobilised for that purpose in a time of war.  Has the Government considered any means of dealing with marine insurance, which is probably the most important, and also the insurance of property against air or other forms of attack?</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the attitude of the Electricity Supply Board towards the farming community.

It is very important that farmers should get quick delivery of parts to replace machinery that has been broken.  The machine for which the part was required was made in England.

      <P>I should like, in the course of my remarks, to consider on this Bill, especially with reference to the general credit of the nation, both the public credit and the private credit of individual citizens, and I hope you will extend to me whatever indulgence may be necessary, in seeing that I may relate my remarks to these aspects of the financial policy of the Bill.  In doing so I shall have occasion to criticise the general financial policy associated with the Minister for Finance and his Government, but I should like to emphasise that, in my remarks, I shall endeavour not to make what might be called a partisan speech, but to be concerned only with the objective aspects of truth.  I will approach the matter from an academic rather than from a Party political point of view.  The Minister cut his milk teeth as Minister for Finance some years ago, and, as far as I am concerned, I hope he will continue to be Minister for Finance until he cuts his wisdom teeth.  I would even like to believe that he is at present engaged in cutting his wisdom teeth, and that we, and the State as a whole, will profit by the result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has had the advantage of a classical education, but he will probably recognise the comparison when I say that the situation in which he and his Government now find themselves reminds me of the tragedy of Dido as recounted in the Fourth Book of the Æneid.  You remember how Dido gave her affections to a false and treacherous idol and, in the end, through her disappointment, inflicted a fatal wound upon herself.  We are told that as she lay bleeding to death, with her eyes she sought the light and groaned, and gave a groan when it had been found. I can see the Minister seeking the light and groaning in every line of his utterance when he thinks he sees, or because he cannot see, the light.  At <Col N="220" /> all events, that disposition to groan is, to me, a sign of grace on the part of the Minister, and I would like to facilitate not only his groans but his vision.  He treated the other House the other day to a most admirable speech in which he probably ran the gamut of all the well-tried and proved financial orthodoxies which have ever been believed in.  But I am not content that the Minister should approach the problem of the public finances with a set of stale financial orthodoxies when the whole subject-matter of those finances has been bedevilled by the fact that the Minister's policy, the Government policy, in the last six years has been built on a series of stale economic heresies.</P>

      <P>Yes, so long as you do not make a long speech on the subject.  I was just considering at what point I should interrupt Senator Johnston.  I did feel he was making a Finance Bill speech on the Appropriation Bill, a speech which should have been made on the previous Bill.

It seemed to me that other Senators were sufficiently eloquent with reference to the Finance Bill, and I thought I would be in order if I kept my remarks for the Appropriation Bill, especially as my remarks concern, not specifically the Appropriation Bill or the Finance Bill, but the whole of the national finances which are embraced or expressed by both the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill, I believe one is quite in order in discussing the general financial policy of the State, and such important questions as the public credit in so far as it may be affected by the Government's financial policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour to observe the ruling of the Chair.  I have no desire to depart from the rules of order.  If you think at any stage of the proceedings that I am becoming irrelevant, I trust you will not hesitate to pull me up.  I should like to avoid anything that could be regarded as irrelevant.  I was going to say that the Minister is opposed, and rightly, to the policy or financial procedure generally known as monetary inflation.  On that policy I have little to add to the words of wisdom used by the Minister in the other House, but I would like to say that the essence of monetary inflation is the increase of money and money incomes which has the effect of distorting prices and distorting the price and income structure. The essence of monetary inflation is not merely the fact that it causes a general increase of prices, but that increase of prices is not equal throughout all ranges of income and prices.  It is unequal and it imposes a burden on some sections of the community while, in fact, conferring benefits on other sections of the community.  I do not know whether I would be in order in summarising briefly some of the major evils associated with monetary inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Leas-Chathaoirleach Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>If so, I will proceed to other matters, only regretting that I did not get up and make this speech on the Finance Bill, where apparently it would have been quite in order.  Inflation&mdash;I am not going to talk about inflation, but this is leading up to the next point&mdash;has sometimes been referred to as the use of national credit.  The Taoiseach rightly stated the other day that the use of national credit means nothing unless it means <Col N="223" /> the use of the taxing power of the State.  That is perfectly true.  Now, my contention is that we have had already too much use of the national credit, in the sense of too much use of the taxing power of the State, in order to pervert and distort the national economy.  Monetary inflation distorts the price and income structure, but, in fact, we, by the policy pursued over the last seven years, have distorted the price and income structure of the national economy, and produced evils of exactly the same character as would have been produced if we had resorted, seven or eight years ago, to a policy of monetary inflation, and it is because it is impossible to cure evils of that character by applying a remedy that would only intensify the disease that I applaud the fact that the Minister is not disposed to use the method of monetary inflation.  At the same time, however, I would welcome some evidence that the Minister is disposed to reverse the economic and other policies which, in fact, have created this economic distortion, analogous to the kind of distortion that would have been created by a definitely inflationary monetary policy. Now, I come to the effect of a £32,500,000 Budget on public and private credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to show you, Sir, in a minute or two, that I am concerned just as much with the effect of the expenditure of that money as with the collection of it, and this Bill relates to the expenditure of £32,500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Leas-Chathaoirleach Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Under this Bill Senators are entitled to debate Government policy in relation to expenditure on the different Government Departments, and that has nothing to do, to my mind, with inflation, public credit, or questions that arise normally and properly on the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, the fact that this Bill appropriates a certain amount of money, which is being paid for my valuable services as a Senator, undoubtedly has improved my personal credit and improved the personal credit of every other member of this House.  Based on that simple fact, I want to draw certain conclusions which are of the utmost public importance. The effect of the expenditure of the public money is to increase the credit of the producers of the services which are going to be paid for by that money, compulsorily abstracted from the taxpayers.  That, I think, is as clear as noon-day.  We happen to occupy a privileged position.  We have a guaranteed market for our Senatorial services and a fixed price, and our credit, therefore, is of the highest possible description; but I ask you, if the £32,500,000 of the taxpayers' money is abstracted for the payment of services such as ours, what about the money that is left in their pockets, and what about the producers of the services which they would like to buy with the money that is left in their pockets&mdash;if they could afford to buy them&mdash;and what about the credit of these unprivileged producers of services catering for such money as we leave in the pockets of the taxpayers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the credit of one section of the community&mdash;the producers of the services paid for by the Budget&mdash;is enhanced, my point is that the credit of other sections of the community may be, in fact, damnified, injured and lessened by reason of the policy of which this Bill is an expression. Whether that is so or not will depend on other causes, such as the relationship between the national income as a whole and the public revenue as a whole, and, as I have showed on a previous occasion, that <Col N="225" /> relationship is one in which an increasing proportion of the incomes of individuals is abstracted for the purpose of paying for public services.</P>
    <P>Further, we have used the national credit, in the sense of the taxing power of the State, in order to put certain sections of our producers, other than civil servants and Senators, in a privileged position&mdash;producers, for example, of flour for the home market, or of zip-fasteners, or Christmas crackers.  We have put them in a position to levy what I regard as private taxation on the rest of the consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope, Sir, that what I have to say will be accepted as being within the terms of this Bill, and that if I am to be interrupted by Senator O'Donovan it will be for some reason other than that I am not in order.  Of course, I may be interrupted by the Senator.  Now, Sir, the Government policy, by the Appropriation Bill, makes provision for the payment of a considerable sum of money to people in this country for the purpose of teaching the Irish language in an endeavour to restore it as the spoken language of the nation.  Now, whatever certain members of this House may think with regard either to my competence to speak on the Irish language or my bona fides, I will say this by way of preface: that I have given a fair amount of service to the work of trying to create conditions here where we would be at liberty to have the language of our country taught, and where we would have liberty to see our children, anyhow, given the chance which was not given to some of <Col N="226" /> us.  Whether Senator McGinley and others believe it or not, I, in my time, have spent many weary hours trying to organise branches of the Gaelic League.  I have gone to Irish classes, collected money, and done quite a number of other, in my opinion, quite estimable things in difficult times, in an endeavour to awaken the spirit which we wanted to re-create in the country, and in an endeavour to have the then attitude towards the language changed.</P>
      <P>Anyhow, through the sacrifices of quite a number of people living, and of others who are dead, the nation to-day has the opportunity and the liberty to restore the Irish language as the living language in this country, but I myself feel, after a number of years, that the policy of the Government is not succeeding.  At any rate, if the success achieved is to be measured by the number of people in the country, and the young people particularly, who are showing an active interest in the language movement and who are using the language, then the Government policy in this country on the problem of the language has not been a success.</P>
      <P>What I feel about it is this: I believe now that the whole policy in regard to the Irish language has been commercialised to a degree far beyond what is wise.  What you discover is that a great many people in this country to-day, or at least a very considerable number of people in this country to-day, who made really no effort whatever, and who took no part at all in the struggle to regain the country's independence or liberty, but who, with an eye to the future, came along and made a study of the language and became efficient in its use, to-day can get a much higher place in the country than those who worked and slaved and suffered and who were ready to lay down their lives so that the country would have liberty to live its own life in its own way and to restore its language to its proper place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people, or quite a number of them who are now occupying posts in this country, are getting money for their services, but their only concern. <Col N="227" /> in my judgment, in the matter of the restoration of the language, is the extent to which they are getting cash for the services which they give. Hence it is that, outside of their work, there is no effort whatever being made by these people to make the language the living language and the force which it ought to be.  Of course, you can commercialise anything.  You can commercialise pig feeding, and you can have hundreds of people rushing in to make what they can out of pig feeding on a commercial scale, but once there ceases to be a profit in the job, they get out of it.  So it is with a great many people in this country to-day.</P>
    <P>They are prepared, and they are encouraged and facilitated by Government policy, to commercialise their knowledge of the language and put on a purely commercial basis the restoration of the language which is fast becoming an impossibility.  There are a few things to be remembered about this.  A limited number of people seem to think that our language can only be restored by the people who spoke it in the cradle, who were born in the Gaeltacht.  My view is that the intolerance, narrow-mindedness and bigotry of quite a number of these people is doing the language movement in this country irreparable harm.  The presence of a number of them enunciating Government policy with regard to the language is in many ways proving disastrous.  It would be wrong, of course, to suggest that they are representative of the native Irish speaker. They are not.  Some of the native Irish speakers, who are doing most constructive work for the language, are doing silent work.  They are writers, cultured men and women whom people in the Gaeltacht will be glad to imitate. But there are others who are not of that kind who are ready to come along claiming themselves to be the highest type of mortal in this country, the Celt whom all should follow, that they are high-minded, highly-civilised, skilled in crafts, attracted by the arts, having made their contributions to them, and so on.  The truth about it is that the language of this country will be restored throughout the length and breadth of the land, not by the native <Col N="228" /> speakers, but by the non-native speakers.  The most active spirits in the language movement to-day are men and women who were born in that part of the country where the language is not spoken but who spent their few pennies in learning it in days when it was not half as popular as it is to-day and when there was very little cash to be got out of their efforts.  Young teachers who did not know a word of their native speech, went off to learn it and spent, out of their small salaries, money that they could not afford.</P>
    <P>Those are the people who are working hardest, yet silently, to restore the language.  But, it cannot be restored by the efforts of these people alone, nor by the few native speakers who are working very hard to raise the general level of the language in the cultural and literary sense.  It can only be restored by the active co-operation of the people who showed spirit with regard to the language movement in days when there were risks in it.  It is very difficult to show that spirit to-day in face of this other spirit that is so obviously abroad in the land.</P>
    <P>If some of the people who wish to pose as the saviours of the language are really in earnest about it, the best thing they can do, in my opinion, is to make up their minds that the language can only be saved by coalescing all the forces in this country that stood at one time for its restoration, people like the Cathaoirleach, myself, and others who are here, who are not able to discourse fluently in the language of the Gael, in the first place because we did not hear it in our youth, and, in the second place, because during most of our life even 30 hours in the day would not suffice to enable us to do the work that was to be done.  Are we to be turned aside from the purpose which we had 20 years ago?  If we and those other sincere, silent, workers, who are doing their best for the restoration of the Irish language, are to be driven away by the few critics and intolerant creatures from this cause that is so dear to all, then there is no question whatever that none of the people, even the children of our generation, are <Col N="229" /> going to see any improvement in the position of the language from that which it occupies to-day.  There are numbers of other people who are prepared to say the same thing as I am saying, who have given service in the language movement.  It may surprise some of the Senators when I say that when my youngest little girl went to school at the age of 4½ years she had not a word of English.</P>

      <P>I will answer the Senator. I hope the Senator will try to learn the rules of debate so that his further education will not be necessary. We are discussing to-day money spent on the supply services, education and all the rest.  We are paying teachers in universities, secondary schools, primary schools, and so on. I am discussing whether or not the policy of the Government with regard to the restoration of the Irish language is going to succeed.  I am pointing out some of the obstacles and difficulties. If Senator O'Donovan cannot see, there are none so blind as those who will not see.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very serious about this.  I am one of the people who always believed, and still believe, that the restoration of the Irish language to its place in our life was vital if we were to express ourselves really as a nation.  I believe that we are not meeting with success in that effort.  I would be very anxious to hear what the Minister himself has to say.  Perhaps he may take it upon himself to reply in Irish.  Perhaps he had a better opportunity of learning it than I had, but if he would not regard that as fair either to himself or to the House he will probably be able to say, also, that 30 hours a day would not suffice to enable him to do all the work he has got to do and at the same time make himself proficient in the use of <Col N="230" /> the language.  What I want to urge is that there is no use beating about the bush.  We are either serious about the restoration of the Irish language or we are not.  If we all mean it when we say that we want to restore the language, then there would be no injury to the cause of the language if we were to look into the present position. I see none who are satisfied with it.  I talked to teachers, professors in colleges, parents; I know what their view is.  I know what my own feelings in the matter are.  Nobody can say that the teachers are not striving hard.  Nobody will ever know what this effort must have cost the teachers in this country.  It is because, like others of us, they gave their allegiance to the cause when they were very young that they are unwilling to-day to decry their own efforts and the cause for which they stood.</P>
      <P>That does not take away from us here the responsibility of asking the Minister for Finance to convey to the members of his Cabinet our view that the situation with regard to the language movement in the country is being seriously impaired by much that is being said and by the happenings; that if the language is to be restored we cannot accept the narrow, intolerant and fanatical point of view which has been and is being expressed, which is driving people away from the language, but that what we require now is an inquiry into the whole position to discover whether we are on the right lines or not.  I believe that there is need for a change and that we ought to be courageous enough to examine in what way this change can be brought about.  There will be plenty of evidence made available to the Minister if he will undertake it, and he will have plenty of good wishes in his endeavour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a reference or two to our broadcasting service.  I did so on a previous occasion here.  As I understand the position, it is this: that while the Minister collects about £80,000 a year from what we may call broadcasting taxes, and spends about £60,000, he actually appropriates a certain amount of the money so raised and utilises it for other purposes.  On <Col N="231" /> a previous occasion I asked here: What evidence had we of a cultural advance in this country in the last 17 years? For myself, I think there is great need for giving a shaking up to this broadcasting system of ours.  We have only one broadcasting station.  The Minister receives a certain amount of money each year from the people who have sets and out of other taxes which are paid on the importation of reception instruments, and if he thinks that he is justified in appropriating a considerable amount of that money, and in using it for other purposes, I cannot see how he is going to have developed here the sort of service which the country is entitled to have.</P>
    <P>One might criticise the broadcasting service from a number of points.  For instance, the service broadcast from our station on Sundays is certainly very unlike the Sunday service broadcast from the stations of some of the neighbouring countries.  Again I understand that the fees paid to people whose services are availed of by our broadcasting authorities are altogether inadequate.  They are certainly not calculated to encourage talent, or to get the right kind of talent.  I have heard of cases in which the fees paid would not cover the costs incurred by those who gave their services at the station.  In that situation, surely the Minister himself must agree that, so far as this service is concerned, the cultural life of the country will never get a chance to express itself or to develop.  The service is never going to develop.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the farming talks that are given infrequently by Radio Athlone appeal to other farmer-Senators. In my opinion, they are, with few exceptions, rather behind the times.  What has struck me in particular about them is this: that they are always given at an hour when the farmer, if he is any good at all, ought to be out in the fields.  Senators may laugh, but if they consult the timetable they will find that that is so. Those farming talks are given at an hour when, if you want to listen to them, you must come in from milking the cows, cutting the meadow, or <Col N="232" /> getting up the hay.  There are quite a number of other criticisms that I could offer with regard to this service, but I hope that what I have said will have the effect of shaking up those responsible. In my opinion, if the Minister wants to give the station a chance he ought to spend whatever money he receives so that we may be enabled to build up a reputation for this station and induce more people to listen in.  If he wants to provide talks for farmers, then I would say to him that he should encourage those in charge not to be looking on our farmers with the usual Dublin eyes. The farmers of this country are generally not to be found in their drawing-rooms or their sitting-rooms on a Sunday evening in summertime at 7 o'clock which, for them, means half-past five.</P>

      <P>It strikes me that this Bill calls for more intimate discussion than for eloquence.  I should be glad if the Minister, when replying, would give me the information which I am about to seek from him.  I see that Senator O'Donovan is not here; but fearing he would be, I was careful to mark off each item so as to make sure that it was referred to in the Bill, and that I was in order in referring to it.  Vote 39 deals with the salaries and expenses of the Public Record Office, the Keeper of State Papers, Dublin, the purchase of historical documents, etc.  On this Vote I would like to have some information from the Minister regarding what was known as the office of the Ulster King at Arms.  I believe that, while he is not an employee of this Government, he is accommodated with premises by this Government.  I should be glad to know whether the Government, in view of his rumoured departure from this country, are taking any steps to secure that the records attached to that office will remain here and do not leave the country.  Under Vote 58, a sum of £37,500 is provided for transport and meteorlogical services.  There is in another part of the Bill a sum of £39,000 for the same thing.  Perhaps the Minister might care to explain to the House whether these sums are entirely for weather reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> Provision is being made in the Bill for the Revenue Commissioners, and for what are called other services connected with the Revenue Commissioners. Under that heading I would be curious to know what is the exact position of a customs official, and what are the exact rights of a citizen when he is in the presence of a customs officer.  On a couple of occasions I have myself seen this kind of thing take place: a dutiable article has been declared to a customs officer at the port of entry and is assessed for duty.  For the sake of argument we will say that the duty to be paid is something under £1.  A pound note has been tendered to the customs officer.  He has refused to accept it and to give change.  If an ordinary trader or shopkeeper took similar action he would render himself liable to prosecution for refusing legal tender. Surely citizens should have similar rights when it comes to dealing with customs officials, and are entitled to be treated fairly.  If they offer legal tender in payment, they are surely entitled to be treated courteously and to be given change.</P>
    <P>As regards the rest of the Bill, I do not intend to say anything.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with the expenditure proposed, the Estimates are there, and the money when voted is going to be spent.  There is only one other thing that I notice lacking in the Bill.  It is this: that there does not appear to be any provision made in it for the Prime Minister's visit to a foreign country which, I understand, he intends to make in September.  I should be glad if the Minister would inform the House whether the Prime Minister intends to go to the World Fair at New York at his own expense, or at the expense of the citizens.</P>

Ní shaoilim go bhfuil mórán bainte idir ceist na Gaedhilge agus ceist an airgid ach tharla gur labhair an Seanadóir Baicstéir ar an gceist seo agus ba mhaith liom é a fhreagairt.  I dtaobh chuid den méid adubhairt sé tá mé ar aon intinn leis.  Is iad na daoine, adeir <Col N="234" /> an Seanadóir, nach raibh an Ghaedhilg acu féin a thóg an Ghaedhilg ón staid in a raibh sí agus a chuir áird uirthi.</P>

B'fhéidir nach bhfuil ach níor mhol sé aon tslí dúinn chun é chur ar aghaidh níos fearr.  Maidir le caitheamh airgid, níl mórán airgid á chaitheamh ar an Ghaedhilg ar chor ar bith.  Ní féidir a rá go bhfuil costas na scoileanna á chaitheamh ar an Ghaedhilg.  Dá mba rud é nach raibh aon Ghaedhilg ann bheadh an costas sin orainn.</P>
      <P>Tá Seanadóirí uaisle léigheannta annso agus caitheadh a lán airgid ar a gcuid oidechais agus ní raibh siad ag foghluim na Gaedhilge.  Dá mbeadh an scéal againn mar a bhí faoi réim na Sasana, bheadh an t-airgead seo á chaitheamh ar na scoileanna.</P>
      <P>Is mar an gcéadna leis an seirbhís phuiblí.  Caithfí an t-airgead sin da mba rud é nach raibh an Ghaedhilg i gceist ar chor ar bith.</P>

      <P>Ní dóich liom gur fíor é sin.  Tá meas againn ar na daoine atá ag cuidiú le foghluim na Gaedhilge ach má tá an Ghaedhilg riachtanach le haghaidh post áirithe ní féidir an post sin do thabhairt do dhune nach bhfuil an Ghaedhilg aige.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis na Gaedhilgeoirí ón Ghaeltacht, taobh amuich de scéim an £2, níor caitheadh mórán airgid orra agus tá na daoine seo a dhíth orainn. Mara bhfuil an dearcadh ceart ag muintear na Gaeltachta, tá an Gaedhilg acu agus ní féidir linn iad sin agus a gcuid Gaedhilge do chailleadh.</P>

      <P>In connection with Vote 55&mdash;the payment of forestry workers&mdash;I understand that our forestry workers are paid half-a-day if they go to work on a wet morning when no work can be done, except when, in some cases, alternative work is provided. These are very few cases, and I think sometimes there is a claim that favouritism may be shown to give the work to a few people.  I think that it ought to be possible to have a scheme&mdash;even if it gave a little extra trouble&mdash;by which forestry workers would be paid by the hour.  It is surely a bad principle that people may be paid for doing nothing.</P>
      <P>I quite see that the arrangement exists so that they will get more or less a weekly wage.  The amount they are due to receive on a full week is, I understand, 30/-, which is about 3/- more than the agricultural labourer's wage.  That would be fair, owing to the lost time they have to make up in some way.  It is just the principle of paying people for doing nothing that I think is wrong.  It ought to be possible to make arrangements by which people would be paid by the hour.  I would be very sorry if, through raising this question, advantage was taken, either by the Department involved or by some other Department that may be involved, to reduce the amount a man would receive.  It ought to be the other way.</P>

      <P>The fact that in this Bill we are providing for the salaries of all the Ministers entitles us <Col N="236" /> to, at any rate, considerable scope as to the subjects that we may raise, and I propose briefly to throw at the Minister's head a mixed bag of questions and suggestions.</P>

      <P>May I just on that point say that it has been the custom where the Appropriation Bill is under discussion for any Senator to communicate with me in advance and let me know the points which he intended to raise, so that I may be in a position to deal with them.  Senator MacDermot has done that in relation to some matters, but I think it could not be expected that I should be in a position to deal with every item of the Government Estimates in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand that the Minister could not deal with anything unusual.  I do not think, however, that he will find any of the points which I am now raising unreasonable. I want to ask, in relation to the money we are voting for the Department of Local Government's housing grants, whether the Minister can tell us if anything is going to be done to reduce the cost of building houses, and whether he can hold out any hopes in that regard, and, in conjunction with that, I want to ask whether he can hold out any hopes of the Government doing anything, or pursuing any policy that is likely to accomplish anything, towards lowering the cost of living in general in this country.  In a newspaper to-day I see an article by an eminent journalist, who has recently paid a visit to London, in which the following remarks occur:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I saw a London housewife's budget, compiled at my request, which indicated that nearly everything eatable is from 25 to 50 per cent. less in London than in Dublin. I saw new houses in residential areas priced at from £650 to £850.  Houses as good in similar areas in Dublin could not be purchased at less than from £1,000 to £1,200.  I saw, in fact, as a result of my observations, that the cost of living in Dublin is unconscionably high.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those devastating remarks might be supposed to have been taken from the <Col N="237" /><i>Irish Times</i> or the <i>Independent</i>, but, in fact, they are taken from the <i>Irish Press</i>, and I feel that however the Minister might be disposed to disregard any mournful observations I might make on these particular topics, he can hardly disregard them when they are from his own Party's newspaper. I hope he will have something a little consoling and encouraging to tell us about the Government's plans for the future in regard to reducing the cost of building houses and the cost of living for Irish citizens.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to ask another question, of which again, I must admit, I have not given any notice, but it is not anything very deep or recondite.  It is a question about the manner in which the film censorship is carried on.  We are voting money here, as I understand, for the keeping up of the office of film censor, so I suppose we are entitled to reflect upon the principles upon which that Department is carried on.  I was astonished to read quite recently that a film, which I have seen, called &ldquo;The Confessions of a Nazi Spy.,&rdquo; which has had enormous success in America and in England, has been banned here on the ground that it is calculated to promote racial hatred. As to that, I would say, in the first place, that there were other films which have been shown here which could be at least equally ruled out on that ground.  There was a film quite lately&mdash;perhaps it is still running, although I am not sure&mdash;on the Spanish civil war which certainly tended to promote hatred of Russia, just as much as &ldquo;The Confessions of <Col N="238" /> a Nazi Spy&rdquo; tendes to promote hatred of Germany.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Senator seen it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I said I had seen it.  There have been various films from time to time about episodes in the past of this country which would tend to promote hatred of England. I am not talking about that being the object of the film, but I am saying that that would be the natural effect of some of them.  Why is this exception made in the case of Germany?  I regard &ldquo;The Confessions of a Nazi Spy&rdquo; as a most excellent and objective film which, in fact, does not tend to stir up racial hatred at all.  It makes a number of Germans very sympathetic persons who are sacrificed by Nazism. It does, I admit, give a picture of Nazism which is horrifying, but I believe the picture to be an absolutely true one, and there is scarcely a detail in the film that is not a mere reproduction of what has actually occurred in America and in Germany, in connection with Nazi spying in America.</P>
      <P>I personally can see absolutely no reason why that film should not have been shown, especially, as other films have been shown that other countries would have as much right to be offended about as Germany would have to be offended about this film.  I think the film is one that tends to promote love of justice, love of liberty and a sense of the dignity of man, and indignation against any system that tends to infringe these things.  As such, I think it would do the public good, and not harm, and, aside from any question of good or harm, it is a film with great entertainment value. A most exciting and interesting few hours for anyone to spend would be at that particular film.</P>

      <P>The one topic which I did give the Minister notice I was going to advert to is the topic of the preparations of this country for meeting the difficulties that will arise in the case of a European war.  I do not intend to go back on what has been already said to-day, and a few days ago, on the subject of defence policy, but I want to know what is being done in the way of industrial preparation?  We all know that if war breaks out, imports of certain commodities that are vital to us will necessarily be much restricted.  There will not be shipping available to bring them here in sufficient quantities.  Have any stocks of commodities that are of great importance to us been laid in so as to meet the position in the event of a European war?  I would be very much obliged if the Minister could see his way to give us some information on these matters.  I think, too, that Ministers should do more than they have yet done to educate public opinion generally about both the material and spiritual issues that will be involved in the case of a European war.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance himself and the Minister for Industry and Commerce are both of them exceptions to the otherwise rather deep silence of the Ministry on this subject.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce a couple of months ago did warn the country of the fact that there would be severe economic and industrial difficulties if war broke out.  But his very excellent speech on the subject did not go into any detail, and it has not had anything like the attention from the country that it deserves.  The Minister for Finance in his Budget speech spoke of the tremendous difficulties, from the Budgetary point of view, that would be involved consequent on a European war.  There, again, I think, hardly enough attention has been paid to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as the other House of the Oireachtas has gone into recess, and as this House of the Oireachtas is about to follow, I hope Ministers will be free to do much more than they have hitherto done in the way of educating the country so that people will <Col N="240" /> understand what they will have to face if war breaks out.  I think they might do something to set before the country as objectively as they can, besides the material difficulties that will arise, the spiritual and moral dangers that will be encountered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I sincerely hope that the few remarks I have to make will be in order.  They are of a sufficiently general nature not to raise any particular difficulties for the Minister in replying, if he cares to do so.  In any case, I rather deprecate this extreme specialisation amongst Ministers.  I do not see why when we have a Cabinet with a small number of Ministers that each one of them should not be prepared to get up and answer questions about the general policy of the Cabinet &mdash;at least about matters of general public interest.  The first subject on which I would like to speak is the subject of education.  I made some remarks here a few months ago about this whole question of reviving the Irish language and the means that have been pursued in that effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I want to do to-day is to emphasise these remarks once more, and to say that I still believe&mdash;I have seen no reason at all to change my opinion &mdash;that the policy that has been pursued steadily and ruthlessly by the Minister for Education of enforcing the practice of teaching through the medium of Irish in the schools is going a long way towards killing the restoration of the Irish language.  I do not see why the Minister for Finance himself should not have an opinion on <Col N="241" /> that matter.  After all, he is a parent like many others of us.  Senator Baxter spoke about that already.  The Minister for Finance has children who are almost native speakers of the language. They have gone through this mill with regard to Irish like everybody else's children.  This is a matter that is not only the concern of Ministers and officials.  It is of vital concern to parents throughout the country. There seems to be an extraordinary fog that is rather difficult to dispel over this whole subject.  There is a tendency here to misrepresentation which is so very widespread that it is very hard to counteract it.  I have always spoken on this subject as one who is most anxious to see the Irish language restored to use in the country. No one can be more anxious in that direction than I am.  But I constantly find myself treated as an enemy of the language if I find I have to criticise certain steps taken in the matter.  I do believe that great damage is being done to the language by this effort of compelling teachers who do not know the language well enough to teach children who do not know Irish certain subjects through the medium of Irish.  Immense harm is being done to general culture and also to the effort of reviving the Irish language itself.  It is because I feel that way about this question that I do not like to let an opportunity pass without referring to it.  I wish I could induce all who are interested in Irish to voice their views on this question.  It is the kernel of the whole subject.  If the Department of Education could be induced to abandon their short-sighted effort&mdash; this policy that has been put across the Department without anybody knowing what was happening&mdash;the gain to the Irish language would be an immense one.</P>

      <P>Is mó bealach atá ann chun iochall do chur ar na daoine.  The Minister for Education has often proclaimed that no compulsion is put on the schools to force them to adopt this method of teaching subjects through the medium of the Irish language.  But everyone who has anything at all to do with the schools, and everyone who meets the teachers up and down the country knows that compulsion is being put on the schools, despite what the Minister says.  This compulsion is not always compulsion carried out by means of a platoon of Civic Guards.  There are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with butter.  The compulsion in this case is rather analogous to choking a cat with butter because it takes the form of holding out an inducement to schools, offering them sums of money which they require badly and then telling them that they will not get these moneys if they do not teach subjects through the medium of the Irish language.  It is only yesterday that somebody told me that in an interview with the head of a Dublin school he was told that that school had been compelled in one way or another by the Department of Education to undertake teaching Greek through the medium of Irish.  Every parent protested in vain to the head of that school and several of the parents in question were people who were enthusiastic about trying to revive Irish and who regarded this effort to teach Greek through Irish as a destructive method.  It is a terrible pity that this question, which is really dealing with educational methods, and not a question of principle, will not be allowed to be examined by educational experts, by people who can go into the question as to how you can do good of any kind by teaching children subjects in a language they cannot understand.  What are the limits to which we can go? What are the particular types of schools in which you can hope to do good by providing this kind of teaching? I would not deny that there are cases in which good may be done by teaching subjects through the medium of Irish.  There again there is danger of misunderstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> These cases are very special cases, I hold.  What is happening is that the ordinary children of ordinary parents find themselves very often in the position where they cannot even be taught Irish properly because there is so much attention being paid and so much concentration being devoted to this effort which I regard as entirely irrelevant and practically useless.  I know myself &mdash;it is my own experience&mdash;that you can either send your child to a school where he or she will be taught through the medium of Irish or you send the child to the school where he or she will be taught a little Irish just on the same basis as every other subject, but to find a school where the Irish language will be thoroughly well taught in its own time and where a sufficient amount of time will be given to it is a very different matter.  I think that would be the experience of everybody who has children going to school.  You can get schools where the general education of the child will be ruined by the attempt of people who do not know the subject they are teaching to teach them that subject through Irish.</P>
    <P>I hope I shall not be accused of libelling the teachers.  Everybody knows that we have started in a country a long way in arrears.  We have a great deal of leeway to make up in the matter of capacity for teaching ordinary subjects in secondary schools. That is not our fault or the fault of the teachers.  It is the fault of the circumstances in which we find ourselves. It was true, and unfortunately it is true to-day&mdash;it was true in 1922 and it is still true&mdash;that our schools in general are practically a generation behind ordinary schools in educated continental countries.  That is not our fault.  We cannot blame our teachers or our parents for that.  It is just a fact that happens to be there and the first thing that we should have done, when we took over the direction of our national education, was to raise the level of our general educational power in the secondary schools and see to it that our teachers were thoroughly trained in the subjects they undertook to teach.</P>
    <P>Instead of that, we introduced this wildly enthusiastic scheme for immediately <Col N="244" /> teaching everything through the medium of Irish.  We put ourselves at once in an inferior position, for example, to the Six Counties where teachers in secondary schools are compelled to have an honours degree in the subjects which they purport to teach. We have no rules like that in our schools.  Still we expect our teachers to teach ordinary subjects successfully and we expect them to teach them through a language which neither they nor the pupils know really well.  It seems to me that by that means we shall make no progress at all in our secondary education.  The question of primary education is I think different. It is possible to do a certain amount in the primary schools with regard to teaching through the medium of Irish, but in the secondary schools instead of going forward we are going back.</P>

      <P>The question of a university is an entirely different matter.  I know I shall be accused of being supercilious, but I think that before you can lay down the law about university education, you surely ought to have some experience of university education.  What I mean is that the university is a place which exists for teaching what it teaches to the highest possible standard attainable.  That is its job.  It is for imparting a knowledge of particular subjects to the highest attainable standard.  Anyone who presumes to criticise a university or to lay down the law about it should know something about how that particular work is done, what it involves, and what it requiries.  I know I shall be accused of being supercilious.  One of the dangers is that we are a democratic country and that the vast majority of our people were never inside the door of a university and do not know what universities are for.  At the same time, universities are absolutely essential to anything like a civilised life in this country.  Owing to the fact that we are living under democratic control, there is a constant danger that somebody will come along and start tearing our universities to pieces, such as they are. I do not claim that they are perfect, <Col N="245" /> but at any rate, they are very peculiar, very specialised institutions.</P>

      <P>All universities are &ldquo;Gallda.&rdquo; One of their objects is to keep students in touch with the knowledge, the culture and science of the world and they have to be &ldquo;Gallda&rdquo; in doing that.  It is quite easy for us to abolish university education in this country if we want to fall into a state of savagery but there can be nothing more dangerous than for a democracy to start interfering with that kind of highly specialised and highly technical work.  It is just the same as if the passengers of a ship decided not merely to run the ship but to remake the engines in the course of the voyage.  It is hard to put it and it sounds somewhat offensive but it is the truth and there is no way of getting away from it.  One of the troubles in a country such as this is the number of people who go butting into education generally without being particularly educated themselves, and without knowing very much of what they are talking about.  These things have to be said if we are going to preserve both democracy and education in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel one of the reasons why this state of affairs goes on so steadily in the Department of Education is that we have applied to education in this country, unfortunately, a most extraordinary form of bureaucracy, a form of control that, I think, our experience should lead us to decide is highly unsuited for educational purposes. I have often regretted that in 1922, in our eagerness to approximate our institutions to British institutions, even something beyond British institutions, the institutions of the French Revolution, we decided it was a bad thing to have boards of primary education and boards of intermediate education, that it would be better to abolish all these boards and that a set of anonymous civil servants should be substituted in control for these boards. I would suggest to the Minister and to the Government that if they could <Col N="246" /> see their way to appoint some sort of an advisory board for education in general, a board of people who are educated themselves, and who have some sort of educational standing in the country and outside of it, to advise the Minister on questions especially like educational policy, they would be taking a great step in advance.</P>
    <P>We have seen in recent months an effort on the part of the Department of Education to revise the Intermediate programme.  They set about doing it in the most extraordinary way, a way that to my mind would be almost incredible if I had not seen it being done.  The Secretary of the Department of Education writes to a number of different people and asks for their opinions about changes in particular programmes like Latin, Greek, French and so on.  He gets answers from half a dozen people in each case; long answers, memoranda by those people to whom he writes, and somebody in the Department gets a scissors, cuts all the memoranda and pastes them together again in some other way that suits himself.  The people who were written to in the first place because they knew something about it are practically never consulted again.  The thing is done in that extraordinarily hole-and-corner fashion because bereaucracy can only work in a bureaucratic way, and because you have not a board of men with a public standing and a public reputation there to look after those questions of curricula and methods of teaching, which are really, to a large extent, matters of policy.  You have nobody like that there to do that work, and the result is that you can only carry on the work of the Department by that kind of extraordinary, in-and-out, cat-and-mouse method between the bureaucracy and certain members of the public, who are not known to anybody because they are written to privately.</P>
    <P>To my mind it would be well worth considering whether it would not pay the Government and pay the country to establish some sort of sound advisory board.  I am not talking now about putting Anglicised people, or anybody of that kind, on such a board. <Col N="247" /> I am talking about a board of educated people with high qualifications in the Irish language&mdash;as high qualifications and as many qualifications as you please, so long as it is recognised that they are men of a real educational standard and capable of giving the sort of advice that is wanted.  I emphasise this matter because I do think that our education is almost the most important thing in the country, and that it is worth spending a little while on, even if it is not completely relevant to a Bill like this.  We are apt to devote so much of our time to matters of taxation and finance and currency, and questions of that kind, that we are rapidly coming to think that our whole lives are concerned with finance and taxation and currency. We forget that what makes a country great, after all; what makes a period in the history of a country memorable; what produces great men in the long run in a country, is not the taxation or currency or finance of the country, but the cultural and educational institutions the country has.  There is nothing more important to which to devote our attention.</P>

      <P>I am in entire agreement with the Senator&mdash;probably more so than any other Senator in the House&mdash;on that question, only it would take a long time to go into it, the question of national culture and the necessity for us in this country to have a national culture springing from our own roots and expressed in our own language.  I think nobody could be more devoted to that ideal than I am, but that is a matter which has to be approached in a regular, trained, scientific fashion.  What I am afraid of is that we are going into this whole question of education at present in a sort of hand-to-mouth way.  We have trusted far too much to this anonymous departmental bureaucracy, and, from what I can hear about it, the internal organisation of the Department of Education&mdash;especially in regard <Col N="248" /> to the secondary branch&mdash;leaves a very great deal to be desired.  We go on casually and calmly, leaving, perhaps, the most important interests in the country in the hands of a small body of civil servants.  I do not believe there are ten Senators here who could tell me who are the civil servants who are in charge of the Department of Secondary Education at the present moment, what work they do, or what are their qualifications.  Yet, they are the people, who, to a very large extent, have the whole future of Ireland in their hands.</P>
      <P>There are one or two other things which I wanted to speak about in connection with education, but they are of less importance, perhaps.  I notice that the Vocational Education Vote has now grown so much that it is almost as large as the Vote for Secondary Education, and that is a subject on which I could hold forth at great length.  I hope that the movement which is in being, I know, to make vocational education a really cultural type of education, and to divorce it from the merely materialistic sort of machine training that vocational education only too often means, will meet with the support of the Ministry and of the Department of Education as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few other small points to which I should like to refer&mdash;at least they are small, perhaps, in comparison with education, but they have their own importance.  Perhaps the least of them is the Vote for the Stationery Office, the question of the bureau for the publication of Irish books, and for the production of Government publications generally.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he has ever considered, or whether he will now consider, the advisability of trying to find some ordinary expert in the book trade to whom to hand over that office. It takes a long time to find it out, but apparently it is true that civil servants are a body of people with constitutions and mentalities of their own, and it seems that one of the things they cannot do is to run an ordinary shop, because that bookshop for the sale of Irish books is one of the most peculiar <Col N="249" /> and remarkable institutions in the City of Dublin.  In the case of any ordinary bookshop you are encouraged to go in and look about and poke into every corner; at least I have never been discouraged from doing it in any bookshop, except one run by a very peculiar person.  Normally, you are invited in and allowed to spend as long as you like in the shop, look at anything you like, and make up your own mind.  But, when you go into the Civil Service bookshop, if you do not know on the nail the name of the book you want to buy, out you go.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>References were made to the broadcasting service and to the cinema.  I am not going to follow Senator MacDermot into his ideological criticism of the film censor.  I should like to raise a question which is perhaps larger and more formidable, but still I think it ought to be raised.  It is the question whether any Department of the Government has ever thought over this problem of the cinema in Ireland, what we are going to do about it, or whether we are ever going to do anything about it.  Is it part of the great new world about which Senator Goulding spoke?  Is it part of the revolution in our national mentality that we are going to go on allowing foreign cinema shows to be produced at practically every crossroads in Ireland until we are all turned into victims of Hollywood <Col N="250" /> or Wardour Street?  Is there any hope at all that, as a people, we can make a stand against the influence of the foreign cinema?  It is not the moral quality of any particular films that I am objecting to.  I am not purporting to criticise the film censor, who does his work, within the limits of his powers, remarkably well.  I am referring to the whole question as to how long we can have any sort of independent minds at all, as a people, if we allow the cinema to spread amongst us and to become such an obsession with so many of us as it has become?  I am speaking now as a person very much addicted to the cinema myself. It has seemed to me for years back that, if we go on with our present system of relying on the cinema to such an extent for public entertainment, and allowing the cinema to spread all over the country, no matter how good a film censor we have we shall inevitably become more and more Americanised&mdash; more likely Americanised than Anglicised. We shall change our whole nature under the influence of the cinema.</P>
    <P>Surely it is the sort of question about which something should be done.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should go into the question as to whether he could not take all the cinema proprietors in Ireland at the present moment, and compel them, by legislation even, to form one single Irish film company, which would be allowed to carry on for the time being as the present cinemas are allowed to carry on, but which would have as part of its functions in the future the production of native Irish films.</P>
    <P>We should consider whether the matter is not so important&mdash;I believe it is vitally important&mdash;that some revolutionary method of that kind will have to be adopted.  If we do not take some steps of that sort, we can have no hope at all with regard to the revival of the Irish language, for instance, or even with regard to the idea of trying to keep any spark of native character alive amongst us.  We must do something about the cinema.</P>
    <P>The question of the radio is a more difficult one still.  There again, we are subject, and I am afraid almost inevitably <Col N="251" /> subject, to all kinds of terrible foreign influences.  I am not speaking as a person suffering from xenophobia, or hating foreign countries, but I would regard it, and I think we all would, as a terrible loss that through the instrumentality of forces like these our character as a people, such as it is, should be altered, or that we should be reduced to the same dead level as the populations of countries like England and America.  That is what is happening to us steadily between the wireless and the cinema.  I believe it would be easier to deal with the cinema.  But, even in the case of wireless, surely something could be done. Surely it is not necessary for us, for example, to intensify that process that is going on by having these sponsored programmes every night at the end of our own wireless programme.  For an hour every night&mdash;one of the best hours, I believe, from the listening point of view&mdash;we have a programme put on which is up to the highest standard of any English or American music-hall programme.</P>

      <P>Very popular&mdash; that is the trouble.  Probably, if you had not them, the listeners would turn to one of those other programmes, like Radio Normandie or Radio Lyons, or some other place, where they can get jazz and crooning and swing music. Even though that is so, I do not see why it should be necessary for our broadcasting system to provide that sort of thing deliberately, even though we do make money out of it.  Indeed, I am inclined to regard it in its own way as rather a national disgrace that we do make money out of the sponsored programmes and use the money on the whole for such very poor ends, because I agree with Senator Baxter that, on the whole, our wireless system, although it has great merits in many ways, does not shine in comparison with the wireless programmes of other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we could do a great deal more to improve the standard.  I think, in regard to the wireless above all things, that there is one axiom we <Col N="252" /> should always keep before our minds: that for us, in our situation, only the very best pays.  It is not worth while in Ireland to have a wireless station at all if we do not make it our object to produce always the very best which can be produced.  It is the only way in which we can compete with foreign stations.</P>
    <P>I believe, as Senator Baxter stated, that the great agency which prevents us from getting the very best is probably the fact that our standard of payment for artistes in this country, as compared with the standard that is applied in Belfast, for instance, or in England, is a joke.  I suppose you get paid seven, eight, or ten times as much, even for an ordinary quarter-hour talk on the wireless in London, as you get here, and the rates that apply in London apply also, of course, beyond the Border, in Belfast, with the result that the people in the Six Counties get far better value, I believe, on the whole from the wireless than we do.  It is a difficult subject to speak very much about and, of course, I do not want at all to be taken as criticising the efforts of the present Director of Broadcasting, because I think he does his very best under the most difficult circumstances and against difficulties which, to a large extent, have been made for him by the Department of Finance; because the Department of Finance insists, I understand, on holding by far the greater proportion of the revenue made out of broadcasting.</P>

I think, therefore, that the speech of Senator Tierney is extremely useful, because the question of education in this country, as in other countries, is fundamental.  He said that what makes the quality of a period is its culture. I think it is the people who make the quality of a period, and that the people are the most valuable national assets we have&mdash;a fact that does not seem to have impressed itself on some of the economists whose voices are heard most frequently in this House.  For that reason I would like to confine my remarks to the Votes dealing with employment and unemployment schemes.  The worst strain on our essential riches is caused by the steady deterioration of an enormous number of our young people through unemployment.  Bound up with unemployment, and partly responsible for it, is a defective and out-of-date system of education which, with its almost total neglect of manual and practical training, and its ignoring of the requirements of life in this country, tends to produce a large number of unemployed, because they are unfortunately deprived of the training which would make them employable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overstepping all the evils that menace us at the present time, and to which this debate has drawn attention, is the threat of war, with its unfortunate repercussions on the Budget&mdash;in a costly defence programme, an added shilling on income tax, and the condition of agriculture, about which Senators have been consistently lugubrious&mdash;is the deplorable extent of unemployment, with its demon brood of human misery, of sickness of soul and body, and of mental, physical and moral deterioration of the race.  It is so heart-breaking, and the remedy is so hard to find, that we all have a tendency to try the Nelson touch on it, to apply the blind eye to the telescope focussed on <Col N="256" /> it, and if the evil thing hits us even in that blind eye, to take refuge in a formula, and say that we are no worse off than other countries, that every other democratic country has its unemployment problem.  I think that is a defeatist attitude.  If we yield to it, and if democracy perishes in this country, as it has done in others, it will be largely due to our surrender to it.  I have no remedy for it.  If I had, it would not be a problem at all. If a cure could be found as easily as a conjuror seems to take a rabbit from a hat, unemployment would hardly be a problem at all or, at least, would not have grown to such tragic proportions.</P>
    <P>But one thing we can do, and must do, we must face up to it.  We must realise that if this nation is to be saved from its disastrous consequences, we must all come together and work hard to try to find a solution.  The Government cannot do it alone.  Nor can the Oireachtas.  It is a matter for Church and State to come together on, to try to find a remedy and, in seeking that remedy, they must have the loyal help of every element of the community, trade unions, employers' federations, vocational and charitable organisations. All must be mobilised in an attempt to devise some way of dealing with what is in effect a national emergency.  The Government and the Oireachtas must give the lead.  The people of this country are being steadily divided on new and more sinister class lines, and while the conditions of those on one side of the line&mdash;those who are happy enough to have work to do&mdash;are being consistently and quite properly improved by our social legislation, the workless are drifting into ever deeper misery, into &ldquo;the legions of the lost men.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the most impressive speeches I ever listened to in this House was made by Senator Campbell, in speaking of the impact of unemployment on the lives of the people.  He told us something of what he had learned as a workers' representative in the Court of Referees and as a visiting justice in Mountjoy Prison.  I wish his speech <Col N="257" /> could have been broadcast to the nation.  I was particularly struck by what the Senator said, when recalling his official visits to Mountjoy, &ldquo;of the terrible ravages unemployment has wrought on people, particularly young people who have never been in industry.&rdquo; He had in mind, he told us, young fellows who had never done a day's work, and, as far as one can see, will never do a day's work.  Work is a human need, as well as a condition of human progress and preservation. Their tremendous power and will to work were, after their Faith, the very best things our Irish people salved from centuries of oppression.  But their enormous will to work, this grand ennobling pride in work, this competence in work, and this habit of work, which enabled our forefathers to hold on like grim death to their own land, by eking out a livelihood on the mountain-sides to which they had been banished is, under our own eyes, being lost.  How can young fellows who never have been given a chance to work, or to fill their empty aimless lives with the satisfaction that comes from work well done, keep alive the will to work or even the faculty to work?</P>
    <P>I hope the Seanad will impress on the Government the extreme urgency of this question, the tragic problem of unemployment, and urge them to face what is, in effect, a state of national emergency, and to rally the nation's best thinkers preparatory to mobilising all the nation's forces against it.  I suggest that if war is averted Senators, whose means permit them to go abroad, could do very useful work by making a study of what other countries have done to deal with unemployment. I have in mind a nation like Holland.  What made me think of Holland was a recent broadcast which told of the vast land reclamation schemes on which Holland had put her unemployed.  An aspect which made a great impression on me concerned the thousands of fruitful acres that have been added to the surface of Holland.  Hardly any machinery was used.  The most perfect machine in the world, that which we are allowing to <Col N="258" /> rot for want of use&mdash;the human body&mdash; is given its full value in the Dutch schemes.  We have much to learn from that example.  If Senators went abroad and studied what is being done in other democratic countries to deal with unemployment, they might bring back lessons that would be of very great advantage here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been considerable discussion on this Bill.  I could take every item in the Schedule and criticise it, because I think in every Department there is waste of money.  I think a great deal of the money we are spending is definitely harmful, and that a great deal of money that is being spent, and that could be spent to advantage, is leaving us in a worse position.  The fact that we have to support so many unemployed out of the production of the working people is driving more people out of employment.  Strictly speaking, what we ought to criticise the Minister for is the total amount we are called to provide in the Appropriation Bill. I think the Minister should protest against the imposition of such a cost on the people.</P>
      <P>The truth is that each Minister comes with his own proposals.  Each one of these proposals might be excellent, but the total effect of them would be disastrous for this country.  That is not the position, however, because a great deal of the expenditure incurred by the various Departments is not only wasteful, but definitely harmful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this debate I find there is a constant idea of more butting-in by the Government.  What I want is less of that.  Senator McGinley seems to want the Government to take a person by the scruff of the neck and say to him: &ldquo;You will have to be nationally cultured and nothing else.&rdquo; I have some sympathy with the Senator, but only to a certain extent.  On the other hand, Senator MacDermot wants a big propaganda campaign for the purpose of enlightening public opinion. He wants to give us nice films showing something of the horrors in Germany and not giving us any films that might be Spanish pro-Nationalist in char- <Col N="259" /> acter.  In every country the cost of government tends constantly to go up. When you are appealing to the public for support you have to say: &ldquo;Vote for us and we will do this, that and the other thing.&rdquo; I would like to see a Party here prepared to say: &ldquo;Vote for us and we are not going to do anything.&rdquo; The bulk of the harm in the modern world comes from the fact that the Government undertakes to do everybody's job.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDermot refers to housing.  A couple of years ago there was a housing strike here, and after that the cost of building went up by 25 per cent.  Even before the strike took place here the cost of building was higher than in England, and was enormously higher than in Italy.  In that industry there were employers and workers trying to make money. They had a row and how did they settle it?  They said: &ldquo;We will make up our losses and recoup ourselves out of the unfortunate consuming public.&rdquo; They were able to do that because it is assumed in this country that it is the Government's job to build the houses and rent them to people at uneconomic rents.  The taxpayers here are paying 25 per cent. more towards building than they were paying before the strike.  Neither the employers nor the workers are going to lose.  The persons who will lose are the unfortunate taxpayers.  You cannot say, &ldquo;You are going to produce houses at a reasonable price or we will not buy your goods.&rdquo; The position is that you have the houses being built at an increased cost and being occupied.  What I object to is this Government butting in, trying to run people's lives for them.  What is the result of it all?  The result is a constant increase in expenditure.</P>
    <P>The question of education has been referred to.  What comes out?  Senator McGinley wants national culture rammed down the necks of the people, whether they want it or not.  Senator Tierney followed from the question of education to the problem of the cinemas. We all agree that the people here are greater cinema-goers than the people in England.  For the last 15 or <Col N="260" /> 17 years we have had a national educational policy and it is the ambition of the present Minister for Education to see that the new generation has a spoken knowledge of Irish.  I do not think that is an educational policy.  If you went to the most backward parts of Albania you will probably find that the people of Albania have a spoken knowledge of Albanian.  I think the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; should only apply when you get beyond that.  We have had 17 years of a definite educational policy here and at the end of that time we have Senator Tierney asking that drastic machinery be used to prevent people visiting the cinemas they want to visit.  Perhaps there should be a cartel of cinemas and that cartel, running a sort of monopoly, should be forced to produce a certain number of Irish movies?</P>
    <P>What is the experience with regard to Irish movies?  We all know it, if we only have the courage to face up to it.  Our experience is that when you produce a national cultural film here, nobody goes to it.  You can, if you like, form your cartel and insist that money is thrown away on producing the films that Senator Tierney or Senator MacDermot believes would have a cultural or an ideological effect on the people, but you will find that the people will not go to see those films.  The point is that you spend money trying to make the people nationally culture-conscious and, to a greater extent now than before you commenced your programme, the people are going to the ordinary Hollywood movies.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal to spend more money on wireless in this country, for the purpose, I suppose, of spreading culture.  I do not agree with that.  I think that even if you double the emoluments you give to the wireless performers, or talkers, you are just going to have the same people giving the same stuff.  If you try to give the people something on the lines of the marvellous educational programme promoted by the bureaucrats in the Education Department, some fine, elevating, high-brow programmes, you will find that they switch the wireless <Col N="261" /> to some outside station.  The fact is that you cannot force people to be otherwise than they want to be.  All you can do is to endeavour to create a certain condition which will make it easier for those things that are good to appeal to the people in this country, and have a slight deterrent effect on those things that are evil.  The Government should not think that it is a wise course to ram things down people's throats in the style of &ldquo;You will have to be cultured and be damned to you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All this comes back to the fact that the members of this Government have been going around the country saying, &ldquo;Vote for us and the baby will not get measles; vote for us and you will have everything you dream of; vote for us and you will have much more money&rdquo;.  What does it all come to? In the end the country produces less. The real producers, the farmers, are producing less and are getting less for their labour.  The cost of government goes up enormously and, so far as culture is concerned, the movies are making bigger profits than ever.</P>
    <P>Let me get to the point.  So far as the Minister for Finance is concerned, I do not expect him to argue every detail of every Vote.  This is what he should do.  Let him go to the Cabinet and say: &ldquo;The amount of money this country can afford for your performances during the next year is £x and I do not care tuppence how you spend it or divide it.  I am not going to be put in the position of a poor, innocent lamb, sent to the Seanad to stand over a lot of things I know I should not stand over.&rdquo; Think of the effect on the poor man's soul! He has to come here and to be completely dishonest when he is pretending to defend these things.</P>
    <P>There are many people who come along and say: &ldquo;Why do not the Government do this or that?&rdquo; The Government should try to create a condition here where a man who works will know that he will get the value of his work, where every man will be able to work and get value for the work he does, and where a man who does not work is not to get anything.  They should try to create the position where <Col N="262" /> the people who work will, out of charity for their fellow-countrymen, see that they get the means of living, and where the Government, in the cultural sphere, will try, by the most gentle and imperceptible ways, to make it easier for the desirable features to get a footing in the country and put a slight hindrance in the way of the things that we think disastrous.</P>
    <P>One Senator went on to talk of the Government indulging in a system of propaganda.  We have a sort of propaganda issuing from the President's Department and from the President's speeches&mdash;to my mind, an undignified thing.  There is a sort of international propaganda going on.  We have people lecturing in England about Partition. I think the less you say about Partition the better.  If you think you are doing good by going to England or to America and spreading propaganda about things, you are not going to do anything of the sort.  Every propagandist does harm.  You have a case in point in Germany, where propaganda has been carried on extensively. Has it had any useful effect?  Not at all.  The British people are trying to spread propaganda throughout Germany and we are now thinking of going around the world on a propaganda tour.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDermot wants some cultural films produced here.  I want some pro-Nationalist films from Spain. Some other person may want something else.  I do not think the Government have any right to ram Senator MacDermot's ideas and the results of his judgment&mdash;which I think is a very poor judgement&mdash;down other people's throats.  He wants to have the Government use machinery to ram his opinions down my neck and my children's necks.  My children would not stand for it.  On the other hand, I do not see why Senator MacDermot's children should have the Government machine operating in such a way as to make them think that I am right and that their father is wrong.</P>
    <P>Let us go to the point.  The less money that is spent by the Government in this country, the better for <Col N="263" /> the country.  You can judge the benefit of the Government's policy by the small amount it spends, and every extra £1,000,000 that it spends means that it is only doing more harm in the country, culturally, economically and in every other way.  Therefore, I say that the Minister for Finance should not allow himself to be put into the position of a poor innocent man coming here and, having to stand over certain things that are done, thereby prejudicing his own soul.  I feel very sorry for him when he is forced into that position, and I should like him to have a little more backbone&mdash;or, at least, I should not say that, because I know that the Minister has plenty of backbone, but I should like him to feel that, when he is fighting these Ministers, for Industry and Commerce and so on, who have done an enormous amount of harm in this country, it would be better to vote against the whole Vote for Industry and Commerce because, in weighing up the good that has been done as against the bad, it will be found that the bad will far out-weigh the good, and I think it would be found that the country would gain if the whole Department were done away with.  The same applies to the Land Commission, because the land that was to be divided has been divided already, but still we have the bee in our bonnet that the landless men must be provided with land, and that land must be taken off other people in order to give it to them.  Therefore, let us all come together and say that we are not going to criticise the Government for not doing this or for not doing that, but for spending money and for the harm that they do by the things that are brought about by reason of the money they spend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how to reply to the points that have been raised in this debate.  I should like, however, to correct the wrong impression under which Senator Tierney seemed to be labouring as to what was implied by collective responsibility, when he suggested that he did not like this specialisation among Ministers and <Col N="264" /> that any Minister who came here ought to be prepared, if necessary, to answer for the Department of another Minister. As I can see it, Ministers are definitely compelled, if not by the Constitution, at least by the Ministers and Secretaries Act, to specialise in the different Departments of State which are specially allocated to them, and they are supposed to be prepared to deal with those Departments, or any matter concerned with their respective Departments, at any moment that they may be called upon to do so by the Oireachtas.  We have, of course, the collective responsibility that Ministers have for the general policy of the Government, but I think that that merely means this: that if an individual is asked to serve as a Minister in a Government, and if he agrees to do so, his faith and trust in his colleagues is such that he is prepared to accept public responsibility for their actions, but not necessarily that he is prepared to defend, in detail, that policy, or indeed, to defend in detail the administration of any Government Department. I think that, if we had that clearly appreciated, when a Bill like this came before the Oireachtas, perhaps the discussion upon the Second Reading of the Bill might be more fruitful and valuable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is merely because time is so valuable to the Seanad and the Oireachtas generally, and in order that it should not be wasted, that I have ventured to say these things here this evening.  For instance, we had a number of interesting speeches&mdash;one from Senator Baxter, one from Senator MacGinley, and another from Senator Tierney&mdash;on education.  Well, it is quite obvious that I cannot possibly go into any question of detail in that connection, and yet the whole value of that discussion would be that it should be a detailed discussion and that the application of principles, whether good or bad, should be exemplified here by examples and clear, specific cases of the good or ill that has been done.  In regard to some of the statements that were made by Senator Tierney, the issue might, perhaps, arise at once as to what were the facts in the case, and I <Col N="265" /> certainly could not deal with those. All I can undertake here is that I shall bring to the notice of the Minister for Education the speeches that have been made to-day in the Seanad on that matter, and that I shall certainly do.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the points which were raised by those Senators who were good enough to send me notice of their intention to raise the points, perhaps I should say something before I sit down.</P>
    <P>On the question of war risk insurance, although I understand that it does not come properly within the ambit of this debate because there is no provision for such a service in the Appropriation Bill, I should say that the matter has been engaging the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I understand that the matter of marine risks insurance is also receiving his attention and that he may, perhaps, be able to formulate a scheme in due course.  The other aspect of the matter, which was referred to by Senator Sir John Keane, that of the insurance of private property, is a very much more difficult matter.  I understand that the position in Great Britain, for instance, where the matter would seem to be a much more urgent one, is that they have only gone to the length that, at the end of a war, if such a catastrophe should befall, they promise to consider what can be done in regard to it.  I am afraid that, with our limited resources, and speaking as Minister for Finance, I should not like to see our Government committing itself to a more forward policy than that.</P>
    <P>As to the question raised by Senator Counihan about the delay in the clearance of goods, that may be due to a number of causes.  It may be due to the inexperience, perhaps, of the importer.  If the importer is relying on a clearing agent, the delay may be due to the dilatory methods of the agent and to the particular way in which the agent looks after that particular customer's business with the Revenue officers.  However, if the Senator has any specific cases of delay in mind, I shall be only too grateful if <Col N="266" /> he will give me the particulars and I shall endeavour to see what was the cause of the delay and, if the fault lies with the customs officers, to ensure that unreasonable delays do not take place in future.  I know that at the beginning, when the new tariff policy was being introduced, a great many delays did take place.  That was due to a shortage of staff and, as I have said, to the inexperience of the importers, but I was under the impression that these matters had now very largely adjusted themselves and that clearance through the customs was proceeding normally and as expeditiously as possible in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Senator D. L. Robinson directed my attention to the question of the payment made to forestry labourers, and the practice which prevails in the forestry branch of paying forestry labourers half a day's wages when they turn up for work and are not able to do anything because of the inclement conditions of the weather.  I shall draw the attention of the Minister for Lands to the aspect of the matter which Senator Robinson mentioned, and I presume that the Minister will take notice of it and see whether it is possible to accede to the Senator's point of view.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter again has to listen to a very unfavourable response from the Minister for Finance because Senator Baxter on the previous Bill was blaming the Minister for Finance because he did not try to keep a grip on the expenditure of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator has not said that, he has told us how the country has been groaning beneath the weight of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If so, why ask me to increase the weight of taxation?  It is the case that we get, I think, £70,000 in licence fees from the holders of wireless licences and spend about £90,000 altogether on the service.  We might spend more if it could justifiably be <Col N="267" /> spent.  If it were agreed between the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and myself that better programmes could be given if only more money were provided, it could be spent, but if we did spend that little more we would have to make good that increased spending by increasing taxation.  I do not think that would appeal to the Senator.  It is always possible, as Senator Fitzgerald has pointed out, to spend more money on the Government services, but it is not possible to spend more money and reduce taxation at the same time or, in most cases, to spend more money and refrain from increasing taxation.</P>
      <P>Senator MacDermot wanted to know whether we were taking any steps to reduce housing costs.  In regard to that, I can only point to the fact that a commission has been set up to enquire into every aspect of the housing problem in Dublin and one of the matters to which this commission is directed in the terms of reference is this question of seeing whether the costs cannot be reduced.  What the recommendations of the commission and their experts are going to be I cannot at this moment say.</P>
      <P>With regard to film censorship, I will direct the attention of the Minister for Justice to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall because it is implied that the censor, whether on his own initiative or acting under direction, has exceeded his statutory powers.  If that were the case I take it that any person who was interested in films has a remedy against the censor. The courts are there and the law is there and it is up to them to interpret it.</P>
      <P>Senator Tierney mentioned the Stationery Office and the dilatory and unsatisfactory business-methods of the sales office.  That comes within my Department.  If the Senator will give me particulars of some of the instances of the unbusinesslike reception which customers meet when they go into the sales office, I will be only too glad to see if that cannot be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> I could say a good deal about the cinema and the radio but I do not think that my remarks would be very fruitful or carry conviction to Senator Tierney.  I do know that an interDepartmental Committee has been sitting to examine this question of the cinema to see whether anything could be done to develop an Irish cinema industry or whether, perhaps, some measures might be taken to reduce, if that were possible, what some people regard as the baneful effect of the cinema upon our Irish life.  I take a rather broad and liberal view in these matters and I am not so certain that we are so immune from original sin or that we live in such a state of pristine innocence, that the cinema can do us a great deal of harm. It is difficult to see how we can confine ourselves in this island in a sort of water-tight compartment, shut off from the rest of the world.  Some of our children have to go abroad; some of us go abroad on occasions ourselves and perhaps it is just as well that we should make some acquaintance, even if it is only on the cinema screen, with the sort of glamorous and dangerous temptations to which we may be subjected when we go abroad so that, being forewarned, we may avoid them. I think it would be far worse if we were to go out like young lambs to the slaughter and that this native virtue of ours should leave us an easy prey to the first wolf who might beset our path.</P>
    <P>Again, with regard to the radio, my views, I am afraid, are very much like those of Senator Fitzgerald.  I cannot see how we can compel people to listen just to the sort of programmes we want.  I do not think there is anything very demoralising in listening to swing music or jazz tunes. I do not listen to them usually, but there are people who take a little innocent amusement in doing so, and, if they stay at home by their own fireside with a book and the radio happens to be playing something like &ldquo;You are the Cream in My Coffee&rdquo; I do not think it is going to do them very much harm.  Probably somebody else will come into the house and switch on to another programme and there will be <Col N="269" /> much less domestic harmony than if the person who bought the radio were allowed to listen to the sort of music he liked best.  I should very much object if anybody came in and started twiddling the knob of my radio if I were listening either to a sponsored programme from Athlone or to one of the German stations which, apparently, transmit the sort of music which appeals to Senator Tierney but which might not appeal to nine out of ten Irishmen in this country, who are just as well entitled to their tastes and to have their wishes catered for as Senator Tierney.</P>
    <P>Senator Crosbie raised a question about the position of the Ulster King at Arms.  The Ulster King at Arms is not a charge on the revenue of the State and I do not think the question of his position arises under this Bill. The Senator has raised a point about whether the records of the office would be retained in this country should the office be discontinued.  That is a matter which would be necessarily one for negotiation between the Governments concerned.  I do not know what the position would be in relation to the records.  I think they probably belong to us, and I do not think there would be any question about their being retained in this country if the office were being discontinued.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the amount which is being appropriated in the Bill for the Transport and Meteorological Services, £300 is for payments in respect of certain steamer services connecting the Aran Islands with the mainland; £5,500 is being provided for the personnel of the several airports, and £40,150 is being provided for the subsidisation of air services; the balance of £20,000 odd is being provided for meteorological services.</P>
    <P>Senator Crosbie also asked me what right a customs officer had <i>vis-a-vis</i> a citizen crossing our frontiers and coming into the country.  He has the right, of course, to ask the citizen to declare whether he has or has not any dutiable goods in his possession.  I think if the citizen declared that he had none and that the officer had reason to doubt that declaration he would probably <Col N="270" /> have the right to search the citizen. If the citizen has dutiable goods and makes a declaration to that effect, I do not think that the officer is bound to give change if he has not got it.  It may sometimes happen that he has not got it and, I think, if a sum in excess of the actual duty collectible in respect of the goods which were being imported were tendered to him he would probably as a matter of mere courtesy provide the necessary change, but I think the law is that the amount of duty must be tendered with the goods. So that the customs officer would probably be within his rights&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;if he were not in a position to return the change to the citizen, in refusing to accept a £1 note if that were in excess of the duty payable upon the goods.</P>
    <P>The Senator also asked me to inform the House whether the Taoiseach intends to go to the World Fair in New York at his own expense or at the expense of the citizens.  I think the Senator is under a complete misapprehension as to the purpose for which the Taoiseach is going to the United States of America.  He has been invited to visit America by the President of the Republic of the United States.  He has been invited to go there, not in his personal capacity as an individual, but in his official capacity as head of our Government. A great honour has been done to the Government, I think, by the President of the United States, and it would be most discourteous for the Taoiseach, if he could possibly accept the invitation, to decline it.  If he goes, he goes there in his public capacity, and there is no reason why he should go there at his own expense. I fear that Senator Crosbie must have overlooked the rather unworthy implication which was contained in his question.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDermot asked me to let the House know what steps the Government were taking to deal with any emergency which would be occasioned by the outbreak of a general European war.  I can say in regard to that matter that for over a year a committee of the heads of the Departments concerned has been sitting.  This committee <Col N="271" /> is presided over by the Taoiseach.  The various ways in which such an outbreak would react upon our economic and industrial situation here have been very carefully considered, and such measures as can be concerted in advance have been, at least, outlined and have been determined upon.</P>

      <P>Every attempt has been made to endeavour to build up stocks of petrol, but my information is that the results in regard to that particular commodity have not been so satisfactory as was hoped.  However, we have been endeavouring to induce traders to lay in supplies of what are essential commodities.  Some of them have been able to do that: others have been less willing, or perhaps their capacity to lay up stocks has not been as great.</P>

      <P>Again, that is not the sort of question upon which I could express an opinion that would be worth while, but I am perfectly certain that it is a matter that is engaging the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is not to be assumed that if a war broke out, and that public transport here were dependent upon electricity as a motive power, that there would be any more electricity available for traction purposes than petrol, because the fact of the matter is that there has been an enormous expansion in the demand for electricity for all purposes here within the past two or three years.  It has been going up by leaps and bounds and there is just the same difficulty in getting electrical plant&mdash;motors and all the rest&mdash;as there is likely to be in getting petrol, so that from the point of view of maintaining public transport in the City of Dublin, I think that on <Col N="272" /> the whole&mdash;I am giving my own personal opinion for what it is worth now &mdash;there is very little to choose between the two things.  I think that is all I have to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, some time last autumn the Seanad passed a resolution recommending the Minister for Agriculture to pay a subsidy on the export of fat cattle during certain months of the year.  I do not know what became of the resolution or whether it was ignored.  At all events, nothing was done, and the general <Col N="273" /> belief is that it is the Minister for Finance and his Department that turned down the question of a subsidy on fat cattle.  If there is anything going to be done for the next season's stall feeding, I want to point out to the Minister that it should be done now, in order to give farmers an opportunity to make provision for stall-feeding cattle.  I pointed out last autumn that, unless there was a subsidy paid for stall-feeding cattle, we would not have sufficient fat cattle in the spring and early summer to supply our own requirements.  That fact has been proved since, as during the months which I mentioned&mdash;April and May&mdash;fat cattle have been exported from Belfast and the Six Counties and sold in the Dublin market, because we were not stall feeding sufficient cattle of a certain class to meet our own requirements.</P>
      <P>Those cattle which were sent in to be sold on the Dublin market received a subsidy in the North of Ireland. They were then sent here, which shows that fat cattle are worth more in this country in those months than they are worth in the British markets. Sending cattle from the North of Ireland to Dublin looks like taking coals to Newcastle, but, if the miners in Newcastle were to go on strike, coal could be quite as valuable there as in any other part of the world.</P>
      <P>There are several other matters which I do not want to go into now, but I would like to impress on the Minister, and through him on the Minister for Agriculture that, unless something is done in the way of encouraging the stall-feeding of cattle, it will be too late.  Apart altogether from the question of tillage, which I do not want to discuss with the Minister for Finance, fat cattle will be as scarce in a short time as pigs and bacon, poultry and eggs, which the Minister is spending thousands now to try and increase in production. If something is not done at the present time, the Government will be spending, not thousands, but hundreds of thousands, to try to revive the stall-fed cattle trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which I will ask the <Col N="274" /> Minister and the Government to take into consideration is that we are not filling our quota.  Perhaps in the near future, the British Government may be revising the quota and, on looking into the quota which we have now and finding that we have not been filling it, they may reduce it, and it may be cut down to the amount which we have been exporting during these lean years.  Then the Government and the Minister for Agriculture will be trying to increase the provision.</P>
    <P>These are the only remarks I have to make.  I would ask the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, that, if any decision is being made regarding a subsidy on fat cattle, that decision should be made now at the proper time in order to enable the farmers and stall feeders to make provision for it this winter.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the debate on the cinema, it seemed to occur to nobody that there is an illict censorship on the cinema to-day.  I hope the Minister may be able to give us some assurance that the forces of the State will be used to resist that censorship.  As I am sure he is aware, owing to that illict censorship, we are unable to see the picture of the Royal tour.  Whatever we may feel politically, every citizen has a right to see what he wishes.  As the Minister probably knows, many citizens of this country feel very much and very deeply that deprivation.  It is a deprivation which cuts very deeply into the whole social life of the country and although it may not be made vocal it does affect the satisfaction of a large number of people who are substantial citizens and substantial taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to the point made by Senator Counihan, because I supported his motion about the subsidy on fat cattle. It was passed by the Seanad, but I certainly am not impressed by the argument he has used now.  Very little cattle came over the Border for sale in the Dublin market and I think that the Senator will agree that the number of such cattle was negligible as people were not inclined to take the risk with <Col N="275" /> a consignment of cattle.  I have known of cattle sold in the Dublin market being taken to Cork, and those cattle practically came all the way up from the County Cork.  It affects the whole argument about bad prices for fat cattle to say they can be imported into the Dublin market from the North of Ireland where the subsidy is paid.</P>

      <P>It is a bad argument to try to impress the Minister that he should give a subsidy on our own fat cattle.  I favoured that subsidy when it was to try to produce a finished product here that could not be improved upon, so that we would produce and finish them and use our own materials and foodstuffs.  I am still in favour of the subsidy, but I think the Senator made a bad argument by saying that one could get a better price&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>For any months. If 5/- to 7/- is the bounty, it is a bad argument for the subsidy of our own cattle to say we can give a better price to those from the North after bringing them across the Border. If one tries to argue that our own cattle are scarce, the prices must have improved to such a satisfactory extent that prices here are as good as on the other side.  I favoured the motion for the subsidy on fat cattle at the time and intended it to enable us to produce the finished product.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister to consider one matter.  He will, I am sure, admit that there is very considerable criticism and uneasiness about the different prices&mdash;much higher prices&mdash;of a number of articles produced here to the prices of the same articles bought in the open market.  I feel that the Minister would be wise, in his own interest and in defence of his policy, to give greater publicity to this matter.  I know that the Minister is disposed to challenge these differences, saying either they are trivial or in some cases that they do not exist at <Col N="277" /> all.  In these days of propaganda the Government has to defend its case before the public in other ways than from its place in Parliament.  Would the Minister consider from time to time publishing lists of the leading commodities and showing the differences in price that prevail here compared with the prices of the same articles abroad?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I have ever denied that the prices of some of the commodities made here are higher than those prevailing elsewhere.  I think a great deal of nonsense is spoken from time to time about the level of prices for Irish industrial goods, and some people have tried to convey that all industrial products here are sold at extraordinarily high prices and are yielding abnormal profits to their manufacturers.  That is not true. There are many industrial products, the prices of which here are no higher than, say, in Great Britain, and some of them are sold at lower prices than in Great Britain.  There are, however, many industrial products, the prevailing prices of which here are higher than in Great Britain, due to known causes, such as higher wages, perhaps, better conditions of employment, or the existence of some special circumstance, as in the case of the flour industry, where the millers are required to use a stated percentage of Irish grown wheat purchased by them at a price fixed by the Government, or as in the case of the maize-meal mixture, where a somewhat similar condition of affairs prevails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say that the Prices Commission, which has been very actively engaged in investigating the prices of a number of commodities during the past 12 months, has secured adjustments here and there.  Certain prices have been reduced, and, generally, voluntarily reduced, by the manufacturers concerned, after discussion with the commission, but, on the whole, their investigation has shown that profiteering, as such, does not exist, and those associated with these investigations have said to me that for all the profiteering they have discovered, <Col N="278" /> there is not much reason for their existence.  Of course, as a commission, they have a much wider field of work to cover than the investigation of prices, and possibly their mere existence is having a useful effect upon the general price level.  Certainly, the fact that these investigations are proceeding from time to time keeps before the minds of the manufacturers and traders concerned the existence of an instrument which can be used against them, if the thought of profiteering should enter their minds; but the net result of their investigation shows that there is no such thing as serious profiteering at all.  Wherever they have been able to discover circumstances which appeared to justify interference, and where they did interfere to secure a reduction of price, the reduction was effected voluntarily, and was never of very substantial amount.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, important that the general price level here should not be raised unduly as a result of the development of industries here, and, therefore, I can assure the Senator that the Prices Commission will not cease its activities, or lessen its activities, even though the results of their investigations so far have been as I have stated.  It is my hope that, with the growing efficiency of our industries, and there can be no question about the improvement in their efficiency as workers have become better skilled and managements more familiar with the intricacies and technicalities of their jobs, we will get a general improvement in prices, and in the quality of the products.  Prices, of course, are of no importance, except in relation to quality, but the movement has been all in the right direction, and, only in the past month or two, many important products, manufactured here for the first time in the past two years, were reduced in price voluntarily by the manufacturers thereof.</P>
