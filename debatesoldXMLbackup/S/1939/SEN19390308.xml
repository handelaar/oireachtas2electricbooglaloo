      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>In some areas voluntary hospitals have been established which fulfil the functions of local authority hospitals in dealing with certain classes of patients, such as maternity and infectious disease cases. Several of these hospitals have in recent years been unable to meet the demands on their bed accommodation. They have had to be replaced by new institutions or have had to be substantially enlarged.  These new institutions will serve a wider area and most of the patients will be sent by the local authority of the area covered by the institutions.  The governing body of the hospitals have found it desirable to give representation to the local authorities in the administration of these new institutions.  In such cases <Col N="1023" /> legislation is necessary to authorise the constitution of a joint board containing representatives of the governing body of the existing hospital and the local authority concerned and to vest the requisite power in the new board for the administration of the hospital.  The Cork Fever Hospital Acts, 1935 and 1938 and the Dublin Fever Hospital Act of 1936 have been already passed to implement the agreement entered into with the local authorities by the voluntary associations for the establishment of joint boards to administer the fever hospitals in Cork and Dublin, respectively. There are at least two similar cases which now fall to be dealt with in respect of voluntary and maternity hospitals in Cork and Limerick county boroughs.  The aim of the Bill is to obviate the necessity for passing a separate Act in respect of each such proposal arising in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill empowers the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, at the request of the governing body of a voluntary hospital, to make an order constituting a joint board comprising representatives of the governing body and the local authority or local authorities, as the case may be, and to grant that board the necessary powers for improving the existing hospital, or providing a new hospital and for administering the institution.  The term &ldquo;voluntary hospital&rdquo; includes any institution providing for the prevention and treatment of any disease, injury or deformity in human beings or for giving medical, surgical or dental treatment in such cases or affording asylum to blind, deaf, dumb or mentally defective persons or to expectant mothers, or mothers of children under the age of five years and such children, provided that the governing body of the hospital is not a Department of State, a local authority or a committee of a local authority. The provisions of the Bill can only be put into operation by a voluntary act of the governing body of an institution of that class, who may apply to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health for an Establishment Order in relation to their hospitals. Arrangements are included for due <Col N="1024" /> notice being given to each member of the governing body of the proposal to make application for the Establishment Order and notice of the making of such application must be published in the Press for at least two successive weeks in three newspapers circulating in the area in which the hospital is situated.</P>
    <P>An objection may be lodged by any person with the Minister to the making of an Establishment Order.  If the Minister decides to make an order, he must first submit a draft thereof to the governing body of the voluntary hospital and to the local authority or the local authorities concerned, and he is not empowered to make an order until agreement with these bodies has been reached in regard to its provisions. The Establishment Order when made shall provide for the dissolution of the existing governing body of the voluntary hospital and the establishment of a new board which shall be wholly or partly representative of one or more local authorities and shall be constituted as a body corporate with the usual powers.  The property, debts, duties and liabilities of the existing governing body shall be transferred to the new board and arrangements may be made for the transfer to the board of the officers and servants of the existing institutions with superannuation or compensation rights for loss of office.</P>
    <P>All other necessary powers for the improvement and administration of the existing hospital, or the proposed new institution, may be granted to the board by such order.  An Establishment Order, when made, shall be deposited for public inspection, and notice thereof shall be published.  The order shall also be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and may be annulled by a resolution passed by either House within a specified period. If no such resolution is passed, any person objecting to the order may apply within the prescribed period to the High Court for annulment of the order.  If the Establishment Order has not been annulled, in pursuance of the above-mentioned procedure, the Minister may confirm the order which shall then have the force of law.  Provision is made for the amendment of the order, from time to time, if necessary, but such amendment can only be <Col N="1025" /> effected at the instance of the governing body of the institution concerned.  The same procedure will apply in respect of that amendment as is prescribed in the case of the original Establishment Order.  Power is taken to amend the Cork Fever Hospital Acts, 1935 and 1938, and the Dublin Fever Hospital Act, 1936, as if these Acts were Establishment Orders.  The object of the Bill, as already mentioned, is to facilitate the carrying out of agreements entered into between governing bodies of voluntary hospitals and local authorities.  It is calculated to prove of the highest value, and will obviate the unnecessary duplication of legislation in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary as to the objects of the Bill, it would appear to be a simple, desirable and, perhaps, a useful measure to avoid the necessity of coming to the Oireachtas in dealing with hospitals of perhaps relatively small importance, and to avoid the necessity for legislation such as had to be promoted in recent years in respect of the two fever hospitals of Dublin and Cork to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred. Nevertheless, the Bill is of a peculiar class which, I think, requires special attention&mdash;almost jealous attention&mdash; from each House of the Oireachtas, because it transfers to the Minister in his capacity as Minister a power which previously has had to be exercised through the Oireachtas and only through the Oireachtas.  This House should jealously study every clause of a Bill of that class, no matter how trivial its content may appear to be.  The House should ask itself not only whether this Bill is produced with what might be regarded from the point of view of some Senators as a mischievous intention&mdash;I make no such suggestion as that in regard to the Bill&mdash;but whether it might not be capable of misapplication when it becomes a statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That will not depend on guarantees or assurances from the Parliamentary Secretary such as he gave on some points in the other House.  It will depend on the Bill itself and the powers conveyed to the Minister for Local Government in the Bill&mdash;not <Col N="1026" /> personally to the present Minister in whose intentions we may have the highest faith but to all those of his successors who may have different views from those in respect of which assurances or guarantees have been given and who will not be bound by such guarantees, who may, if they think fit, apply the Bill in any direction which is in accordance with its provisions. I make no apology for asking the attention of the Seanad to points in this Bill which require elucidation and to others which require considerable caution before acceptance.  The Parliamentary Secretary has referred to two hospitals in respect of which it was necessary to promote legislation in recent years.  He said there were other hospitals in a similar position and I think he mentioned one&mdash;the Maternity Hospital, Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we should ask the Parliamentary Secretary for a little more information as to the other hospitals he has in mind to which this Bill may possibly apply in the near future.  He would hardly think it necessary to ask the Oireachtas to pass a general measure to deal with the single case of the Maternity Hospital in Cork.  We have a right to ask for further information as to what other hospitals the Minister may be contemplating applying the provisions of this Bill.  In the other House, the Parliamentary Secretary said there were certain hospitals to which this Bill would be applicable.  He said (Nov. 16, 1938, col. 757):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There are now other instances in which governing bodies of voluntary hospitals have agreed to transfer their functions to joint boards on which local authorities will have representation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In another debate on 30th November (col. 1243), he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Bill has been put before the House on Second Reading solely for the purpose of enabling voluntary hospitals who wish to merge their interests or pool their resources with the local authority.  If, as has been indicated to us, there are some <Col N="1027" /> such voluntary hospital authorities in existence at the present time the necessary machinery will be provided in this Bill to enable them to seek the establishment order mentioned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House is entitled to know what voluntary hospitals were indicated to the Minister as desiring to make use of the special machinery which this Bill is providing.  Our apprehension as to the application of the Bill and the purposes to which it may be applied might be considerably relieved by knowing what is in the mind of the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary.  At the same time such information would not limit us as to the possible application of the Bill in future years in different hands.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what hospitals have agreed to such action at the moment.  Reading the Bill one finds that almost every voluntary hospital in the country might apply to be established and, if the Minister thought fit, might be established.  The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that it is not the intention of the Minister when this Bill becomes law to put any financial or other pressure on any hospital to induce it to seek such establishment. These are his words (November 30, 1938, col. 1243):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I assure the Deputy and the House that it is not the intention of the Minister or the Department to exercise any pressure, departmentally or otherwise, on the committee of a voluntary hospital to force them to merge their interests with some other body.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I accept that statement, but it is not easy to see how such pressure can be non-existent so long as control of the Sweepstake Fund lies absolutely in the hands of the Minister, as it does at present.  Almost every voluntary hospital&mdash;there are a few exceptions&mdash; keeps its doors open by means of subsidies from the Sweepstake Fund which the voluntary hospitals themselves, by permission of the Oireachtas, established eight or nine years ago, the control of which is now entirely in the hands of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  The <Col N="1028" /> Minister may not put any pressure, financial or otherwise, on a hospital, but the mere fact that he has the funds entirely under his control makes it inevitable that pressure will be felt even when it is not exercised.  The Parliamentary Secretary was asked to give a further undertaking that no invitation would be issued to a voluntary hospital to apply for establishment and he was unable to give that undertaking for reasons which he stated.  So long as the voluntary hospital depends for its existence on funds which the Minister controls, whether the Minister cares to exercise pressure or not, that pressure is there. The Minister may not flourish the big stick but, nevertheless, he has it behind his back all the time.  We know that the initial step with regard to the application for orders under this Bill depends on voluntary action by the hospitals.  I must use the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; in inverted commas because the action of the hospitals cannot be truly voluntary so long as control of the funds is in the hands of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Certain safeguards in the Bill have been recounted to us by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I suggest that these safeguards are, in fact, nugatory, though looking well on paper.  There is this question of the voluntary action of the hospital in starting the machinery for an Establishment Order, but as I have pointed out the hospital in that matter is unlikely to be in a position to act quite voluntarily.  The order has to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas and either House may disallow it.  All of us know that that machinery in respect of various orders and regulations is almost impracticable. It is almost impossible to carry a resolution in either House annulling an order issued by a Minister and, in fact, it is difficult even to have the matter brought before the House. Parliamentary time rarely permits of such a motion being moved within the period fixed by law in such a case.</P>
    <P>That provision in this Bill and in other Bills is useful.  It may permit, though it often fails to permit, public discussion of an order, but as a check on action by the Department it is ineffective. There is an appeal to the <Col N="1029" /> High Court, but as I understand the Bill the appeal to the High Court is purely on the legal aspects of the matter and not on the merits.  The High Court may annul the order if it is of opinion that such order contravenes or is not authorised by or is not made in accordance with the Act. Again, it may annul part of the order if part of it is not authorised or made in accordance with the Act.  These are the only two matters which the High Court can deal with and they are purely legal matters&mdash;whether the Minister has proceeded in accordance with the provisions of the Act or not. None of these apparent safeguards seems to me to be a real safeguard of the continued existence of a voluntary hospital which depends on moneys under the Minister's control&mdash;not public moneys but moneys which belong to the hospitals, moneys collected by the activities of the voluntary hospitals which the Oireachtas has given into the control of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Some points in the Bill seem to me to be still rather obscure.  I am not sure in what relation an established hospital would be under an order under this Bill, either to the local authority or to the Minister.  In the Schedule I notice that there are matters in respect of which provision may be made in an Establishment Order and some of these give a certain amount of control to the Minister. Item 13 in the Schedule provides that provision may be made in an Establishment Order for the account to be kept by the board, including the giving of power to the Minister to regulate such accounts.  Item 17 makes similar provision in respect of the inspection of institutions maintained by the board by officers of the Minister and officers of local authorities.  Item 18 deals with the furnishing by the board of information to the Minister, local authorities, officers of the Minister and officers of local authorities.  Item 20 refers to the making of regulations by the Minister in relation to the board and the institutions maintained by the board.  I do not know how far these various matters to be laid down in the order will put such an established hospital in the same relation to the Minister and to the local authority as, <Col N="1030" /> let us say, one of the county hospitals at present where practically the whole management of the hospital is under the supervision and control of the Minister.  Are these established hospitals which at present are conducted as voluntary establishments to come entirely under the control of the Minister?  Are they to become official institutions instead of voluntary institutions? This is hardly the occasion to argue the relative merits of voluntary work in hospital management as compared with that of representatives of local authorities under the supervision of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I simply say this, and I think it is beyond question that there is greater freedom of initiative, and less delay, because of the delays that are necessary when a higher authority has to be consulted, and more rapid efficiency in the case of hospitals under voluntary control than in hospitals primarily under a rating authority, and secondly under the Minister.  I am not going to pursue that side of the question, as it might entail a long discussion, but it is a matter of considerable importance to those interested in the future hospital system in this country.  The Minister has, on many occasions, expressed great appreciation of what was done by voluntary efforts in regard to hospital management and other public services, and I can hardly believe that he sees the danger contained in this Bill, of the possibility of transferring a number of institutions, hitherto established, and maintained until recently, by voluntary work, and of transferring them to a public authority. I would welcome from the Parliamentary Secretary some information by way of illustration as to what this Bill is going to do, by mentioning the names of some hospitals which have indicated that they would like to make use of such a machine.  We would be better able to judge what the Bill can do in cases where the Parliamentary Secretary thinks it is necessary, but we must not overlook what it may do in other cases that have not come into his mind so far.  We are not legislating for this year or for next year.  We are legislating for a considerable number of years, and we should know what we have in mind, in taking any action <Col N="1031" /> which will govern an important part of our social system for many years, and particularly we should exercise great caution in transferring from the Oireachtas powers it possessed up to the present, and putting in the hands of the Minister powers which he never possessed before, without, in fact, any adequate check on his actions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that the Title of the Bill says that it is &ldquo;an Act to enable the Minister to make certain orders in relation to the management and financing of certain hospitals.&rdquo;  I suggest that that is not an accurate Title.  I would prefer the word &ldquo;uncertain&rdquo; there.  Although the Minister says that he has it in mind that this Bill will only apply to certain hospitals who want it, the powers are there to apply it to all hospitals.  For that reason I do not think we could deal adequately or honestly with this measure without considering the whole fact of hospital management.  Any of us who know the present position in relation to hospital management under ministerial control must admit that. The Minister says the Bill will only apply to hospitals that ask for it, and that it cannot be forced on any hospital, but we must all be aware that the Minister's power is such that he can practically force anything on the hospitals.</P>
      <P>With very few exceptions hospitals depend on the Minister's sanction to meet deficiencies in their working. The Minister has control of the funds provided by the Sweepstakes for the Hospital Trustees and, if so minded, he can make such queries and place such conditions on the hospitals that he can bring them to heel.  Everyone knows that the power of the purse is such that he can do that.  There is very considerable apprehension amongst hospitals at the increasing control being exercised by the Minister, and this control, if my information is correct, and judging from what we read in the newspapers, in which there are many statements on the matter, tends towards in efficiency.  It is causing very considerable delay in the way of correspondence, lack of prompt decisions and executive action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1032" /> As the House knows from recollection, it is at least three years since the Hospitals Commission published its report advising certain specific reforms in connection with the Dublin hospitals.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary will contradict me when I say that very little has actually been done.  There has been, no doubt, a great deal of correspondence initiated, but very little has actually been done.  I believe at this moment there is in preparation a Bill for carrying out a very considerable portion of these recommendations and reforms in regard to the amalgamation of three important hospitals, but there is also the position of the medical profession, and the lay management, amongst which there is very considerable uneasiness at the centralisation, and the multiplicity of authority on this whole question of hospital management which, if one believes what one hears, is having very serious reactions on efficiency.  I do not want to pursue the matter except as a background to this measure.  There are at least four parties concerned in the control of hospitals now.  There is the board of management of the hospitals, the hospital commissioners, who are nominal advisers to the Minister; the Minister's own Departmental advisers, and the Minister himself, and when it comes to legislation there is the Oireachtas.  All that is cluttering up administration, and I seriously suggest makes for inefficiency.  With that background, I think it is very serious to see the Minister taking unrestricted powers to impose establishment orders on hospitals.  In fact, through his financial control over the hospitals, if he wishes to operate it, they have no alternative but to apply for establishment. That is the way we have to read the measure.  I agree that we have an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that there is no such intention, but I feel that the hospitals should be safeguarded in some way, so that the operation of this measure is restricted to certain hospitals that want it.  If other hospitals want it, there should be some Parliamentary machinery whereby an order is made or a resolution passed&mdash;I am not concerned how it is done&mdash;stating <Col N="1033" /> the additional hospitals to which it is to apply.</P>
    <P>There are two or three other matters in connection with the background on which I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to inform the House.  Has the public any knowledge as to how all the funds in the hands of the Hospital Trustees are spent?  Do they publish any accounts?  I am informed they do not.  No doubt there are accounts, because they are a very competent body, but they are not published.  I feel that the hospital position has long since passed from the voluntary method, and that as the Hospital Trustees are a semi-public institution the public should know where the money in their hands is expended.  It is all expended on an order from the Minister, and it is very little different from other public money.  Assuming there are such accounts, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he does not feel the time has arrived when they should be available, because there is a feeling about the expenditure on the Dublin hospitals and on hospitals under local authorities.  We know that there is a great deal of congestion, and considerable lack of service in the case of the Dublin hospitals, owing to the delay in carrying out the reports of the Hospital Commission, whereas you have only to travel about the country to see these new local hospitals almost everywhere. If my information is correct these hospitals are adequately equipped materially, but very much understaffed.</P>
    <P>I cannot give names, but I think it my duty to tell the House what I was told on the very best authority the other day with regard to service in local hospitals.  A certain young medical doctor on the staff of a local hospital came up to one of the heads of a teaching hospital of considerable repute to borrow a book dealing with a certain very critical operation.  The older man when consulted asked the doctor why he wanted the book, and was told: &ldquo;I have got to do an operation of this kind in the local hospital.&rdquo; When he asked if he realised that it was a very serious operation, and if he should do it, the doctor answered: &ldquo;Yes, I must.  The last time I had a case like this I sent it to Dublin and I <Col N="1034" /> got hauled over the coals for doing so. I was asked what was the use of having the local hospital if such work could not be done there.&rdquo;  That, I am told, is not an unique case.  After all, those who know the country realise that locally elected laymen, unable to distinguish between the degrees of danger in an operation, might naturally say, if they were on the board of the local hospital, that as a lot of money had been spent on up-to-date equipment they expected that the operations would be carried out locally.  I am quite satisfied that the case I have mentioned is true.  It was told to me on the unimpeachable authority of one of the parties concerned.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that it is typical of other cases, and that it is the cause of considerable anxiety.  For these reasons I feel, like Senator Rowlette, that there are considerable dangers implicit in this measure, and we should not rest content with the assurances in the Bill, that the Minister is only going to apply, in certain cases where any pressure is wanted, legislation of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal grounds of objection or, perhaps I should say, of uneasiness in relation to this Bill are the possible powers which the Minister will hold because of his control of Hospitals Trust Funds.  I did not read the debate in the Dáil, but I did read the introductory speech of the Parliamentary Secretary in which he indicated that it was in connection with the administration of these funds that this question arose.  That was in his first speech.  Now, I was wondering whether or not a clause could not be put in dealing with the case of a hospital that might refuse these funds.  I know that I am not putting the point as well as it could be put, but I suggest that if some clause were to be inserted it would be a clear indication of the actual intention in the Bill and might do away with some of the uneasiness which exists.  I was hoping that at some stage of this Bill the Parliamentary Secretary would be willing to indicate where it fits in with the whole question of hospitals here or with the whole scheme, if there is a scheme, or whether there is any relation at all to it.  I think we have reached the stage <Col N="1035" /> where a detailed and full statement from some responsible Minister, with regard to hospitals and the intentions of the Government in that connection, would be exceedingly useful.</P>
      <P>There have been many rumours.  Of course, my experience is that, when you get rumours of this kind, they generally turn out to be false to a very large extent, although there may be some truth in them.  For instance, you hear that some districts are getting preference; that money is being spent on hospitals in certain districts and that the work is being done as quickly as possible.  Then, you hear that, in other quarters, schemes are being held up, and that these districts are not being treated fairly.  We all know that there has been an enormous number of applications.  On the other hand, however, we feel that if the Government had granted even a quarter of the number of applications received, they would have been extremely foolish to do so unless they had some assurance that the particular scheme proposed could have been fitted in as part and parcel of the whole scheme.  I am not a medical man, nor do I pretend to have any medical knowledge, but, speaking from the point of view of a layman, it does seem to me to be sensible that there should be very close co-operation in connection with the whole hospitals scheme whereby the rarer and more peculiar diseases could be treated at one particular centre, and it seems to me to be doubtful whether the same amount of money should be spent in every hospital all over the country, so long as we know that the needs of the country as a whole are being served adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit, Sir, that it is possible that it is outside the scope of this Bill, but I do suggest that, whether at the moment or at some early date, it would be very useful if the Parliamentary Secretary could see his way to make a statement dealing with a good many of these discontented rumours which are very undesirable, particularly when they deal with such vital matters as that of public health.  I think that a statement of that kind would do good.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could tell us what are the <Col N="1036" /> reasons for the delay or holding up of the money&mdash;whether it is because of the requirements of the general scheme, or whether some schemes for the building of hospitals have been put through quickly while other schemes are held up.  These rumours, undoubtedly, exist, and I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary could tell us something in connection with this Bill which might serve to allay that feeling of uneasiness.  If it is not feasible for him to deal with it now, perhaps he might deal with the matter on the final stages of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Having listened very attentively to a few very interesting speeches that have been delivered on this Bill, I have not very much to say in reply.  Senator Rowlette criticised the Bill in some detail, and he was good enough to answer himself by quoting the replies I gave, in the course of the debate in the Dáil, on most of the points he has raised. Might I point out, if it is necessary&mdash; it may be necessary for some members of this House&mdash;that this is merely an enabling measure.  I do not want to suggest that the Senators who ask the House to believe that they have genuine fears as to the purposes to which this Bill, when it becomes an Act, may be applied, are not genuine in their fears, but I find it hard to believe that they have any real anxiety.  Senator Rowlette tells the House that very dangerous powers are being taken in this Bill.  Well, I suppose, if we examine any Bill that is passed through this House or the other House, or many of the Bills that are passed through this House or the other House, we shall probably discover that in practically every Bill powers are taken which, if abused, may have very many undesirable consequences. It must be conceded, however, that if powers are taken at all, they must be taken on the ground of the greatest good of the greatest number, even though the result of the taking of such powers in the legislation concerned may mean that somebody may be hurt.  I must say that I did not anticipate the possibility that, in connection with an innocent measure such as this, there would be a <Col N="1037" /> general debate on the whole hospital situation in this country, past, present and future.</P>

      <P>Well, I do not think we could completely close our eyes to the past and the present if we are to have a debate on the subject at all. The point has been made here that, while nobody would attribute for a moment any possibility, or the very thought, of the misapplication of the powers sought in this Bill by the present Administration, some future Minister might come along and, being presented with these powers, cut and dried, might apply them to purposes such as the present Minister or the present Government never intended or that this House never intended.</P>
      <P>Now, again, without in any way intending to be offensive, let me say that that appears to me to be an utterly childish argument.  If and when such a Ministry comes into being in this country, let it be&mdash;well, perhaps we had better not try to anticipate what particular brand of Government it might be&mdash;but at any rate let us suppose we have a Minister for Local Government and Public Health in the future who would be prepared to abuse the powers that are being given in this Bill or that are sought for in this Bill. Let us, for the sake of argument, picture the possibility of such a person taking complete control of the hospitals system in this country and completely eliminating voluntary control.  Does any sane man think that such a Minister, with a Government behind him backing such a policy, would hesitate to seek and obtain any statutory powers he may require, even if he were to wait for any statutory power at all? I do not think that the fact that statutory powers are there to enable a Minister to do certain things, if he is so disposed, would endanger the position any more than it is endangered at the present moment.  If he has not the statutory powers to implement his particular policy, he would not be a Minister, or at least he would not remain a Minister very long, if he did not take the powers to administer his policy, whatever that policy might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> It is suggested, or it has been suggested, that because of the fact that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has control of Hospitals Trust Funds, undue pressure might be exercised of a financial nature on a recalcitrant and voluntary institution. Again, there is no denying that such a possibility can be contemplated; but when one comes to try to visualise the possibilities in that regard, one ought to remember that a Minister has powers of financial pressure over many corporations, local authorities and public bodies at the present time, and I think it has scarcely ever been known that the Minister has exercised that power. If a local authority refuses to cooperate with the Minister in carrying out his policy, he can withhold road grants, public health grants, and grants to mental hospitals and similar institutions. In that way, financial pressure could be exercised, in order to bring such bodies, as some Senator expressed it&mdash;I think it was Senator Sir John Keane&mdash;to heel.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter does not agree.  Well, I am not surprised at that, although I suppose Senator Baxter is the nearest neighbour I have, so far as this House is concerned. However, he and I never agreed, and I do not suppose we will anyhow. Senator Sir John Keane tells us that Ministerial control tends towards inefficiency. I should like to challenge that.  If we were to follow that to its logical conclusion, I think we should abolish Ministerial control altogether. If it tends towards inefficiency in one direction, the logical conclusion should be that it tends towards inefficiency in all other directions.  Complaint has also been made that the Minister has unrestricted powers to exercise his will in this particular regard, and the point has actually been made that these unrestricted powers can be exercised by a majority of our democratic institutions of government.  That seems to me to be a difficult line of argument to follow.  The order made in this Bill, when and if the Bill becomes an Act. <Col N="1039" /> can be annulled by either House of the Oireachtas.  Some of the Senators here seem to foresee dangers in that&mdash; dangers in that the majority of this House or the majority of the Dáil can render effective the majority will of the people.  I see no danger in that.  I think that is the essence of democracy, and the very safeguard that we have put in for the purpose of ensuring that any such orders that are made under the terms of this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will have the backing of a majority of the people's representatives behind it, seems to me to be the most democratic machinery that we can set up.</P>
      <P>I do not know that there are any other points that have been raised with which I should deal.  Coming back to the note I struck in opening, I do not believe that the Senators who spoke on this Bill have any genuine fears.  I hope they have not, but if they have any such genuine fears as to the purposes to which this Bill might be applied, I can only say that I do believe such fears to be utterly groundless.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to continue the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts.  As Senators are no doubt aware, the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act was operated for a fixed period of time, namely, five years.  That five-year period expired last year, so that the Act ceased to be operative.  The sole purpose of this Bill is to continue the Act for another five-year period.  In the ordinary course it would be a purely formal measure which would arouse little comment, apart perhaps from discussion upon the manner of its operation.  In the circumstances of this year, however, perhaps it is necessary to say something more than that; to explain the decision of the Government to proceed to enact this measure, and continue the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, having regard to the fact that the Banking Commission, in its report, recommended that that should not be done.  I dealt in the Dáil, in the Second Reading debate on this Bill, at some length with the considerations which swayed the Government to reject the advice of the Banking Commission and to submit this measure that is to continue the Trade Loans Guarantee system.  The objections of the Banking Commission were very largely theoretical and, in fact, some of them were not entirely related to the facts. Their conclusions on the matter appear to me to have very little behind them. At any rate, so far as their report went, it did not give any very adequate reasons to justify the conclusions which they set forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that in our circumstances the continuation of the system is necessary if we are to facilitate industrial development of a kind which it is most desired to see undertaken here.  Industrial concerns can be classified in three distinct groups.  On the one hand, you have the individually-owned concern, the factory that is operated under the management of its owner, the owner providing the finances necessary for its establishment and conduct out of his private resources.  At <Col N="1041" /> the other end of the scale, you have the large public company which is able to go to the public direct for whatever capital it requires, but in between there are a large number of concerns which are somewhat too big to be financed out of the private resources of individuals and too small to make a direct approach to the public practicable.</P>
    <P>It is in relation to the medium-sized classes of concern that the utmost difficulty has arisen either in regard to meeting their capital requirements or providing the capital necessary to finance extensions in their operations. In certain cases, of course, concerns of that magnitude have been able to get the accommodation they needed from banking institutions; but in the ordinary type of case the banks do not regard the advance of loans on long terms as coming within their proper sphere of operations, and have only agreed to make loans of any substantial amount when backed by a State guarantee given under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we have reached the stage in our industrial development, or in the development of financial institutions here, when we can afford to do without the Trade Loan Guarantee system.  It is, of course, desirable that State commitments of this kind in relation to industrial projects should be limited, but, having regard to the programme we have before us, and the need there is for the promotion of industrial development and the provision of employment in industrial occupations, it is our opinion that we cannot afford to divest ourselves of this particular weapon, apart from the purely financial considerations that are involved.  There are many other considerations of an important character such as the provision of employment, the reduction of imports, the decentralisation of industry and the provision of industrial employment in rural rather than urban areas, which make it necessary for the State to be able to give financial assistance in this form to industrialists where financial accommodation would not be provided if purely banking considerations applied.</P>
    <P>The objections of the Banking Commission <Col N="1042" /> to the continuation of the system were somewhat vague.  The commission made reference to the high ratio of loss experienced since the first Act was passed.  It is true that if one examines only the total amounts involved, there appears to have been a high ratio of loss, but an analysis of the figures is necessary in order to understand the position.  The first Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act was passed in 1926 and operated until 1929. The Acts continued legally in force from 1929 until 1932, but, in fact, they were not operated during those years, the Government then in office allowing them to become a dead letter.  At any rate, no guarantees under the Acts were given during that three-year period.  By far the greater proportion of the loss which was incurred arose out of guarantees given before 1929, and, in fact, arose almost entirely out of three cases which were the subject of much public discussion and debate in the Dáil and Seanad at that time. Since 1932, the ratio of loss has been very small, although in 1933 we amended the Act to make provision for guarantees for working capital.  That is one aspect of the present system to which the Banking Commission took objection.</P>
    <P>I think some significance attaches to the results of the working of the Act since 1933 as compared with the results of the working of the Acts prior to that year.  In the interim there had occurred a considerable change in Governmental policy in relation to industrial development.  That change had operated to make investment in industry here more secure, so that the prospect of loss arising was substantially reduced.  The ratio of loss since 1933 was, in fact, so small as to be almost negligible, certainly negligible when compared with the results secured, results which are, I think, well worthy of mention here.  According to the statistics which I gave the Dáil, there are at the present time 66 industrial concerns being actively carried on in this country with assistance under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts, and the total number of persons employed in the industries concerned exceeds 5,600.  The salaries and wages paid to them over last year exceeded <Col N="1043" /> £500,000.  Having regard to the fact that our total losses to date since 1933, in respect of guarantees given under these Acts, amounted only to £13,000, I think most Senators will agree that the risk involved in continuing the Acts is altogether insignificant in relation to the great advantages which it is possible to secure: advantages in employment, and in the distribution of wages to workers here.</P>
    <P>The Banking Commission made another objection of a somewhat vague character to the continuance of the Act, in drawing attention to the fact that many of the concerns which got assistance from the State by means of guarantees for loans depended for their existence upon the maintenance of Government policy or the exercise of Ministerial discretion in their favour. They urged that that situation must be a cause of embarrassment to the Minister concerned and to the Government as a whole, and might at some stage induce decisions contrary to the public interest.  I stated in the Dáil that I could not find in the minutes of evidence published by the Banking Commission any indication of the source of their information which led them to consider that possibility.  So far as the evidence goes, it showed that nothing was brought to their notice by anybody which might give rise to that idea.</P>
    <P>I think that the members of the Banking Commission were assuming a state of affairs which they had no reason to believe existed.  My experience, during the period of five years in which this Act has been actively operated, has been that no such embarrassment as that anticipated arose, and that in fact there was no difficulty in reconciling the position in which the State had financial commitments in the success of particular industrial concerns with the public interest in general.  In fact, it is, I think, a false assumption to conclude that the public interest must necessarily be opposed to the success of these particular concerns.  In any event, the Government do not agree that in the considerations put forward by the Banking Commission there was sufficient justification to discontinue <Col N="1044" /> these Acts and leave the State without the power to guarantee loans where the giving of such loans would appear to be likely to promote additional industrial developments here and create additional employment for our people.  We are consequently bringing this Bill to the Oireachtas.  The Bill involves no change in the system.  It merely continues the Acts in force for another five-year period, and extends by £1,000,000 the limit of the extent to which loans may be guaranteed or made.</P>
    <P>Senators may be confused by references in the text to the giving of loans or the giving or guaranteeing of loans for purposes other than the financing of capital or manufacturing undertakings. There are references in the Bill for example to the giving or granting of loans the effect of which might be the reduction of the cost of commodities. That provision was in the original Act and it has been continued in each of the amended Acts since, and is being continued in this Bill, although since the first Act was passed no case arose of an application for this purpose, nor has any loan been given under the powers conferred on the Minister in that respect.  There have been a very large number of loans guaranteed and the only applications which were received and favourably decided on were applications for the guaranteeing of loans.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Senators are all familiar with the system under which trade loans are guaranteed.  An applicant comes to the Department of Industry and Commerce seeking a State guarantee for a loan which he proposes to raise.  That application is considered by in advisory committee composed of business people who act voluntarily at the request of the Department.  The committee give their recommendations on the application to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister is not bound to accept their recommendations and there have been numerous cases in which a favourable recommendation from the committee has been rejected by the Minister or in which an unfavourable recommendation was not acted upon by the Minister.  The Minister if he thinks fit, decides to give the <Col N="1045" /> guarantee and then seeks the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  If the Minister for Finance concurs, the applicant is informed that the Government is willing to guarantee the loan, probably on specified conditions.</P>
    <P>It is then for the applicant himself to negotiate the loan.  He goes to his bank and seeks to get the amount he requires advanced by it on the basis of the State guarantee.  The rate of interest is fixed by the bank.  There is an arrangement at present in existence between the State and the banks under which the banks undertake to grant these loans at a rate of interest one half per cent. under the existing bank rate.  The State guarantee does not cover, and has not covered since 1933 the whole of the interest.  They guarantee only to the extent of 2½ per cent. and the banks have accepted that arrangement.  The borrower is, of course, free to get his loan anywhere he likes and subject to any additional condition he may wish to accept on the suggestion of the lender.  It is open to the applicant to make whatever arrangement he desires with the lender subject only to the conditions which the lender imposes.</P>
    <P>The loans are repayable by fixed annual instalments and the State's obligation to make good this guarantee arises only when there has been a substantial default in the payment of interest.  We have, of course, power to exercise discretion in that matter and sometimes have been lenient in the case of businesses which have run temporarily into difficulties but appear to have good future prospects, but where it appears clear that the project is not going to make good a receiver is put in by the Minister for Industry and Commerce who seeks to realise from the assets the greatest amount he can for the benefit of the Exchequer, the State taking over the full obligation to the lender to repay the amount advanced and the interest due to the extent of 2½ percent.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is necessary to give here again the statistics which I gave in the Dáil as to the extent to which the Act has been utilised.  These statistics are all set out in the Dáil debates.  They indicate that the facilities available under the Act have <Col N="1046" /> been utilised to a large extent and have been instrumental in promoting a great deal of industrial activity within the country.  While it is probable that the Acts will not have to be utilised to the same extent during the next five year period, it is nevertheless desirable that they should be there and that the power to guarantee loans for industrial purposes and other capital undertakings should be available to the Government.  It is open to the Government to decide not to operate the Act or to utilise its powers under it if they think that the circumstances justify such a decision, but it is not desirable that they should be divested entirely of the power.  That is the reason why this Bill is being put forward at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I will have to take a certain line in relation to the proposals of the Minister and, as usual, that line will be somewhat opposed to the general contentions he has made in his eloquent speech.  The first thing that strikes me with reference to this proposal is that it is in flat defiance of one of the quite important recommendations of the Banking Commission.  I do not regard every word issued by that body as sacrosanct yet, at the same time, it was a body of world-renowned experts on whom the State spent £10,000 and they did issue a report and I think we must attach considerable importance to and, at all events, consider very carefully all their recommendations before deciding to fly in the face of any one of them.  As it is at present, this looks like keeping a dog and barking yourself. I admit that the Minister for Commerce is a very expert barker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose at the same time to repeat the arguments used by the Banking Commission which are doubtless familiar to all of us.  In that connection, I might say that if they will not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one should rise from the dead, and if the arguments used by the Banking Commission are unable to persuade you in these matters it is perhaps somewhat unlikely that my eloquence will avail.  But, there is one point in particular which is, I think, the chief consideration advanced in that <Col N="1047" /> report that I should like to say a word or two about.  That is this: the Banking Commission said that it must be a very embarrassing situation for the Minister to find himself in if he has guaranteed a loan to a certain industry and if that industry is obviously not doing particularly well and the loan is unlikely to be repaid, it must, in such a case, be a great temptation to him to use his powers of granting a monopoly to that industry as a means of bolstering up its financial position and making the loan appear a good asset from the point of view of the Government and the taxpayer.  We must, of course, believe the Minister when he says that he has never felt any embarrassment in making decisions of this kind and he has never sacrificed the public interest in furtherance of the interest of any private industry which was related in that way to State finance.</P>
    <P>But, at the same time, I must say that if I were in the position of the Minister, being perhaps, at all events, a different person to what he is, I should feel the gravest possible embarrassment if I had to make decisions of that kind, and I would be tempted, very much tempted, in the interests of my party or of the Government, to buttress up a weak financial position by giving monopoly privileges to an industry which owed money for which the State was responsible for the repayment. The granting of monopoly privileges in such a case appears to save the taxpayers' money, and doubtless, does save the taxpayers' money, but it involves a principle which is most objectionable, and that is the principle of granting to a private interest rights of private taxation which are likely to cost the consumer generally far more money than the taxpayer is saved.  I want the Seanad to consider carefully whether it is good economics, although it may appear good finance, to save thousands of pounds for the taxpayer by granting monopoly privileges&mdash; powers of private taxation&mdash;which may possibly cost the consumer tens of thousands of pounds.  In that matter we have had growing up in recent years what amounts to rights of private taxation by monopoly interests and <Col N="1048" /> which have added greatly to the burden which the general community bears, who, in addition, must pay public taxation for which, at all events, they get some return by way of public service.  To illustrate what I mean, I need refer only to the report of the Bacon Prices Tribunal, in which it appears that excess charges of between 8/- and 16/- per cwt. with reference to the annual consumption of bacon of less than 600,000 cwts., must have cost consumers in this country annually something in the region of £350,000.  I regard that as simply and solely a form of private taxation in addition to the burden of public taxation, but, unlike that burden, something in exchange for which the ordinary consumer obtains no return.</P>
    <P>If that burden of private taxation with reference to the consumption of bacon is typical, and it is, I believe, typical, the cost of living in the country generally is probably inflated by a co-efficient which I would be inclined to put at fifteen times that amount, in which case we arrive at an estimate of taxation by private monopoly of the sum of £5,000,000 a year.  At all events that is my guess.  Already public taxation amounts to some £30,000,000 a year and absorbs one-fifth of the national income, which cannot be put any higher than £150,000,000.  Now, the proportion absorbed by public taxation has reached the alarming total of 20 per cent.  of the national income and, in that connection, I may remind you that although public taxation in the neighbouring country has gone very high in recent years, the proportion of public taxation to national income is not much more than 20 per cent.&mdash;it may perhaps be 25 per cent.&mdash;and they are bearing terrific burdens in the way of rearmament, of which only a small proportion devolves on us.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make is that the growth of public enterprise and the economic activities of the State, whether reflected in legitimate public taxation or illegitimate private taxation facilitated by State action, that take place in a situation in which the national income as a whole is not increasing, produces a situation in which the credit of a genuine private enterprise, meaning an enterprise <Col N="1049" /> which must be carried on without protection or privilege from the State, is undermined and, as it happens, in spite of the liberal distribution of industrial privileges, the great bulk of economic activity remains in the category of unprotected, unprivileged private enterprise.  The credit of the producer depends on his ability to get back from the ultimate consumer a price which covers the cost of production and leaves a profit for the producer. If the State by its expansion of public taxation, and by its encouragement of the growth of private taxation, absorbs an increasing proportion of the national income, then the amount of money left in the pockets of consumers available for expenditure on the products of unprotected and unprivileged private enterprise is diminished.  To that extent, the credit of unprotected enterprise is undermined and that, I submit, is the most important national economic interest that we should take into consideration. The more you take by legitimate and illegitimate taxation from the consumer taxpayer&mdash;for the consumer is also a taxpayer&mdash;the less money he has to spend on the products of unprivileged enterprise.  It is the case of unprivileged enterprise I would seek to develop before the Seanad to-day.  Agriculture I would regard as an outstanding example of unprivileged enterprise, although even there, attempts have been made within recent years to introduce privileges for certain sections of the industry, notably dairying, beet and wheat.  So far as the most recent information available to me is concerned, the national income was not more than £150,000,000 in 1935, not having returned to its 1929 level when it stood at £162,000,000.  If you had a situation in which the State, by its economic activities, was doing something which helped to expand the national income, then these considerations, which I mentioned just now, would not apply with the same force and the money left in the pockets of consumers, after paying public and private taxation, would be greater and more plentiful for expending on the products of unprotected industry, but when you have this rigid figure, representing national income, <Col N="1050" /> we should be very careful of doing anything that tends to expand the volume of legitimate or illegitimate taxation.</P>
    <P>My chief objection to the Bill then, is that it puts in the way of the Minister, a temptation which should not be in the way of any Minister, a temptation to use his powers of interference with commercial intercourse, to grant an industrial monopoly in a way which is contrary to the public interest and which might prevent serious criticism of the kind that would result if the Government met with serious losses in connection with a matter of this kind. I have the greatest personal admiration for the Minister himself, and I only regret that his great eloquence and debating skill are not harnessed to a more worthy cause.  If he really wanted to promote prosperity, the best thing he could do would be to go to sleep like Rip Van Winkle, remain asleep for the next ten years and slow down all this business of too rapid industrial development.  Then when agriculture and other forms of economic activity had time to catch up, we might be able to resume the industrial policy with some possibility or prospect of success.</P>

      <P>I know it is very difficult to say anything unpleasant about the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this House without being subjected to interruption.  I suppose in a way that is not unnatural, but whether it is pleasant to the Minister or not, I am expressing the view which I hold very strongly that, if he had not one-tenth of the energy which he has, if he had not one-tenth of this ill-founded enthusiasm for establishing industries, he would have given the country the kind of chance that it should get.  We are going to have another Bill to-day on which more can be said about this <Col N="1051" /> aspect of Government policy.  The Minister, I am quite satisfied, will, as usual, if he cannot make a good case against the arguments which have been put forward, get on to false premises and make a defence of his policy on points totally different from those which have been put forward by speakers from this side.  He is very clever at that.  He will put into the mouths of speakers something that they never said at all and build up a case on that.  You cannot, however, build up Irish industries on that sort of foundation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that this Trade Loans Act in the past was instrumental in creating 66 industries employing 5,600 people, earning about £500,000 annually, and he added that there had been a total loss of only £13,000.  What I want to point out to Senators on the right&mdash;they are supposed to be on the right for the moment, but they should be left&mdash;is the plight of the agriculturist to-day. When you know how badly the farmers of the country need money, when you think of the fact that 19,000 fewer men were working last year on the land than the previous year; when you think, on the other hand, of the fact that these 66 industries employing 5,600 people meant a loss of £13,000 to the State, that the Minister is going under this Bill to get a group of business people to pass judgment on applications that will come in for loans, of the fact that if the loan be passed by the committee, it may or it may not be passed by the Minister, but that if it gets the imprimatur of the Minister, the man who applies for the loan will get the Minister's cheque to go into a bank and get as much money as he requires, you can see this policy in its true perspective. How can Senators over there, who talk sometimes about the rights and wrongs of the farmers, stand for a policy of financing these little industries in towns, big and small, or out on the mountain side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not saying anything about that.  I am asking you to think <Col N="1052" /> of how these men can be assisted to get money under these conditions. Think of the two things side by side. The chief fault I have to find with the Minister is that he has gone too far ahead of his colleagues, particularly of the Minister for Agriculture.  That is really what is wrong in the country.  If the Minister could pull the other members of the Cabinet along with him, or even keep them abreast of him, then complaints about the Minister's policy would have less point.  When we know what the Minister's own supporters are saying, when we know the necessity of aid for agriculture, when we see what is being done for small industries while the big industry of the country is at a standstill or is going downhill, that it has to wait until Doomsday for help, and when we see this unbalanced economy, we cannot be expected to approve of the Minister's policy.</P>
      <P>There are other aspects of this policy to which Senator Johnston has referred, and to which the Banking Commission adverted in their report.  I do not want to stress it unduly, but, say, I made an application under this scheme for a loan for an industry, and it came up before this committee, and the committee seemed to think that it might not be a bad proposition, I am very doubtful about what the Ministerial decision would be.  If I had no doubts about what the Minister himself might say, I am quite convinced that, as soon as it was known that I was putting my hand to starting a new industry, and that I was seeking assistance under the Trades Loans Act, as far as the politicians are concerned, I would not get it if they could prevent it.  You may say what you like, but nothing that is said will succeed in convincing quite a number of people in this country that that is not possible under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel myself the Minister has gone altogether too far in his efforts to industrialise us.  Some people come along with an idea, and the Minister, in his desire to get something done, rushes ahead with it, but very frequently no consideration is given to the question of whether the industries can stand or not.  You are bound in such circumstances to come up against the <Col N="1053" /> position that quite a number of industries are facing to-day.  I am not saying that these industries have been financed under these schemes at all.  In fact, quite a number have not.  In fact, some of them have been financed partly out of public subscriptions, and some by individuals who were energetic enough or had courage enough to put their money into them.  Quite a number of these industries are in a parlous condition now.  The Minister seems to think that we are not going to have a very great rush on these loans in future.  Does he anticipate we are going to have a slowing down, that we are becoming so saturated with industries that we are not going to have as many demands as in the past, or is the Minister going to see&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that when applications are made in future there is going to be such an examination and scrutiny of the possibilities of every industry that fewer of them are going to get facilities under this Act?  I think it is generally agreed that the Minister's drive has been too terrific.  The pace he set has been too hot.  Even he himself is not able to-day to father all the new things he has brought into existence in the country.  It is very difficult to feed a number of them.  The people who are expected to feed their children down the country have to strive very hard on the hillsides and on the plains to feed the little ones in their own homes; and every new industry which is started and kept alive under these conditions puts an additional burden on an already overloaded back.  The Minister may think he has justified himself by adding to the number of new industries by this Act or some other Act, but in the long run this is a policy that is not going to prove fruitful.  In the long run, it is going to do more to injure native industry, and to damp down native enterprise, than if there were a slow, cold, calm examination of the position, and if people were encouraged to face problems and tackle schemes only when they are tolerably satisfied that they can be made a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister's colleagues were <Col N="1054" /> ready to stake the credit of the Government in order to find money for farmers who would employ far greater numbers of people if they were able to get their factories working than will be employed in any of these new factories which the Minister hopes to bring into existence under this scheme, many of us would be prepared to readjust our view.  But while the Minister is putting forward this scheme and leaving the people of the country to struggle uphill with all these burdens, neither he nor those who sit behind him can expect ordinary, rational, sensible people, with their feet on the earth, to get enthusiastic.  I agree with Senator Johnston that it would be better for the country if the Minister would give it a rest.  If it cannot get that rest with the Minister's two eyes wide open, it would be better if he would go to sleep.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I have not sufficient intelligence to appreciate the dry humour which Senator Johnston directed against the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Very few people will see eye to eye with the Senator.  He pictured the Minister as a man who keeps a dog and barks himself.  It is hardly necessary for me or anybody else to stand up to defend the Minister.  I am quite sure he is capable of doing any barking necessary. When it was a question of biting, he was able to do that, too, and I am sure he would be able to do it again. I know something about dogs.  Some dogs bark for no reason but their own amusement.  They are known as &ldquo;babblers&rdquo;.  I am afraid we are getting a few of them into the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I read the debate in the Dáil on this Bill and there was very little opposition to it.  I cannot see any justification for the opposition here.  In this debate, as in other debates, we have the suggestion that the Minister may use his powers to the detriment of the community in general, that it is not safe to give him certain powers lest he use them recklessly.  That is a ridiculous suggestion.  If the Minister were of that type, he would never have got to the position in which he finds himself. That applies to the past as well as to the present.  People do not elevate men of that type to such positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we go back on the legislation <Col N="1055" /> enacted during the terms of office of the past or the present Government and pick out any Bill, we shall find that if the Minister used all the powers given him under that Bill recklessly, he could have rendered the country insane.  It seems like courting popularity to attack the report of the Banking Commission, but I am glad it is not the intention of the Government to accept the Banking Commission's report <i>in toto.</i>  I do not propose to deal with any other portion of the report except the section relevant to this discussion.  I do not see how the Banking Commission arrived at the decision they did in connection with this scheme of trade loans.  If we had arrived at the stage of over-production, there might be some excuse for the report, but we have not done that yet and, in my opinion, we are not likely to reach that stage for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter proceeded on the same line as Senator Johnston.  He started off by saying that he was in thorough agreement with Senator Johnston, that the Minister's policy was all wrong, and that he should go away to Spain or somewhere for ten years.  I ask Senator Johnston and Senator Baxter if that is the Minister's policy and the Minister's policy only. Surely everybody realises that it is the policy of the country, and that if Senator Baxter and Senator Johnston could get the majority of the people to agree with them, they could easily change the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the policy of the Government. Until they find that they have a minority of reasonable size in the country in agreement with them, as they have not at present, they should not make the ridiculous speeches we have had to listen to to-day.  It is well known that the drive of the Minister, which has been condemned in strong language to-day, is appreciated not alone by the Minister's supporters but by people of other political opinions.  They have not been slow to voice their appreciation of the Minister's efforts on every possible occasion. The suggestion is that the Minister, by his drive, force and energy has caused terrible destruction.  The Minister has the support not alone of the Fianna <Col N="1056" /> Fáil people in the country, who themselves constitute a majority, but the support of the majority of the Opposition. Just because Senator Baxter does not agree with that policy, there must be a stop put to the Minister's gallop and he must be sent away for ten years.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Minister has caused considerable embarrassment to Senator Baxter and other people on several occasions and I hope he will continue to do so so long as they are in opposition to a policy which is the policy of practically the entire people.</P>
    <P>I believe that the policy of continuing this trade loan system is very sound.  Without going into the figures, the results have, so far, justified it. Were it not that trade loans were available for Irish industry, we should have a very different position to-day. In other countries, they have not the tradition we have and it has been found easier in those countries to establish industries through the normal channels.  Here, because of tradition, if you like, that has not been found possible in many cases and in respect of particular types of industry. Because it was not found possible to start industries through the normal channels of finance, the trade loan system is necessary.  This system has been in operation in other countries and I understand it was largely responsible for the great development of industry in the United States.  A similar arrangement exists there and has been availed of all over the States. As a result, industries were built up which could not, in ordinary circumstances, have been developed.  From my own knowledge, I can say that numerous industries have been helped out by this system here.  If it were not that such assistance was available, some of these industries would have come to the ground.  Perhaps Senator Baxter would think that that would be a great day's work for the country. Would the Senator go into his own constituency&mdash;if a Senator can be said to have a constituency&mdash;and say it would be a very good thing if the boot factory in Cavan went out of existence?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there is one there&mdash;the factory that the Senator told us a month ago made bad boots and gave people rheumatism.  I take it for granted that the Senator did not refer to the Clonmel factory, because the Clonmel factory makes good boots.  All the people in Tipperary stand up for their factories and would stand up for them even if their products were not good.  They would say they were.  If Senator Baxter holds the opinion to which he gave expression, he should go to the people in his own area, the people with whom he is personally acquainted or associated, and advise them to let these factories go &ldquo;burst&rdquo;.  Some of these factories started out with barely sufficient capital to keep moving.  When they got started, they found that they were not able to produce sufficient quantities to carry the overheads and that it was necessary to extend.  Were it not that the trade-loan guarantee system was there to help them, these industries could not have extended and the country would have been worse off to that extent.  If any of these factories had failed&mdash;even the back-lane factories which we used to hear so much about but which we do not hear so much about now&mdash;it would have been a loss to the country.  I believe that Senator Johnston and Senator Baxter will find it very difficult to prove that the production of wealth in the field of industry is detrimental to agriculture.  That is a false doctrine. The more development there is in industry, the more customers there will be for the products of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to go back on the history of our own country, we should find that the statements made by Senator Baxter and Senator Johnston with regard to Irish industry would not hold water.  Many of the industries we have to-day are not new industries.  They are old industries, revived under what Senator Baxter would describe as the &ldquo;destructive policy&rdquo; of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  As a result of that policy, we have to-day in various little towns in the South, North, East and West, thriving populations living on the wages derived from these industries.  One of the <Col N="1058" /> desirable features of the trade-loan guarantee scheme, as I understand it, is that the Minister will be in a position to grant a trade loan to a company which is starting in industry.  I was interested in various undertakings and I know that the Minister would be prepared to sanction a trade loan provided the factory were set up in a district in which he considered a factory was necessary, from the point of view of unemployment and for other reasons. I believe that that is very desirable. We are told that the Minister would possibly be influenced to give preferential treatment to certain industries because of the existence of a trade loan. I believe the Minister will have, as he has, a definite interest in every industry, regardless of whether it is financed by trade loan or not.  That is very desirable and I can see no reason for any objection on that ground.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter says that the Government will not agree to a Bill to give farmers money.  It is hardly necessary to remind Senator Baxter that the Government has agreed to a Bill to give farmers money.  That Bill was introduced by the previous Government who put on the board set up under that measure no less a person than Senator Baxter.</P>

I do not think there is much necessity for anybody to stand up to support this Bill.  It is obvious that it is necessary. It may not be necessary after a certain <Col N="1059" /> number of years, when the people begin to get confidence in Irish industry. I believe that in another five years the people will have far more confidence in Irish industry.  They will know that industries have come here to stay, and gradually it will be possible to finance them through the ordinary channels.  Perhaps after five or ten years, if Senator Baxter comes back, we will give him all the applause he got to-day, but did not appreciate.</P>

      <P>As a matter of personal explanation, may I say that Senator Quirke either misunderstood what I said, or considerably misrepresented what I did say.  I pointed out that under this Bill the Minister for Industry and Commerce was giving industrialists a cheque to go in and borrow from the banks on Government security.  My point was that they would not do that for the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>My attitude towards the general policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is considerably more friendly than that of Senator Baxter or Senator Johnston. In fact, in the main, I have been a supporter of his policy, merely objecting to its being carried out simultaneously with a policy so damaging to agriculture, as was the policy of the Government until recently.  Unlike Senator Johnston, I should be sorry if the Minister for Industry and Commerce were to go into a swoon like the Sleeping Beauty for ten years, to be awakened by the kisses of some agricultural Prince Charming.  If there is a division on this particular Bill, I shall certainly vote against it.  I have always disliked this idea of the State guaranteeing loans to particular industries. I attacked it in the Dáil when it came up before, and I am opposed to it still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quirke's remarks that, in fact, there was no general opposition to it in the Dáil, could be explained by the circumstances, that the record of the Opposition really prohibited them from taking any strong line on the subject.  They introduced a similar Bill and exercised similar powers when in office.  In spite of what Senator Quirke <Col N="1060" /> said about the results having proved up to now satisfactory in the case of loans&mdash;possibly that was because they had not got the same instrument in the way of protective tariffs that the present Minister has&mdash;they were absolutely disastrous.  I think Senator Quirke is a bold man to say that the results of guaranteeing trade loans by the State up to date have been such as to justify them.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the State is equipped for making such guarantees as are permitted.  I agree with Senator Johnston that it is an obvious source of possible corruption, public and private.  There is no use in Senator Quirke saying that we have got such an admirable Ministry that it is impossible for any one in high places to commit blunders or great errors of judgment, or moral delinquencies, but we cannot reckon on that for all time. We would be unlike every country in Europe if we never had a Minister getting into power who was capable of making great financial blunders, or even if we never got a Minister into power who was capable of being corrupt.  This is the kind of Bill that seems to me to open the door to corruption more than most others, and I object to it on that ground, as well as on other grounds.  The remarks of Senator Quirke have given a good illustration of the sort of dangers inherent in a policy that includes Bills of this kind.  Senator Quirke referred to the suggestion of Senator Johnston that there would be tremendous temptation to the Minister to buttress up a failing industry to which the State had guaranteed a loan, and to give it preferential treatment rather than see that loan go bad.  According to Senator Quirke's answer, that is no danger at all in his eyes.  In his eyes every industry in the country deserves preferential treatment, if necessary.  I think that is an outrageous proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I think the Senator is not right in accusing me of saying that every industry is entitled to preferential treatment.  I never said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case the Senator's arguments had no meaning. <Col N="1061" /> The only point in his reply to Senator Johnston's warning, about the danger of buttressing industry, would have been that every industry could be advantageously buttressed.  I think it ought to be realised, even by the most ardent protectionist, that it is sometimes for the good of the country that an industry should go to the wall.  That fact was not realised by Senator Quirke when rebuking Senator Baxter.  There are industries that it is better for the community should go to the wall because they are detracting from public prosperity instead of contributing to it. I think the whole ideology of our industrial policy would be purified and improved if we had not got into the habit of talking as if it was a sacrilege to say that the country would be better off without any industry rather than that any industry, however uneconomic, might exist.  Senator Quirke said the people in Clonmel would fight for the boot factory even if the boots made there were bad.  I have no doubt they would.  Financial vested interests and local patriotism would fight violently in defence of any factory that might exist.  That very fact ought to make us more cautious of what we do.  Once you start an industry, however rotten, it is definitely difficult to get rid of it.</P>

      <P>I think it is a waste of breath to discuss whether it is good or bad.  It is inevitable.  People will wish local industry to continue.  That is human nature.  I merely say the fact that they do is not a sound reason why, from the point of view of the State, they should continue.  An industry that is uneconomic and that impoverishes rather than enriches the community ought to go.  I am in general sympathy with the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I do not want him to go out of action for ten years, but I dislike this particular Bill.  I do not think anything has been said in its favour that goes anywhere near answering the objections raised by the Banking Commission, and the objections raised to-day by Senator Johnston.</P>

      <P>I do not propose <Col N="1062" /> to range over the whole Government economic policy.  It would be impossible to do so on this measure, but I feel the admiration of it by the Minister to be rather an exaggeration.  I have an admiration for the Minister's optimism because even though the portents are alarming the Minister tells us everything is quite happy.  With regard to this measure, I do not at all like the way the Government is tied to any industry, or the way in which Government prestige and policy is dependent on this, as there is a temptation, undoubtedly, to use Government powers to foster and buttress industry.  I was told once that I was out of date on economics, and that this policy is perfectly right.  On the question of the dangers of this Bill, Senator Johnston referred to the danger of monopoly.  I do not feel that that is such a danger.  I feel that there is a great danger of the Minister using an allied institution, the Industrial Credit Corporation, to come to the rescue of the trade loan guarantee.  I should like an assurance from the Minister, if possible, that such was not the intention.  We all know that legally the corporation may be independent but, in its nature it is controlled by the Government.  The Government holds over 90 per cent. of the capital, and I feel there is a great danger there, that to save loans under guarantee, the Government may call in a body like that.  There is another danger, and the Minister can say to what extent he is taking advantage of it. That is the power to give a trade loan guarantee either without or against the advice of the advisory committee. Under the Bill he can act independently of the advisory committee.  I do not know if he has any intention of doing so, but he can give loans against the advice of the advisory body. One other matter was discussed at considerable length on this Bill.  I refer to the Government policy with regard to trade loans in the building industry.  I feel that there is a great danger of helping the building industry with credits, apart altogether from the power of the public to purchase houses when built.  The whole thing is interlocked and cannot be considered independently.  There is considerable <Col N="1063" /> danger in using the machinery of the Bill to encourage the building of houses when there is no prospect of a sale.  I read the debate in the Dáil, and while I was not quite clear as to the Minister's attitude, I think he changed it during the progress of the debate.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong.  I understand that at one time it was stated that this Bill was to help building societies.  If I understand the object of building societies, their main purpose is to finance the general public who are about to purchase houses.  If this Bill is to be used to encourage housing, I feel that it disregards altogether that aspect of purchase.  Merely to build houses with no prospect of selling them is unsound and dangerous.  I may be wrong about that, but that was my interpretation of the debate in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I just wish to intervene for a few moments in this debate, and again, unfortunately, it is the remarks of Senator Baxter that bring me to my feet.  I feel that whenever the Senator speaks, either on agriculture or industry, it is a case of all being yellow to the jaundiced eye.  In this case, it would appear that everything is yellow save the Minister himself.  The Senator tries, by his praise of the Minister while he is here, to hit as hard as he can in what he says about other matters; but he then comes on to the question of agriculture and refers to the Minister for Agriculture as not doing certain things for the farmers. He says that when the Minister for Agriculture is not here.  I presume that, if the Minister for Agriculture were here, the Senator would say that he was a very nice gentleman, although at the same time everything he was doing was all wrong, when the Minister is not here.  I wish to put one question to Senator Baxter and to the other economist who has spoken, Senator Johnston: Has not the Government, through the Minister for Agriculture, given the farmers a monopoly in the butter trade?  Have they not been given a monopoly in the egg trade and in the bacon trade&mdash;notwithstanding the aside of Senator Johnston, that the <Col N="1064" /> bacon curers had made £300,000 excess profits from the consumers? The fact remains that the Government, through the Minister for Agriculture, have given to the farmers and the agriculturists of this country monopolies of the butter, eggs, bacon and meat trades of this country, and that is a flat contradiction of the assertions made by Senators Baxter and Johnston.  That is my main purpose for intervening in this debate.  However, apart from that, I should like to say, as the Minister for Agriculture is not here and the Minister for Industry and Commerce is here, that the régime of the Minister for Agriculture has been a far more difficult one than that of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. When we came into office, we were so derelict of industries, and our people were appealing so much for the support of Irish goods and the support of Irish industries to produce those goods that, in my opinion, the problem of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, hard though it was, was a much easier problem to face than that of the Minister for Agriculture who, when we took office, had not merely to tear down a false economy but to fight an economic war with an enemy that was trying to destroy our industries here</P>

      <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House.  I am sorry I did not hear the speech of Senator Johnston.  I want to say that I do not think that anyone is enamoured&mdash;probably the Minister himself is not enamoured either&mdash;with the system of trade loans.  However, as I see it, that policy has been continued in this country for a considerable number of years.  Then the Bill lapsed, but it gave certain limited facilities&mdash;on pretty drastic conditions I must admit&mdash;but nevertheless they have proved to be of great value in connection with certain industries, and I believe that it was absolutely essential for the Government to continue this system at the present stage, although I do not believe it would be a permanently satisfactory arrangement. While you have an existing industry which has a substantial capital and in which extension is desirable, but which possibly is not showing such profits as would make it possible to float the matter as a public issue, this method has provided a way by which such an industry can be extended, and there are many cases in which such a procedure can be justified.  There are many cases of losses which can be justified, but you can also point to a number of cases of businesses paying regularly but which could not get further capital to extend their business.</P>
      <P>Some people seem to think that this is a method of financing industry.  I submit that it is not, and that it never could be, but I also submit that as a method of providing short-time and temporary assistance to an industry it is a thing that should be continued until some other method may be found.  Where the money cannot be found from the banks or by a public issue, and provided that the loan has a proper relationship to the capital already in the industry and to the capacity of the people to pay back the loan, and that there is a proper reserve to meet commitments, I think that there is a number of cases where this would be very useful, and I would be very sorry if the Minister decided to drop it altogether.</P>

      <P>Sir, it is always a difficult matter to describe a whole policy in a phrase, and yet men, and particularly men in politics, are always attempting to do it, although their attempts are not always successful. For a long time I have been seeking for a concise and easily remembered phrase to describe the policy, or, if &ldquo;policy&rdquo; is too strong a term, the attitude of mind of Senator Johnston and Senator Baxter, and their Fine Gael policies, and to-day I have got it&mdash;the Rip Van Winkle policy.  Senator Johnston, having announced it, if not clearly, at least with sufficient eloquence, got almost a cheer from Senator Baxter, and he had hardly resumed his seat before Senator Baxter jumped to his feet to back up this policy which at long last has got its innings&mdash;the Rip Van Winkle policy.  I am glad of the phrase because it typifies so completely the attitude of mind, if not the policy, of the Senators who have used it for the first time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Baxter is now beginning to find out that his first blush of enthusiasm was a bit too rapid.  Everyone who saw him realised the glee with which he jumped up here once Senator Johnston had given him the phrase&mdash;to reiterate the phrase and advocate again and again the policy of which that phrase was so completely descriptive.  I could not follow Senator Johnston's remarks through the full ramifications of that policy, but as far as I could follow his remarks I understood him to say that if an industry makes a sufficiently substantial profit then the residue left to those who purchase the commodities produced by that industry will be less.  I think that is self-evident.  Nobody disputes that. Senator Johnston, however, took ten or 15 minutes elaborating that point, and he spoke of the principle of granting to a private interest rights of private taxation which are likely to cost the consumer far more money than the taxpayer has saved, and he asked the Seanad to consider whether it was good economics to save thousands of pounds for the taxpayer by granting monopoly <Col N="1067" /> privileges&mdash;powers of private taxation, as he called it&mdash;which might possibly cost the consumer tens of thousands of pounds.  Now let us be clear as to the exact significance of the term &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo;.  Would Senator Johnston agree that we have given the barbers the monopoly of cutting hair? I think it would be fair enough to say that.  Did Senator Johnston use the term &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; in that sense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there are, and that is the only admission I wanted. Senator Johnston referred to my powers of conferring a monopoly.  In that sense, I have no powers of conferring a monopoly.  Certainly, we have given the people concerned with the manufacture of flour a monopoly in the sense that we excluded foreign flour. In the same way, as Senator O'Donovan has mentioned, we have given Irish farmers a monopoly, with regard to eggs and bacon, and so on, in the sense that we have excluded foreign produce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, all monopolies can be invaded.  Senator Baxter, for instance, can cut his own hair, and thus invade the monopoly of the barbers, and somebody else in another way can invade the so-called monopoly of the flour millers.  I have no doubt that some people would like to invade Senator Baxter's monopoly, but that is not on a statutory basis.  However, I think that Senator Johnston is wrong in his assumption&mdash;if I am right in thinking that it is his assumption&mdash;that if the profits industries are now making were not made, there would be more money available for the purchase of agricultural produce&mdash;although agriculture is a protected industry in one sense.  I think that is not true.  If all <Col N="1068" /> our industries to-day, which are employing about 75,000 additional people and producing so much more goods, were to cease to make profits, and cease to exist, the amount available for the purchase of the products of agriculture or of private and legitimate unprotected industries would be lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I was using the word &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; as an extreme example of industrial privileges in general, and they can be shared in general, even if they do compete with one another on the home market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know, there is only one legal monopoly in this country, and that is in connection with the manufacture of cotton thread. Powers were obtained to confer monopolies <Col N="1069" /> in certain circumstances, and only in one instance has a legal monopoly, so to speak, been conferred, and that was in connection with the manufacture of cotton thread.  That was conferred for one reason, and for one reason only, and that was that we wanted to have that factory set up in the West of Ireland instead of in Dublin.  If that had not been done, we realised that it would not have lasted a month because of the competition that might come from some other centre.  We often hear Senators urging the distribution of industries around the Gaeltacht and depressed areas, but I say that we cannot do that unless we are prepared to protect them from the competition from other highly industrialised centres.</P>
      <P>That is the only basis upon which mandatory powers have been given to a Minister or exercised by a Minister here&mdash;in that particular case.  In every other case in which those powers might have been exercised they could not be used because of the particular phraseology in the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it is true that we have limited competition, particularly competition from outside, in respect of a very large range of commodities, and that because of that limited competition it is possible for manufacturers here to make profits&mdash;but if the competition was not limited to make no profits&mdash;and in some cases to make big profits.  I have no objection to manufacturers making profits.  I spoke on this before and do not want to repeat what I said then. Industries are run for profit.  The whole incentive to industrial enterprise is the making of profits.  These attacks on Irish industrialists of making profits seem to me to emanate from feelings of jealousy, if not from mere political motives.  With regard to the firms that have got assistance under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, Senators I am sure will be glad to learn that quite a number of them have paid off the loans and wiped out the guarantees within a lesser period than we anticipated, and that the others&mdash; those that failed to pay the interest on the loans guaranteed to them and in respect of which receivers had to be <Col N="1070" /> appointed in order to dispose of the assets at a minimum loss&mdash;were industries that made no profits and were failures.  We get far too much nonsense talked about the profits of Irish industry.  It is true that in the circumstances of this market, which is a small market, the provision of State protection makes possible, in certain cases, undue profits.  Because of that the State has, in the exercise of its responsibility, set up an institution to control such industries, to control them at any rate to the extent of limiting their profits either directly by order to that effect, or by an alteration in the basis on which protection is given.</P>
    <P>The bacon manufacturers made profits.  It was not a very large additional profit over and above what might be regarded as reasonable, taking into account their total annual turnover, but it was a sum of money, in addition, in the opinion of the Prices Commission, to that which they might reasonably have taken out of this market.  How do Senators know that?  Because an inquiry, instituted by this Government, gave them that information.  That inquiry is going to result in action designed to ensure some alteration in the circumstances under which the bacon industry is carried on so as to minimise the risk of excessive profits being taken in the future.</P>
    <P>I propose now to deal with some of the matters that have a more direct relation to this Bill.  Senator Johnston quite properly said that we had set up the Banking Commission at considerable expense and some trouble and that we should not altogether ignore their recommendations.  There is no intention of ignoring their recommendations, but we do not propose to take their conclusions or their recommendations as Revelations of Holy Writ. Each of the recommendations of the Banking Commission is worth no more than the arguments advanced in support of it.  We have got to go behind their recommendations and see why they made them: what was the basis on which they went, the arguments that were advanced in support of them and the evidence on which they based their arguments.  I say, in respect to their <Col N="1071" /> recommendation that the trade loans guarantee system should be terminated, that their arguments are weak&mdash;in fact, they are out of all relation to the facts. When they spoke about the ratio of loss they were ignoring the most obvious thing that they should have adverted to, namely, the change in Government policy that took place in 1932.  It is true that one-half of the total amount guaranteed before 1932 was lost.  It is also true that less than 1 per cent. of the amount guaranteed since has been lost.  The Banking Commission did not take that into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the Minutes of Evidence taken before the commission on this matter.  I observed that quite a number of the members, in addressing questions to witnesses, made a distinction between the period before 1932 and the period after.  They were at great pains to explain why they made that distinction.  Some of them referred to the gap, the three-year period before 1932, when no loans were made.  Some of them gave that as an excuse in making the distinction. Others made the distinction on different grounds.  But everybody knows that the one thing they had in their minds was the fact that there was a change of Government in 1932, and they were at great pains to conceal that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>That was very tactful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the important thing.  The Senator says is was tactful. I say it was mere stupidity. The essential thing that mattered was the fact that there was a change of Government, and a change in Government policy.  That was the one factor they left out of account.  Surely, in making their recommendation they should have taken that factor into account.  It was the most important factor, so important that it invalidates their conclusions.  They referred to the theoretical objection they have to <Col N="1072" /> the giving of guarantees in respect of loans for working capital.  That theory is entirely fallacious.  In the first month in which I became Minister for Industry and Commerce I came to the conclusion that the retention of that limitation would inevitably produce a farcical situation.  It had produced it for our predecessors.  But our predecessors got over that objection in the most roundabout way so as to keep within the terms of the Act.  In the case of Alesbury's and the Irish Glass Bottle Company, the loans that were given were, in fact, loans for working capital, and were used to extinguish existing debts.  Everybody familiar with these cases knows that although the Act debarred the doing of that in so many words, that is to say, the giving of loans for such purposes as working capital, our predecessors succeeded in doing so and in getting within the terms of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember a manufacturer who came to me.  He was about to embark on a new enterprise.  He estimated his capital requirements at approximately £10,000.  He estimated that he would be able to equip the factory for £7,500, and that he would have the balance for working capital.  After a period he found that his machinery was going to cost him more than he estimated, and that consequently his working capital resources were going to be unduly limited.  He came to discuss with me the possibility of getting a trade loan.  I had in the back of my mind that the man had already ordered the machinery for the factory, and that if he told me so he could not get the guarantee for the trade loan, but that if he did not mention it there was nothing to prevent him from getting the trade loan.  The man was just too honest or not subtle enough not to refer to the fact that the order for the machinery had been placed.  I said to him that he was out because of that, and that there was no chance of his getting a guarantee for a trade loan. The project that the man had undertaken was a good one, whether we guaranteed a loan for the purpose of plant or for working capital.  The security and the prospects were good, but because of this stupid limitation, based upon a theory which has very <Col N="1073" /> little to recommend it, it prevented the man at that time from getting assistance which would have enabled him to go ahead with the enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Did he go on, or did he get the money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, because we amended the Act&mdash;the Act that is now in operation.  Because of that amendment in the Act, the Banking Commission recommends that the Act should be repealed and the whole system changed.  That theory, as I have said, has nothing to recommend it.  Our experience has been that firms that get guarantees for loans for working capital have no more difficulty in meeting the charges on those loans when they arise than firms that get guarantees for loans for the purchase of plant or equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third objection that Senator Johnston referred to is the one most frequently made&mdash;the possible difficulties arising in the fulfilment of public policy by reason of the fact that the State has financial commitments in respect of particular industries.  May I say that my experience has been that the reverse is the case.  It is quite true, as Senator Sir John Keane remarked, that in recent years Government prestige here has become bound up with the success of privately-owned industrial enterprises, and that that is an undesirable position.  It is an undesirable position, but we cannot avoid it.  It is a matter which we might debate here on another occasion, but there is no doubt that the prestige of the present Government is, to a large extent, involved in the success of privately-owned industrial concerns.  I would like to see a way out of that position, but I do not think that we can easily get out of it so long as we have the existing political divisions and an Opposition that has absolutely no policy whatever.  That being so, it is clear that the Government is directly concerned with the prospects of each industrial concern whether it has got a trade loan guarantee or not.  In fact it is much more likely to risk the collapse of an enterprise where the <Col N="1074" /> main burden of loss has to be borne by public funds than where the main burden of loss will fall upon private funds.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, of great importance to this country that private capital invested in industry should not be lost. If there is one thing that is more essential than another it is to get out of people's heads the idea that Irish industrial enterprise is going to be a source of loss, so that the hesitancy to invest in Irish industrial enterprise which was so marked a feature in this country until recently will have disappeared.</P>
    <P>On the grounds of public policy, apart altogether from the question of Government prestige, it is important that the Government should do everything possible to see that privately-owned industrial enterprises do not fail, if the Government can, with due regard to the public interest, prevent their failure.  So far as the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Department are concerned, I want to say that their interest in the prospects of industrial enterprise will not be any the less by reason of the fact that there is no State money involved in them. In any event, I am curious to know where the Banking Commission got the idea that such embarrassment did arise because the suggestion was not made by any of the witnesses who came before them.  They certainly had no ground on which to base that recommendation. They have advanced no arguments in support of their recommendation that this Act should terminate.</P>
    <P>Another objection they have to the continuation of the Act is that it makes possible the exercise of political discrimination by the Minister.  Senator MacDermot went further and said it is a source of possible corruption It is.  That is quite true.  There is not the slightest doubt whatever that a Government that wanted to exercise its powers under these Acts to the detriment of its political opponents, and to the benefit of political friends, could do so.  It is quite obvious that these <Col N="1075" /> powers could be used corruptly by any Minister who wanted to do so.  What is the remedy for that?  The only safe course that in my opinion would have any real validity in meeting the point of Senator MacDermot would be to strip Ministers of all power.  Give them no power whatever, and not having power it is obvious they cannot use it corruptly.  The only other safeguard is that provided by the Standing Orders of the Dáil and the Constitution. Members of the Dáil and the Seanad have the right to question Ministers, to get information concerning all the activities of Government Departments.  It is that power to get information and to expose anything that may require exposure concerning the use of Ministerial powers and the administration of public departments which I would say is the main safeguard with regard to the use of those powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be drawn into a sideline issue regarding the rights of Senators.  Also, apart from the fact that it is a reasonable assumption that those who are chosen by the Dáil to hold ministerial office will be men of probity, who will not be influenced unduly by partisan or corrupt considerations, the only other safeguard you have against abuse of these powers is in the vigilance of the members of the Dáil, but if you give Ministers powers at all you have got to take the risk that they will be abused and it is unnecessary to be constantly reiterating the possibility of those abuses arising.  If you want to eliminate that possibility altogether by giving your Ministers no powers, then it will soon be plain that government under those circumstances will be impossible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly so, but the <Col N="1076" /> particular powers given here are so accessible as to be the least dangerous of all.  There must be full publicity. The Act provides that a return of all the guarantees given must be made to the Dáil within three months and the loan is given in that public manner to the knowledge of a great number of people&mdash;the banks who advance the money, the directors and shareholders of the company who are borrowing, the solicitors and accountants and others who have had parts in the transaction and to members of the advisory committee&mdash;all the details will be known&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not suggested that, but it is available to a substantial number of people and that ensures that if there is anything corrupt or of a character to which Senator MacDermot referred, the matter is inevitably going to be raised in public and that is the surest safeguard against any abuse of his powers.  It is possible, of course, for a Minister to exercise these powers in a manner which would be detrimental to the interests of his political opponents.  That was a point raised by Senator Baxter.  My reply to it is that neither under this Government nor the previous Government did it happen.  If the Senator will look down the list of cases that got advances prior to 1929 he will find certain cases which indicate that our predecessors were not influenced by these considerations and if he looks down the list of cases since 1929 he will also find that neither were we.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane asked me to give an assurance that I would act in accordance with the advice given by the advisory council.  I intend to give no such assurance.  It is true that a Minister would be influenced to a considerable extent by the advice of the committee but he does not bind <Col N="1077" /> himself to accept it without question, because there are many considerations that might influence a Minister's decision of which the committee would have no knowledge.  Take the particular case which might arise&mdash;an application was made under the Trades Loans Acts for a loan guarantee in connection with a boot manufacturing enterprise. The Trade Loans Advisory Committee considered it a good proposal, that the security was good and the prospects good and that the amount of the loan was reasonable, having regard to the total capital invested, and they submitted a favourable recommendation. That recommendation came to me and I rejected it.  I rejected it because there are, in my opinion, a sufficient number of boot factories in the country at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the competition between them is likely to produce an undesirable development, that is, spasmodic employment in that industry as well as inadequate utilisation of the capital invested in it and I rejected the application.  Mind you, the advisory committee were quite within their rights.  They said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This is a good case even if there are too many boot factories already and even if some of them fail, this won't fail.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They were satisfied that the particular case was as good as any and that when the test of competition was applied the factory would not prove to be one of the weaker units.  However, I decided on the grounds of public policy that the loan should not be given and it was not given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, the Senator would be more concerned with that. There have been such cases in which the committee considered that the risk involved in granting the loan was too great, but in which I decided that, whatever the risk, it was worth while having the particular enterprise contemplated <Col N="1078" /> in the application.  One could easily imagine a highly speculative enterprise such as one proposing to exploit a new patent previously untried but the successful operation of which might be of great advantage to the country.  The risk might be very great and no advisory committee would recommend that a Government should take the risk but the Government might take the responsibility of deciding quite reasonably that it was proper to risk the loss of the money and to face even the loss of the money in order to take the chance of having the new development attempted.  That could happen; it has happened.  There are not very many such cases, it is true, but I would not like to deprive myself of the power to deal with them either in the Bill or by an undertaking given here not to consider such cases in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane spoke of hardy optimism.  May I congratulate him on the consistency of his pessimism? I did not say that everyone was happy and that there was nothing to worry about.  There is quite a lot to worry about.  I think the solution of the economic problems of this country depends very largely on the success of our efforts to promote industrial development in this country. Industries are not merely new sources of employment&mdash;they are new sources of wealth.  If we are to tackle our social problems and deal adequately with the position of agriculture, and that position, according to most people who speak about it, seems to be calling for assistance from the community fund, the people engaged in industries must add to our means for producing wealth and, apart from agriculture, there is no way of doing that effectively or easily except by the promotion of new industrial activity. It is because we believe that the powers in this Bill are essential to enable that objective to be pursued that we have brought the Bill before the Oireachtas.  It is simply a misrepresentation of the attitude of the Government to represent us as being completely satisfied with the position, or saying that everyone is happy, and there is nothing to worry about. There is a great deal to worry about <Col N="1079" /> and a very large number of people are unhappy because of depressed economic circumstances.  We have not gone too far ahead&mdash;we have not gone far enough.  The position is that industry in this country was backward, so backward that it seemed almost impossible for us to rectify equilibrium between industrial and agricultural activity. In industrial matters we were far behind the position which other countries which were not cursed by an alien Government as we were had achieved long ago.  We have gone a long way towards our objective, but we have not gone far enough&mdash;there is still a great deal of leeway to be made up.  It will require all the energy and drive to get the results that are necessary, and the idea that the country would be benefited by the slowing down of our progress in that direction is all wrong.</P>

      <P>However, I do not think it is necessary to deal further with any of the points that have been raised.  Some of them are general and of no particular relationship to this Bill, except perhaps the point raised by Senator Douglas with regard to building societies.  During the course of the passage of this Bill in the Dáil I thought I made it quite clear that it was not intended to utilise the trade loans guarantee system for the financing <Col N="1080" /> of building societies.  The term &ldquo;building society&rdquo; has misled people. Under the Building Societies Act, I think that a building society is in fact debarred from owning houses or owning land.  It is concerned only with the getting of subscriptions from its members for the purpose of making advances to its members to build houses.  I do not want to minimise the importance of the part which they might play in the development of house building here.  I think the development of private enterprise in house building is very largely dependent on some suitable system of financing house purchase transactions.  This Bill has nothing to do with it.  It is possible for a public utility society, that is a society formed under the Friendly Societies Act, which engages in the building of houses and for a private individual or contractor to apply but, as I made it clear in the Dáil, I would not be prepared to consider any application which did not involve fairly large-scale development. There has been only one case in which application was made and that was in connection with the Mount Merrion scheme in Dublin.</P>
      <P>A trade loan guarantee was given to the company that undertook the development of that particular estate and by reason of the giving of that guarantee a substantial and large-scale development of that area resulted. That particular loan was paid off in a short while and the guarantee discharged. There has been no other case of a similar character.  An application would only be considered in connection with a project of that particular magnitude involving the opening up of a large area and the investment of capital in roads, sewers and the like.  Only in those circumstances would I be prepared to entertain an application under these Acts, but to deal with the particular point made by Senator Douglas I have merely to say that the financing of house purchase is not involved.  It is not possible to use the powers of these Acts for the purpose of making advances for house purchase.</P>

      <P>By an Act passed in 1926, a Tariff Commission was established. That commission operated for some years, but it is no longer serving a useful purpose.  No reference to it has been made for over five years.  The Act of 1926 was so phrased that the commission must be kept in existence so long as the Act itself is on the Statute Book.  It was not an Act to enable the Government to set up a commission; it required the Government to set up a commission even though there was no obligation on the Government to utilise the commission when established. It is desired to bring that situation to an end by the repeal of that Act which will permit of some saving in public funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLoughlin Mr. McLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us a first-rate introduction and a very brief summary of the Bill.  The Minister for Finance in the Dáil was much more eloquent.  He told us that this Bill is necessary because the functions of the Tariff Commission have been transferred to the Prices Commission, which now serves both as a Tariff and a Prices Commission.  It has also been stated that the Prices Commission is so overwhelmed with work in consequence of the London Agreement that it will take three years to complete the investigation of over 100 applications from British manufacturers to review the tariffs which have been imposed by this country on their goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would have thought that with this tremendous congestion of work in the office of the Prices Commission the Government would have made use of the Tariff Commission to relieve the pressure and, instead of abolishing it, have given it additional powers. Instead of this Bill for its abolition, we should have had a Bill giving powers to the Tariff Commission to investigate the complaints of any citizen or manufacturer who felt that any tariff was unfair or injurious to his business.  As <Col N="1082" /> far as I understand it, the situation will be that an Irish manufacturer with a grievance will have to take his place in the queue and wait for three years until the complaints of the British manufacturers are investigated.  But, apparently, the Government never had any use for the Tariff Commission. They never allowed it to function and, thus, the Minister for Finance could tell the Dáil that the commission had been doing nothing since 1932 and that, on the grounds of economy alone, he felt constrained to abolish it.  Three thousand additional civil servants having been put on the pay roll during the past seven years, the Government is now going to economise by reducing the number by three &mdash; the three Tariff Commissioners.  This is, I presume, the first instalment in the now famous £2,000,000 reduction, which we were promised.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister, no tariffs are imposed until they are fully examined and discussed, first by the Department of Industry and Commerce and then, by the Government.  We frequently hear, too, that tariffs are imposed for the sole purpose of developing and fostering Irish industry, and the Minister informed the Dáil during the debate on this Bill that there has been such a careful planning of industry by the Government that each industry fits into the other like a mosaic.  Of course, the Minister is accustomed to look at things through the rose-tinted glasses of the artist but, if he viewed them through the more prosaic optics of the ordinary businessman or manufacturer he would find that his mosaic was neither as well planned nor as artistic as he seems to imagine. I can give the Minister more than one example of tariffs which have been imposed during the past seven years which, instead of helping the promotion of Irish industry, have retarded it.  I can give him examples of tariffs put on goods which are not manufactured nor intended to be manufactured in this country at all, and for which no Irish manufacturer ever asked.  The only possible reason for their imposition is to increase revenue.  One of the results of these tariffs is the anomaly of the Minister raking in 40 per cent. duty on the raw material of a certain article <Col N="1083" /> which is allowed to be imported as a finished product at 30 per cent. duty.</P>
    <P>Taxing the raw materials of the native manufacturer to the tune of 40 per cent., and allowing in the finished product of the foreigner at 10 per cent. less, is a rather curious method of helping Irish industry.  Of course, this is not a Rip Van Winkle policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLoughlin Mr. McLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the policy under which this is done can be described only in the picturesque language of the Minister for Finance as the mosaic policy.  The material on which this 40 per cent. duty is imposed cannot be procured here, as Irish manufacturers cannot make it, except at a loss and, consequently, do not want to make it.  No such tariff would be allowed on such material if a tariff commission were properly functioning. But when the Tariff Commission is deliberately put out of action no attention whatever is given to the incidence of tariffs on established industries or to the fact that the finished product of one industry is the raw material of another.  Irish manufacturers are thus penalised, and when they complain their complaints are not listened to by the Government that claims to exercise a paternal care over all Irish industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently the Government are only concerned about new industries at the opening of which golden keys and addresses of welcome are presented. Scant consideration is given to old-established industries, industries established without any pomp or ceremony and carried on by their proprietors with their own capital before the promotion of industries became patriotically fashionable.  Some of these industries are compelled to pay prices for their raw materials from 33 to 40 per cent. over the prices prevailing in Northern Ireland and Great Britain for the same materials &mdash; thus completely crippling their export trade.  This is being done despite ministerial guarantees, specifically given in this House and in the Dáil, <Col N="1084" /> that the prices of these raw materials would, quality and quantity, be the same as the prices charged in Britain. Yet, when manufacturers drew the Minister's attention to the fact that these guarantees were not being carried out, and that no slight, but gross, profiteering was taking place, no attention whatever was given to their complaint.  In fact, their communication, backed up with irrefutable proof of the profiteering, was not even acknowledged.  The profiteering was allowed to go on and to hamper these manufacturers in their competition for an export trade which we are told the Government is so anxious to encourage and which is so essential for the success of any industry.</P>
    <P>Instead of encouraging old established industries trying to do an export trade, the Government treats them like step-children.  They have no place in the ministerial mosaic, and their only hope of obtaining fairplay is in my opinion through an impartial tariff commission.  A real live tariff commission was never more necessary than to-day.  There is plenty of work for it and it would be welcomed by every business man in the country as a greater safeguard against exploitation than an already overburdened and congested tribunal like the Prices Commission. Accordingly, I submit that instead of abolishing the Tariff Commission, the proper course for a Government claiming to be anxious for what they call a balanced economy, is to retain the Tariff Commission and to-extend its powers.  I am, therefore, opposed to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to offer a few remarks on this Bill without attempting to range over the whole-field of economics.  The Minister has had my views so often that I think it is not necessary to do so.  I have seen no reason, in the light of what has happened in the last few years, to change my views in any way.  I am deeply apprehensive of his whole policy.  I hope that he will not say that it is because I am prejudiced or because I do not want to see Irish industry flourish.  I do not see how his present policy can fail to have adverse <Col N="1085" /> reactions on agriculture, if the raw materials of agriculture and the requirements of the agricultural producer are increased in cost, as they must be, by the present policy.  I feel that it is a great mistake to abolish an instrument of such great potentialities as the Tariff Commission.  The fact that the Government have not used it is no reason why they should not use it.  I think it is most unfair to those who may come after them, if anybody ever does, to put upon them the obligation of reintroducing this legislation, should they find it necessary to do so.</P>
      <P>I suppose one of the reasons why it is being abolished is that certain charges are entailed by the continuance of this body.  I take it the members are still paid and that it is desired to save on their salaries.  I think, however, that it might be provided that so long as they are not being used, no payment need be made.  I believe it is a great mistake to take these powers completely off the Statute Book.  I can give one instance &mdash; there may be many others &mdash; where ignoring the advice of the Tariff Commission has led, I think the House will agree, to rather disastrous results.  That was in the case of the bacon industry.  In the Report of the Prices Commission on the bacon industry we read that the Tariff Commission's Report, which was made on the 27th May, 1932, did not contain a provision for the imposition of a protective duty.  We know that the Government imposed a protective duty with all the disastrous results which we read of in that report of the Prices Commission.  I am very much opposed to the abolition of this body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>We have still rights left, however the Minister may try to intimidate us.  Of course, it is understandable that the Minister must shout as loudly for his policy as he is able. He must convince everybody that it is right, whatever evidence he may see to the contrary or whatever evidence is obvious to those of us who keep our eyes open and look around.  I remember that when the proposition was first made for the setting up of this Tariff Commission, I did not like tariffs.  I like them less now.  I shall <Col N="1086" /> make this concession to the Minister that, if you want to have a particular industry for the production of a commodity for which there is a potential market, where there are certain raw materials available and so on, I suppose we must have tariffs, but what we should first try to understand is whether there are reasonable possibilities for the success of the industry before we start constructing an institution that later on will not be able to stand.  The Minister has put through a certain policy and what does he tell us here to-day?  He tells us, with regard to boot factories, that there are a great many people who feel now that we have too many boot factories in the country.  If you ask the people who are wearing boots down the country what they think about the boots, and the price paid for them, you will come to realise why many of the owners of these boot factories to-day are very perturbed about the future.  People are only buying just where they must.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech on the previous Bill made a statement to which we all subscribe.  None of us wants to see Irish capital invested in Irish enterprise lost.  We recognise, of course, that you cannot get people to invest capital in an enterprise without some hope of its paying a dividend.  Nobody is expected to do that but the farmer. He is the one who is expected to put his capital into an enterprise and nobody will bother, certainly not the industrialist and evidently not the Minister, whether the farmer can get a return from his capital or not.  While the Minister earlier has said that economic development in this country in his view is dependent on the success of our industrial policy, I say that the contrary is the fact, that the economic development of this country is contingent on the success of its agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I say, further, that when you make your agricultural industry successful you will be able to see how far it can subscribe to the maintenance <Col N="1087" /> of uneconomic industries.  The first thing we must do is to have an agricultural industry that is able to stand that.  That is not the position with agriculture to-day.  The Minister's Party and the Minister's policy have made their contribution to its present debilitated position.  We are not going into that because there is no point in going back on these things.  The fact is that we have the effects of that policy. Flowing from that, you have the position, as I argued earlier, that you invite people to subscribe capital to get industries started without a proper examination of all the circumstances and conditions.  You have the position alluded to by Senator McLoughlin in which a tariff is put on the raw material of industries started some time ago, that tariff altering the whole complexion of the problem which faced these industries when first established.  All this is going on side by side with conditions in agriculture which are the worst in the memory of most of the people living on the industry to-day. While that is so, the Minister has convinced himself as to his own policy and he has so silenced his followers that, even when they know that that policy is wrong, they are afraid to speak out. According to the Minister, we must pin our faith to the industrial scheme of the Government.  He admits that the Government is so involved in it that the fate and the future of the Government depend on how far they can make their industrial policy a success.  They are so involved in the establishment of many of these industries that, if they fail, the Government could not claim to have succeeded.  The Minister knows what the prospects are for some of its own schemes &mdash; the industrial alcohol scheme, for instance, in which £500,000 have been invested.  Somebody has, I think, interrupted from the Government Benches that that was for agriculture. I shall not be as rash in my description of the interruption as the Minister and some of his supporters would be.  If the Government wanted to spend £500,000 on agriculture, there are very few agriculturists who could not give them advice as to how it could be better spent.  It may be that a few people got hold of the Minister and <Col N="1088" /> induced him to put up these factories because they might give a fillip to a type of development that is uneconomic, from the point of view of agriculture. If potatoes can only be produced to sell at 30/- or 35/- or, perhaps, 25/-, you will not have a prosperous agriculture.  Anybody who knows anything about the growing of potatoes from year to year knows that you will have nothing but poverty and misery if potatoes are raised to yield only 25/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only answering the Fianna Fáil interrupter, who said the factories were established in the interests of agriculture.  The Minister at times whistles to keep up his courage.  A great many of his industries are passing through very trying times, not because of any criticism, but because of the conditions inherent in our history, population, planning capacity and the debilitated condition of agriculture.  None of us wants to see capital invested in Irish enterprise lost but, if you want to ensure that capital will not be lost, you must be much more discriminating with regard to the type of industries you are going to establish here.  What is going to happen to the capital invested in the surplus boot factories?  At the end of May, the quota on boots is coming off.  The whole problem is to be reviewed by the Prices Commission, and the Minister knows much better than I do the state of alarm in which the boot industry is at present.  He knows that some of the biggest boot factories are working only half-time and that some of them are working less than half-time.  That shows, despite anything the Minister or the Minister for Finance may say, that there has been no proper planning and no proper effort to discover what the consuming capacity of our people is.  It shows that there has been no proper effort to investigate the possible output of these factories.  The Minister had all these powers of restriction and restraint and he has gone on and on.  Now, we are going to have surplus capital invested in that particular type of industry. That sort of thing will do irreparable <Col N="1089" /> damage to other people with, perhaps, quite good schemes who put their stock on the market and ask Irish investors to take it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may be pardoned for attempting to look at the other side of the picture. We are not so stupid as supporters of the Minister allege.  I am not sure that the Minister himself did not make some reference to our effort to go into the position.  We are more concerned about the success of these industries than the Minister gives us credit for.  I am quite convinced that it is a sign of nothing but racial decadence to try to build up industries which, ultimately, can only fail.  If we cannot do better than that I do not know how our nation or race is going to live at all.  There must be some great fault or inherent weakness in our people if that be the position. We should understand our weakness, and if the Minister is banking on the growing power and strength of the nation to build up industry, he may as well have it brought home to him at once that there can be no success for industry until he puts agriculture in a stronger position than it is.  Agriculture was, perhaps, weak when he came into office.  The Government did everything to make it weaker.  They took its market away and said that they were delighted that it disappeared.  The other day, in the Dáil, the Taoiseach argued in defence of his policy that it was quite conceivable that we might actually have to go to war if our foreign markets for our surplus produce were closed on us.  Compare that with the argument advanced a short time ago.  Our agricultural industry is in a very depressed condition.  It was bad when Fianna Fáil came in, but they have considerably worsened it.  The Minister led in the attack on it and he continues to pile up the burden without any effort to bring in relief.  I pointed out on the other Bill what the Minister was doing to give credit facilities to the industrialist which he would not give to the agriculturist. We may be abused.  The Minister may attempt to intimidate us and, in a slick kind of way, try to make us appear silly, but we know our own <Col N="1090" /> farms and our own soil.  We know the condition of the people and we are quite convinced that their standard of living is much lower than it would have been if this mad policy of the Minister had not been carried so far. We go further and say that there would be greater success eventually for the Minister and his policy if he had gone more slowly.  He would have built up much more cautiously and on more certain foundations, and he would not have stirred up the antagonisms that he has stirred up among his own supporters as well as among the supporters of other Parties.  But the Minister's supporters will not say that. They would get short shrift if they did, and it does not appear as if many others were prepared to say it either.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston pointed out the consequences of a certain monopoly with regard to a particular trade in the country.  Senator Quirke will remember that, when the Pigs and Bacon Bill was going through, we pointed out the dangers and risks in the Minister's scheme, hut we did not get our way. There is no great pleasure to any decent-minded individual in coming in and saying, &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;  I get no pleasure whatever out of it.  Ireland would be a much better place for all of us if there were a fair crack of the whip all round and if it were recognised and admitted that those of us who differ from the Minister have some sense and honesty and a desire to do what is beneficial.  The Minister wants co-operation, but it must always be on his own conditions.  We have to reject everything in which we believe and swallow his nostrum, to find later that it is poison for all of us.  I do not think that there is wisdom in what the Minister is asking the House to do.  I am convinced that, for the future, a go-slow policy, with a more exhaustive and careful examination of the possibilities of industries and what is involved in their establishment, would be much better for the country.  It would be much better for the Minister, too, because, in the last analysis, if his industries go down, he will have great difficulty in rescuing his reputation from the ruins brought about by his rashness and excessive enthusiasm.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to inflict myself on the House a second time, but I notice always that when I speak the Minister for Industry and Commerce excels himself in the eloquence of his reply.  I look forward with some interest to his reply to my less eloquent speech.  The general attitude of myself and other Independent members of this House is that we do not care a hoot which Party governs the State, so long as it is reasonably well governed.  If I were to take up definitely a partisan attitude to the Minister's policy in this and in other matters, instead of speaking up and saying what I think, I would be doing the Minister a real disservice by remaining silent and allowing him to continue in his way without criticism of the kind I give.  I find it necessary to speak even with the hope, if you like, of the Minister learning something from my remarks that may enable him to prolong his own political life and even the period of office of his Party.  With regard to the proposed abolition of the Tariff Commission I do not like it.  I would dislike it less if a particular recommendation of the Banking Commission Report was likely to be carried out, that is the recommendation in paragraph 376:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the monetary authority should take the necessary steps to establish a research department which would not only provide it... with the information necessary for the execution of its own monetary tasks and the giving of reasoned advice to the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In paragraph 352 they point out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...it is clear that important measures with a very distinct bearing on currency and credit have been introduced in the Free State without any thorough examination of their wider implications from a monetary point of view...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>For example</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...the pledging of Government credit for the pursuit of the land settlement and housing policies, or <Col N="1092" /> the various interventions in the structure of costs and prices....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The commission, in particular, refers to the kind of interference which it would be the duty of the Tariff Commission to investigate, from the point of view of national welfare as a whole, including monetary and credit reactions. If I had any assurance that a research department, associated with the Currency Commission or its successor in title, would undertake work of the kind hitherto capable of being done by the Tariff Commission, or if there were a great expansion of that particular kind of work, I would be inclined to agree offhand to the abolition of the present Tariff Commission. The Tariff Commission, whatever it may have been in fact during the last four or five years, has been always in theory a possible machine for investigating proposed new tariffs, not only from the point of view of the particular interest affected by the imposition of tariffs, but from the point of view of the general economic situation in the country as a whole, and its investigations would take place before either the State or private interests had undertaken financial commitments that would prejudice the matter once they had been undertaken.  In other words, the Tariff Commission was in a position, with reference to the proposed infant industries, to make what might be called a pre-natal examination of proposed infantile industries, so as to ensure that nothing but lusty industrial infants would be born, which would grow in due course to be a credit and a source of real economic wealth to the nation.</P>
    <P>The Prices Commission in its functions is not organised to provide that-kind of necessary pre-natal advice. On the contrary, its functions are more in the nature of supplying postmortem examinations after the industry has overreached itself, or its success in fleecing the consumer has given rise to such complaints that an appeal is made to the Prices Commission to investigate charges of profiteering.  In my view, the Prices Commission does not supply a service-of the same desirable kind as the <Col N="1093" /> Tariff Commission was capable of supplying. It has been urged elsewhere that in the period in which the Tariff Commission was operating, which was more or less from 1926 to 1931, industrial development scarcely took place, and that, in fact, industrial stagnation was the rule.  I had the curiosity to look up the report of the Census of Industrial Production on that matter, and it appears that between 1926 and 1931 the net output of industries increased from £23,000,000 to £25,500,000 and the personnel engaged in industries from 102,000 to 110,000.  The returns in the subsequent period from 1931 to 1936 showed that the net output of industries increased from £25,500,000 to nearly £34,000,000 and the personnel engaged from 110,000 to 154,000.  The facts remain that during the early period, 1926 to 1931, there was a slow but sure industrial expansion and, in my view, that slow, gradual expansion of industry had in it the promise of greater permanence and prosperity, more so than the flatulent expansion that took place since 1932.  If we examine more closely the elements that constitute the sum of £8,000,000 increase since 1932, we find that in the case of sugar the net output is something in the region of £1,000,000 in 1936, whereas it was only £32,000 in 1931. The net output of nearly £1,000,000 in the case of sugar is an entirely artificial creation, and the result of rigid restrictions on imports.  If the sugar produced by the sugar industry were valued at world prices that value would be deflated by something like £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>If you make the necessary adjustments you will find that there is much wind and water even in the officially reported net output which took place in the years since the Tariff Commission ceased to operate.  My objection is to the whole method by which the Minister imposes tariffs, and gives industrial privileges.  On that point, I may say that when I spoke of monopoly dangers, I spoke rather loosely of industrial privileges in general, of which monopoly is only a particular case.  My objection to the whole procedure of the Minister, in his hit or miss methods of imposing tariffs, is <Col N="1094" /> that no guarantee is provided that the national economic welfare will be taken into consideration with reference to the tariffs which he imposes.  His attention is concentrated too much on the circumstances of a particular industry, or locality, and not enough on the general economic situation in the nation as a whole.  He sometimes twits Senator Baxter with irrelevance, when he speaks in reference to the agricultural situation, and maintains that his measures have as little to do with the agricultural situation as they have with to-morrow's weather.  In fact, Senator Baxter is the sounder economist of the two.  Anyone who knows anything about economics knows that you cannot touch the economic situation anywhere without affecting it elsewhere. Everything the Minister does in his limited Departmental outlook has most unforeseen and sometimes most disastrous reactions on other parts of the country, and especially on agriculture, which are beyond his imagination or power to understand.  Hit or miss tariffs involve certain dislocation of an existing production economy in relation to an existing consumption economy in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>That sounds a big phrase, but I will try to make it a little more clear.  In my view, one aspect of a sound credit situation is that there should be such adjustment between consumption economy as a whole and production economy as a whole, that all production facilities &mdash; all reasonably efficient &mdash; capital and labour are in full employment, and that everything which proceeds from the productive mechanism should achieve complete consumption. In such a case there is adjustment between the production economy as a whole, and the consumption economy as a whole, and the final absorption of the output of the mechanism is the ultimate guarantee of the soundness of that credit situation.  Violent disturbance in the way of tariff changes and quota changes disturb that adjustment between the production economy and the consumption economy, and are liable to have most unforeseen results, not only in the immediate limited field, but on the national position and on the credit position of the nation as a whole. <Col N="1095" /> You may, by a stroke of the pen, wipe out all imports of foreign bacon, but you cannot guarantee that the disposition of consumers, with regard to the expenditure of their incomes, will be such as to produce a desirable adjustment between the new production economy with reference to bacon and the new consumption economy.</P>
    <P>What do we find in fact happened with reference to bacon? Whereas in 1929 the people of this country consumed 734,000 cwts. of bacon, since 1932, when the imports of foreign bacon were absolutely wiped out, the consumption of bacon at home fell to 573,000 cwts.  The unexpected fall in the consumption of bacon apparently necessitated the expanding of exports, which took place to a considerable extent at the expense of the native consumers and native tax-payers. These violent dislocations of the production economy may disrupt consumption production relationships, and may have effects on the general credit of the nation which are unforeseen, but there are other aspects of the credit situation that can be more easily appreciated.  From the point of view of people outside our country, the credit of a nation, in the long run, depends on such an adjustment between costs and prices in the nation concerned and other nations as will enable the nation in question to maintain a suitable volume of exports.  Only by maintaining a suitable volume of exports can such a people build up those external short-term assets which are the immediate guarantee of the stability of the national currency, or a kind of cushion on which it may rest during temporary dislocation or shock. In the long run, anything which undermines export capacity is liable to undermine national credit and even threaten the stability of the nation's currency.</P>
    <P>The effect of a tariff policy on national credit and on the stability of the national currency is not sufficiently realised.  Australia in the years preceding 1930 maintained a policy of encouraging the import of capital, while at the same time maintaining high tariffs.  The effect of these persistently-maintained <Col N="1096" /> high tariffs was to create a situation in which the Australian pound, although nominally equal to the pound sterling, no longer bought a representative parcel of goods in Australia of the same weight as the English pound bought in England &mdash; in other words, the real purchasing power of the Australian monetary unit was depreciated mainly in consequence of what had happened previous to 1930.  The fact that the Australian currency was on a par with the pound sterling did not indicate its real purchasing power. It may be said, of course, that that kind of thing cannot happen here, and it is perfectly true that the cushion, so to speak, that guards us here is very much more substantial than the cushion with regard to Australia and so on.  For instance, there is, I believe, some £66,000,000 of sterling assets here which affords a guarantee of our currency.  At the same time, if there should be a long-continued position in this country by which prices are artificially raised in consequence of tariff policies and so on, and if the situation exists for a long period of time during which the Irish pound, as a result of these kinds of measures, will not be able to buy the same typical representative parcel of goods as the English pound, then the time will surely come when, in one way or another, you will be faced with currency devaluation or depreciation. That happened in Australia.  In our case it will take a longer time.</P>

      <P>It has everything to do with tariffs.  I am pointing out what the effect of such a policy has been in other countries with regard to the monetary system, and I am referring to the report of the Banking Commission with regard to the monetary situation.  Now, in our case, we are not likely to fall from stability of currency as soon as Australia and New Zealand fell, because as I say, of our large volume of external reserves, but if the general tendency of things is such that we are falling at any rate, then the only difference in the long run will he the difference between falling <Col N="1097" /> out of the 20th storey of a building or out of the second storey of a building &mdash; we being somewhere near the top storey&mdash;and I suppose that, in the meanwhile, the optimists may congratulate themselves that nothing has happened to them so far.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be excessively alarmist on this matter, but I do want to insist that a tariff policy, among other points of view, should be considered from the point of view of monetary policy and credit in every sense of the term, and it would give me the greatest hope and confidence if I could be assured that the particular recommendation of the Banking Commission with regard to the setting up of a research department could be carried into effect for the fulfilment of functions that the Tariff Commission would not be available to fulfil.  In general, I am not a defeatist on the economic future of this country, although in other ways I sympathise with many of Senator Baxter's views. I think that the best guarantee we have of our ultimate survival is the fact that we have been able to survive so well the onslaught of the Minister and his colleagues during the last five or six years, and if we have been able to stand that, I think we can stand anything.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Now, Senator Fitzgerald is asking the question that Senator McLoughlin should have asked.  Clearly, those who have spoken on this matter so far did not trouble to find out for themselves what were the functions of the Tariff Commission which is being abolished by this Bill. I think Senator McLoughlin said that the Tariff Commission was a safeguard against exploitation.  It had no such function.</P>

      <P>The Senator, of course, wants to get out of his difficulty by asking that question.  The Tariff Commission, which we are abolishing by this Bill, ceased to exist, as a matter of fact, quite some time ago, and it will be formally interred by this Bill, but the fact remains that it had none of the powers of doing the things which Senator McLoughlin has attributed to that commission.  That commission had no powers except that the Minister for Finance for the time being received an application and accepted that application and sent it on for consideration by the Tariff Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, at any rate, the point I have to make is that if a person has a complaint to make he does not have to wait for the Prices Commission to deal with it.  If it is a matter of tariff adjustment, prices investigation, or anything of that nature about which an Irish manufacturer has a complaint to make, there is adequate power to deal with that without having to go to the Prices Commission.  The Prices Commission deals with what it is asked to deal with by the Government.  It has no initiatory powers, but it has powers to deal with matters that are sent to it. The old Tariff Commission had no initiatory power.  It had no such function at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

      <P>I think somebody must have been pulling Senator Baxter's leg.  However, I shall deal with Senator Johnston's point in a few moments.  I could not follow him very well.  He got into deep water in which, I am afraid, I cannot swim.  In the meantime, however, I want to inform Senator McLoughlin that the Tariff Commission proved to be an unmitigated nuisance, that it could do nothing and that it has long since ceased to be operative.  There can be no question of transferring powers from a body that had no powers, and I must say that the restoration of that body is very unlikely.  Certainly its restoration is very unlikely, even with such very limited functions as it had. In answer to Senator Sir John Keane's point, I can only say that if any succeeding Government want to resurrect that body they will have to introduce another Bill.  I see no reason for continuing such a body with a new staff costing, perhaps, £2,000 or £3,000 a year, merely because of the possibility that some future Government might want to restore it.  If some future Government should want to restore that body they can pass an Act for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> Senator Johnston asked for an assurance that a research institution, such as the Banking Commission recommended, should be established, and I understood him to say that, if we did intend to establish such an institution, his concern about abolishing the Tariff Commission would be much less. I can give no such assurance.  I am afraid that the Senator has a very child-like faith in commissions, but I can assure him that commissions are very fallible and that they often make most grievous mistakes.  You cannot safeguard yourself against the possibility of error by setting up a commission. Everything that Senator Johnston said, however, seemed to lead inevitably to a recommendation that a commission should be established.  He read one paragraph, which I remember, of the Banking Commission Report, regarding the bearing that legislation might have on costs and prices, and so on, to the effect that legislation had been introduced here, including land and housing policies, without any thorough examination of their wider implications from a monetary point of view, or without due regard to the reactions on prices and conditions generally.  I admit that I was pleased with certain paragraphs in the Report of the Banking Commission, but there were other paragraphs that irritated me and that I should like to burn, and particularly that paragraph.  They had no right to assume that no consideration had been given to these aspects of the matter, and I think it was damned cheek on their part to set down that paragraph.  Of course, what they meant was that we did not come along and ask a couple of bankers for their views on the matter; but, certainly, they should not have said that we did not give due consideration to these aspects of the matter.  I do not think Senator Johnston did much to support his case for the setting up of a new commission in quoting that particular paragraph.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>What I suggested was that the Currency Commission should have a research department associated with it which would deal with this matter from certain points of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot express an opinion on that matter at all.  If Senator Johnston has got the idea that some such research department will never again make a mistake in any aspect of monetary policy I think he is living in &ldquo;a fool's paradise.&rdquo;  An investigation can produce facts.  Senator Sir John Keane mentioned that the Tariff Commission, in its report on bacon, did not recommend a tariff on bacon.  They did not.  Neither did they recommend a tariff against it, because they were instructed by me not to.  The Tariff Commission Act of 1926 provided for the setting up of a Tariff Commission for the purpose of carrying out an investigation into certain specified things, but there was nothing in the Act which empowered the commission to make a recommendation. In fact, I remember complaining in the Dáil, when in opposition, that the Tariff Commission had not merely made recommendations but had made a report.  They stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As we are not recommending a tariff we do not think it is necessary to deal with this aspect of the matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I contended that they had acted illegally and had failed in their statutory duty when they submitted that kind of a report on a tariff application to the Dáil.  I urged then that it was not the function of that particular Tariff Commission to make any recommendations but merely to ascertain the facts and to publish them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I became Minister for Industry and Commerce the Tariff Commission was about to submit a report to me on bacon.  I said to them it was their duty to report the facts and not to make recommendations on the facts, because I hold it is for the Government to come to a decision on the facts as presented. The function of any bureau or of any research body is primarily to ascertain the facts, but decisions on policy must be taken by the Government. The Government have to stand over their decisions and cannot shift their responsibility by referring to the <Col N="1104" /> report of some commission.  Commissions are as liable to error as any body of Ministers.  It would be utterly foolish to put upon commissions the responsibility of determining policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

The <Col N="1105" /> fact that in the case I referred to they not only made recommendations but wrote a report around them meant, in my opinion, that they had departed altogether from their statutory duty.

      <P>One of the criticisms that might have been advanced on this Bill and that has not been advanced is this: why was not the Tariff Commission abolished a long time ago?  The description of &ldquo;hit and miss tariffs&rdquo; is completely inaccurate.  You have to approach this question of a tariff policy from one angle or the other.  You have got either to proceed on the assumption that Irish industry needs protection and should get it unless a case can be made against it, or else proceed from the opposite point of view that free trade is the ideal arrangement: that no industry should get protection, and that there should be no infringement of the policy of free trade unless an over-whelming case can be made for it&mdash;the tariff policy of our predecessors was a free trade policy&mdash;that there must be no variation of the free trade policy unless the Tariff Commission, after a long, solemn examination of the whole position, recommend the contrary to the Government.  Our predecessors proceeded to act on that principle. They never imposed a tariff unless they were forced into doing so by a report from the Tariff Commission after an investigation carried out over a long period of years.  They assumed that free trade was the best policy until the contrary was shown.  We reversed that position entirely.  We assumed that protection for Irish industry, and for its development, was good for the country, and, consequently, we operated what can be conveniently called a protectionist policy.  In every case in which a tariff was imposed it was kept in operation unless and until it was shown that the national interest would be better served by the contrary procedure. That is why the Tariff Commission <Col N="1106" /> ceased to serve any real purpose once this Government came into office.  The Prices Commission took its place.  This is a body whose powers and functions are fully in accord with Government policy.  It has got the job of recommending a reduction in tariffs if it thinks that the circumstances warrant it, or an alteration in the basis on which protection is afforded to any particular industry if, for instance, it thinks an industry is making excessive profits due to the absence of reasonable competition or any other cause.  The whole framework of the Prices Commission Act assumes the maintenance of a tariff policy modified only to the extent that the Prices Commission recommends after due investigation. Clearly the particular body which we are dealing with here serves no useful purpose in present circumstances, and, therefore, it is high time that we should abolish it.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the time for the completion of houses for which grants may be made to private persons and public utility societies under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 to 1937, and to extend the rating provisions of Section 10 (1) (b) of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, to houses in urban areas affected by grants under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it may be helpful to the Seanad if I place before the House somewhat detailed particulars concerning the moneys made available to private persons and public utility societies since the passing of the Act <Col N="1107" /> of 1932, together with particulars of the housing operations carried out by such agencies with the aid of grants.</P>
    <P>The Housing Act of 1932 provided a sum of £700,000 for the making of grants to private persons and public utility societies towards the erection and reconstruction of houses within a period ending 31st March, 1935.  Before that date had arrived it became clear that the sum was inadequate and that the demands for such grants were far from being met.  It was decided to provide further moneys, and an additional £700,000 was provided under the Housing Act of 1934.  The date of completion was extended to the 31st March, 1937, but towards the end of 1935 it was again clear that additional moneys would have to be provided.  By an Act passed on the 3rd April, 1936, and another Act passed on the 3rd July of the same year the sum originally provided for these grants was raised to £2,800,000, ultimately increased to £3,500,000 by the Housing and Labourers Act passed in December, 1937.  It will thus be seen that over each of the five separate Housing Acts from 1932 to the present date the sum of £700,000 has been provided for the allocation of grants to private persons and public utility societies.</P>
    <P>It may not be inappropriate to outline the progress over the period from 1932 to, say, the 31st May, 1936, and from 1932 to the 1st of last month.</P>
    <P>Taking the period 1932 to the 31st May, 1936, a sum of £2,100,000 had been provided under three Housing Acts (1932, 1934, and April, 1936).  On that date the sum allocated was £2,007,702 in respect of over 38,000 houses, of which 22,000 houses were to be erected and 16,000 reconstructed.</P>
    <P>The number of houses actually provided and the number of houses reconstructed as at the 31st May, 1936, were as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Over the whole period (1932 to 1st February, 1939) the allocations were as follows:&mdash;36 per cent. to reconstruction of existing houses; 20 per cent. to the erection of new houses in urban areas; and 44 per cent. to the erection of new houses in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The necessity for the introduction of the present Bill arises from the fact that the period for the completion of the works in order to qualify for grants expires at the end of the present month.  The Bill does not contain any proposal to vary the existing rates of grants, or to provide additional moneys.  The sum which remains unallocated amounted on the  <Col N="1109" /> 1st of last month to £390,000, and seems adequate to meet allocations up to the autumn, at any rate.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points to which I may refer.  When speaking on the Housing Bill, which became law on the 3rd April, 1936, I mentioned that the largest proportion of the amount provided for grants for new houses in urban areas went to the City of Dublin and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, and that there did not seem to be the same need for a continuance of grants in urban centres that existed in rural areas.  I indicated that the position was being reviewed and, on the occasion of the second Housing Bill, which became law on the 3rd July, 1936, the floor area of houses in urban areas was reduced from 1,250 square feet to 800 square feet.  The object of the reduction was to secure the provision of houses for letting to the working classes.  This aim, however was not achieved as it has been found that most of the houses provided in urban areas are, in fact, erected for sale.  Up to the 1st ultimo, out of 10,354 houses erected in urban areas, only 3,092 were provided in the urban portions of the country outside Dublin City, Dun Laoghaire Borough and Howth urban district.</P>
    <P>The growing demands on the Exchequer taken with definite statements made to me by builders that the grant for the urban areas was of little consequence, left us no other option but to discontinue such grants and, accordingly, under the Act of 1937 the period for the completion of houses in urban areas was fixed as the 1st October, 1938.  The grants for such houses may have been said to have been then definitely withdrawn but, in consideration of numerous representations made to me in respect of houses which were not completed but were almost completed at the 1st October, 1938, the Government decided to grant a further extension in respect of these houses.  This Bill in Section 2 (d) provides that these houses will be eligible for grants if they are completed not later than the 1st proximo.</P>
    <P>The second matter to which I wish to draw attention is the date 1942 in <Col N="1110" /> Section 2 (b) (i) in respect of houses completed by public utility societies in urban areas <i>for letting.</i>  Hitherto it had been usual to provide for a year's extension, i.e., from one year to another.  The section is not extensively availed of, but the time limit of one year is somewhat embarrassing.  Negotiations in relation to such schemes may be carried on over a lengthy period and in consideration of all the circumstances a three-years period for completion of the works is now being provided.</P>
    <P>Section 3, which deals with the remission of rates, is a section in effect to remove doubts.  Under the Act of 1932 the partial remission of rates for seven years in respect of houses erected with the aid of grants in urban areas was authorised.  A new paragraph (k) was, in effect, substituted by the Housing (Amendment) (No. 2) Act of 1936 for paragraph (b) of Section 5 (1) of the 1932 Act.  Houses built under the latter section came within the remission, and the question arose whether houses built under paragraph (k) had the same benefit.  The section is considered desirable to clear up the matter.</P>
    <P>As the houses affected by outstanding approvals number over 15,000, none of which can be completed by the end of this month, it will be appreciated that it was essential to introduce this Bill in order that the statutory date for completion might be extended so that grants could be paid in respect of works at present in progress.</P>
    <P>It may be mentioned that of the £3,500,000 provided under the five Housing Acts previously referred to for the purpose of making grants to private persons and public utility societies, the sum which had been actually paid on the 1st ultimo was £2,475,405.  Disregarding the moneys yet unallocated, it will be seen that a sum of over £600,000 still remains to be disbursed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters to which I would like to refer on this Bill.  I do not agree that it is right that a grant should be stopped at this stage in urban areas because without giving a subsidy in urban areas <Col N="1111" /> building will cease entirely, as it has almost ceased at the moment.  I would strongly appeal to the Minister to extend the time in urban areas to the same limit as for rural areas.  If that is not possible, I would then request that it be extended in cases where approval certificates had already been issued.  I have in mind a number of houses in Galway City which were started some time ago and in which certificates of approval were issued and for some reason or another, which the Minister probably understands, the houses have not been completed and will not be completed before the 30th April this year.</P>
      <P>The reason for the hold-up, in a great many cases, is the lack of water and sewerage, and particularly in those cases I would seriously ask the Minister to consider extending the time for urban areas.  I have in mind another few cases where people of very limited means have taken advantage of the Act and have received the first instalment of the grant but, through financial difficulties, they are not in a position to complete the houses.  I know one particular case where a workingman undertook the building of a house for himself.  He has already received half the grant, but if he has not the house completed before the 1st April next not alone will he lose the other half but the danger is, if the Minister wishes, that he may have to refund the portion of the grant he has already received.  I think that would be very bad if it happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking generally on housing, I believe that the picture that the Minister has presented is not exactly a true picture in so far as it does not give us details of the number of houses built in rural or urban areas, because we have, as we know, more house building by the Land Commission and by Gaeltacht grants.  If the Minister totalled these up, the number of houses built would greatly exceed the total he mentioned.  Speaking about the houses built by the Gaeltacht services and the Land Commission, I think that if we are going to tackle seriously the question of houses <Col N="1112" /> either in urban or rural areas we will have to co-ordinate our schemes.  I have very limited experience as secretary of a utility society and I know there are cases in rural areas where people are anxious to avail themselves of the housing grants and they also require a loan from the Land Commission. This means that those houses are to be inspected by inspectors from the Land Commission and the Local Government Department. If we had co-ordination of those services, only one inspection would be necessary.  The same thing applies in the Gaeltacht services.</P>
    <P>I remember reading a statement of the Minister in the other House, not on the last occasion, but on the occasion when he introduced the original Bill, that is, when he gave notice of his intention in 1937 to stop the grants in urban areas.  He stated that grants were being stopped because other facilities were being made available in the way of loans and reconstruction grants that would be more useful.  A number of public authorities have availed themselves of their powers to issue loans under the Small Dwellings Acts.  In some places it has been very successful and in others not so successful. I think that if we are going to make any attempt at all to tackle this housing question in a serious manner, we will have to make funds available for a tenant purchase scheme, and I think that if we adopted something on the lines of the Federal Housing Administration scheme adopted in the United States it would be the cheapest and most easily managed scheme.  I do not believe in administering loans or funds through local authorities.  I think it is not the best method.  If we can encourage private enterprise and public utility societies, we will get a better and more satisfactory type of house and the responsibility of the local authorities will not be so great.  I think that if we leave the clearing of the slum areas to the local authorities they will have quite sufficient to do in attending to that problem, without having responsibility for the provision of houses for the better-class people, who, in some cases, can afford to lay down a fairly good deposit or make <Col N="1113" /> some contribution towards the purchase of the house.</P>
    <P>There are, as I said, some things in this Bill with which I am not in agreement. The first one is the stoppage of the grant in urban areas.  One of the centres which I have in mind is the City of Galway, and in taking a review of the position a few days ago I found only one house in the course of erection.  It seems doubtful if that house will be even completed in time to receive this grant.  We are also to lose the remission of rates attached to the former grant.  That is very serious and I suggest it is a position which we should seriously consider before we impose such a heavy burden on anybody taking up the provision of houses in urban areas.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the original Bill in the Dáil, the Minister referred to the position of houses built by public utility societies for letting in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.  That section means that in order that public utility societies would get these facilities the public authority would also have to contribute portion of the grant.  I am not sure if that has happened in a particular case, but I doubt very much if any public authority will be prepared to make any contribution to a utility society for the purpose of building houses to let.  I do not know if it has happened in any case up to the present.</P>
    <P>Another serious objection which I have to the Bill or to the amendment is that it proposes to curtail the floor area of new houses.  I agree that no house should be built with less than 500 square feet of floor space, but I think that it is a bad thing to restrict the size of the house.  We heard here on another occasion that this restriction had led to a very serious position in Dublin City.  Senator Mrs. Concannon suggested that she was informed by people in the Labour movement that it had led to the position that maids were not being kept in houses as originally because the accommodation in the newly-erected houses was rather limited and there was not what we might describe as a maid's room in the house.  It was <Col N="1114" /> even suggested that on account of that it would be necessary to erect hostels for maids.  That is a fact.</P>
    <P>I know of a few cases in which this restriction has led to an abuse of the Bill or of certain parts of it.  Some people who built houses found out when they were completed that the area was too large for them to receive a grant. In some cases the floor area was 1,250 square feet, and in order to receive the £40 or £45 grant they converted one room into a shop or office.  If we look around the country we find that we have a number of shops and offices of no use whatever.  I would seriously ask the Minister to reconsider this question of floor area.  I would agree that 500 square feet should be the minimum, but I think there should be no restriction on the size of the house.  As I said, my chief interest in this Bill is because of my knowledge of the work of a public utility society, and at the present moment there are about 30 houses. That would mean £1,200 or £1,400 of a loss in Galway City alone.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to reconsider the question of extending the time in urban areas to at least the same time as is allowed in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I have just one more suggestion to make.  In reading the debates in the other House, I observed that the Minister stated that he intends next autumn to bring in another Housing Bill which, I understand, will cover the whole range of housing activities. There is just one consideration that I should like him to bear in mind when he is drafting that Bill.  I have met cases in rural areas where the housing conditions are much worse than one would find in slum areas in the city. There are certain villages, particularly in Galway, in which the housing conditions are just as bad, if not worse, than they are in slum areas in the city. In such cases a grant of £80 is not sufficient.  The occupiers of these houses have no means of getting a loan because the Land Commission or any other body will not give them a loan as their assets do not provide sufficient security.  In some of these cases we have given additional grants out of the funds accumulated by our society.  I <Col N="1115" /> would suggest to the Minister that in the new Bill, which is being drafted, a section might be introduced providing for grants of a greater amount in such cases than those given to the ordinary applicant on a certificate given by the county medical officer of health and the officer administering the Act.  I think if both of these officers certified that the conditions in particular cases called for special consideration, if, for instance, any of the members of the family were suffering from tuberculosis or any other disease, a greater grant could be given.  I think that the new Bill might be made more elastic in that way.  I would again urge on the Minister the advisability of extending the time in urban areas and also the deletion of that portion of the Bill providing for a floor space of 800 feet.  If that cannot be done, if a person has received a certificate of approval from the Department, he should receive the grant as if he had completed the building before the Act expires.</P>

      <P>Tá sé deanach anois, agus ní maith liom móran cainnte do dhéanamh faoi an mBille seo.  I think we should be all in favour of the extension of the time for qualifying for housing grants. Houses are badly needed, in the city particularly.  There is a great slump at the present time in house building in the city.  At the Dublin Corporation last night, we had a deputation from the Dublin Trades Council asking that building operations should be speeded up.  The idea at present is to endeavour as far as possible to build houses with home-manufactured materials.  Our builders have had some experience of obtaining supplies of the requisite materials, such as ironwork and ranges, from local manufacturers and they have made no complaint as to the quality of these materials.  Since it is now so late, there is no need to stress the matter further.  I presume the Bill will be unanimously approved of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has had its origin in the fact that many requests were made to me recently in <Col N="1116" /> the Dáil to extend the period of time for the payment of grants in urban areas.  In 1936, when introducing the Housing Bill of that year, I gave notice that it was my intention at a certain time to drop grants in urban areas.  Later, in 1937, I repeated that warning.  Subsequently, I gave notice that the grants in urban areas would cease on the 30th of last September. They did actually cease, but at that time there were a number of houses&mdash; I think a great number in Dublin; the figure we have got for the whole country so far is about 260&mdash;which had been almost completed, but which were not so complete, according to the officers charged with inspecting them, that the grants could be paid.  These 260 houses were deprived of grants with some others which, if the time were extended somewhat, could be brought within a reasonable measure of fulfilling the obligations necessary for a grant.  All these representations were put up by utility societies, and by members of the Dáil of all Parties who asked that the time should be extended.  It is to comply with these requests from societies and from members of the Dáil that the present Bill was introduced.  These remarks apply to the principal part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of the Bill relates to the giving of a remission of rates by the local authorities.  It was suggested to me, when bringing in this Bill, that there was some ambiguity in the minds of builders as to whether the remission of rates was still in operation or not.  I thought it well to clear the matter up, and I put in a section of the Bill announcing to anybody interested that the remission of rates provided for in the previous Acts is still operative.  Senator Hawkins is not here now, but I should like him to know that there is no present intention, so far as I am concerned, to carry the grants in urban areas beyond the dates set out in the Bill.  I think anybody looking up the figures relating to house-building in urban areas will see that the grant does not appear to have played a very important rôle in encouraging people to build houses in urban areas.  There were a good many houses build in <Col N="1117" /> Dublin City, in Dun Laoghaire Borough and in Howth area and the grants were paid, of course, in all these cases.  A small number of houses were built in urban areas by private persons and public utility societies in other parts of the country, but the vast bulk were built in Dublin County Borough, Dun Laoghaire Borough or in the Howth urban area. Even in these areas I was informed by some builders who had built many of these houses that the grant paid to them in connection with the building of these houses was not an important factor to encourage them to build. Seeing that the grant was not so widely availed of in urban areas, and that money is not so easily got, it was my recommendation to the Government to drop the subsidy in urban areas and to continue it in the rural areas.  That policy we intend to carry out.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins referred to the work of local authorities in providing houses and to the work done under the Gaeltacht Acts.  This Bill does not deal with either of these matters.  It has no relation to house-building under the Gaeltacht Acts in Gaeltacht areas and no relation to houses built by local authorities.  For the information of Senator Hawkins also, I should say that even though the subsidy ceases the remission of rates does not cease.  Local authorities have helped in Dublin City, in two cases, private societies which have erected dwellings for letting.  The local authorities have given the grants that are allowed under the 1932 Act, and the Acts that followed it, and they have helped in that way these benevolent societies to erect these dwellings.  I am sorry that greater use has not been made of this section of the Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins suggests that we should not have any limit so far as floor space is concerned.  I think, on consideration, he would realise that that would carry us a very long way and that the difficulties encountered in the end would be much greater than they are at present.  After all, our primary work here is to encourage the building of houses for the working <Col N="1118" /> classes, and if we leave out a limit as to floor space, grants will be given to persons who do not need them at all.</P>

      <P>I do not think that there is the slightest chance of getting from the Government grants for rural areas more generous than are given in the present Act.  I have often made the statement, and I have frequently asked for a contradiction of it, if it could be contradicted, that the grants under the 1932 Act, whether in urban or rural areas, given to local authorities were more generous than were given in any other part of the world.  I do not think that in present circumstances, with money as tight as it is, there is any likelihood of their being increased.</P>

      <P>I move the motion on the Order Paper in the name of Senator Byrne and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that the Government should introduce proposals for legislation with a view to amendment of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts as follows&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to provide that all widows and orphans derive equal benefits statutorily;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  to provide that widows resident in rural areas receive benefits <Col N="1119" /> similar to those resident in urban areas; and</P>
    <P>(c)  the omission of the &ldquo;contributory&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-contributory&rdquo; provisions.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that this motion is being taken so late and I do not intend to delay the House very long.  I would appeal very strongly to Senators on behalf of what I consider the most deserving class in this country&mdash;the widows and the orphans.  These are people who have been left without their breadwinners.  That is bad enough, but it is much worse when they are left in straitened circumstances. I appreciate what has been done by the Government in introducing the previous Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill.  That was a step in the right direction.  But the Bill, in so far as widows and orphans resident in rural areas are concerned, did not go far enough.  Even in the cities and towns, there was reason for complaint in certain places but not to the extent that exists in the case of widows and orphans residing in the rural areas.  I refer to the widows of cottage tenants, rural workers and small farmers.  I should like members of the Seanad to realise, as I am sure those from rural areas already realise, that the small farmer is a worker and a hard worker. To make ends meet, he has to work very hard and, if he happens to die, his widow, if the valuation of the holding is over £8, gets no help. Picture that poor woman trying to live in these circumstances, with a large family depending upon her.  One of the blessings the poor generally have is a large family.  She is not in a position to employ a man to work the farm for her and she is not able to work it herself.  Therefore, I hold that that widow of a small farmer is as badly circumstanced as the widow of the ordinary labourer.  In fact, she is sometimes worse off.  Therefore, I ask the Seanad to recommend this motion to the Government.  I believe that a Government that has gone so far in this direction will go all the way and treat the widows, whether they reside in Balbriggan, Mayo, Kerry or Cork on an equal level.  I <Col N="1120" /> do not, of course, include widows of means&mdash;widows who have been left house property or who have an income which would exceed the present allowance. I refer only to widows in the position I have described.</P>
    <P>The present Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act is good up to a point. But, unfortunately, under the contributory pension scheme there is a distinction made between the widow of an agricultural worker and the widow of any other worker.  That is a terrible shame.  In the pamphlet sent out from the Minister's Department giving the amount to be paid to the widow of a worker, a clause says: &ldquo;Provided she is not the widow of an agricultural worker.&rdquo;  I think it is a pity that that distinction is made.  On the other hand, people are being encouraged to remain in the rural areas.  The Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act extends no encouragement in that direction, because a widow residing in a rural area is not as well treated as a widow residing in a city.  If we were really serious in encouraging people to remain in the rural areas, the least we could do would be to give widows the same treatment. When the orphans of widows in the country grow up, they will be workers in the rural areas.  Instead of that, they are given every encouragement, under present legislation, to move into the towns and, particularly, the cities. There are widows in the rural areas whose pensions are cut down as low as 1/- and 2/-, whereas, if they were residing in the city, they would get, at least, 7/6.  That is most unfair.  There is, then, the case of the widow who is under a certain age and who does not happen to have any dependents.  She gets no pension at all, which is unjust. Consider the case of a person who gets married young and who has her family reared when she loses the bread-winner. She has no dependent and she may be in bad health.  She is not provided for at all under present legislation. It is wrong, therefore, to call the statute the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act because it does not apply to every widow.  Some people say they are provided for.  I have here proof that they are not provided for.  In the rural portion of County Dublin, you had <Col N="1121" /> 171 non-contributory widows in December last, when we put down this motion, who had to be assisted from the local rates.  Is not that a terrible shame? Before any person can get poor law assistance, the relieving officer must be satisfied, from week to week, that he or she is destitute.  Otherwise, he cannot give assistance.  He himself is accountable to the auditor.  In Balbriggan area, there were 20 of these cases; in Lusk, 18; in Swords, 20; in Dunlaoghaire rural district, 62, and in Blackrock and Stillorgan, 33.  Taking all the rural districts, the total was 171.  Is it not hard that a poor person should have to go to two sources to get what is barely sufficient to keep body and soul together?  If proof were needed in support of my case, I think it would be furnished by that fact &mdash; that there are 171 widows in one county in receipt of non-contributory pensions so destitute that they must get assistance from the relieving officers from week to week.  That argument should satisfy the Minister that there is need for equal treatment.  As regards the others, we have only 13&mdash;that is to say, 171 non-contributory and 13 others. That is my reason for putting this motion forward.  These people would get 7/6 from one source and they would have to go to another source to get 2/6 or, in some cases, 3/-.  That is why I ask the Seanad to pass this motion and recommend it to the Minister. What the relieving officer gives is only what he is satisfied is sufficient for food. He does not take into consideration clothing and boots.  There was a reference to school books in this motion, but I am glad that, in the meantime, the responsible Minister has come to the assistance of these poor people.</P>
    <P>It is proof of what a great measure the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill was and how much in sympathy the Irish people were with it that there was not a dissentient to its passing amongst any Party in the Dáil. Whether inside or outside the Oireachtas, nobody could be found to say that it was wrong to pass such a Bill, though the Labour Party complained that it did not go far enough.  Otherwise it was unanimously received.  That <Col N="1122" /> is proof that if the Minister could see his way to treat all widows alike, he would have the approval of every fair-minded person in the nation.  Some of these non-contributory widows are very badly treated.  I should like to refer to one case.  A widow of an agricultural labourer was in receipt of 5/-, widow's pension, and this letter was sent out from the Minister's Department to her on the 15th October, 1938:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to the non-contributory pension payable to you under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, I am directed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to inform you that, as a result of our investigation, it has been decided that your net weekly means, as calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Act, amounts to 5/4.  As this sum exceeds the rate of pension (5/- per week) to which you would be entitled if you had no weekly means, you cease to be entitled to a pension as from the 31st October, 1938.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That widow had a son who worked for a farmer last summer and, because her means were taken into consideration for that period, she cannot get back her pension now.  Apparently, the means test stands for 12 months.  Her plot of ground is calculated at 9d. per week, though the poor lady was not able to work it at all.  If a plot of ground attached to a labourer's cottage at Blanchardstown is worth 9d. per week, Senator Counihan must be one of the wealthiest persons in the country. Working out the matter in proportion, the people who have big farms must be extremely wealthy.  When the Old Age Pensions Act was brought into force&mdash;it was not brought in by a native Government&mdash;no distinction was made between the pensioners.  Whether they were living in Connemara or Dublin, they got 5/- per week.  More people are leaving the rural areas at present than ever left before in our time and that is another reason why we should give the residents of the rural areas, at least, as much as those residing in the cities, if not more.</P>
    <P>Certainly, if I had anything to do with it I would give more.  If we are <Col N="1123" /> really determined and sincere we should give more.  I am sorry the Minister is not here, as there was another case that I wanted to bring to his notice, concerning the widows of British ex-servicemen. There are hundreds of these in this country, and because their husbands got into bad health fighting for the freedom of small nations, and got small pensions, their widows cannot come under the contributory scheme here.  Many of them are in bad circumstances.  A great case can be made to the people they served so that these widows should not be left destitute.  Many widows of ex-servicemen are being subsidised at the expense of the ratepayers of the City and County of Dublin.  That is no great credit to the mighty nation they fought for.  These women are neglected.  They do not come under the contributory scheme owing to the fact that their husbands were not working, and the pensions they had ceased at the husband's death.  There was a case of a widow on a holding in Mayo who, though she had no means, was offered the mighty sum of one shilling a week as a pension.  It would be hard to expect her to take a shilling when, if she moved to a room in Dublin, she would get 7/6.</P>
    <P>My principal reason in bringing forward this motion is to encourage the people to stay on the land.  It does not matter how prosperous the cities are, if the young people leave the land there is no hope for this nation.  Most Rev. Dr. Browne, Bishop of Galway, pointed out recently that the real strength and wealth of a country, its human beings, were disappearing at a rapid rate.  He said that if the position was not changed, the next century would see the extinction of people on the land.  That statement of an eminent scholar supports my appeal on behalf of the widows and orphans. There is every inducement to leave the rural parts and to come to the cities.  It was also stated in Galway that the number of school-going children had gone down by almost 2,000 in ten years.  I appeal to the lady members of this House to support <Col N="1124" /> this motion because the cause I advocate is a just one.  We should at least give equal treatment and thus help to keep people in the rural districts.</P>

      <P>I ask the proposer and seconder of the motion to withdraw it, for the simple reason that it must be obvious it is not feasible or workable. I am sorry the Minister is not here to deal with it.  I understood the Labour motion would be taken first, and that this one would follow.  I informed the Minister accordingly.  He had left when Senator Tunney moved the motion.  I am sure that the Minister would oppose it.  Senator Tunney gave various reasons for his proposal, and if it could be worked, it would appear that all the widows and orphans in the country, regardless of their circumstances, would be given pensions. Possibly Senator Tunney would have a parade and a couple of bands outside Leinster House in favour of it.  We would all like to follow Senator Tunney into the lovely &ldquo;Valley of Avillon, where falls not hail, nor rain, nor any snow.&rdquo;  I suggest that he should get into touch with the Rip Van Winkle Party which has at least in common with him the policy of keeping people on the land.  He should see what could be done to keep people on the land, and maybe when the new Party takes the field the means test could be abolished.  Of course, if the test is abolished in connection with widows' and orphans' pensions, it must also be abolished in connection with old age pensions, and with regard to people who have substantial incomes of £200 or £300 a year and who may be driving in Rolls Royces to draw the widows' and orphans' pension or the old age pension.  I would be surprised if Senators were serious about pushing the motion as it stands. I would be terribly disappointed if they were.  In the name of common-sense, I ask them to withdraw it and, if necessary, at a later date to put forward a motion worded on lines that would suit the situation which exists. <Col N="1125" /> I understand if this motion were accepted it would mean the revolutionising of the whole policy of widows' and orphans' pensions, and old age pensions, and that it would cost the State the fabulous sum of something like £750,000 or £760,000 per annum.</P>

      <P>I understood that Senator Quirke said that Senator Tunney wanted all widows and orphans to get pensions.  What is wrong in the suggestion that the case of widows with from £100 to £2,000 should be considered?  I agree that the motion is loosely drawn, and that several things could be read into it, but we must take it in conjunction with the statement made by the mover.  He made it perfectly clear that he wants certain alterations made in the present legislation.  He pointed out defects that want remedying.  Anyone who knows the operation of the present legislation knows that remedies are needed and that these cannot be removed by administration alone, but would require legislation.  These remedies come under two or three heads.  Take the case of a widow between 30 and 40 years old and who has two or three young children. What is there inherent in her case that would not entitle her to a pension? Has she not the same responsibility and the same burden as a widow of another age?  Is there any reason why the case of the first widow should not get consideration?  I do not know of any reason.  I am sure Senator Quirke will agree that that type of case deserves consideration, and that <Col N="1126" /> is the type for which Senator Tunney made the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion clearly points out that all widows and orphans should be provided with equal benefits, provided they comply with certain conditions. I never intended that widows with £200 or £300 would be looking for the widows' and orphans' pension.  I am opposed to such people getting pensions as long as there are poor people in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Tunney has made the point clear.  I wish to point out that a widow of a certain age has as much responsibility in respect to her children, as a widow who is qualified to receive the pension, inasmuch as her breadwinner is gone, and she has no support.  The local authority has the same responsibility towards a woman who is not qualified for the pension, as one of more mature years.  I think that a case has been made by Senator Tunney, and that he has tightened up the terms of his motion by his statement. Let us take up the means test. It is evident that the manner in which the means are ascertained is open to question.  I disagree with the statement that a woman who has £200 or £300 should be asked to draw on that until it is spent, and that she can then get the widows' pension.  If a few hundred pounds have been saved by scraping, these people should not be asked to draw on it, and perhaps be in great want when it is gone.  The manner in which means are calculated is open to examination.  Where will five per cent. be got at present on invested money?  That is what is taken by the authorities in respect of the first £250 of a widow's capital.  They say that she can get five per cent. on the first £250 invested, and 10 per cent. on anything beyond that.  Senator Quirke has <Col N="1127" /> experience of business, and he knows something about finance, but I think he will agree that that return will not be got on such an investment.  Therefore, the manner in which pensions are granted on the means test is open to investigation.  There are contributory and non-contributory conditions.  The non-contributory pensioners will be dropping out, as the contributory method comes more into operation. There is no reason why that distinction should be made between widows who have contributed towards the scheme, by way of national health insurance, and those who did not.</P>
      <P>The fact that a man was paying into the National Health Insurance Fund does not mean that his widow was any the poorer when he departed this life than the widow of a man who was not paying into it.  Take the case of a poor woman who is left with a few children in a side street in the town or in a cottage on the side of a country road whose husband was not paying national health insurance&mdash;let him be the local tailor or the local carpenter or anything else.  Surely that man's widow is entitled to get as much consideration as the widow of a man who was paying into the national health insurance?  We always agreed that the amount paid was not at all adequate.  It is entirely inadequate, in the first place, to meet anything like the demands that a woman with a couple of children would have to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We think that this whole thing requires examination.  I am in entire agreement with the motion as amplified by Senator Tunney's statement. All these things require examination, and I say that if it would only require the expenditure of £150,000 the Government should immediately jump to it and provide that money.  If that is the only burden which would be put on the taxpayer I think it would be very well recompensed by taking a large number of these poor women out of the degradation of having to live on the rates.  When people have to live on the rates or on home assistance or poor law relief, notwithstanding anything you may say, <Col N="1128" /> that carries a certain amount of degradation, and it is for that reason that I ask that this motion should get consideration from the Government. With Senator Tunney, I regret that we have not the advantage of having the Minister for Local Government and Public Health with us to express his own views and the views of the Government on this matter.  I am perfectly certain that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is sympathetic towards the reconsideration of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.  I believe that the Government also is sympathetic, because anybody who has examined that Act can see that there are certain defects which cannot be removed through administration alone, and that it is necessary, therefore, to introduce proposals for legislation.</P>

      <P>It seems to me, Sir, that the proposer of this motion wants the motion to be amended, and Senator Hogan seems to want to talk about it as if it were already amended.  Now, according to paragraph (a) this means that the Government should introduce proposals to amend the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts in order to provide that all widows and orphans derive equal benefits statutorily.  That could mean that orphans should derive the same benefits as widows, or else that anybody who is a widow and an orphan would derive equal benefits according to the statute.  Now, I understand that the proposer of the motion does not want that, and the supporter, Senator Hogan, has carefully indicated that he is not speaking to this <Col N="1129" /> motion but to one which he presumes has been amended by the remarks made by Senator Tunney.  It seems to me that what we are asked to do here is to say that we, the Seanad, ask the Government to change the law under the terms of (a), (b) and (c), as set forth in the motion, but the proposer and supporter of the motion seem not to be clear as to what should be the proper wording, or the proper course to be followed, and I therefore suggest that an amendment should be proposed to the motion before we consider it further, or that the motion should be withdrawn until it could be more properly worded.</P>

I am quite sure, as Senator Hogan has suggested, that the Minister would be more than anxious to do anything he could for the widows and orphans of the country.  I myself believe that there is room for improvement in the Bill in connection with certain cases, but as this motion as it stands before us now is not a proper motion, or not properly worded, I would ask <Col N="1130" /> that it should be withdrawn and that another motion should be put in later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Senators have taken the view they have taken on this motion.  It may not be properly worded but, after all, this is my first motion before the Seanad. I am honest enough to admit that it is not worded in the proper legal phrases, but as far as I am concerned I shall try in a couple of words to make Senators understand what I mean, and if they once understood what I mean, it should be comparatively easy to have the motion properly drafted.  My idea is that if a widow is a non-contributory widow, the highest amount she can receive in a rural area, within the law, is 5/- a week; that is, if she is non-contributory and resides outside the City of Dublin, and in a rural area, the highest amount she can get is 5/-.  If she is contributory, she can receive as high as 8/-.  Now, my point is that a widow in Dublin who is contributory can receive 8/- or 10/-a week, and I say&mdash;and I would like Senator Quirke to bear this in mind&mdash; that not alone is that good, but that in certain cases it is even lavish.  My reason for saying that is that I can give at least one case of a woman who was married for seven months and then lost her husband.  She holds a position in which she is earning £3 10s. 0d. a week.  After the husband's death, she goes home to reside with her mother and she comes back to her position, at £3 10s. 0d. per week, and gets a pension of 10/- a week.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister would give consideration to such a case.  Not alone that, but even if that particular woman should happen to win £30,000 in the sweepstakes&mdash;her name in the papers and all that&mdash;she would still be entitled to draw her 10/- a week.  I think that my case is a very just case, and that if there is any question of a means test it should apply to the contributory people also.  As far as the contributory people are concerned there is absolutely no means test.  They could be publicly owning £10,000 or much more and still could get their pensions according to law.  Yet here <Col N="1131" /> you have the case of a poor farmer's wife who, because she has 5/-, cannot get it.  I admit that my motion is not worded properly, but I am trying to make my case as plain as I can.  I know that the Minister is a Christian and sympathetic man, and I also feel that if this Seanad would be generous enough to make this recommendation the Minister would take up the case and bring in an amendment that would satisfy every member of the Seanad because the case is so just and reasonable.  Of course, if I could help it, I would like to have preferential treatment for the widow and orphan residing in a rural area.  Senator Fitzgerald has said that I am looking for equal pensions for widows and orphans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not say that.  What I said was that as the motion is worded it would mean that all widows and orphans would get equal pensions.</P>

      <P>Well, a circular sent out by the Department regarding the rates of orphans' contributory pensions says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the parent in respect of whose insurance the pension is payable was normally engaged in non-agricultural employment, the rate of contributory pension is 7/6 a week. Where the parent was normally engaged in agricultural employment, the rate is 6/- a week.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to that, the man who remains in agriculture is not being fair to his children or to his widow, if he should die.  I should like Senator Fitzgerald to understand what I mean there.  I mean that where the person was engaged in agricultural employment the rate is 6/- a week, and where the employment was non-agricultural the rate is 7/6 a week.  I hope the Senator understands what I have in mind.  I am not advocating pensions for widows who have means.  I am satisfied that there are very few of them.  I am concerned with cases, however, such as Senator Byrne and other Senators must be aware of, in Galway and other such places, where people <Col N="1132" /> who have small holdings of land are left, as a result of the death of the father, with a large weak family, so to speak, and who are in very bad circumstances, and if their valuation was increased by a certain amount they could not get a pension at all.  I am quite sure that there is not a Senator here who would not support this motion.  It may not be properly worded, but I would appeal to Senators to pass the motion.  I have no doubt that the Minister is charitable&mdash;he has proved himself to be so&mdash;and if Senators will pass this motion, I am sure the Minister would accept it and put it into the proper words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisMByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to my colleague on this matter that, as Senator Fitzgerald has suggested, we should either bring in an amendment to the motion or withdraw the motion and hand in another one later.  I agree that we could not expect the Seanad to pass this in its present form.  As far as I am concerned, I agree with Senator Tunney that the Act is causing considerable difficulty in rural Ireland owing to this matter of the contributory and non-contributory basis where you have one widow receiving 8/- and another widow beside her drawing 10/-.  I realise that perhaps the financial aspect of the motion would need to be looked into.  The only way now for Senator Tunney is either to withdraw the motion or to adjourn it and have it amended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">

      <P>I think that the House might pass the motion. Senator Tunney has covered very fully in the arguments that he put forward the object that he seeks to achieve in this motion.  Even if we assume that the motion is not worded perfectly, I think it would be no harm to pass it.  The Senator has made an overwhelming case for it.  I imagine that if the Minister for Local Government were here he would not turn it down.  While the motion may have been loosely drawn, I think that Senator Tunney, in his speech, made the object that he has in view quite clear, and I am sure that will be perfectly understood in the Department of Local Government if it be decided <Col N="1133" /> to give legislative effect to what is sought in the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should remember that it is what is written down that this House passes and not elucidations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that if Senator Tunney wants to press the motion now that he should only ask the House to pass Section (b) of it. He seemed to me to make a very good case for that particular clause, especially when he told us that a widow in Dublin with £3 a week can draw a fairly heavy pension, whereas a widow with land in the country, if the valuation of her holding is more than £8, can get nothing.  As far as that is concerned, I agree that some change ought to be made in the law. I gathered from the Senator that he does not want the law changed as proposed in clause (a) of the motion.  In view of that, I do not see how we <Col N="1134" /> could act in so futile a way as to pass a resolution recommending the Government to do something and at the same time tell the Government that nothing could be further from our minds than that they should do the very thing we ask them to do.  I think that the motion should be amended in some way or else withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Senator Tunney would agree to the suggestion made by Senator Byrne, namely, that he should now withdraw the motion, and table it at a later date in an amended form.</P>

      <P>I am agreeable to that course.  May I say, in conclusion, that I am glad Senator Fitzgerald sees my point.</P>
      <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.35 p.m. until Wednesday, 15th March, 1939, at 3 p.m.</P>
