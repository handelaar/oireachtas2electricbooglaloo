      <P>There is one change proposed in the Order of Business for to-day.  It would convenience the Minister for Defence if item No. 6&mdash; the Air Raid Precautions Bill&mdash;were taken after item No. 1.  If that rearrangement be agreed to, the order of business for to-day will be Nos. 1, 6, 2, 3, 4, 5.  I have given permission to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance to attend and be heard on the Second Stage of the Appropriation Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know on what basis the Minister has calculated the yield from the increase in income-tax for a complete year.  I know he will not get a full year's yield in the current financial year.  I have been making a calculation on the basis of a two-ninths increase on the standard rate and, assuming the present yield to continue, he should get over £1,000,000.  That is considerably more than he is budgeting for.  I should like the Minister to comment on that and to say whether he is calculating on a diminishing yield in future years.</P>

      <P>In the present year we expect to get about £660,000.  In a full year we estimate we shall get about £800,000. Normally, by an increase of 1/- in the £ we ought to get £1,000,000 in a full year, but because of the increase in respect of earned-income relief we shall probably only get about £800,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator would not be entitled to assume that at all because one of the reasons which have necessitated the increase in the tax is the fact that the income upon which the tax is assessed under certain schedules&mdash;the income for last year under schedule D, for instance&mdash;in the view of the Revenue Commissioners may show a slight decline.  One of the reasons why the general increase in taxation has been necessary is in order to counteract that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in this section is increasing the standard rate of income-tax by 1/-, making it 2/- greater than the rate he found when he came into office.  Income-tax is usually increased in small doses, for a variety of reasons: from the point of view of the yield and from the point of view of the disturbance to industry and employment, and for various other reasons.  This increase which we are asked to pass now in this particular section is not for the purpose of armaments. I think it is fair to say that <Col N="56" /> from the moment the Minister came into office his policy was a high income-tax. I think he raised it three six-pences&mdash;1/6&mdash;at one go.  This particular rate of 5/6 is not the complete picture.  There is also a 1/6 corporation profits tax after a certain point.</P>
      <P>The idea that income-tax is something which merely taxes the rich, which has no effect at all upon the poor is, I think, entirely erroneous.  The Minister himself is now convinced of that.  After a certain level, income-tax, like other taxes, produces less for the Minister.  He expressed a certain fear of that even this afternoon.  The burden becomes greater, and when it becomes greater it is felt downwards and influences the position of people who pay no income-tax at all.  In this particular instance, this imposition of an extra 1/- follows upon a number of other impositions.  When the Minister came into office, a person with a house in Dublin valued at £24 or £40 paid income-tax, whatever the valuation was, at the rate of 3/6 on five-sixths of his valuation.  Now he will pay income-tax at the rate of 5/6 on five-fourths of his valuation&mdash;a very substantial increase.  Apart from that, rates, not only in Dublin, but all over the country, have increased substantially. I think they have increased by at least one-third, so that a person who paid £1 in rates to a local body, whether a country borough or county council, in 1932, will pay, I think, in this year at least 27/-.  As well as that, the Minister's policy has increased the cost of repairs and decoration to a house. Therefore, any person who owns a house now, big or small, has to pay higher taxes, higher rates, and higher costs for repairs and decorations.  I know in my own particular case, over a period of ten years, the increase for decorating a room is up at least one-third. In addition, the Minister has taken steps in the Dáil to pass a Valuation Bill, which will increase valuations and increase the yield of income-tax to the Minister.  All that has been done at a time when the national income was falling, when our exports were falling, and when the Minister was seeking for a cure for unemployment without any success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> You cannot have all these burdens placed upon the people and at the same time expect that these people will have money to spend for goods and services so as to solve unemployment in the most effective manner.  A person in Dublin who has to pay increased rates, who has to pay increased costs for decoration and repairs, who has to pay increased income-tax and increased costs for everything he buys, cannot possibly spend as much money even in the matter of repairs and decoration to his house.  If you apply that all round, you get, naturally, a marked decrease in employment.</P>
    <P>This tax is not being put on for armaments.  It is the same tax, roughly, as in England, although certain reliefs that are given in England are not given here at all, notably the relief for age.  But the idea that a country of the size of this, of our population, of our national income and of our exports and production generally should have the same income-tax as England is ridiculous.  It is really the greatest possible condemnation of the Minister's policy that he has to charge the same income-tax as a country which is the centre of a vast empire, which has greater national wealth than we have, which has immense trade and immense responsibilities all over the world and which, to fulfil those responsibilities, has the largest navy in the world and is now proceeding, I think, to double it.  We have not a navy at all.  They have an army which they are proceeding to quadruple, I think, right away and they are going to have conscription generally.  They have immense investments abroad and they have a class in England of which there is no counterpart here at all since the landlords had to go consequent upon the Land Acts, a class which has considerable accumulated wealth.  Those people pay income-tax at the same level as the income-tax in this country.  It is not for armaments and I doubt very much if the Minister, even if he had the money, could possibly spend it on armaments in the year that is before us.</P>
    <P>This section shows the result of the Minister's policy over a period of <Col N="58" /> years.  It shows an immense burden upon the community, a burden which will result in decreased spending, decreased employment and some of it will be passed on to the people who are foolish enough to think that those who are better off than themselves are the only people who will have to pay. I think the Minister has discovered and I think his Parliamentary Secretary has proudly declared that there is no reason why the working class should not pay.  The working class will certainly pay some of this.  One would like to hear from the Minister what justification there is for a State of our type having exactly the same income-tax as England considering the lesser responsibility we have; and for what reason the tax is being put on and whether it is not part of a regular policy which has no reference at all to the European situation.  I think myself that this is really part of a policy which the Minister entered upon in 1932 and that the talk about armaments is merely an excuse.  At any rate, it does show that taxation in this country is at a level which is bad for employment and which offers no hope that the problem of unemployment can be solved in this State.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I want to get information rather similar to what I was seeking to get on Section 1.  I take it that the Minister knows the amount of the incomes on which this new tax is levied, that he has found, for the purpose of calculating this tax, the total amount of the incomes between say, £3,000 and £8,000 on which the 10 per cent. addition is to be levied.  I would like to know if the estimate was less than that 10 per cent. because, pursuing this matter, I would suggest that it is open to objections rather different from those that apply to income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the Minister may be gravely disappointed over the yield of this tax.  The person at present with an income of £3,500 a year is going now to pay an additional 10 per cent. <Col N="59" /> on the total tax.  There is nothing easier than for that person to get rid of the additional £500, and thus bring himself down below the level where 10 per cent. increase operates.  Evasion of that kind is perfectly legitimate. We all know that it is going on.  We know that people are every other day transferring part of their incomes for that purpose.  Now, there is suddenly going to be this 10 per cent. tax on incomes of over £3,000 and 15 per cent. on those over £8,000.  I suggest that the Minister is going to stimulate the transfer of large sums by persons with large incomes.  They will transfer part of their incomes either to their descendants or, if they think fit to escape death duties, they will do, as has been done on a large scale in England, give large sums to charity. It is very nice to see those large sums given to charity, but every Minister for Finance knows that it is exceedingly embarrassing to the Exchequer. We know that in this way millions have been given to charity in England so as to escape the payment of estate duty.  All that is very embarrassing to the national finances.  Would the Minister say on what basis he has calculated this increased yield, and whether he has had regard to the great stimulus he is going to give to the perfectly legitimate evasion of taxation which is almost sure to follow from his proposals?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, in case Senator Hayes might have misunderstood my silence on the last section, to say that I was quite prepared to answer.  There are five sections in the Bill dealing with income-tax and surtax, and perhaps it might be as well if I held what I have to say until we came to the last section or reached the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, on the point which is directly <i>ad rem</i> to Section 2 of the Bill, which Senator Sir John Keane has mentioned, I should like to say that to my mind, so far as surtax collectible in the current year is concerned, there is no possibility of evasion.  As the Senator is aware, the incomes upon which the surtax will be <Col N="60" /> assessed have already been determined and, accordingly, it will not be possible for people to dispossess themselves of income in the way the Senator has suggested.  With regard to the future, we cannot speak with the same certainty.  It was a very distinguished statesman who, I think, was at one time Chancellor of the Exchequer, said, in regard to quite another category of operations: &ldquo;The resources of civilisation have not yet been exhausted,&rdquo; and what the British Chancellor has done indicates to us that there are quite a lot of shots in the locker of the Treasury yet so far as tax evaders are concerned.</P>
    <P>I do share personally the apprehensions which the Senator has expressed here.  There is no doubt about it that when our rates of taxation on fixed incomes become heavier people are induced to do things&mdash;perhaps, in some cases, are coerced to do things&mdash;which they themselves would have looked askance at.  There is no doubt that people are distributing their incomes over members of their families and are getting rid of portions of their income by giving them to what may be broadly described as charities. Whether greater public good is being done by placing these sums at the disposal of private committees, of individuals or of trusts, or whether it would not be better to hand them over to the community as a whole, in so far as the Government may represent that community, is a question upon which there may be differences of opinion but I think there is no person, looking at the general trend in regard to these larger incomes, but would say that a case is being built up where Governments and those in charge of public finances may not have to say to themselves &ldquo;We are killing the goose which, up to this, has laid the golden eggs.&rdquo;  Undoubtedly, when incomes, no matter how large they may be, are taxed at such a level at which it would pay a person better to hand the income over to the State, and, as has been said, &ldquo;retain the tax for yourself,&rdquo; than to proceed in the way in which we are now doing: when that stage is reached it becomes a matter for consideration whether we would not have <Col N="61" /> to find some other sources of taxation bearing as heavily upon those who are able to bear taxation at present, and abandon the direct tax upon which, up to the present, we have relied to provide the Treasury with a very large portion of its resources.</P>
    <P>That is, I think, a problem which is engaging the attention not merely of people in Great Britain but of people everywhere.  It is one of the great problems of this age where these large taxable incomes have tended to accrue, and it may be that, as the Senator has pointed out, we have perhaps reached the limit of our ingenuity in regard to those matters.  I am not so certain that we have, but, as I have said, it is a matter for consideration.  However, I have no doubt that if we should decide that these taxes have perhaps reached the limits of their usefulness we may have to try to see whether we cannot devise some other taxes, perhaps, of the same nature but slightly different in their incidence, which would catch some of the income which is going astray.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that at the higher rate the Minister for Finance is getting less than he was getting when the surtax was at a lower rate?  The Minister talks about things that he will discover in the future.  He has had plenty of experience in the past and plenty of figures.  There is a small number of surtax payers.  I am sure the Minister could give us a fair round figure.  Is the actual yield from surtax increasing from year to year? Are we getting in fact more from the people with the higher incomes than we were getting formerly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister is replying would he say if the income-tax payer with an income of between £1,500 and £2,000 pays more here than in Great Britain, if he includes income-tax and surtax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It may happen that an income-tax payer with an income ranging between £1,500 and £2,000 whose income is all earned may pay slightly more than a taxpayer in the same circumstances with the same earned income would pay in Great <Col N="62" /> Britain; but one has got to remember that the yield from taxes upon incomes within various ranges tends to cross up and down the British scale.  Our rates of relief in regard to certain elements&mdash;in regard for example, to the reduced rate relief allowance&mdash;are smaller than the British.  Our normal tax upon the first quota of income, say £100 or £75 income, as the case may be, tends to be at a higher rate. The rate tends to be higher, but our actual yield lower.  The people here with small earned incomes tend to pay less.  As we advance up the scale to the region of £1,000 incomes, we tend to close the breach between our rates and the British rates.  In the range from £1,500 to £2,000, our rate is slightly above the British.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the British supertax begin at £1,500 or £2,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot dissociate the two things.  The total tax upon our incomes here between £1,500 and £2,000 does tend to be slightly above the British scale.  If the Senator would give me a moment, I believe I can give him the exact figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This question is much talked about and possibly the Minister could set it right to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now give the Senator the figures.  Taking the case of a single person whose income is all earned, if he has an income of £200, is single with no dependents or housekeeper or anything else like that, he pays us here £5 10s., while in Great Britain he would pay £5.  Above that, in respect of earned income, a single person will tend to pay generally more. At the surtax limit he would pay £283 5s. 0d. as against £276 12s. 6d. in Great Britain&mdash;that is, where his income is £1,500.  On £2,000 he would pay £433 5s. 0d. here as against £414 2s. 6d. in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>That includes surtax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, this is the total payment.  If he is a single person whose income is all earned, on an income of £3,000 he would pay £750 5s. here as against £751 in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> If his income is £8,000 he would pay £2,908 5s. here as against £3,033 10s. in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The position is quite different when we come to consider married people. Take the case of a married man, without any children, whose income is all earned; again, there is a certain amount of criss-crossing.  If his income were £350, he would pay £8 5s. 0d. here as against £8 6s. 8d. in Great Britain.  If his income were £400 he would pay £13 15s. 0d. here as against £12 12s. 6d. in Great Britain. If his income were £450 he would pay £24 15s. 0d. here as against £23 12s. 6d. in Great Britain.  At £1,500, the married taxpayer here, whose income is all earned, would pay £255 15s. 0d. as against £254 12s. 6d. in Great Britain. If his income were £1,700 he would pay £315 15s. 0d. here as against £309 12s. 6d. in Great Britain.  At £3,000 our taxpayer would pay £730 15s. 0d., while the British taxpayer would pay £729 0s. 0d.  Somewhat above that point our income-tax and surtax tend to be slightly lower&mdash; that is, in the case of married men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really from £1,500 to £3,000 that we are higher?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But even then it is only slightly higher and the figures do not make much difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is in the case of married men without children.  We now come to the most usual case in this country, that of the married taxpayer with two or three children.  I will give the figure now for the married taxpayer with two children, whose income is all earned.  If his income here were £414, he pays nothing here whereas in Great Britain he would pay £2 11s. 9d.  If his income were £431 he would pay 13/9 here and would pay £3 15s. 0d. in Great Britain.  On an income of £440 the amount would be £1 13s. 0d. here and £4 6s. 8d. in Great Britain.  At £500, it would reach £8 5s. 0d. here, in comparison with the British figure of £8 6s. 8d.  At £500, there is a momentary cross, so that, taking the £550 income the amount in Great Britain <Col N="64" /> would be £12 12s. 6d. while the same taxpayer would pay £13 15s. 0d. in this country.  Now, at £600, the taxpayer here would pay £24 15s. 0d. compared with £23 12s. 6d. in Great Britain; at £1,500 the figures would be £222 15s. 0d. compared with the British £221 12s. 6d.  At £1,700, due to the fact that the surtax rates come into force, £282 15s. 0d. would be paid here compared with £276 12s. 6d. in Great Britain.  After that, at £3,000 the position is that whereas the taxpayer pays £696 0s. 0d. in Great Britain he pays £697 15s. 0d. here, but from somewhat above the £3,000 point (about £3,280) up to the top of the scale he would pay less here, very much less on the large incomes.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that, so far as the lower ranges of taxable income are concerned, our scales tend to be more favourable to the taxpayer whose income is all earned.  At the very high rates, even with the additions which we have had to impose in this Budget, the surtax payer here tends to pay much less than in Great Britain, and there are, of course, very good, practical reasons for that.</P>

      <P>The difficulty and the trouble about particular tax systems is that there are cases where the incidence of a tax may fall with greater severity upon one class of individuals than it does upon another.  We cannot simply proceed to tax classes.  We have to impose the taxes on the general mass of the people.  Some people, bearing in mind their own particular circumstances, may be more heavily hit by any system of taxation than others are, but all we can try to do is to do rough justice and equity between the people as a whole.  I am quite prepared to admit the force of what Senator MacDermot has said.  I know cases myself where this bears heavily upon people, but we cannot legislate for these particular cases, as the Senator knows.  I think it is very true to say that hard cases make bad law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator did not, but how are we going to find the trend of the yield from surtax, unless we take some point of reference, and the point of reference which has generally been taken in this respect is the yield of surtax for the year 1931-32, or the year 1930-31&mdash;I am not sure which.  When the yield from surtax was returned at over £700,000, it was quite an abnormal year, as any person who studies the figures for the preceding years will see.  In those years, the yield from surtax was of the order of between £550,000 and £600,000.  In the particular year which is so often cited, the surtax yield exceeded £700,000, and why?  It was due to one abnormal payment in that year, a payment of £180,000 in respect of surtax which had been in dispute for a period of years. There was a slight fall in the yield in the years 1932-33 and in 1933-34 but, in 1934-35, it tended to go up.  If there was a decrease in the years 1932-33 and 1933-34, it was because surtax is levied, not upon the income of the current year and not even upon the income of the preceding year, but upon the income of the year before that again, so that the diminution in the yield in those years was due to the fact that conditions had been deteriorating in the years 1930-31 and 1931-32.</P>

Since 1935, the yield from surtax has been increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It may happen, and is very likely to happen, that, in the present year, the yield from surtax will tend to fall, and certainly next year the yield will tend to fall.  Why? Because there has been a heavy fall in income derived from investments, and investments not made in this country, but made abroad, and the major part of our surtax revenue is derived from those who get their income from investments, and, as I have already said, from investments not made here but made abroad.  It is derived, in fact, I might say, from people who maintain a residence here, who perhaps live three or four months of the year here, and spend the rest of their time abroad; but because they are good enough to maintain a residence here, we are enabled to get a share of their income and surtax.  The main point about it however, is that no argument based on the yield of surtax is a sound argument, if it is held up as a reflex of the economic condition <Col N="69" /> of the country.  The yield from surtax is very largely conditioned by the economic state of countries other than ours.  These people have their moneys invested in many countries. They do not put their eggs in one basket, by any means, and, if we see a fall in the yield of surtax here, it may be, to some extent, a reflection of conditions here, but it is, in a much larger measure, a reflection of the conditions which prevail elsewhere.  If Senators want to make a case against the general policy of the Government they should not base it upon the yield from surtax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say anything about the general policy of the Government except that the general policy of the Government was declared to be that we would get money from the rich to help the poor.  While that is a very good thing to preach off a political platform it is a very difficult policy for the Minister for Finance on which to work.  The Minister has actually increased the standard rate of income-tax.  He has also increased the surtax.  I hold no brief for surtax payers.  Income-tax is a fair tax and should be graded.  Surtax payers are mainly people who have incomes derived from investments abroad.  The kind of person who has a residence here and stays here for three months out of the 12 months, is exactly the kind of person who can pack his bag and go back where he spends the other nine months.  Assume that the Minister is accurate, that he is getting this surtax from the kind of person who lives here for part of the year and whose income does not depend upon this country at all, the time comes when such a person can pack his bag and go and the Exchequer here gets nothing from him.  Having increased the standard rate of surtax is the Minister getting more money year by year?  Let the Minister never mind about the previous Administration.  What I want to know is whether the present rate is giving him a greater yield than we were getting before?  I very much doubt it.  I think the Minister could give us a simple figure for surtax for 1934-35 and for 1935-36.  I am fairly certain that it will be found that the <Col N="70" /> Minister is not actually producing the goods from this particular provision. That is my point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one question I would like to see cleared up. Does the Minister know that on an examination of this problem, no recent statistics are available?  The reports of the Revenue Commissioners are in arrears for even two or three years sometimes.  For that reason we are very much handicapped in criticising these matters and in examining the trends.  Would the Minister look into it and say whether it is possible to expedite these reports?  I do not suggest that the Revenue Commissioners should increase their staffs. But I rather think if that matter were examined in the light of modern statistical machinery, in the light of the machines now used on census work, these reports could be expedited.  These modern statistical machines could be adapted to a lot of laborious calculations that have to be made.  I should think if there was an approach by an up-to-date system of calculation, these labours could be expedited without increasing the staff.  Would the Minister mind my telling him of a case of which I have knowledge&mdash;where a certain expert report was made on the matter of these calculating machines in the Land Commission in reference to the use of this machinery in expediting work and is he aware that the expert reported that he was satisfied that a saving of 50 clerks could be made by the use of these machines and the reply was that they could not get rid of these 50 people here on account of their national record?  I do not want to pursue that but I think the Minister, irrespective of any political reactions caused by a reduction of this staff, should examine this as a business firm would examine it and use the latest mechanical means for getting out statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to a comparison of the taxes&mdash;and I do not want now to make any political point&mdash;we have to bear in mind that the cost of living here is very considerably higher than the cost at the other side.  So that as regards the actual burden on the taxpayer, it <Col N="71" /> is substantially greater not only in the case of necessities but still greater in the case of luxuries and other amenities in the lives of the richer people. That, however, is a matter that I do not want to pursue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of the earlier or prompter publications of the Revenue Commissioners' accounts I wish to say I have had a discussion with the Revenue Commissioners with regard to that matter and I think I can give an undertaking that the arrears in the publication of these reports will be speedily overtaken and that we will have prompter publication in future of these reports.  With regard to the question which Senator Hayes has put to me, I can only give him these figures. The yield from surtax for the year 1929-1930 was £549,000; for the year 1930-1931 the yield was £597,000; for the year 1936-1937 the figure was £545,000, and for 1937-1938 it was £595,000.  Now I think when I come to remember that the years 1927-1928 and 1928-1929 were years of general economic importance, and when we remember that the year 1929 was the year on which we had an economic recess and the slump started to manifest itself, I think the Senator will agree that those figures do not afford any basis for the case made here that, though we have been increasing the rate of tax the yield from the tax has fallen off.  He said it did not even remain stationary.  That is, naturally, one of the reasons.  We have had figures in relation to income tax giving the income upon which the tax is assessed.  These figures show that the amounts upon which the tax is assessed have tended to fall off.  We have, therefore, tried to compensate the Exchequer because of that.  As I have already endeavoured to point out, the yield of income tax is by no means a sort of barometer for the general economic health of the community which Senators and others sometimes tend to assume it is.  I say that because a large part of the income which is assessed for tax here is income derived outside this country.  Naturally, if <Col N="72" /> conditions elsewhere are not good the amount that falls to us for assessment tends to dwindle.  That is a fact that has to be borne in mind when we are trying to draw conclusions from the yield of income tax as to conditions here.  I do not want to be taken as saying that the yield from income tax should not be looked to and regarded seriously when it does fall off.  It may be a manifestation of conditions operating here which may be a different manifestation of increases in ordinary trading conditions within the community.  But there are these two sides to the question.  I can only say that a very certain analysis of the figures should be made before one can arrive at any conclusion and the conclusion I have come to is this&mdash;that our economic conditions here are very largely governed by the conditions in other countries.  That is natural.  We are, taking the community as a whole, a producing concern which has to rely upon its exportable surplus.  If conditions in other countries are not such that they can absorb our exportable surplus at a price profitable to us, naturally, our producers tend to relax their efforts.  In view of that, they have less to sell, the price which they get being lower than they regard as reasonable.  Income from primary production, therefore, tends to fall off. Our primary producers have less to spend upon the products of our manufacturers and the incomes of our merchants tend to decline, as do also the incomes of our manufacturers.  The main governing factor, so far as income tax is concerned, is not the conditions which prevail within our own narrow community but the conditions which prevail in the great, wide world.</P>

I seem to remember an advertisement which stated that there was no reason why unemployment should continue here, that certain people, including the Minister himself, had given consideration to the problem and could solve it. Now, it appears that the Minister cannot solve the problem unless the Englishman solves his problem, the German solves his problem and the American solves his.  I do not think that either statement is quite accurate. The result of the Minister's figures with regard to surtax is that, in spite of having reduced the surtax limit from £2,000 to £1,500 and in spite of having increased the rate, he has got practically no more from it than formerly but he has been extremely successful in obtaining tax from the people with earned incomes up to £1,000 and £1,500.  Apart from the general economic policy, the Minister's scheme for taxing the rich has been a complete failure.  Whether that is due to economic conditions here or outside or to the fact that the Minister had no plan except a plan to get into office, the truth is that he has not succeeded in taxing the rich to help the poor.  He has succeeded in getting a considerable yield from the lower income-tax levels but he has not succeeded in getting anything appreciable from the people with incomes over £1,500 a year.</P>

On the last occasion on which this Bill was before the Seanad, we listened to a very eloquent speech, if I may say so, from Senator McLoughlin in which he ventured to put before the House views which I had put before the Dáil in the year 1929 or 1930.

      <P>No.  The figure tends to be fairly constant.  The point which I noted in respect of some of the figures was that people were tending, for good or ill, to get out of the range of £1,500 to £2,000 and to pass into the higher ranges.  That seems to be the tendency in certain classes. There are, therefore, people whose position does seem to be improving.</P>

      <P>I get a great deal of information from the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;not about individuals but about classes.  I cannot get from the Revenue Commissioners particulars about any individual but I do get every year from the Revenue Commissioners certain information as to the trends which are manifested in certain classes of activity.  One of the things which struck me in connection with figures which I had before me was that the number of taxpayers whose incomes range from £1,500 to £2,000 had been tending to decrease very slightly, but, above £2,000 and up to £3,000, there is a tendency for the numbers to increase, ascribe that to whatever cause you may.  I am dealing only with the point the Senator tried to make here.  With regard to the number of people whose <Col N="76" /> incomes come within the range £1,500 to £2,000, I have already told the Seanad that the total number of taxpayers might be taken to be of the order of 125,000.  The numbers whose incomes come within the range £1,500 to £2,000 is less than 1 per cent. of that figure.  We get about 1,000 within that very narrow, limited range and no person is going to expect the House or the intelligent public to accept the suggestion that, by lowering the surtax limit from £2,000 to £1,500, you are going to decrease the yield from income-tax.</P>

There must have been dissent and division in the Fianna Fáil Party that Senator MacDermot and myself did not know anything about.  If the Minister did not agree with what his colleagues said, they did say freely, frankly and fully all over the place that they could tax the rich to benefit the poor.  The figures the Minister gave us here this evening show that although he lowered the level for surtax, although he increased the rate, he got substantially the same amount of money, if he did get that.  He did not get much more.  His success has been as a tax gatherer and a tax imposer in taxing the people who have earned incomes under £1,500 a year.  He has been a failure in getting more from the people who have more than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word on this section.  Apart altogether from the fact that the alteration which the Minister has seen fit to make in the figures in this section has left the members of the Ministry in the position that they, like Deputies and Senators, or anyhow like Deputies have increased by the amount of £120 the tax-free <Col N="77" /> portion of their own salary&mdash;and that is a fairly substantial figure&mdash;there is another aspect of this question of allowances to which I think the Minister ought to give attention.  The scheme at present in the matter of allowances for children is that no matter how many there are in family the allowance is the same.  I do not think that is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same per child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The same per child.  I do not think that that is as it ought to be.  I think it is unsound from the family point of view.  The position of the family in this State is so vital to our very existence that the first consideration ought to be given to it. The family life in this State to which I think the Minister should exert himself to the fullest to keep intact and to encourage and expand is the type of family where incomes are low and where, in quite a number of cases the number of children is fairly large.  If the costs of living were low, if they were as low as they are in neighbouring countries, the position would not be as difficult as it is to-day.  The Minister surely is not going to argue that it does not profoundly influence the life of a family where there are five or six children, that only the same allowance is made to people with small incomes for the fifth child as for the first.  I think that point of view is all wrong.  I think the point of view which ought to exist and which ought to be encouraged is that the greater the number of children in a home the greater will be the allowance in the form of remission of tax.  We have others advocating that, in relation to the poorer members of our community, consideration will be given to family, allowances and in other countries on the Continent where terrific efforts are being made to-day to propagate the race and to keep it strong and virile and increase the numbers, one of the methods which is being employed is to encourage marriage by giving marriage bounties, and to encourage the families where the numbers of children are greatest.  I do not think there is a country in the world where <Col N="78" /> that sort of encouragement needs to be extended to family life to the same extent as it is required in this country to-day.  This is a country where in the past the numbers in family were not inconsiderable, to say the least of it, and in days like these, when taxation presses so heavily on all members of the community, I think the Minister in his future scheme of family allowances ought to consider that point of view.  Pressed, as apparently he is, in the difficulty of finding money, he is not prepared to do anything except rake in all he can and give as few remissions as possible. I do not think in the end that that is sound.  I think it is very unwise. The Minister ought to see his way in future to give the kind of relief which I am urging.  I do not want now to say any more about it.  I know it is a point of view which is strongly held in the country.  It is not as freely expressed as perhaps it might be, but beyond doubt any consideration that you will give to it will convince you that it is a scheme of taxation which the Minister ought to attempt to adopt here.</P>

      <P>It strikes me that the idea of Section 3, reducing the limits to £220, is to bring in those people who are on the margin.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of many of these people in these towns has undoubtedly worsened in the past few years and many of them who formerly were not under the Act will now come within the terms of it.  I think it is going to be a hardship on them.  I recognise, of course, that income-tax is a fair tax, one of the fairest taxes we have, and that all this talk about taxing the rich for the sake of the poor has, to a great extent, social <Col N="79" /> justification for it.  We, in common with every other country in the world, have to deal with a large unemployment problem.  A considerable number of our people are unable to obtain a livelihood.  Those people have to be supported and the people who are in the fortunate position of being able to make more than a livelihood should, in fairness and justice, contribute to the support of their less fortunate brethren.  None of us likes taxation.  It hits everyone of us.  Direct taxation hits some of us.  Indirect taxation hits others.  I think, on the whole, that those of us who can afford to pay something extra towards the support of those who can afford to pay nothing should be willing to do so. The individual taxpayer, of course, finds it very hard to take the broad view.  We all feel it when we are hit and when we have to pay something extra that we did not have to pay before.  We have to pay more for our luxuries, for our tobacco and other things but, despite that fact, one cannot but be struck with the vast amount of money we are spending, even in this country, on luxury services.  We are spending more in backing horses; we are spending more on pictures and other amusements and although we all realise that the country is not as well off as people would like it to be, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that we are spending far more than we can afford on purely luxury services.  When we hear it said that the country is very badly off and that everybody is badly off, we must face up to the fact that we are spending far more than we can afford to spend in this way. Everyone of us as I have said, resents being taxed as do the smaller taxpayers in regard to some of whom a move is now being made to bring them within the ambit of taxation.  Still, we must realise, as I have already said, that many of us are spending money in ways that we could perhaps avoid.  If we could make up our minds to curtail expenditure in some direction, perhaps it would not be necessary for the Minister for Finance to increase taxation on more of us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might deal with the point which the Senator has raised.  He fears this section because, in his view, it is going to bring within the shadow of the income-tax code the smaller shopkeepers in country towns and villages.  The first thing we have to remember in connection with these income-tax proposals, is that Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 all form part of a general scheme: that Section 3 cannot be considered apart from Section 4.  Section 3 is there because it was necessary to reduce, to some extent, the cost to the Exchequer of a concession which has been given under Section 4.</P>
      <P>I would like Senator Goulding to consider the position of the small shopkeeper, or indeed of the small income earner, whether in town or country, in the light not merely of Section 3 but of Section 4.  Section 4 proposes to provide for an increase in the earned income relief.  Section 3 provides for a reduction in the personal allowance. If we want to see what is going to be the effect of these two sections upon the small income earner, we can take two critical cases.  The first case is that of a single man who has an earned income of £150.  Last year his allowances would have been calculated as follows: His earned income relief, amounting to one-sixth of his total income, would have been £25.  In addition, he would have a personal allowance of £125.  These two allowances amount to £150.  Therefore, since his earned income from all sources did not exceed £150 he would be tax free. His position under our present proposals is as follows: Under Section 4 of this Bill his earned income relief would amount to one-fifth of his income, or to £30.  His personal allowance would have been reduced from £125 to £120, but the sum total of his allowances would have remained as before at £150, so that he would have been no worse off under our present proposals than he was last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next critical case is that of the married man with an income of £270, all earned, and with no dependent children.  Last year his earned income relief would be one-sixth of £270, or £45.  The personal allowance for himself and his wife would have been <Col N="81" /> £225, so that his total allowances would be £270.  Accordingly, he would have paid no income-tax.  This year, not merely will a man with an earned income of £270 pay no income tax, but a married man with an income of £275, all earned and with no dependent children, will not pay any income-tax either, because the position will be that the earned income relief, being one-fifth of £275 or £55, has to be added to the reduced personal allowance of £220, making the total allowances to which this person would be entitled £275.  So that under the scheme that we are proposing now not merely will that married man with an earned income of £270 be no worse off than he was last year, but a person whose income does not exceed £275, and is not less than £270, will be slightly better off than he was last year.</P>

      <P>That will depend on how his income is derived.  If his income is investment income he will be worse off to the extent of the tax on £5, but if he has a pension income he will be in exactly the same position as if his income was earned income, because pensions are regarded for income-tax purposes as being deferred pay on earned income, and as such they get the allowance.</P>

      <P>The purpose of it is to clarify a position which has existed here since 1933-1934.  The section, in fact, brings up to date, and gives statutory authority, for the exemption given by Section 3 of the Finance Act of 1931.  As Senators may remember, at the time that the <Col N="82" /> Finance Act of 1931 was passed, all the surpluses from the sweepstakes went to the hospitals organising the sweep.  Since the passing of the Public Hospitals Acts of 1933 and 1935 all the surpluses are now payable to the Hospitals Trust Board as distinct from the hospitals organising the sweep.  Without the amendment of the law now proposed, the strictly legal position I understand would be that sweepstakes surpluses, in the hands of the organisers or committee of a sweep, would be chargeable to income-tax.  In order to clear up the position and leave no doubt that the surpluses which are now being transferred to the Hospitals Trust Board are free of income-tax, this section is being introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an illustration of the extraordinary tariff policy that we have.  I believe that most of this is elucidation and amelioration.  This section was described as being the section of elucidation: it makes something clear until somebody gets working upon it to make it clearer still&mdash; and then it becomes aggravation.  It resembles the position where you put on a tariff by means of a Bill, and then one by decree and by a Bill afterwards, and then discover that it is not the tariff that was intended, and you set out to give somebody a licence and make a quota or a prohibition, and then nobody knows what the tariff situation is.  It requires constant elucidation, constant change, and constant attention by the staff of the Revenue Commissioners.  It also requires the constant attention of special persons on the staffs of most Dublin firms, who now employ men with nothing else to do but look after the tariff position.  That adds still more to our costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to know what anything precisely means.  Nobody knows what the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his colleague, the <Col N="83" /> Minister for Finance, are doing at a particular moment, except the persons who are directly interested&mdash;and if these are making something out of it they do not squeal.  If something is being done to them they may squeal, but not too loudly, because the Minister may hit them harder some other time.  The result is, that we get about £500,000 more in customs, but we have a substantially bigger staff to collect it.  The situation remains that it is almost impossible to know what is taxed, or how it is taxed, or where it is taxed, or even what it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a case where I am not in complete agreement with my friend, Senator Hayes, because I think that, but for the machinery such as we have in this section, things would be even worse from his point of view, very much worse.  It is essential to any scheme of general tariffs that errors are inevitably found&mdash;even with a Minister as clever as the present one&mdash; in any scheme, because no one knows in regard to any particular tariff exactly how it will work out or what the incidence of it will be, until it is put into effect.  Few people can say what effect it will have on industry or on manufacturers and therefore it is essential that some adjustments should be made from time to time.  However, as far as the general working of tariffs is concerned, from the point of view of the importer, the machinery has now got to such a stage that most of us have extremely little trouble.  Most of the initial difficulties have disappeared and, while that does not mean that there are not many improvements that might be made, though we may have grumbled in the past, we have reached the stage now where most ordinary business men can understand the position and get reasonable expedition in regard to tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like again to urge on the Minister&mdash;I will not argue with him, as I did that on the Second Stage&mdash;not to stand too closely over what he said in the reply he made to my question with regard to examination of the basis on which general tariffs are applied, that is, the ad valorem basis; and to consider carefully whether another <Col N="84" /> basis such as that which is in operation in Canada might not be from every point of view a great advantage both to the State and to manufacturers. I have given a good deal of study to this question, I have made enquiries and have discussed it with English manufacturers who did not like it at first; I have also discussed it with Canadians and with persons who have made enquiries in Canadian offices; and I am quite convinced that it is not a matter that the Minister should lightly pass over, but one that he should very carefully investigate.  It is not, of course, a matter for hasty action, but I believe it is one which should be carefully investigated.  I am not trying to make Party points in any sense of the word.  But this is, in my opinion, a case which will, on full investigation, be found to be the basis of a change to our advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section, that a new sub-section be added as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that hydro-carbon light oil (chargeable with the duty imposed by this section) has been used in the ordinary course of his business by the owner or driver of a street service vehicle which plies for hire from a <Col N="85" /> street stand in the County Borough of Dublin, the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, allow a repayment of duty at the rate of 2d. per gallon up to such maximum sum in any one month to any one driver or owner as may be fixed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>This may have some superficial resemblance to an amendment that was moved in the Dáil, but it was devised by myself to try to meet the objections which I read in the Minister's speech to the amendment that was proposed in that House.  He objected to the proposal to meet the hardships on taxi-drivers on several grounds, one of which was that the proposal was to go back on previous taxation and not simply to give a concession on the taxation that was added this year.  My recommendation only proposes that the concession should be the 2d. per gallon which the Minister has put on in this Budget.</P>
    <P>He further objected because, he said, it would be open to evasion and that taxi-drivers would have many friends and would get petrol for them, etc.  I do not think that objection is a good one.  The taxi-driver must have a licence and has to pay a fairly substantial tax for it.  I see no reason why he should not be given a certain amount of petrol per month, which would be fixed by the Minister on the basis of the average use of the taxi; and when he proved by means of the receipts from various garages that he had paid for petrol and that he had used it up to that amount, he should be refunded 2d. per gallon on it.  He could not get more in any month than the fixed limit.  That is a method that is applied to tourists in certain countries in Europe.  If you stay a month in a particular country you obtain petrol and keep the receipts and show that you are a tourist by means of a passport. A taxi-driver would have similar possibilities because he has been registered and has to pay tax.</P>
    <P>There would be a limit to the maximum amount on which you can get <Col N="86" /> a refund so that there is no use in offering it to the people in the country, because that would be of no gain to yourself.  If that were adopted here, it would be a very definite relief to taxi-drivers, who are now feeling the burden of this increase on top of a very considerable number of other increased taxes.  Those who wanted to use more petrol than would be provided for in the maximum set down would not be entitled to receive the same amount of sympathy; if they exceeded the normal amount they would, presumably, be making a greater profit.  One of the reasons why I brought this up again was, not that I had very much hope that the Minister will change his mind, but that I believe there is a general grievance and that it is not in the public interest that we should go on increasing charges and providing more difficulties for taxi-drivers.</P>
    <P>Our taxis are none too good, and will not be improved, but rather worsened, by this tax.  We are proposing to provide a lot of money for tourist development. One of the most important features of a city like the City of Dublin, the capital city of the State, is that we should have good taxi accommodation, especially from the point of view of tourists.  When a tourist comes into a strange city and does not know the bus or other traffic routes he makes use of taxis.  I feel that the majority of the Dublin taxis are none too good as it is and that they are not a credit to our city.  That is very largely due to the fact that recent taxation here is in itself operating very harshly on these people.</P>
    <P>I do believe that, without any substantial expense at all, it would be possible to meet them to the extent that I have proposed, which is to the extent that an additional tax on petrol has been imposed in this Budget.  I do not say that it would solve the whole problem, but my principal reason is to call attention to a problem which ought not to be neglected.  I know that there is a danger that certain companies who are operating from fixed addresses quite convenient to the ordinary citizens of Dublin, are operating at a rate which would knock the ordinary <Col N="87" /> street taxis off the streets.  I do not consider that desirable, because, from the point of view of the visitor, these people are no use at all.  The visitor wants a taxi at a railway station, or on stands which are convenient, and I think it would be most unfortunate if they were driven off the streets, or if their general standard was allowed to deteriorate, when it should be improved.  I am not optimistic enough to pretend that this recommendation will, by itself, solve the problem, but I do say that it was a mistake and unnecessary to add to the petrol tax, at any rate so far as taxis are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I should very much like the Minister to agree with this recommendation, but I should like to see it extended to hackney drivers throughout the country.  Petrol nowadays is delivered directly into a car from a pump.  In the old days, when petrol was sold by the gallon in tins, evasion was quite possible, but now when petrol is delivered directly into a car, it should be possible to make arrangements by which an outsider could not obtain petrol from any petrol supplier.  These men who use motor cars for the purpose of making a living are in a different class from the rest of us.  Some of us drive cars for pleasure and some in the course of business, but these are the only people who drive them directly for the purpose of making a living, and I think we would all wish that some concession should be made in their favour.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that I cannot accept this recommendation. The tax upon mineral hydrocarbon light oils has become a very important tax in our revenue.  I think that, last year, we got almost £1,300,000 from it, and we expect this year to increase that to well over £1,500,000.  If I were to accept Senator Douglas's recommendation, I undoubtedly would have to do what Senator Goulding suggests. I would have to extend the concession to the taxi-drivers throughout the country, but it would not stop there. There are other people whose livelihood <Col N="88" /> is derived from the use of petrol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, directly.  Commercial travellers are engaged in the same way.  They could not do their business without using petrol.  Public transport companies would be in exactly the same position, and ultimately, we would come down to a point at which petrol, which was to be used for commercial purposes, would have to be exempt.  The moment we tried to apply such an exemption, not merely should we have a very heavy reduction in the revenue derived from the tax on petrol, but we should also have wholesale evasion of the tax, because it would not end with commercial exemptions.  Professional exemptions would then come into play. We should have the doctor wanting to be exempt; we should have the engineer wanting to be exempt, and we should have the clergyman wanting to be exempt.  We would have all the people who use their motor cars for the dual purpose of business and pleasure wanting to be exempt from the tax, and the result of granting an exemption of this sort would be that we should have to withdraw the tax upon petrol altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody might say that that would be a good thing.  It would be, if we could do without the revenue which we derive from the tax, but, unfortunately, the position is that we cannot do without that revenue, and if we did not tax petrol, we should have to tax something else.  I do not think any person is going to contend that the duty on tobacco is not already as high as it might be, nor do I think any person is going to say to me: &ldquo;Do not tax petrol, but tax tea or sugar.&rdquo; That is the alternative.  I have given very careful consideration to this matter since it was first brought to my notice.  I am satisfied that the end which is sought to be served, that is, to ease the position of taxi-drivers and hackney-drivers in general, must be served by means of a special exemption from the incidence of this tax. There are other ways.  They pay road <Col N="89" /> tax and, perhaps, something might be done in that regard.  I do not undertake to do it, because I am not in a position to give any undertaking in that respect.  The Minister for Local Government is in charge of the Road Fund, but undoubtedly, if you want to ease the position in regard to taxi-drivers, there are other ways in which it can be done, with less risk of evasion and with less justification for extensions and exemptions than would arise, if the concession now asked for were to be granted.  I cannot accept the recommendation, and, if the matter were to come back from the Seanad to the Dáil, I do not think there is any hope that the Dáil would accept it either.</P>

      <P>There is an Irish saying &ldquo;Mair a chapaill agus gheobhair féar&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;.  That is the Minister's consolation to taxi-drivers and to a great many other people who are being taxed in this Bill.  He feels that if he were allowed to get away with this petrol tax, sometime or other somebody or other might do something for some of the taxi-men.  The Minister, in the course of his argument, did what he does so frequently&mdash;he built up a vast edifice of his own and destroyed it most systematically and thoroughly.  But Senator Douglas did not make the case which the Minister destroyed and the Minister did not deal in any particular at all with the case Senator Douglas made.  He was so immersed in his imaginary enemy that he even forgot what is in an ordinary Finance Bill.  I think he said that the Minister for Local Government was the person who settled the road tax.</P>

      <P>And of his majority in the Dáil, of course, not further or otherwise.  The notion that if you did not tax petrol, you would have to tax sugar and tea is absurd.  We have to have taxes because the Minister does not know where to stop when he is spending.  There is no more foolish argument than that, if you do not tax one thing, you must tax another thing.</P>
      <P>To come down to the precise matter of the recommendation, I sympathise with Senator Goulding's point of view about hackney drivers in the country, but there is this difference between the hackney driver in the country and taxi-men in Dublin, that the taxi-men in Dublin drive on a clock.  They are bound to fixed charges, charges which are fixed for them and which they cannot increase, and they have to pay more for petrol but they cannot get more from their fare.  The hackney drivers in the country are, I think, in the vast majority, people who do not drive on a taxi-meter and, therefore, they can make some effort to pass on the charge to the public who use these hackney cars.  Similarly with the people the Minister mentioned, the transport companies, and even the other great carrying companies.  As a matter of fact, what the Minister proved in his rebutting of this recommendation is that the tax on petrol is a tax on the food of the people, a tax upon necessaries, a tax on the cost of things we have to buy.  In the case of the Dublin taxi-men, however, they work on a taxi-meter, or clock, as they call it themselves, and therefore, they cannot increase their charges.  They have to pay particular road tax and they have cars which, in the main, do not give a good petrol return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been in recent years, I think, though Senator Douglas does <Col N="91" /> not make that point, a very considerable improvement in the type of taxi. These taxis are subject to very rigorous, though I am sure, very sympathetic inspection by the police. They have to be up to a very high standard and the taxi people can barely make ends meet.  For my part I prefer the individual taxi-man to the big company.  It is a pity that individuals who own one or two or three cars should be put out of business and that their trade and their profits should be gobbled up by some big impersonal concern.  The remission of the tax on petrol in the case of the taxi-men would not lead to confusion if it were confined to the City of Dublin where the taxi-man drives on a taxi-meter.  If we are going to develop the tourist traffic in Dublin, the taxis in Dublin are a very important consideration.  All of us who visit foreign cities know that there is a very great tendency to take a taxi instead of depending on a bus or some such mode of conveyance.  It is much more convenient to one in a foreign city to go round by taxi.  The taxis are dear in Dublin, but that does not imply that the owner or the driver gets a big profit.  I submit that in the case of the taxi-driver this particular tax should be remitted. The Minister did not make the case that the remission to the taxi-driver would be abused or evaded.  It is a reasonable amendment and the Minister should accept it.  These people are only given power to charge a certain fixed amount in their fares. For that reason there should be some relief from this tax.  I think the Minister should have given it more sympathetic consideration as a special case.  With regard to the road tax that, of course, is a different matter, but when this petrol tax is put on the difficulty of getting a reduction in the road tax will remain as great as ever.</P>

      <P>While having no sympathy with this amendment I would strongly commend to the Minister that he should give some consideration to the question of the remission of the tax in the case of vehicles <Col N="92" /> engaged in the removal and transport of agricultural produce.  I have no sympathy at all with the motion before the House.  I would be glad if we could tax the people of Dublin a little more in every shape and form and drive some of them back to the land, and the more of them we could drive back to the land the better it would be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that I cannot be expected to know a great deal about this.  I very occasionally drive in a taxi.  I have not the accommodation which others, Ministers included, enjoy.  What I would like to know is this: Senators Douglas and Hayes told us there is a situation likely to develop out of this tax which is going to put a number of taxi-drivers out of business. Is that a fact?  What does the Minister know about it?  It is all right to talk on platforms about taxing the rich for the sake of the poor.  Does the Minister like the scheme in which he is imposing a tax which, when distributed over all members of the community, is going to fall most heavily on the weakest members of the community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supposing the Minister, by this tax, puts a number of these people out of business, what does he think is to happen to them?  What will become of these people?  Where are they to go? Are they to stay down and out?  Are they to get employment in these firms to which their business will pass when they are put off the street?  Is the Minister envisaging this measure having such a devastating effect on taxi-men in the city that they will be put out of their employment.  Does the Minister want all this business to go to a big corporation out of which he will get a corporation profits tax?  It seems to me that the case as presented by Senators Douglas and Hayes shows that very great hardships are to be imposed on these people who can bear very little additional strain at the moment.  I think, in justice, the Minister should take a case like that into account and give it more con- <Col N="93" /> sideration.  It is terribly unjust to put these people out of employment.  I can very well visualise the Minister asking: &ldquo;If we give this remission, where are we going to stop?&rdquo; I put this amendment as an alternative.  I think the whole tax is unjust, but, unjust as the tax is, it would be less unjust if this remission were given.</P>
    <P>This tax would not be necessary if the Minister were pursuing a sane policy in the years gone by.  The Minister is now in a very tight corner in trying to keep his level of expenditure up to the same standard as that at which it stood a few years ago.  The Minister is trying to search out every corner in the taxpayers' pockets and to collect from them all the pennies left but he will very soon discover that very little is left.  Certain people are going to be injured and prejudiced in their business by this Bill.  In this case I would prefer that he would take the line that he would do just a little to right a great wrong, for the whole tax is unjust.  It would be better to do a little right on the fringe of this tax than to do nothing at all.  If I had the power I would oppose the whole tax all round, but if the facts are as Senators Douglas and Hayes have stated them, the Minister ought to look around the whole situation and examine the consequences of what this tax will be if applied to the taxi-drivers in Dublin.  There are things that human nature can stand and beyond these limits one cannot go.  If you drive people beyond these limits, you certainly are not going to make them better citizens.  If these people are put out of their employment are they to go on the rates or to look for unemployment assistance?  What is to happen to them?  If this tax is not going to press as heavily as the Minister suggested he ought to tell us the evidence he has that it is not going to press so heavily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister finally rejects the amendment moved by Senator Douglas, I would like to draw the attention of the Minister and the attention of Senators Hayes and Douglas to the fact that outside Dublin there are also taxi-men who are working <Col N="94" /> on the meter.  There are certainly as many per head of the population in the City of Cork as in Dublin and they render just as valuable a service.  They also exist in Limerick and unless I am mistaken I have seen some in the cab ranks in Galway.  I think the Minister should give more consideration to this amendment before he turns it down. Senator Baxter has pointed out that these men are not rich men.  In fact they are poor men and they have invested what little capital they have been able to gather together in the purchase of their cars and vehicles. They have gone to certain expenses in the road tax and in the up-keep of their cars in the condition which will enable them to pass the tests of the Commissioner of Police and the local licensing authorities.  I think Senator Baxter has made an extremely good case as to why these men should not be penalised.  I think the Minister ought to see whether he can stretch a point to prevent them being put in a position where they would not only lose their livelihood but the capital invested in these vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the point which has been made by Senator Hayes that I told the taxi-drivers that they might live and that they will get grass, I would like to say this, that a Bill codifying the measures of vehicle taxation is under consideration at the moment and I have some hope that it may be introduced within the next year.  That is the Bill consolidating and codifying vehicle legislation.  On that Bill therefore will arise the case for considering the taxi-driver as a class and not merely the taxi-drivers but other classes of motor vehicle users.  With regard to this particular recommendation, the argument has been used that because the taxi-driver charges upon a meter at a pre-determined rate prescribed for him by some authority, then the tax is going to fall entirely upon him.  There is no justification at all for that.  The charges for taxi fares are determined with a full consideration of the costs of running a vehicle and providing a taxi service. If, because we have increased the cost <Col N="95" /> of petrol to the taxi-drivers, they have a claim for revision of fares, I have no doubt whatever they will not be slow in presenting that claim.  If we may assume that the authority which prescribed fares previously acted fairly between the owner and the user of the vehicle, I think we may take it that it will act fairly in the future and that the charges will be amended in order to meet equitably the point of view of the taxi-driver in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see any justification for the other argument used&mdash;that we are going to drive these people out of business by means of this tax.  As may be gauged from what I have already said, if an increase in fares is necessary to enable the owners to run these vehicles and to provide this service at a profit, that increase in fares is likely to be granted.  If that is done, they will be no worse off than they are now except in so far as the increase may deter people from using taxis and induce them to turn to other means of transport. In that event, if the taxi-owners lose, others will benefit.  With regard to the suggestion that the taxi-drivers may be supplanted by large concerns owning taxis and a certain amount of unemployment caused, I think that argument is utterly fallacious.  I do not think that large corporations tend to reduce employment.  On the contrary, by reason of the fact that those who constitute the corporations cannot give to the business the same element of personal attention that the private owner can give, they tend to provide more employment at a certain cost, naturally.  It is not a case of the poor taxi-driver being forced off the street and being left without a livelihood.  He may cease to be an owner.  Some people might regard that as socially disadvantageous.  He might become an employee, but there is just the possibility&mdash;it has happened before &mdash;that the economic position of the person concerned would be improved rather than disimproved by becoming an employee.  I am not suggesting that one state is more advantageous than the other but, when Senator Baxter was talking about these people <Col N="96" /> being driven off the streets and supplanted by big corporations, he did not remind the Seanad that nobody ever yet saw a big corporation, public or private, driving a taxi.  These corporations employ taxi-drivers.  Those who suggest that the taxi-driver is going to be supplanted by large concerns and that a large volume of unemployment will thereby be created do not give due weight to the intelligence of the Seanad and of the general public.  There would be something to be said for this recommendation if it was not for the fact that there is nothing in any code I know which would bind the taxi-drivers to shoulder the burden imposed upon them.  They have various remedies.  I have suggested two.  They can go to the Minister for Local Government and try to secure his assent to a reduction in the road tax, or they can go to a commissioner of the peace and get him to agree that taxi fares should be raised.  There is nothing in the <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal made here to support this recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am completely and absolutely unconvinced by the Minister's speech&mdash;more unconvinced than usual.  The only argument that seemed to me to be sound, as against this recommendation, was that advanced by Senator O'Callaghan.  That was that we should drive the taxi-men back to the land.  That seems to be an excellent reason for voting against this recommendation.  I had not thought of it myself and I congratulate the Senator on having thought of it.  The Minister was quite up to his usual form and, in the latter part of his speech, he argued against something which is not a serious problem.  There is not, so far as I know, any large corporation which puts taxis on the street.  There is a large corporation which does not ply on the streets but which, if you have a telephone, you can ring up. That is of service to people in Dublin with telephones but it is largely useless so far as the general public is concerned.  That corporation operates under different regulations because they do not ply on the streets.  That argument is, I admit, irrelevant&mdash;just as irrelevant as was the Minister's <Col N="97" /> argument when he referred to a corporation driving taxis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxis to which I was referring were taxis on the streets and I never wished to confine the concession to Dublin.  Cork would, certainly, be included and any other city that could make a case.  It would be confined to hackney vehicles that operate on a meter, and I am not convinced that it could not be operated without evasion.  As to the Minister's statement, that there is to be a general revision of the code, that seems to me to be a good argument for making this concession for one year, so that there will be no danger that a number of people will be driven out of employment in the meantime.  That is possible. It is the last straw which does the harm.  I am convinced that there will <Col N="98" /> be a serious position with regard to the Dublin taxi-drivers unless somebody steps in.  I think that it is not a bad principle, when you introduce general taxation, which is inevitable because of expenditure, to make exceptions where you find that a small class will be hit out of proportion to other people who have to pay the tax.  In putting down this recommendation, I felt that the position was one to which publicity should be given.  I was also convinced that the taxi-driver would be hit by this tax out of proportion to any other class which will have to pay this petrol tax.  I recognise that taxes have to be imposed somewhere, but I do not agree with the Minister's general objection to making exceptions when a good case is made that certain classes are unduly hit.  I propose to press the recommendation, as there is a principle involved.</P>

    <P>In this case I am not going to say that any large corporations are interested or that anyone is going to be put out of business.  My object was really to ask the Minister if he would explain why it was essential that these particular words in brackets should be there.  I asked him on the Second Stage and I think he forgot about it.  It is only a discretionary power, and I do not see why the discretion should not be extended to the sidetrack film which <Col N="99" /> has sound on it.  May I say, in reference to the debate here on the last day, in regard to the suggestion that the Minister thought I made&mdash;that he, as Minister, was doing something because he was personally interested in it, that there was nothing further from my mind&mdash;especially as I have been the one person who has advocated the giving of this concession for the last four or five years.  Frankly, I admit I was interested, but I am afraid I could not make much of a case against the Minister even if I wanted to.  In the United States, where the amateur cinematograph came from, to a large extent the amateur cinematographers are now taking up the sidetrack film with sound on it.  It is a pity that it should be precluded from coming in here.  At the moment it is definitely precluded, because the price of having it processed and then of paying duty on it would be absurd.  I suggest that it is not necessary to have in the section the words in the brackets. They are only discretionary.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Senator not to press this this year.  I undertake to look into it before next year's Budget.  I am inclined to agree with the Senator that there may not be a great deal in it, but there is just the possibility that if these 16mm. films could be imported free of duty they might be shown in small halls in competition with exhibitors showing full-size films and paying tax thereon. The reason why the words in brackets appear in the section is that, in regard to concessions of this sort, where commercial interests may be involved and where the concession might adversely affect commercial interests, we have got to proceed slowly even with the concession.  I understand that there are not any of these 16mm. sound-projectors in the country at the moment.</P>

      <P>The Minister is under a misapprehension.  As I have said, there are several of these in the country and there would be more if it was not for the difficulty of getting them processed.  This is confined entirely to a small number of films only available for use in private houses and in schools.  I am more interested in it from the school point of view than that of private houses.  The small sound camera, as far as I know, is not of any use here because you cannot get the films taken here processed.  The cost would be quite prohibitive.  It is not so much from the point of view of the users of projectors that I am interested in this.  I do happen to be interested in a firm that sold two.  The fact is that, at present, you cannot introduce a camera because if you do you have no way of getting the films processed.  I am sorry that the Minister is going to allow another year to pass before he will undertake to do anything.  I cannot see anybody bring a camera in here while the law remains as it is.  I am not pressing this, and I am prepared to withdraw it if the Minister wishes.  I would be glad if he would take a further opportunity of looking into it.</P>

      <P>I think the Senator has now raised another point.  When I was talking of the apparatus I was referring really to the camera.  Because of the fact that there are projectors coming in, I think the concession which the Senator now asks would allow these 16 mm. films to come in indiscriminately whether they were shot here or not.  That would mean that if we were prepared to grant a concession in regard to films shot here by residents who owned these cameras we would have to narrow the concession somehow.  If the Senator, or those interested in the subject, would get in touch with the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="101" /> on the matter we would try to meet them.  Personally, I am satisfied that one of the ways in which we can develop, if we consider it desirable to do so, the cinematographic industry is by trying to encourage the amateur in this way.</P>

      <P>The point was made by Deputy Benson in the Dáil that one of the attractions of amateur cinematography was that you could shoot a picture with your camera abroad and have it brought in here free of duty. In order to meet that point we have had to relax the section very considerably. It may be possible that the Revenue Commissioners, when they are drafting regulations, will try to safeguard the position as against the wholesale importation of 16 mm. films. On the other hand, we have got to remember that the 16 mm. silent film has very little commercial attraction, but that the 16 mm. sound track film might become a competitive article. That is the point we are doubtful about in regard to it.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise one point, an administrative point.  I have had one or two complaints recently regarding delays in the Estate Duty Office.  I wish the Minister would give an assurance to look into the matter, as it is most inconvenient for beneficiaries after a death to be held up, as in one case that I know of, for a very long time.</P>

      <P>It so happened that I was discussing the position of the Estate Duty Office with the commissioners some few days ago, but not entirely in relation to the point which the Senator has raised.  It was in relation to other matters and it was suggested to me then that the work of the Estate Duty Office was rather complex and rather difficult because of the delay which they experienced in getting solicitors who were handling cases to furnish them with the necessary information.  I am only saying that to indicate that perhaps the Estate Duty Office may not be entirely to blame in regard to questions of delay.  I will put to the Revenue Commissioners what the Senator has said and will try to arrange that, as far as it rests with the Estate Duty Office, they will expedite the case with which they are dealing.</P>
      <P>The Senator will understand that there is a natural inclination on our part to get the work of the Estate Duty Office done expeditiously, as the more rapidly these cases are dealt with the greater the rate at which revenue flows into us.  I am not prepared to ascribe the responsibility for the delay to one party or the other, but there are two parties involved&mdash; the solicitors for the estate and, of course, the officials of the Estate Duty Office.  It may be, as I have said, that the responsibility does not rest entirely with the officials.  If the Senator thinks it does I should be glad to hear him.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Seanad could permit this section to pass without making a comment or two.  I would be very surprised if the farmer Senators on the right-hand side of the House are prepared to support the Minister in the imposition which this section contains.  The Minister is proposing to take £150,000 from the Road Fund and transfer it to the Exchequer.  I think the Minister, early in his career as Minister for Finance, borrowed on the strength of the Road Fund; and I would like the Minister to tell us if that money has ever been repaid.  Is it gone and lost for ever, or, on the contrary, has it come back to the Road Fund and is it there to the credit of that fund to-day?</P>
      <P>It is not so much the fact that the Minister has decided to take £150,000 out of the Road Fund&mdash;it is not so much the loss of the £150,000 to that particular fund&mdash;that I disagree with it, but rather the attitude of mind displayed in such a decision.  I confess, as a countryman, that that proposal was the one proposal in the whole Budget which gave me the greatest shock.  It was going back on all the conceptions that we had here and that we tried to propagate, wisely and justly throughout the country&mdash;that taxation of land was too high.  I think the position now is, that local rates are well over a million pounds higher than they were before the Minister came along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister tells us of the benefits which have been granted in the remission of the land annuities&mdash;or half of the land annuities&mdash;let him recollect <Col N="104" /> that it is being balanced on the other side now by the additional expenditure imposed on local authorities, largely through the scheme of financing which the Minister has in progress. At the present time when the farming industry is very considerably depressed one can see evidence of that, and it is admitted by every type of citizen in rural Ireland, regardless of politics&mdash;it is not a question at all now of men giving evidence of being depressed only because of the political Party to which they belong.  The economic situation is pressing on all people in the country and they are quite prepared to admit now that the facts are as they are. What surprises me is that, in circumstances like this, the Minister could succeed in putting a scheme across his own Party, which gives him authority to take from the Road Fund moneys paid into that Fund to be utilised for the purpose of road construction and road maintenance in this country.</P>
    <P>We had expected that the Minister had softened his heart a bit as far as the farmer was concerned, and was coming to the point when he would be prepared to admit that times had been very rough for the farmer and that concessions ought to be made to him. When we hoped that in the offing there would be some remission of local rates, we find, instead of that £150,000 being an additional relief of rates, the Minister actually comes in and takes from the Road Fund money which ought to be utilised in the construction and maintenance of roads and places it in the Exchequer, to be spent on goodness knows what.  It is something to which I cannot subscribe and something which I think is entirely unjustifiable on the part of the Minister.  I do not think it is a policy which people from the country&mdash;whatever about people from the City of Dublin who are not perhaps, so concerned&mdash;will stand for. No one knowing what the condition of the ratepayers is to-day can assent to it.</P>
    <P>What is the net result going to be? Surely to the extent to which one is reducing the amount available in the Road Fund, one is going to reduce employment on the roads.  The money is not there to be spent; at least, the <Col N="105" /> money will not be available from that fund to spend on roads.  It may very well be that local authorities will expect the roads to be kept up to a certain standard and the poor oppressed ratepayer will be further taxed to keep the roads up to the level which it is only possible to maintain by contributions from this fund, which we have always been led to believe was the legitimate property of the local authorities and was to be spent in road construction and road maintenance in this country.</P>
    <P>I am against this section.  It is staggering to think that the Minister, at this time in his career, is prepared to go on taking away money and putting a heavier burden on the local taxpayers than they have had to carry heretofore.  One might add that to that extent local taxation has been increased, because that is what the real position is.  I would like the Minister to tell us what has become of the money which was borrowed on the strength of the Road Fund.  Was it ever given back to the Road Fund? It seems to me that the Minister in his whole scheme, as I said earlier to-day, is becoming quite reckless.  The money has to be found and, no matter from what source it comes, it must be got. He is quite reckless of the consequences. That situation will have to be faced because you cannot go on spending at this rate, and taking from this hole to close that hole.  The net result for the taxpayer of this country is going to be that the position will be worsened, not to the extent alone by which the fund has lost in cash, but in the sense that it is an attitude of heart and mind on the part of the Minister to the local ratepayer.  I think the sooner the local ratepayer wakes up to the attitude which the Minister has to the rural dweller generally, the better for the Minister and for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the protest made by Senator Baxter.  I do not know if I am right, but, speaking from recollection, this is the first time the Budget has placed a burden on the local authorities.  I may be wrong, but, if that is so, it <Col N="106" /> is introducing indirectly a new principle, because that is the effect of it. This money, if it were not taken for revenue, would go indirectly to expenditure on roads and in relief of rates, and if the local authorities do not get it, they have to let the roads deteriorate to that extent or increase the rates to an equivalent amount.  It does raise a very important principle because I feel that the Government, all along is paying inadequate regard to the burden on the ratepayers.  The Minister has quite enough of a burden to bear in taxes, and wherever he can, it is very natural that he should yield to the temptation to say: &ldquo;Put it on the rates.&rdquo;  From the more or less narrow departmental outlook, I do not altogether blame him, but remember that the burden of rates is very different from the burden of taxes.  The burden of rates is a fixed charge on a hardly pressed class and not like taxes, which, if you have not got the income, you do not pay.  An increase of rates you have to pay, whether you have an income or not.  It is a fixed charge on land and practically equivalent to a land tax.  If you go down the country and talk to the farmers, you find that they all say: &ldquo;It is the rates which are killing us.&rdquo;  They will give you instances which, in some cases, are appalling, showing that rates are double what they were 20 years ago. We know that, in the last few years, rates have increased by 25 per cent., so that I do join in the protest made by Senator Baxter against this, the thin end of the wedge of a new principle. I do not believe that if the Minister is pressed for money, he will be satisfied with £150,000.  It is a small amount, and I am afraid there will be an increasing tendency to raid the Road Fund, which really means placing additional burdens on the ratepayers.</P>

      <P>I should like to join in the protest against this raid, on the ground that it will cause considerable unemployment throughout the country. It is well known that the secondary roads are falling into disrepair and these are the roads largely used by farmers.  It will be impossible in a few <Col N="107" /> years to get these back into condition, if the present position is allowed to continue.  I think this is contrary to the whole spirit of the idea of giving assistance to rural areas.  We have set up a commission for the purpose of devising ways and means to help agriculture, and here we find this principle cutting across that in a very important way.  I think there will be great discontent on the part of public bodies, whose engineers are in despair because they can never get the secondary roads into condition without an immense expenditure.  A little attention given annually would, in the aggregate, mean a good deal to employment, and, finally, would mean that the roads could be easily reconditioned. I think the Minister should seriously reconsider this proposal, and leave the fund to be used for its legitimate purposes.</P>

      <P>I, too, wish to protest against this proposal.  A sum of £150,000 will mean a great deal to the employment given by local bodies.  I do not think there is any charge which presses so heavily on agriculturists as rates.  I once mentioned here that fear is perhaps the greatest of all human emotions, and the fear that sees in this another effort to take away from what public bodies have come to look upon as their rights is very serious, and I appeal to the Minister to withdraw this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible if the public bodies are taking the wrong view of this matter.  To my mind, there is no difference between the tax paid on motor vehicles and the tax paid to the Exchequer by the owners of public houses.  It happens that a tax has to be imposed which at the outset was very largely of a luxury nature&mdash;its character may have been modified in the course of the years, but in which there is still a very large luxury element&mdash;and I do not see any reason why it should not be appropriative to the general purposes of the Exchequer and a more orderly system of assisting local authorities in regard to the maintenance <Col N="108" /> of roads devised.  I am saying that because I want to make it quite clear that I do not regard and no Minister for Finance has ever regarded it that the Road Fund has been appropriated to one particular purpose.  It did happen when the tax was first introduced in Great Britain that they did say that the proceeds of this tax will be reserved for a certain period in order to enable us to build up a proper road system, but they long ago have discarded that attitude towards it.  Chancellors of the Exchequer have, on a number of occasions, taken contributions from the Road Fund whenever the general Exchequer position required it, but latterly they have wiped out the Road Fund altogether in the country in which it originated.  Therefore, so far as the history of this fund is concerned, so far as its character is concerned, and so far as it is a tax of almost exactly the same sort as is paid by a tobacco licence holder or an excise duty licence holder or by a bookmaker it is there to be appropriated, in my view, for the general purposes of the Exchequer, one of the general purposes being to assist the local authorities to do their share to maintain the roads which run through their portion of the country.  With regard to our justification for appropriating some portion of the Road Fund in this year I should like to make it quite clear that we are not, as Senator Sir John Keane has stated, introducing the thin end of the wedge. There are many precedents for what we propose to do here both in our time and in our predecessors' time. Why do we feel that it is necessary to ask the Road Fund now to contribute for the general purposes of the Budget?  First of all, because if we do not do that we have to impose taxation elsewhere which will fall just as heavily upon the local ratepayers as anything we may do in regard to the Road Fund now; but, apart altogether from that, under the Employment Schemes Vote no less than £500,000 is going to be spent on improving the roads of the country and local authorities are not being asked with certain not very significant exceptions to make in the majority <Col N="109" /> of cases, any contribution towards it at all.  In so far as the ordinary county and trunk roads are concerned they are, but in regard to a considerable number of secondary roads and roads in tourist districts, in districts which are poor and congested, they are not being asked to make any contribution. There is going to be a sum of almost £500,000 spent in those areas, and I think that where that money is being spent in order to improve the means of transit in the country we are quite justified even if the Road Fund were in the sacrosanct position in which Senator Baxter and Senator McGee hold it to be, in securing a contribution from the Road Fund to devote to this particular purpose of improving the roads throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it has been said, of course, that we are going to impose an added burden on the farmers by reason of the fact that we are taking this money from the Road Fund.  But the position is that the local authorities have never received more from the Road Fund to assist them to maintain the main roads and the other roads in the country, than they have been drawing during the past two or three years.  The revenue from the Road Fund has been going up by leaps and bounds.  When we came in, the receipts into the Road Fund were £700,000 to £800,000 a year and the borrowings by our predecessors were so heavy that the amounts that were being allocated from the Road Fund to the local authorities were considerably less than to-day.  To-day the receipts into the Road Fund are £1,075,000 some of which is going to pay the interest on the borrowed money and the much larger part goes to the local authorities.  The proceeds that create that fund do not come from the county councils at all.  They come from the transport system in the towns and very largely the cities. Nobody can say that the county councils are entitled to this money by reason of the fact that it is raised mainly from those who reside in their area.  Again, I come back to this point made by Senator Baxter who said that this is putting an added burden on the local authorities and that we were <Col N="110" /> going to deprive the local authorities of some assistance which hitherto has been given to them.</P>
    <P>The fact is that this sum of £150,000 can be taken and the local authorities should be no worse off than they ever were.  In fact their position in the past few years with regard to the maintenance of the roads of the country has been steadily improving.  I am sure that with the development of road transport, with the more general use of the roads and the fact that the quantum of charge to be borne by individual vehicles moving along the road will be reduced I think the position of local authorities will tend to improve.  Naturally we are not predisposed to make the position of the local authorities in any event worse than it was.  The fact is that in the last three or four years we are spending a considerable sum more than we had been spending, and more than ever was spent previously, upon improving the roads of this country. The utmost amount that was spent in any year up to 1932 was spent in 1926 and 1927 when about £2,000,000 was borrowed upon the security of the Road Fund.  The Road Fund is paying that back and it is only the balance available that was granted to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The local authorities have no claim to any greater proportion of this fund than the proportion that has been allocated to them by the Minister in charge of the fund.  He can build up a reserve.  He could wipe out the borrowings entirely instead of giving the local authorities anything.  He could devote the income of the Road Fund to wiping out previous obligations and liabilities.  We are not doing that.  We have in fact provided for the repayment of the borrowings by the Road Fund.  We have provided for the repayment to the Exchequer of the moneys borrowed from the Exchequer for a number of years and we are making available to the county councils more than was ever available before for road maintenance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want some more information from the Minister on this question. <Col N="111" /> In the first place the Minister seems to take a great deal of credit to his Ministry for what has been spent on the roads to-day compared with what was spent previously.  The Minister told us that the revenue from transport services to the Road Fund is somewhere about £1,075,000. Obviously the traffic on the roads has grown.  To the extent that this traffic is greater than in the past, the cost of road maintenance is greater.  The Minister talked about the big transport services in the towns.  What are they doing in the towns?  These services are going over the country roads; the man with the horse and cart to-day cannot travel over the roads.  These roads were built up by borrowings in the days of the Minister's predecessors here.  They were built by borrowings and by the efforts largely on the part of the local authorities, who built up these lines of transport.  The position in which the Minister is trying to put the local taxpayer is this&mdash;the Minister thinks that the people who are using the roads to-day have no obligation to maintain the roads they are so using. It seems, according to the Minister's thinking, that the men who ought to keep up the roads for the big transport services are the farmers inside the fences.  The farmer must pay whether he is using the roads or not.  The Minister ought to pay from the Road Fund which is made up of contributions paid into it by the transport services and by the owners of motor cars, taxis and lorries, the cost of the road maintenance.  The Minister ought to be prepared to use that money for the road maintenance.  But the Minister's solution of the problem is to let the local authorities find the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let the Minister make no mistake about it, to the extent to which the money is not forthcoming to-day from this Road Fund for constructional work, it can only be found by the local ratepayers and the local ratepayers are already burdened too heavily.  The traffic on our roads has grown practically speaking to an alarming extent. Now these roads can only be maintained by increasing the payments from the Road Fund.  The Minister need <Col N="112" /> not take credit for the fact that greater sums have been made available out of that fund at present than in the past.  But these payments have been made because the moneys have come into the fund.  The Minister deserves no credit at all for that. The method of distribution between one county and another I am not going to discuss now.</P>
    <P>I do again say that so far as the ratepayers through the country are concerned, they are definitely convinced that they are not getting a fair crack of the whip in this matter.  The ratepayer sees no justification whatever as to why he should have to maintain these roads for huge trunk services, for transport companies all over the country.  Why should he be asked to maintain that out of his limited resources, all the more when he sees the moneys in the fund built up for that purpose?  The Minister now has other plans.  The ratepayer is convinced that there is no obligation at all on him to-day to maintain these roads.  The people down the country will give the Minister no thanks for what he is doing, and they will give the people who are backing him here no thanks either.</P>

If the Minister is going to break with the principle, he ought to break with it straight away.  He ought to take this money into revenue and devote whatever portion is necessary for maintenance of the roads.  There is a strong moral feeling that this Road Fund was established for the improvement of the roads and I do not think that the British analogy&mdash;which, if I <Col N="113" /> may say so, is always quoted when favourable&mdash;is quite on all fours because agricultural land has been completely derated in England.  That is why I am concerned that there should be no attempt to diminish the Grants-in-Aid of rates, either directly or indirectly.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable us to fulfil an undertaking which, I am convinced, was given by the then President of the Executive Council to the Clerk of the former Seanad Eireann when that gentleman was accepting an appointment on the staff of the House as Assistant-Clerk.  The late holder of the office of Clerk of the Seanad was an officer in the ordinary Civil Service of the State in one of the Government Departments and, undoubtedly, he had many opportunities in front of him for advancement in the ordinary departmental service. Because of the character of his experience, it was thought desirable that he should become attached to the staff of the Seanad.  He was unwilling to go because he thought that, in accepting this new appointment, he might forfeit his Article 10 rights.  Assurances were given him, as I have said, by the then head of the Government, with the full knowledge of the Government of the day, and these were reinforced by assurances given by those members of the Seanad who were charged with the obligation of trying to secure a suitable <Col N="114" /> person for this particular office. Unfortunately, in drafting the 1929 Act, his particular position was not adverted to and, when he came to retire and to apply for compensation under Article 10, the Judge was compelled to hold that his appointment in the Seanad could not be described as being in the ordinary course and, accordingly, that he could not give him the benefit and advantage of Article 10. We feel that, in view of the fact that public faith was pledged to this gentleman, it remains for us to ask the Oireachtas to honour that undertaking. The purpose of this Bill is to give to the former Clerk of the Seanad the same retiring terms as he would have been entitled to if the 1929 Act had covered his case.</P>

      <P>This Bill will enable us to organize precautions against air-raids.  For the past few years we have been doing preliminary organization and training work, and for the last year or so we have been doing it somewhat more intensively.  We have in the City of Dublin and elsewhere throughout the country some hundreds of men trained to the point at which they could take charge of air-raid wardens, first aid parties or decontamination squads and enable them to deal with the dangers of air-raids.  Here in Dublin, the Dublin Corporation have taken certain steps and incurred certain expenses and this Bill will be retrospective to the extent that it will make legal the expenses they incurred and it will empower for the future local authorities to co-operate with the Government in taking precautions in their towns.  The whole expenditure that we contemplate in the country will amount, roughly, to £500,000, and of that about £320,000 will be direct State expenditure on the provision of gas masks, decontamination equipment and additional fire-fighting appliances.  That will leave about £180,000 to be borne by the State and local authorities.  Of this £180,000, 30 per cent. will at least be borne by the local authority and perhaps more.  We have linked the local authority with this particular item of expenditure in order to get their co-operation in keeping down expenses and avoiding an unnecessarily lavish type of precautions. This local authority fund, paid into by the State, will be spent on training air-raid wardens, organising shelters and first-aid posts and things of that nature which will not be very expensive if done by voluntary workers but which could mean a huge expense to the community as a whole if they were not done in a voluntary way but were paid for either by the State or the local authority.  We have got to rely on the good sense and co-operation of the people throughout the various communities to have an organisation prepared in peace-times that will minimise the effect of air raids.  I think that, without any vast expenditure here we could so minimise <Col N="116" /> the effects of air-raids as to reduce greatly the temptation of any foreign power to inflict them on us. If we were not prepared, there would be a very big temptation indeed, because the result of even one rather small air-raid might inflict very vital destruction on the community and on the community's property, but, with a modest amount of expenditure of money and a modest amount of expenditure of time and energy on the part of the citizens, I think we can reduce that temptation to practically nil, because, with the community fairly well prepared, no air-raid would cause disastrous consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, as I say, will give the Government and the local authorities power to spend the money and gives power to organise the people.  There is really no necessity to go into the various sections in any detail because they are written in rather simple language.  It is the first Bill and, being such, there are not very many cross references.  It is the first Bill but I am afraid it will not be the last because if things get worse in Europe there are certain things that we are leaving optional on the various sections of the community that we would have to make compulsory.  At the present time we are making it compulsory on certain named local authorities to make a scheme of air-raid precautions and that scheme is subject to approval or amendment by the Department of Defence.  Apart from the half-dozen or so large towns which we propose to compel to carry out such schemes, we propose to have a nucleus organisation in the various counties which will enable them to co-operate effectively with the scheduled towns.  For instance, there would be no use at all in blacking out the City of Dublin if the lights in the surrounding counties enabled hostile aircraft to mark down the city in relation to those lights.  We hope the amount of money required to be spent by the various county councils in non-scheduled areas will be very small but the activities that they might have to carry out, while not costly, might be very vital.  We are taking power to extend the scheduled districts and to lay them on the Table of <Col N="117" /> both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The same thing will happen in regard to the air-raid precaution schemes which we make compulsory.</P>
    <P>Apart from the local authorities, we are taking power to give grants to certain factory owners and people who have large establishments of that kind towards the provision of air-raid shelters for their workers.  That grant will amount to their rate of income-tax.  We are also taking power to exclude as from valuation new structures to be used solely for the purpose of air-raid shelters or additions to structures which will enable them to be used solely for that purpose.  Such new structures or additions will not be subject, therefore, to rates or calculable for income-tax purposes.</P>
    <P>We are taking power to give grants, also, of 50 per cent. to certain public utilities or manufacturing organisations of such a character that their products would be vital.  We are taking power to give them 50 per cent. towards such expenditure as they might make to enable them to carry on in the case of air raids.  Take the Electricity Supply Board, for instance, or gas companies, or people like that; it may be necessary that they should put in extra equipment in order to enable them to carry on, or to lay aside certain equipment that would be used should their services be interrupted. They will get 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>I think that covers the really essential parts of the Bill and I do not wish to take up the time of the House in going into more detail.  If any Senator raises any question now or on the Committee Stage I will deal with it in detail.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate the difficulty the Minister is in over this whole Bill.  In connection with a private establishment I have, in a small way, experienced a similar difficulty, that is, how far to go, having regard to what might happen and having regard to the expenditure involved.  My feeling is that anything that is not essential should be put off. Anything of a permanent character has to be done, but a lot of the trimmings and details could safely be left until the emergency became more apparent.  If, unfortunately, war should break out, it is inconceivable that we are going to be raided for the first fortnight or three weeks.  We probably would not be raided for some months. By the time we receive attention a lot of experience will have been gained and it may be that we will find that it is too risky for a possible enemy to attempt to come and give us any attention at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be aware of the 100 per cent. war-mongers.  It may be that they have got their ideas from the other side where the need is much more pressing.  It is only natural, I suppose, that they would want to apply their 100 per cent. standard here, and that they would be averse from any modifications or any rough and ready improvisations.  I hope the Minister will not do more than what is barely necessary at the start.  He should not go spending money on anything that does not need to be done in a hurry. He should have his plans ready by all means.  As I have said, we are likely to have at least a month's warning here before people will have to run certain risks.  Even if you had a <Col N="119" /> declaration of war to-morrow, I do not think there would be any danger of air-raids in Dublin within, say, a couple of days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Minister for Defence must be doing something, even though he may not be too clear of what is the right thing to do.  I suppose that is a problem for Ministers of Defence everywhere, so that our Minister for Defence must be in the fashion.  I was surprised by the answer he gave to Senator MacDermot's question about gas masks.  What is the policy with regard to them? Where are they going to be used?  Is it only the people in the cities who are going to get them?  Are places along the eastern seaboard such as Drogheda, Dundalk and Wexford being taken into account at all?  Would the Minister tell us something about his scheme for the use of gas masks, if there is a scheme?  Is there any definite plan about the methods to be adopted to meet a possible air-raid attack?</P>
      <P>I know, of course, it is difficult for the Minister to say exactly what he is going to do in every eventuality, but there are certain things that he ought to be clear about, and if the Minister and his Department are not clear about them, then the citizens cannot be clear.  If it is felt that there is going to be a necessity for gas masks, then they ought to be available in the parts of the country and in the areas where it is thought they will be most needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The part of the Bill that concerns me most is that which applies to remote areas in the West and Midlands. If the people in those parts are expected to make a contribution towards a defence scheme which may have no application to their areas, then, surely they may very well say that in those circumstances they should not be asked to contribute.  How does the Minister expect them to be satisfied to make a contribution to the rates levied by the local authority for the purposes of this Bill if the defence scheme has no application to their areas?  The sum of money that is going to be spent on defence is no inconsiderable figure.  We may have in this Bill <Col N="120" /> possibly only the thin end of the wedge.  It seems to me that what we find outlined in this Bill may look foolish and absurd to the people living on our hillsides, and away back in counties like Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan, Mayo or Sligo.  I would like to hear from the Minister what his plan is with regard to the application of this measure to those parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The powers and duties of local authorities are set out in Section 10. Who is going to determine that it is necessary for a scheme-making authority to make a scheme Will the Minister consult with the local authority about that, or will he just issue an order telling the local authority to make a scheme and to raise a certain amount of money?  If that is to be the procedure, while it may look all right to the Minister, I think it will cause considerable apprehension to ratepayers down the country and to people away back in the bogs.  The Minister's whole plan with regard to the application of this Bill to the country ought to be laid before the House.  We all realise that if the country is attacked a great many things may have to be forgotten, because self-preservation is the first law of nature.  It will bring home to our people that, however valiant they are, they will have to set about meeting that attack, and the more prepared they are the better they can face it. They can only do that when they know what the Minister's plan is.  If he has any clear plan in his mind, he ought to give it to the country.  I think he has not given anything like enough information to the House as to the lines he is thinking on in the matter of defence.</P>
    <P>Very considerable sums of money have been voted for the defence of the country.  The taxpayers and the ratepayers are now going to be asked to give more pennies.  Where are we going to stop?  Personally, I think the Minister should face up properly to this whole question of defence. Additional provision for defence is being made in the Finance Bill which we had before us this afternoon.  I believe it is going to prove very exasperating <Col N="121" /> to people living in remote parts of the country if they are to be asked to make further contributions towards the expenditure outlined in this Bill.  What will farmers and others living away back in the hills think of it?  Many of them would be just as pleased to be in an air-raid as where they are to-day.  I think that the consequences will be anything but satisfactory from the point of view of getting voluntary assistance.  In my opinion, the people in the parts of the country to which this defence scheme will not be applied ought not to be asked to pay for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the gas mask that is now in use will shortly become obsolete.  I understand that no sooner is a gas mask made than some form of gas is made that makes the mask useless.  I think that it would be rather inadvisable to lay in a large stock of gas masks at the moment, that it would be more advisable to delay purchasing these articles until the danger is almost upon us and we know exactly what we have to face.  It appears to me that we get rather frightened about this possibility of air-raids in this country.  At any rate, if air raids were to take place, surely no one would take notice of small towns in this country; they would seek out the fortified areas or the large manufacturing towns.  Now, in this country, we have practically no fortified areas, apart from those on the coast, and we have no munition works or large factories making war material; and I think the parts likely to be subject to air-raid attacks are very few.  It would, therefore, be advisable not to go to too much expense at the moment.</P>
      <P>As Senator MacDermot remarked, a lot of the expense may be useless. That is quite possibly so.  On the other hand, I suppose we have to take every precaution that we can not to be caught out.  Still, it would be advisable to go slowly, and not to spend £150,000 or £200,000 on gas masks which may become obsolete in a few months.</P>

      <P>I would like to <Col N="122" /> know what steps the Minister has taken in regard to possible air attacks. I have seen rehearsals of the preparations for air raids and pictures of some of the damage caused by air raids on the Continent and it is easy to realise that if bombers dropped bombs they will utterly destroy buildings.  I feel just as Senators do about these gas masks: they are horrible things to wear.  If they are ineffective and do not work as they should, it would be a pity to waste so much money in purchasing them.  We should go a little more slowly in this matter, as it is improbable that there will be air raids here without some kind of warning&mdash; we may even be given a week or a fortnight. The schemes for evacuation are excellent, but elaborate preparations in the way of shelters and gas masks should receive a little further consideration. It will involve such an amount of interference with ordinary civil quiet life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be advisable to have several thousand over and above the number required rather than to be one short; and I am sure that if <Col N="123" /> Senator Goulding were the man who was short he would be lucky if he survived the ordeal.</P>
      <P>As to whether we are going to get any warning of an air raid several Senators have suggested that we are never going to have any such thing as an air attack on Dublin.  I hope they are right, but I would certainly not like to take the chance, and I would not suggest that the Minister for Defence should take the chance.  Probably the Minister for Defence has more knowledge than anybody else has, but nobody can avoid having some conception of the position if they read the papers during the last 12 months. It is amazing the suddenness with which swoops have been made in other places.  They must know the air forces attached to the various countries.  Anybody knowing that must at least anticipate that, if hostilities are to open in Europe at all, it is quite on the cards that we may have a very serious attack on this country even in the first couple of days.  Senator Baxter suggested that some of the farmers would rather be in an air raid than in the position they are in at present.  That, in my opinion, is a ridiculous fashion in which to treat a serious measure.</P>
      <P>Though I do not know anything about an air raid or a gas attack, as far as I can gather it is something that it is absolutely the duty of the Government to do everything possible to protect our citizens against.  I would like to see people taking a far more serious view of this kind of thing. Many people are ready to criticise the construction of air raid shelters.  If we were to have an air raid here, it would probably take place in the big centres, and, regardless of what anybody may say to the contrary, I believe that people living in the farthest corner of Ireland are quite prepared to do their part and to take their share of the expense to defend the citizens of Ireland in any part of the country in which we may be attacked.  I think the Minister is perfectly justified in the steps he is taking to defend the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Quirke to the extent that I <Col N="124" /> think the citizens of the remote parts of Ireland ought not to take a parochial view of a measure of national defence.  Whether or not they would do so is a different question, but I agree that they ought not do so.</P>
      <P>The difficulty we are in about this Bill is that there is a very general scepticism as to the effectiveness of what is likely to be done.  Certainly, the Minister has not uttered anything here to-day that is likely to shake that scepticism.  He has given us no sort of picture of what he really proposes to do to protect this country against air raids.  He has not told us how many aeroplanes we have, how many chasers he is going to send out after the enemy bombers, how many aircraft guns he possesses or proposes to acquire; he has not indicated where the whole of this £500,000 is to be spent.  As I rather gather&mdash;though the Minister has not clearly said so&mdash; it is to be spent on purely passive measures of protection.  In other words, he has not indicated whether he depends on any degree on attack as a measure of defence, or whether it is just a question of creeping out of danger as far as we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am far from being a blind optimist about the European situation I would say that the chances of a European war within the next few months are rather more than even.  We all hope to Heaven there will not be such a war.  But I must say that I am an optimist on the question of the likelihood of an air raid on this country. There are other objectives of so much more importance to a potential enemy of Britain that it would be a considerable time at least before any thought of bombing this country would enter the enemy's head.  After all, I imagine that the desire on the part of an enemy of Britain would be to abstain from any action that would drive us into active and cordial co-operation in the war alongside Britain, and I imagine that a few bombing raids would do that very effectively.  I doubt very much if anything that they are likely to gain by such raids would compensate them for that.  Surely as regards our cattle trade, for example, they <Col N="125" /> could operate to interfere with that as effectively by bombing Liverpool or Birkenhead as by bombing the City of Dublin, and they could do that without any infringement of the neutrality which, apparently, it is the policy of this country to preserve as long as possible.</P>
    <P>One thing I would like to appeal to the Minister to do, if he can, in replying to this debate, is to give us a clearer picture of what action he is proposing to take.  He is asking practically for a blank cheque for £500,000. I should like a little assurance that that is going to be used in a really intelligent way, and that, assuming that protection is required by somebody, that somebody will really get the protection.  Certainly, I think that whatever is done to counter air-raids, considering what the resources of this country are, instead of being scattered over a wide field, where we cannot possibly afford to do anything effective, should be concentrated on the very few areas where one could imagine an enemy thinking it worth while to come.</P>
    <P>With regard to gas masks, I believe the provision of gas masks for everybody, even in Great Britain, has been a colossal blunder.  The very last form of air-raid that is likely to be made in this war, if it comes, is a gas air-raid.  It is the least effective and most expensive, and the one that excites most moral reprobation of all the forms of air attack.  I think it is the very last sort that is likely.  The distribution of gas masks was decided upon in England more to save the Government's face than anything else, because it was something that was comparatively easy to do and that brought home to every citizen that the Government, was doing something.  It was, therefore, thought that it would have a good moral effect on the public.  As a matter of fact, it had a very bad moral effect, and I think the downfall of British diplomacy at Godesberg and Munich was not totally unconnected with the evil influence on British morale of the distribution of gas masks.</P>
    <P>I had an example of it in my own <Col N="126" /> house in London where, up till the day when a municipal official came around distributing gas masks, my domestics had announced that, even if I wanted to shut up the house and remove my own family entirely to Ireland, they were determined to stay on and do war work.  A municipal official came around distributing gas masks, and, as a result, they all announced that, even if we were to stay on in London, nothing would induce them to do so.  The general effect of distributing gas masks, especially on uneducated people, is enormously to add to their terrors, and to give them, as I think, quite a false picture of anything that is likely to take place.  My objection to gas masks is not so much that, as Senator Goulding said, they might become obsolete. I think that would be a risk you would have to take, if the distribution was justifiable on other grounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he said that gas masks went out of fashion so quickly, owing to the invention of new gases, that we would soon have to get a different type.  That, however, is not my objection to them.  My objection is simply that I think they are very poor value for the money.  If we want to spend £500,000 on precautions against air raids, I would save that particular £150,000 which is destined for gas masks, and apply it to other forms of precautions against air raids, because I honestly think that, especially in our relatively thinly populated country, the use of gas in enemy air raids is fantastically improbable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every sympathy, like everybody else, with the Minister in the difficulties which this whole problem of defence produces for him at present.  I think, however, it would be really a derogation of duty on the part of the Seanad, if it were to let the Bill go through without the most careful and far-reaching scrutiny, and I think it spoke rather badly, if I may say so, for the Dáil that this Bill was allowed to go <Col N="127" /> through in almost a casual fashion, without any real downright criticism at all.  I do not know whether I would be described as an optimist or an absurd person by Senator Quirke, but I believe, and I think that 99 per cent. of the people of the country, believe with me, that we stand in practically no danger at all, either in the towns or in the country, from air-raids in any prospective war.  That being so, it is the nearest thing to lunacy for us to propose, in our present circumstances, to expend the enormous sum of £500,000 on preparations of this sort.</P>
      <P>I am not a military expert by any means, but I have read a good deal about wars, about air-raids and about the possibility of air-raids in war, and so on, and, so far as I can understand, if there is going to be a European war, the great objective of the Powers that use the air weapon in such a war will be to strike terror into the civilian population.  I cannot for the life of me see in what circumstances it would be of any value for any European Power to try to strike terror into the population of Ireland.  It seems to me that there could be nothing more senseless, from a practical point of view, for a European Government at war with Great Britain than to imagine that they could affect the course of that war by creating a panic in Dublin, and that is the great use of the air weapon in war.  It is not military destruction.  I think the Spanish war went a long way towards proving that, from the military point of view, the effect of air-raids is comparatively slight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great objective in a war, if there is such a thing, will be to strike such terror into the population of Great Britain that they will be prepared to surrender in a comparatively short time.  That certainly will be the primary object; the destruction will come secondary to that, and, to my mind, a long way secondary to that.  I do not see what circumstances could arise in which it would pay any European Government to send over even one bomber in order to strike terror into the population of Dublin.  Remember <Col N="128" /> that if there is a war every ounce of petrol and every ounce of explosive in that war will be costly, and it will be the object of the Government hostile to Great Britain to see that the maximum possible value is got from every ounce expended.</P>
    <P>The thing is bad enough if you apply it only to Dublin.  It might be argued, in a rather fanciful way in my view, that Dublin, because it is an agglomeration, a large city with a lot of people, does stand in a certain amount of danger and that certain measures of protection should be taken, although, as I say, I fail to see in what circumstances there is any real danger at all even to Dublin.  When you come to counties like Westmeath, Roscommon, Galway and Leitrim, to all of which it is proposed to apply this Bill, in Heaven's name how can anyone believe that the people living down in those counties are going to be subject to air-raids in any conceivable European war, and to be subject to air-raids to the extent that it would be worth the while of any Government to inflict the loss of one sixpence on the people of these counties? Here we are proposing to extract from the people in County Leitrim, County Cavan and County Roscommon, a great many of whom have not been able to eat meat more than once a week for the last two years, a lot of money to take precautions against dangers which only nightmares could cause us to fear.</P>
    <P>We might as well spend a whole lot of money and set up very elaborate machinery to protect the people of Roscommon, Galway and Mayo from an outbreak of homicidal mania on the part of some of their own neighbours as set up machinery to protect them against air raids.  In view of the financial position of the country, and in face of the expenditure that we are asked to undertake here, I think we should not allow this Bill to go through without a protest and a demand that a much fuller explanation should be given than has been given.  There should be a much more elaborate inquiry as to our needs in case of war. If there is to be a European war in the future, we stand in far greater <Col N="129" /> danger from other sources than we do in the matter of air raids.  It would be much more pertinent if the Government would take steps to produce a united policy for general defence.  If we are to be faced with a European war, we shall have to face dangers quite apart from air raid dangers, and these will come internally as well as externally.  These are the dangers to which we should devote our attention. We should make sure that if such a situation arises we will have a Government which will represent the whole of our people to deal with that situation. If we do not do that, I believe that anything spent in precautions against air raids might as well be thrown down a drain because it will be entirely wasted.</P>
    <P>I have heard that some consignments of gas masks that have already come in have had duty charged on them by the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not know if that is true, but if it is, it is surely an extraordinary state of affairs, and it throws a queer light on our whole attitude towards these defence problems.  A few days ago here we passed the Second Reading of a Bill to spend £45,000, and a capital sum of £600,000 was set aside to encourage people to come here from Blackpool.</P>
    <P>Now we are going to spend another large sum.  And these sums are to be extracted from people who are being mulcted of the last penny they have by way of taxation.  It is not the income-tax payers who will have to pay the bulk of this money.  It is not the wealthy people who will have to pay it. It is the poorest people in the cities and towns and in the country who will ultimately have to pay this money which we are proposing so lightheartedly to spend and all that to provide against a danger which is far less than the danger of being struck by lightning.  I regard this Bill as a fantastic proposal and I would say that nothing like a sufficient reason has been presented to the House to warrant us on behalf of the people to whom we are responsible to spend money on this measure.</P>

      <P>We may or may not have a war, but I think the chances <Col N="130" /> are two to one in favour of war.  If we do have a war we will have a panic. We will have very great panics in the densely populated areas.  We will have the surplus population of another country coming over here.  Much though I would like to hear the details of how the Minister proposes to spend this £500,000, it may be that the disclosure by the Minister might defeat the objects he has in view.  We heard from Senator Goulding that gas masks have been rendered obsolete by modern methods.  However, I would direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that there will be evacuations from the cities and large towns to the rural areas and there will be an influx of people into the country.  In order to cater for these people it would be well that reserves of foodstuffs might be built up.  There will also be the need of housing.  Much already has been done in the country to provide housing; that will come in well in the case of a war breaking out.  Provision should be made for building up stores of food.  That should be provided for in any scheme.  I think that would be far more important than the provision of gas masks.  These, to my mind, are the most important things to which we should attend.</P>

      <P>I would like, also, to support the Air Raid scheme.  I am satisfied that in view of the international situation it would be very foolish of us to do nothing&mdash;to make no preparations to safeguard the people.  Now such preparations are being made even in remote countries and countries far from the seat of war. I would like to suggest that, perhaps, the most effective precaution would be the installation of anti-aircraft guns. It is quite possible that aeroplanes when raiding towns and cities will swoop very low and do more damage thus than they otherwise would.  I suggest that the Minister should instal as far as possible anti-aircraft guns along the eastern coast.</P>

      <P>I have not the slightest intention of following Senators Tierney or MacDermot into debating European <Col N="131" /> affairs.  This is purely a technical Bill.  I am not here to-day to ask sanction for the money.  I did, however, give the Senators a general indication of the amount of money involved.  Last someone might say that I was putting through a technical Bill without at all telling what it would cost, I gave a rough indication.  Now, the present-day gas-masks may be obsolete just as the gas masks of 20 years ago are obsolete to-day.  We do not know.  What I am concerned with are not the present-day gas-masks or any other equipment we might have but the effectiveness of our organisation to keep some discipline amongst our people and to prevent panic.  People dread the unknown more than anything else.  If we have a certain number of people trained to identify the various gases in certain densely populated districts they will be the back-bone of the people in a time of crisis.  If the unfortunate thing should happen that air raids might come about these people could stave off panic in the case of gas, and where ignorant people might think the gas was upon them.  Now, the actual destruction caused by gas in the quantities in which it might be imported into this country would be very small. But if we were not able to cope with it, gas combined with, say, incendiary bombs, which people would normally deal with and put out, might cause the destruction of a vast amount of property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not as great an expert as most of the Senators who have spoken on this subject to-day, but, in my opinion, we need not fear a pure gas attack in any eventuality.  I could imagine a military commander who was given the job of destroying a city, when packing up with incendiary and high explosive bombs saying, &ldquo;I will put in a few gas bombs to create a diversion.&rdquo;  We do not propose either to buy and distribute or to store sufficient gas masks for all the people of the country.  We have bought a few hundred thousand. That would be sufficient for our largest and most populous areas.  We are endeavouring to get a number manufactured <Col N="132" /> here, in addition.  That would deal with a few of the cities and larger towns.  We hope, in the purchase of these gas masks of home manufacture to bring into being reserve equipment which could be made to turn out further supplies of gas masks if a crisis were to bring about the necessity for them.  I believe that gas masks are essential for preventing panic in case of an air raid.</P>

We hope the outbreak of the particular disease about which we are concerned will never occur but, if it does, I hope we shall be able to cope with it.  I am not sufficient of an optimist to take responsibility for doing nothing, knowing the destruction that might be caused.  Senator Tierney said that there was as much chance of our being struck by gas bombs as by lightning. My house was struck by lightning three times&mdash;on one occasion when I was in it.  The second time it was struck, while I was lying in bed during a lightning storm I thought I was a fool not to put up a lightning rod for the sake of the small amount involved.  The following morning I put it up.  In the same way, these steps may not be an absolute safeguard but it is worth while to spend the small sum that we propose to spend in addition to the amounts expended for the protection of the public health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not follow that any further.  We have not given the gas masks out to the people.  We have them in central stores.  If, in times of crisis, we feel that things are warming up a bit, we shall further distribute them throughout the city and, if there were an immediate crisis, an order would be given for distribution of the masks to individuals.  At the present time, we have reached the stage where we have the masks in a central store. Senator Sir John Keane said I should not be led away so as to engage in 100 per cent. expenditure in regard to air-raid precautions.  We are very far from 100 per cent. in the expenditure we propose and the precautions we are taking.  We are doing the minimum necessary if we are to do our duty in preparing the people for a possible eventuality.  To take such precautions as would render everybody perfectly safe from high explosives, gas and incendiary <Col N="134" /> bombs, we should have completely to reorganise and utilise all our resources and energy.</P>

      <P>It could be done over a number of years if the people were prepared to accept the standard of living necessary, but I do not think that that would be worth while.  It is not worth while living if life is not worth living, or if we should have to take such precautions against dying as would render life not worth living.  In the modern world, however, we should, I think, take some steps to stave off an air-raid.  The better we are able to deal with the results of an air-raid, the more likely we are to be left alone. Senator MacDermot and Senator Tierney said that nobody would make an air-raid here in order to strike terror or panic into our people.  There may be something in that, but the chance of such a raid will be rendered less the better we are able to cope with the results of such an attack, if attempted.</P>
      <P>Various Senators asked what other precautions besides these passive precautions we were taking against air raids.  That does not come into this Bill at all.  The military precautions, active precautions, are in a different category altogether.  We are, however, taking such steps as we think the country can afford to actively resist air raids if they should come.  We have a certain number of anti-aircraft guns and more on order; we have a certain number of aircraft and more on order; but even if we had all the aircraft at the disposal of one of the Continental Powers and all the anti-aircraft guns, you could not guarantee that a bombing raid would not come through.  Therefore, we still come down to the individuals on the ground, who will more or less have to look after themselves.  All we want to do is to teach the community to look after itself and to take care of itself&mdash; to get out of harm's way as best it can. We are not going to ask the people of County Leitrim to spend any vast sum of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> There is a schedule here of towns where we propose to put fairly intensive precautions into operation, that is, Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Waterford, Bray, Cobh, Drogheda, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire and Wexford.  Apart from those, very little money will be required, but, as I say, there would be no use in dimming lights in Dublin if the lights in County Dublin were not dimmed, or if some of the lights in Meath were not dimmed.  There are certain little things that will have to be done throughout the country if a signal is given that an air raid is coming. There are certain other things, such as fire apparatus, that are badly required even for peace-time purposes, that should be organised so as to put the temptation out of anybody's way of attacking a town, knowing that it will be destroyed if only a few incendiary bombs are dropped on it.  All that we contemplate asking the county councils to do would not amount to a decimal point of a penny in the rates.</P>

You have the assurance, from the governmental point of view, that they will not be anxious to do more in air-raid precautions than is absolutely necessary because they would be paying twice as much as the local authority.  The State has to safeguard itself against being asked to undertake unnecessary works in counties or towns or villages in which there is very little danger of anything happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Second Reading of the Public Hospitals (Amendment) Bill, 1939. Under the Public Hospitals Act, 1933, Section 12, a specified proportion of the money derived from the sale of tickets can be applied to expenses incurred in the holding of a sweepstake, and while the proportion so applicable has been found sufficient, the promoters of sweepstakes have represented to the Government that a sudden change of circumstances might render the provisions in the Act of 1933 totally inadequate.  To meet such a contingency it is proposed to establish a reserve fund.  The sweepstake committee and the promoters whom they engage to conduct the sweepstake on their behalf must in the ordinary course incur heavy expenses a considerable time before money is received from the sale of tickets for a sweepstake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, therefore, considered desirable to establish a reserve to meet expenses that would not be fully covered by the percentage of receipts from the sale of tickets fixed by the Act of 1933.  The reserve fund will be allowed to accumulate until it reaches £250,000, and when that limit is reached there will be no further accumulation.  Any interest or dividends that accrue will be transferred to the Hospitals Trust Fund.  The reserve fund will be in the hands of the Hospitals Trust Board, and no payment will be made out of it unless the Minister is satisfied that the expenses cannot be met owing to an <Col N="137" /> emergency that could not have reasonably been foreseen by the committee. It will take some time before the reserve fund reaches the limit fixed, that is £250,000.  If it happens that the reserve fund is insufficient, payment of the expenses to such extent as may be necessary can be made out of the Hospitals Trust Fund on the direction of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to substitute for the code of laws known as the Poor Relief Acts new legal provisions to enable local authorities to assist the poor, and to appreciate the difficult situation which the Bill is designed to remedy a short outline of the main events leading up to the present position of the law may be of assistance.</P>
      <P>The Poor Relief Code started with the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1838, which introduced a system for the relief of the poor modelled on that which had been in existence in England. The Act provided for the division of the country into districts, which were called Unions.  In each Union the relief of the poor was entrusted to an elected body called a board of guardians and a workhouse was to be established in which the guardians could relieve destitute poor persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system grew and developed under subsequent Acts, one of which provided for the establishment of an infirmary in connection with each <Col N="138" /> workhouse and under a later Act a fever hospital was provided at each workhouse.  An Act passed in the year 1847 authorised guardians for the first time to grant relief outside the workhouse but only to certain specified classes of poor persons.  An Act passed in the year 1851 provided for the establishment of the dispensary service under which medicines, medical advice and treatment were provided for poor persons.  Further enactments gave powers to the boards of guardians to send inmates of workhouses to extern hospitals and to send afflicted persons such as blind, deaf and dumb to suitable institutions. Extensive powers were given in relation to children under which they could be boarded out in suitable homes, sent to special schools and placed in suitable trades.</P>
    <P>The Poor Relief Code remained in full force until the years 1920 to 1922. In those years the councils of several counties in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government of Dáil Eireann, believing that the existing poor law system was not suited to this country, took steps to reorganise the administration of the relief of the poor by means of schemes for the various counties.  The main features of these schemes were:</P>
    <P>(a)  the abolition of the existing system under which the poor were relieved in workhouses established in each poor law union;</P>
    <P>(b)  the centralisation of administration under one authority in each county;</P>
    <P>(c)  the establishment in each county of central institutions in which the poor of the county could be assisted; and</P>
    <P>(d)  the provision of power to enable poor persons to be assisted either in or out of the central institutions as might be thought desirable.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, legalised those schemes and gave power to the council of a county to which no existing scheme related to prepare a scheme <Col N="139" /> and submit it to the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister had power to confirm such scheme either without alteration or with such amendments, omissions, and additions as he deemed necessary, or to reject the scheme. The Minister was also empowered under the Act to amend and modify any county scheme.  The Act also contained a provision under which the council of a county and the council of an adjoining county borough, instead of preparing separate schemes might prepare a joint scheme for the county and the county borough.  Only two such schemes were prepared, one for Cork County and County Borough and the other for Waterford County and County Borough.  The Cork scheme provided for the division of the county into three areas with separate administration for each area.  The southern area of the county is administered jointly with the Cork County Borough by one administrative authority. Limerick County and County Borough Councils did not adopt a joint scheme. The two areas had separate schemes.</P>
    <P>The councils of Dublin County and the county borough did not prepare either a joint scheme or separate schemes, and in those two areas the Poor Relief Acts have remained in full operation subject to two amending Acts, one of which removed the restrictions which limited outdoor relief to certain classes of poor persons and empowered the local authorities at their discretion to relieve destitute poor persons either in or out of the workhouse, and the other provided for the establishment of three boards of assistance in the area instead of the three boards of guardians.  The boards of assistance, instead of being elected directly by the local government electors, are appointed by the county council in the case of two of the boards whose functional areas are wholly within the county, and by the county and county borough councils in the case of the third board, whose area is partly in the county and partly in the county borough.</P>
    <P>It can be readily understood that, with all the various changes and alterations which have been made in the <Col N="140" /> Poor Relief Acts since the year 1838, the code has grown very involved.  On many points it is often difficult to determine what is the law, not alone in view of various amendments, but having regard to the fact that the county schemes have to be taken as implying modifications of the law.  From the point of view of administration it is a matter of great importance that this position should be remedied, and that the law should be set out clearly and without ambiguity.</P>
    <P>Another reason for bringing forward this Bill is that the powers given by the Act of 1923 were temporary.  The Act was intended to give legal authority for the county schemes pending provision for more permanent legislation.  The Act has since been renewed from year to year, and it is very desirable that this position should be terminated.</P>
    <P>It may be well at this stage to refer to a further complication in the existing law which arises from the fact that the Poor Relief Acts, besides providing for the relief of the poor, contain provisions which have now become part of the general law of local government. This complex position is due to the manner in which local government has developed in this country.  The boards of guardians were the first elected bodies to administer any form of local government in rural districts, and when it was later decided to establish local services not relating to the relief of the poor, the administration of them was assigned to the boards of guardians. The guardians, for example, became rural sanitary authorities.  Subsequently, when county and district councils were established, provisions in the existing law relating to boards of guardians were utilised and applied to these councils.  As a consequence, the different codes of local government law have become intermingled to an extent that does not make for clarity or simplify administration.</P>
    <P>The main purposes of the Bill under consideration are:</P>
    <P>(a)  where the law is at present temporary, to place it on a permanent basis;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> (b)  to consolidate such provisions of the law as it is considered desirable to retain;</P>
    <P>(c)  to repeal any provisions considered obsolete or inapplicable to existing circumstances; and</P>
    <P>(d)  to introduce any amendments necessary to meet present conditions.</P>
    <P>The Bill will include all the law relating solely to the administration of public assistance, but it will not include provisions which apply generally to all local administration.  Such matters as borrowing powers, local inquiries, duties of inspectors, audit of accounts, appointment of officers, although essential to the administration of public assistance, relate generally to all the local government services.  These will be dealt with in a Local Government Bill, and it will not be possible to bring the present Bill into force before the Local Government Bill is also in force, or some other provisions are made for these matters.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the general scheme of the Bill calls for any explanation as all its provisions are clear and self-explanatory, but a few comments on the more important provisions may be necessary.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the administration of the law relating to public assistance (which term is to replace the term &ldquo;poor relief&rdquo;) shall be subject to the general direction and control of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  For the purpose of administration the Bill states that the State is to be divided into public assistance districts.  In this matter the Bill makes no change as the districts provided for are those already in existence.  Each public assistance district is to be administered by a public assistance authority.  In Dublin City and County the public assistance authorities are to be the existing boards of assistance.  Where a public assistance district consists of a county borough the public assistance authority is to be the Corporation of the County Borough.  Where the district consists of a county borough and a county, or part of a county, the public assistance authority is to be a <Col N="142" /> board of public assistance elected by the Corporation of the County Borough and the Council of the County.  In other cases the public assistance authority is to be the County Council. This latter is the only change proposed as regards local administrative authorities and it is included in anticipation of proposed legislation to give counties the benefit of the manager system which operates in county boroughs.</P>
    <P>The definition of the classes of persons who will be eligible for assistance in pursuance of the Bill is similar to that contained in the county schemes but somewhat more detailed.  It is specifically laid down as the duty of the public assistance authority to give public assistance to every person in their district eligible therefor, but in this matter they are allowed a discretion, in that they may give such assistance as may appear to them to be necessary or proper in each particular case.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the public assistance authority may provide for persons eligible for assistance maintenance, training, education and treatment in institutions, which institutions may be institutions maintained by the public assistance authority or institutions not so maintained.  In this respect their powers will largely resemble those at present possessed by them.  Provision is made in the Bill for assistance outside institutions which include home assistance and medical assistance.</P>
    <P>The public assistance authorities will be required to provide institutions and to carry out improvements thereto as directed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to some of the powers proposed to be given by the Bill to public assistance authorities namely:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the power given in Section 20 to assist societies for relieving poor persons by contributing to their expenses, by supplying fuel, light, food, water or other commodity, by providing premises with furniture and fittings, and executing alterations and repairs to such premises;</P>
    <P>(b)  the power given in Section 21 to provide land for any public hospital or infirmary where satisfied <Col N="143" /> that the treatment given in such hospital or infirmary renders useful aid in the administration of public assistance.</P>
    <P>(c)  the provisions of Section 22 as regards the payment of expenses of removal of a person eligible for assistance (with or without dependents), where such removal is likely to enable the person to support himself and his dependents by his own industry or other lawful means, and is generally for their benefit;</P>
    <P>(d)  the provision contained in Section 49 which enables a public assistance authority to contribute to the support, maintenance and education in an approved institution of any child who is deaf, dumb, blind, imbecile, idiot, epileptic or crippled, and whose parents are unable by reason of poverty to provide adequately for the training of the child;</P>
    <P>(e)  the power given in Section 63 to enable a public assistance authority to have land inspected for the purpose of ascertaining whether it is suitable for acquisition.</P>
    <P>Special powers conferred on the Minister to which I might draw attention are those contained in Section 11 as regards the establishment of committees for two or more public assistance authorities for any purpose connected with the administration of public assistance where it appears to the Minister that joint administration would tend to reduce expense or be otherwise of public or local advantage.</P>
    <P>Section 25 empowers the Minister to prescribe methods for determining the cost of different kinds of public assistance. This will simplify proceedings in a court dealing with an application for the recovery of the cost of assistance.</P>
    <P>Section 35 will empower the Minister to direct that institutional assistance to a particular class of persons shall only be given in a special institution for that class where such is available.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 38 I might point <Col N="144" /> out that hitherto the Minister when altering or rearranging dispensary districts could not divide a district electoral division.  When the Bill becomes law that restriction will no longer operate.</P>
    <P>Section 41 gives the Minister power to require a public assistance authority to keep a dispensary in proper condition and repair.  Hitherto he has not possessed this power.  The Minister is also given a new power by Section 42, under which he may direct a public assistance authority to provide a residence for a dispensary officer.</P>
    <P>Section 85 will empower the Minister to abolish any of the remaining county infirmaries.  Hitherto the Minister could abolish a county infirmary by amending a county scheme.  Seven such institutions still remain, and it may at some future time be considered desirable to have power to abolish a county infirmary in the interests of better hospital organisation.</P>
    <P>The extensive provisions of the Bill for the protection of children are largely taken from the existing law. One important change is that the age up to which a child is a dependent for the purposes of the Bill has been raised from 15 to 16 years.  Another provision prohibits the placing of a child under the age of 14 years at service or in a trade, calling or business.</P>
    <P>The powers given in connection with the burial of the remains of poor persons are more extended than those already possessed.  A public assistance authority will, under the Bill, be able to bring home for burial the body of a poor person who died outside their district.</P>
    <P>As regards finance, the moneys required by a public assistance authority are to be raised equally over the whole of the public assistance district.  Beyond fixing the borrowing limit, the Bill contains no provisions as regards borrowing, as this matter will be dealt with in the general Local Government Bill.  The borrowing limit fixed is the same as that hitherto in force, namely, one-fourth of the valuation.</P>
    <P>The powers to be given to the public assistance authority to acquire land <Col N="145" /> are the same as those contained in the Public Assistance (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1934, which the Bill proposes to re-enact.</P>
    <P>I might conclude by saying that the need for this Bill has long been felt by persons engaged in public administration. More than one public commission has given recommendation to some of the Provisions contained in the Bill. I think that the Bill has at least one point to recommend it in that it contains none of the rigidity which characterised the Poor Relief Acts.  It is much more elastic, particularly as regards the provision of institutions in relation to which it does not tie down the responsible authorities to the provision of one or two institutions of a particular class, but leaves the position open so as to afford every opportunity for the growth and development of improved ideas for the institutional assistance of the poor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>As no other Senator wishes to speak I shall pass a few remarks.  My first remark is to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Local Government for producing such a voluminous document.  It is more or less a codification of the laws going back for 100 years.  We are now in 1939 and the first Act in relation to poor relief was passed by the British Government in 1838.  The other subsequent Acts are some partly and some wholly repealed in this Bill, which I hope will soon become an Act.  It has certainly entailed an immense amount of work in the Department, and I must say that it would entail an immense amount of study for any Senator to digest it in the short time at his disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps, in Committee, some Senators will have some remarks to pass on different clauses of the Bill. I cannot say that I am conversant to any great extent with much of the subject matter of it, but the thing that strikes me particularly, and on which I want to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary, is that it is a codification&mdash; and, I hope, a simplification&mdash;of the Poor Relief system.  It will be of <Col N="146" /> great assistance to local authorities in the operation of home assistance and public assistance in the future.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to some new Bills, and&mdash;though it may be out of order&mdash;as I am on my feet, I would like to remind him that officials of local authorities are waiting for a Bill to he introduced by the Minister for Local Government for some time, relative to the resignation of office and superannuation of local authorities' officials, in order to bring them something into line with the position that exists with regard to the Civil Service. If an officer of a local authority dies at any time, his dependents get nothing; his salary is cut off from the day he dies.  We have been for a long time looking for a reform of that system.  I hope that, now that the Department has succeeded in doing such a magnificent amount of work as this for public assistance, they will assist public officers by bringing in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean to speak on this Bill at all, but I cannot let it pass, being the only woman here, without congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary on removing the horrible word, the horrible appellation, &ldquo;pauper&rdquo;.  This Bill puts the coping stone on this social legislation of which Irish people must be proud, and the spirit of the Bill must commend itself to us all.  It is full of delicate charity, and it preserves the human rights of the poor people, and especially of the children.  I hope we shall be able to go through it more carefully in Committee, but I do think that it is an occasion on which we should all congratulate ourselves, and that it is one of those occasions on which we show up best, when we Irish people come together and show our respect for the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in his review of a hundred years of social legislation, made us think of the times when the workhouses were established, when the people were herded into them, fathers and mothers separated and children put in another place, as described in most moving terms by Canon O'Leary.  We are glad to think that in this Ireland of ours, in this land we are trying to <Col N="147" /> build up, our first thought is for the poor.  I most heartily congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJohnston" hpid="Mr. James Johnston Mr. James Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill with all the strength I can command, and, in addition, to support what Senator O'Donovan and Senator Mrs. Concannon have said, and to add a few words to their remarks.  I certainly congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the care and the pains he has taken on this codification of the laws passed from 1838 to the present day, and I particularly admire the remarks of Senator Mrs. Concannon in relation to what is proposed to be done for the poor.  I would remind Senators, as one coming from the North, from County Monaghan, where we have a large population, and as one who, from his childhood days, had some experience of the powers that then were, of how the poor people were treated under the old boards of guardians before the Local Government Act of 1898 was passed.  I am very proud to be a member of this House and to be living in this country at present, when protection is being given to, and provision made for, the poor and, in addition to the poor, for those who are in any way disabled as to sight, hearing and speech.  Provision is being made for them now.  It has been made for some long time past, but, in my early days, that was not the case.  Although I am not yet in the centuries, I well remember what the conditions were in the northern counties, some 30 or 40 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Still further, this is a step to confirm and to put on a better footing, while not necessarily putting into operation, some of the urgent work of members of public bodies, of which I have some knowledge from 1919, when the first Dáil was set up in Dublin, in respect of the amalgamation of local boards of guardians into one body known as a board of health or a board of public assistance.  The work done at that time was done quietly.  It has been carried out since practically from year to year.  This Bill puts it into complete form, so that it will be quite easy for members of public bodies and <Col N="148" /> officials to understand and administer it.  Up to the present any member of a public body who wished to carry out his duties as a public representative would require to spend a good deal of his time in studying these matters, but this will simplify the various Acts, and I hope the Seanad will pass the Bill without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill, and I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on bringing it forward.  At the same time, there are a few points which I would wish to put before him, while he is here, in connection with relief.  I should like to say, in regard to the arrangement proposed for County Dublin, that I am not pleased, because for the Dublin public health area there are going to be three different authorities for the administration of relief.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will look into that point.  I have been a member of the Dublin County Council for the past ten years, and I say that there is great dissatisfaction amongst the poor and amongst those who are forced to apply for relief owing to the different methods of administration.</P>
      <P>I will give the Parliamentary Secretary one case, the case of dentures, which is very serious for some of the residents of the county.  The Balrothery Board of Assistance has always given free dentures to the poor in their area, but in the district in which I reside, which is in the area of the Dublin Board of Assistance, free dentures are not given.  I have been elected for the No. 1 area, which is North Dublin and Balrothery, and it is hard on the people living around me who cannot get these free dentures when they see the people in Balrothery getting them.  As a matter of fact, I have had several complaints, and they go so far as to say that those of us in North Dublin are not doing our duty.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to look into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Rathdown, I suggest very strongly that, so far as County Dublin is concerned, the Board of Health should be the authority because the position, as it exists now, is very awkward.  There are three different authorities and there is also a very <Col N="149" /> wide difference in the amounts given by the different boards.  On the question of relief, we would all congratulate ourselves if we had reached the time when there would be no necessity for this Bill.  I say sincerely that I give the greatest possible praise to the present Administration for what they have done for the poorer classes, the classes least able to help themselves, but there are a few points which, if conceded, would almost finish the question of poor relief altogether.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary will make inquiries, he will agree that half the people in receipt of outdoor relief in Dublin City are people who are out from work sick, and for whom the amount which they get in National Health Insurance is insufficient, with the result that they have to go to the relieving officer to supplement this small amount they get from National Health Insurance.  I feel that the time should come when the working man should receive sufficient from National Health Insurance to meet his needs.</P>
    <P>Then, again, there is the question of non-contributory widows.  It is very hard on these people who have to get relief from two sources.  I know that I am a little out of order in discussing this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator, being conscious of that fact, will be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Three-quarters of those in receipt of outdoor relief in Dublin are represented by those two classes, and it is a terrible pity that such a large section should have to apply to two sources for the small amount they receive.  I hope the time will come when that position will be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary who is going to be the authority in the matter of admission? Is there going to be an admission board, who will have to decide who is or is not entitled to outdoor relief?  For the last few years I have been fairly conversant with the administration of home assistance in Dublin.  The position is peculiar.  The applicant applies to the relieving officer and the relieving officer is not always able to tell whether the applicant is to receive it. <Col N="150" /> He says it is going before the board. Are the board of assistance the people who are to decide who is or is not entitled to relief?  On that point I might say there are many people who are in receipt of out-door relief at present who are not aware whether it is the relieving officer or the board who grants the relief.  The old position that obtained in the country is not the position now.  I am given to understand that that is so.  I would like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary make that point clear.  Is there to be an admission board?</P>
    <P>In connection with the existing staffs I have a few words to say.  I now refer to the people who are dealing with the relief of able-bodied persons. There was a very big staff added on by the board some 10 years ago, and some of these people are at present very uneasy about their positions.  I wish to pay this compliment to these people, and indeed to the relief supervisors in Dublin, that they are working under very great difficulties.  The application form put in is a very simple form.  The relief officer investigates the case; often the applicant does not give full information.  If the applicant is destitute, the relieving officer cannot tell him that he has no remedy.  I do hope that no injustice will be done to the existing staff.  I have been asked to mention the matter.  I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would give us some information.  These relieving officers had the difficult work of being fair to the applicants for relief and being fair to the ratepayers at the same time.  They did their work in a remarkably honest way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as I welcome anything that is for the upliftment of those who are not in a position to help themselves.  I hope from the introduction of this Bill that we will have in the country in future the feeling that nobody will go hungry.  It is not the wish of any of us nor of any ratepayers that people should go hungry.  Like Senator Mrs. Concanon I would be glad to see the assistance that was given coming from a source to which there would be no stain of pauperism attached.  I would be much more pleased if that were so.</P>
    <Col N="151" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, I want to ask the Minister a question with reference to Section 24 relating to work as a condition for receiving general assistance.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  A public assistance authority may, as a condition of the granting of general assistance to a person, require such person, either before or after or during receipt of such general assistance, to perform such work as such authority shall consider suitable to the sex, age, strength, and capacity of such person and shall direct such person so to perform.</P>
      <P>That looks very much like a revival of the old principle compelling people to break loads of stones when they entered the local workhouse.  Is the section a revival of that principle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could enlighten me on a couple of points.  The question as to the definition of &ldquo;poor persons&rdquo; has always created some trouble.  Heretofore the status of a person who was entitled to relief was defined.  There is now in this Bill no such indication as to what &ldquo;poor person&rdquo; means.  Different people may have different ideas.  In some cases people have a small patch of land, and these are not looked upon as &ldquo;poor persons&rdquo; whereas they are in actual fact very often in dire poverty.  They may have a small patch of ground or perhaps a few hens, or some little industry of their own, and because of these things they are deprived of badly-needed help.  A person, no matter how poor, if he has no dependents, is not entitled to any assistance, medical or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is how it appeared to me on an early reading of the Bill.  Whether actual dependents themselves are entitled to any assistance, or home assistance of any kind, is a point on which I am not clear.  There is another point.  Those receiving a certain amount of home assistance are expected to do a certain amount of work.  Does the relation <Col N="152" /> between worker and employer exist in such circumstances?  Is the employer in this case, say the board, bound to give him any stamps for the work performed?  I think the person receiving relief should in such circumstances be placed in the position of an ordinary worker and when there is sufficient work done to merit a stamp, that stamp should be given and the man should be entitled to unemployment insurance.</P>
      <P>Apart from these things I think the Bill makes for good.  It is a very elaborate Bill.  The setting up and putting this Bill into operation will require special attention.  In all bodies formed under the Bill some of the personnel should be ladies of experience who understand the home and who are generally more sympathetic with poverty than the average man of the world and have perhaps a better understanding of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather a pleasant task to undertake to conclude a debate that has been conducted in the friendly spirit in which this debate has been carried on and with the congratulations that the Ministry have received from the various Senators. No doubt its preparation has been an enormous task.  There is no denying that.  As Senator O'Donovan has pointed out, the poor law relief code over a period of 100 years embodied some 36 Acts.  The repeal and codification of some of these Acts had to be gone into and carefully reviewed; obsolete and objectionable terms and phrases in the old enactments had to be eliminated, and a draft produced more in accordance with the happy position in which we find ourselves to-day&mdash;indeed, more in accordance with the dignity of the poor and the dignity of the Christian State.  When I mention that enormous work, I do not wish to take credit for it myself. The officials of my Department, who have assisted in the drafting of this Bill and who have assisted in embodying and enshrining the policy of the Government of the day in this comprehensive piece of proposed legislation, deserve the major portion of the credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> Senator O'Donovan would like to extract some information from me regarding the possible contents of a Bill that has not yet come before the House.  All I can say to Senator O'Donovan on that score is that a Local Government Bill is in course of preparation and I should like to draw his attention to the fact that the &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; on which this Bill is to come into operation is to be fixed by the Minister.  This Bill will not come into operation until two other, more or less, collateral Bills&mdash;the Managerial Bill and the Local Government Bill&mdash;become law.</P>
    <P>The three measures will become operative about the same time.  The Local Government Bill will deal with officers.  How it is going to deal with them is another question.  It will deal in detail with the status, conditions, rights, remuneration, terms of office and age of retirement of officers.  Perhaps I have told the Senator too much. He will, however, be satisfied that officers have been adequately and fully dealt with when he comes to read the Local Government Bill.  There was just one note of complaint&mdash;from Senator Tunney.  Senator Tunney would like to have one public assistance authority for Dublin City and County.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>For Dublin County only. I am concerned only with Dublin County.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does not make any alteration in the areas of administration as they stand to-day.  Under the 1923 Act, the counties and county boroughs, with the exception of Dublin, adopted county schemes.  Dublin City and County failed to adopt any county scheme.  When this Bill was first introduced, it was not intended to apply it to Dublin City and County at all.  The old poor relief code operated in Dublin City and County.  We have now extended the provisions of the Bill to Dublin City and County, but we are not making any alterations in the public assistance areas.  The three unions&mdash;Dublin, Balrothery and Rathdown&mdash;will remain the public assistance areas under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> I should like to remind Senator Tunney that the Dublin tribunal held a long and detailed inquiry largely into the question of the geographical areas which should constitute the new City of Dublin.  When this other pressing legislation shall have been dealt with, I have no doubt that a Bill will be introduced to deal with that position. I think that Senator Tunney must find himself much in the same position regarding the areas that will constitute Dublin County as Senator O'Donovan finds himself in regarding the officers. I am not in a position to anticipate as regards the area of the new county. It is a possibility that Dublin City might swallow it up altogether, or the major portion of it.  If, as a result of the recommendations of the Greater Dublin Tribunal, such legislation comes about, and the existing areas are materially altered in their geographical outline, consequential alterations will probably have to be made in relation to the public assistance districts, but until that matter is disposed of it cannot be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Senator Tunney seems to have some doubt as to the present system of administration of public assistance in his area&mdash;whether the public assistance officer, or the relieving officer, as he was termed in the old days, and as Dublin calls him still, or the board of assistance is the final authority.  There is no doubt about it under the Bill, and there should not be any doubt about it under the existing law.  In the interval between meetings of the assistance authority the public assistance authority affords public assistance in urgent cases.  He reports to the first meeting of the board of assistance, and whether the assistance is to be continued or discontinued is determined, or ought to be determined by the board of assistance. It is not proposed to make any alteration in that position now, but when this Bill becomes law Senators ought to bear in mind that it will probably be operating under a managerial system, and perhaps in that way some of the difficulties Senator Tunney has in mind will disappear.  The staffs <Col N="155" /> of the existing local authorities in Dublin City and County need have no anxiety.  No change is being made in their status under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Goulding was concerned about Section 24.  Sub-section (1) of Section 24 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A public assistance authority may, as a condition of the granting of general assistance to a person, require such person, either before or after or during receipt of such general assistance, to perform such work as such authority shall consider suitable to the sex, age, strength, and capacity of such person, and shall direct such person so to perform.</P>
    <P>That is not a new principle at all. Neither is it, to my mind, either a degrading or a wrong principle, from any point of view.  I should like to point out to Senator Goulding that that particular clause is in the public assistance code which is operating at the present time.  It may not become operative under this Bill, but it might be desirable that it should be operative when you read the qualification explicitly set out, &ldquo;suitable to the sex, age, strength and capacity of such person&rdquo;. In this regard, I am expressing a personal view, but, I believe, a view that would be held by most of the sensible members of this House&mdash;that an able-bodied man in receipt of home assistance, if an able-bodied man is in receipt of home assistance, should be liable to be called upon to do some work, and that it would be far better physically, morally, and every other way for him to be doing some work than to be drawing public assistance from the local authority and allowing himself to become demoralised by idleness and to get into such a physical condition that, when work would be offered to him, he would not be able to do it.</P>
    <P>Senator Goulding probably did not advert to the fact that, under the code as we hope to see it operate within the four walls of this Bill, able-bodied persons will be eligible for public assistance.  In the old days able-bodied persons used not be eligible for public assistance and, of course, it is <Col N="156" /> not intended to ask anybody other than able-bodied persons to do a task of work.</P>
    <P>Senator Cummins is concerned about the interpretation of the definition of a poor person or a person who would be entitled to public assistance. I have given a good deal of thought to that and we have searched for as wide a formula as it is possible to get. I think the formula embodied in this Bill gives ample scope for the exercise of the discretion of the public assistance authority and, in fact, the public assistance authority can in their wisdom determine, regardless of what amount of land any man may hold, that he is still a poor person and entitled to assistance if they of their local knowledge believe that that is so. Section 17 (1) of this Bill reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A poor person who is unable to provide by his own industry or other lawful means the necessaries of life (other than medical, surgical or dental treatment, medicines, and medical, surgical or dental appliances) for himself or any persons whom he is liable under this Act to maintain shall be eligible for general assistance.</P>
    <P>Not only the person himself shall be eligible for assistance, but anybody whom he is liable to maintain.  I think that is fairly comprehensive.</P>
    <P>The other point that was raised by Senator Cummins related to the question of the stamping of cards for persons who might be engaged in work for a local authority as a condition of public assistance.  National health insurance cards are stamped, and the conditions of master and servant as understood in the Workmen's Compensation Act will exist.  In other words, the Workmen's Compensation Act will apply when they are engaged in any such work.  I think that probably fully meets what the Senator has in mind.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else that was raised on the Bill that it is necessary to deal with at this stage. Perhaps between this and the Committee Stage members of the House would study the Bill in detail, and <Col N="157" /> those of them who are members of local authorities and who have practical knowledge of the administration of public assistance and the difficulties encountered may be able to make some useful suggestions on the later stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="158" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 11th July.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.15 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 11th July, 1939.</P>
