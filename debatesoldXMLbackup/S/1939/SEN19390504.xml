    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel that I have very much to say about this measure but, at the same time, I think it will be generally agreed that no responsible member of this House could be put a more perplexing problem to-day than to decide what to do about it.  On the one hand, all our human instincts sort of rebel against the request of the Government to confer these extraordinary powers upon them.  From what we heard from the Minister yesterday, and from what he said up to the present, there does not seem to be great cause for the introduction of this measure.  It may be that there is much more which the Minister might say.  It would be better if he had told us if there are reasons, other than those he has given, why the Government is now asking for these powers, because the question that is at the back of my mind is: In what way will these powers be used when they are conferred upon the Government?  I suppose they are being sought because of our past.  As was said by other Senators yesterday regarding the Treason Bill, our past was a very strange one indeed, and the immediate past and the present are so closely linked up with the activities of the Minister's Party, that it is very difficult to argue that the conditions which confront him to-day are not conditions that he shared in the making of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Senator O'Donovan telling the House, when speaking on the Treason Bill, that he had a certain attitude towards treason some time ago, but that his attitude had changed since the passing of the Constitution, No. 18. <Col N="1544" /> one got a peep into that type of mentality. A representative in this, or in the other House who can talk like that, and who has that attitude towards the State, is prepared to say, merely because of the fact that his Party has come to the top and secured a majority, that what was wrong yesterday becomes right to-day.  That is the doctrine that was propagated some time ago, and even members of this House, by inference, propagate the same doctrine to-day.  What one has to do then is to ask, will the measure be operated in a calm and impartial way?  If one were satisfied that these extraordinary powers were to be exercised with discretion one might feel less uneasy.  That is something about which I am not too satisfied.  I suppose it is impossible to separate in one's mind the sort of action of the Government Party on various issues which have been raised in the past, and their attitude towards the application of the law and, indeed, certain other activities.  There one finds the Minister making a declaration with which no one could quarrel.  It was an acceptable statement.  It seemed to be full of reason and all the rest, but somehow the application of these principles, at least from my experience, very frequently represent the point of view, not of sanity and levelheadedness that one expects from the Executive Council, but rather the extreme point of view of the narrow, bigoted experienced Party man, of which we have personal experience.</P>
    <P>The operation of the law in the past can be pointed to as the cause of apprehension as to what may happen in the future.  During the past five or six years I have had the experience myself that, as far as the protection of the law is concerned, it was denied to some and given to others.  At public meetings I had the experience of not getting the protection of the law.  I was entitled to have it but I did not get it, while I saw it being given to others side by side with me.  I have had other experiences of the sort of injustice that the citizen <i>qua</i> citizen can get. In view of all that, one must have misgivings as to how this measure may be applied.  The measure itself is no doubt very complete.  It must be the <Col N="1545" /> most perfect public safety Bill that has ever been introduced in the Oireachtas.  One feels inclined to say that the old poacher certainly makes a very good gamekeeper.  I say that because the Minister seems to have made provision in this Bill for meeting every possible contingency.</P>
    <P>On a historic occasion about ten years ago it was my duty, as a member of the Dáil, to vote for a measure something like this but not so extreme or far-reaching as this is.  The conditions at that time were very different from those that prevail to-day.  The problems that the State and its representatives had to face then were far different from what they are to-day.  I am speaking of 1927 when, for the first time, I was called upon to give my approval or disapproval to a measure something like this.  I can recall the conditions that existed then, and the reasons and the justification which were put before us as to why we should give the Ministry the powers they asked for.  I confess that if the conditions in 1927 were the same as they are to-day, the Ministry of that day would not have been given the powers it asked for.  One must remember that at that time one of the greatest men this country has produced, the late Kevin O'Higgins, had been assassinated. From some experience that I had immediately after his death, I should perhaps say that his was one of the greatest minds in the Europe of his time.  I did not know him very well.  I had had some experience of his sledge hammer blows when driving home his point of view in the course of Parliamentary debate, and was very frequently in conflict with his point of view.</P>
    <P>After his death the leaders of the various political groups in the Dáil were invited to meet the then President of the Executive Council.  I was one of the two from the Farmers' Party.  Two others attended from the other two Parties, the Labour Party and the other Party.  I should say that I was the youngest and most inexperienced of all those who gathered around the table of the President of the Executive Council on that occasion.  It was put to us that the situation then <Col N="1546" /> existing was so grave that the powers we were asked to give were felt to be necessary.  I urged that nothing of a panicky nature should be done: that to do anything of the kind at that particular moment, instead of steadying the country, might produce the contrary effect, and that bearing in mind the whole structure of the Government of the country, it might possibly be advisable to postpone taking any action.  The others who were there did not subscribe to that point of view, at any rate with the vehemence that I did.  In the course of our discussions the leader of the Labour Party put this question to Mr. Cosgrave: &ldquo;What are you going to do about filling the Vice-Presidency?&rdquo; Mr. Cosgrave answered: &ldquo;That is going to be done the next day the Dáil meets: they may get me any day, and there must be some man to step into my shoes.&rdquo;  That was the atmosphere in which our discussions were carried on around the table.  The then President of the Executive Council meant what he said, and everybody there believed that he meant what he said: he looked it, and the others looked it too, and it was in those circumstances that we agreed on that particular day to give a general assent to the introduction of a measure which we were informed was necessary for the protection of the State and the Ministers of the State.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go into the subsequent history or tell of the difficulties that confronted me when the Dáil met two or three days afterwards.  The first thing I found was that the other Party leaders had changed their point of view, and that I, who had the least desire for the introduction of such a measure, was left alone to keep my word and carry on.  But I remember this, and shall always remember it: that over hill and dale the people who are in the Government Party to-day pursued me for my support of that measure at that time: they pursued me ruthlessly and very successfully too, in the political sense.  Now we find ourselves up against this situation to-day, very different indeed from the situation ten years ago.  I say, thanks be to God, that the Minister of to-day <Col N="1547" /> is not required to make the plea that had to be made ten years ago for the measure then introduced.  The Ministers of to-day have not the threat hanging over their heads that the Ministers of State had at that period. When I think of the great change that has come over the minds of those in the Fianna Fáil Party in the past ten years, and indeed within a much shorter period, I realise how their education has advanced, and what responsibility means to men, as well as what actions they are driven to take when responsibility is put upon them.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should say that all that has happened in this State has been for the best.  As I said earlier, the old poacher certainly makes a good gamekeeper. I feel at any rate that the Minister is going very far indeed in asking for the powers enshrined in this Bill.  I confess that when the Minister told us yesterday, with regard to the Treason Bill, that it was conceivable that the Attorney-General might proceed against people under some Act other than the Treason Act, it occurred to me that there must be many Acts of Parliament, comprising the ordinary law, which could be made use of effectively for dealing with many of the offences in this Bill.  Because of that, the Minister will have to show more justification than he has done for the extraordinary powers he is seeking in this Bill before he will get my support for it.</P>
    <P>I will make the Minister this concession, and it is to a certain extent repeating something I said in 1927, when I was, as I regarded, being very unfairly attacked in the Dáil by the men who had sat around the council table with me and had given assent to the introduction of the particular measure which we were discussing at that time.  I indicated then that if there was general support on the part of the responsible leaders for a measure to protect the State and the Ministers of the State, it is possible to do with a less drastic measure than is perhaps necessary when you are faced with the opposition of a very large and perhaps violent majority.  I will make the Minister this concession, and I think it only right to do so, that all of us <Col N="1548" /> who have been watching the course of this Bill through the other House appreciate the Minister's approach to the situation with which he, this House and the other House are confronted to-day.  He certainly acted in a reasonable and fair way, and with an open mind.  That, so far as I am concerned, has definitely influenced my attitude towards the measure.  In other circumstances I would, I believe, have been active in opposing it, but when the Minister is prepared to be reasonable, as he was, one feels that one is not justified in being unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Personally I do not believe in playing politics in a matter like this.  I do not believe in behaving as other people have behaved in the past, to the detriment of the State and, indeed, to a certain extent discrediting their own reputations now when they look back on the general behaviour of those days. I do not believe that is in the best interests of the State.  I have no desire whatever to capitalise the position in which I find myself to-day and in which the Minister is to-day.  I do not think that, in the long run and taking the long view, that is the sort of line that any of us should pursue who feel that we have responsibilities to the State to make it more stable, to improve it, and to improve also the conditions of the people in it.  On the other hand, I am not satisfied that the conditions in the country to-day justify the giving of these extraordinary powers to the Minister.  The Minister, in my view anyhow, has not put before us sufficient evidence to warrant our giving these powers to him.</P>
    <P>I will, however, say this, that the Minister certainly has information which is not at my disposal.  He may have information of which he does not feel he should put the House in possession. If the Minister argues very strongly that this measure is necessary and requisite for the preservation of stable, peaceful conditions in the State, and the protection of the lives of Ministers and of the people of the State, I confess I have no answer to that argument.  If he argues that strongly, and says that there are reasons other than those which he has given us, which he cannot give, for asking <Col N="1549" /> for these powers, I am not prepared to stand against him, but I confess that when I look back to the circumstances of other times, and to the attitude I had to take on another occasion, I am perfectly convinced that the conditions as they are to-day do not warrant the giving of these powers, if you make a comparison between conditions now and conditions as they existed ten years ago, when the Minister and all associated with him denounced very strongly and vehemently, and used all available means to prove that all and sundry who gave any support or countenance to the measure passed then did a foul deed and had blood on their hands which they could never wash off.  I am not prepared, on the other hand, to stand as a sort of bush in the gap, if the Minister says he has no alternative but to get these powers, and that they are necessary and requisite for the protection of the State and the lives of the citizens.  I would be prepared to give my active support to the measure, if I were satisfied by the Minister, as I was satisfied on another occasion, that it was necessary. He has not satisfied me yet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think our people have very much to say on this Bill. They are satisfied that it is a bad Bill in that it puts the liberty of the ordinary people in jeopardy.  The trade union movement view the Bill with very serious apprehension.  They believe that, in its present form, it could be used to break up, to imprison the members and to confiscate the funds of a trade union.  There is one section, Section 9, sub-section (2), which I hope the Minister will try to justify.  It sets out:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person who shall incite or encourage any person employed in any capacity by the State to refuse, neglect, or omit (in a manner or to an extent calculated to dislocate the public service or a branch thereof) to perform his duty or shall incite or encourage any person so employed to be negligent or insubordinate (in such manner or to such extent as aforesaid) in the performance of his duty shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and shall be liable on conviction <Col N="1550" /> thereof to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious section for the trade union movement.  Any employee of this State who happens to be a member of a trade union and who believes he has a legitimate grievance, and who adopts the ordinary trade union machinery for having his grievance remedied, comes immediately under that section, and the trade union giving him its protection and exercising the ordinary functions of a trade union would find itself in very grave trouble.  That, in itself, apart from anything else in the Bill, has caused very serious apprehension in the trade union movement.  As I said, generally, the Bill is so bad and could be used to deprive the subjects of this State of their liberty to such an extent that we must vote against the Bill <i>in globo.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister assures us that there is a necessity for this Bill, and we must accept his assurance, although there appears to be little, if any, outward evidence to substantiate that assurance.  The position appears to be rather different from what it was when a somewhat similar measure had to be introduced in 1927.  Thanks be to God, no Minister of State has been murdered on this occasion.  We sincerely trust that no Minister of State ever will be murdered in this country again.  There are, however, other aspects of this Bill.  While accepting the Minister's assurance that it is necessary, the Bill in itself is a very drastic document which interferes with and purports to take away most of the rights of the citizens of this State, which they are supposed to enjoy under this free Constitution that we have been hearing so much about lately.  I may say that, as far as I am personally concerned, I do not intend to obstruct this Bill; and I must pay tribute to the reasonable manner in which the Minister handled the Bill in the Dáil and the reasonable manner in which he accepted suggestions and amendments.  Even as amended by the Dáil, there are still a lot of very objectionable features in this Bill&mdash; features which notably interfere with the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of expression of opinion <Col N="1551" /> either by speech or in writing&mdash;and I trust that, on the Committee Stage, the Minister will prove to be as reasonable in this House as he was in the Lower House and that he will accept any amendments that are produced dealing with that portion of the Bill. Otherwise, I intend, personally, to facilitate the passage of the Bill on the Minister's assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Baxter made reference to the extraordinary powers sought in this Bill.  Those extraordinary powers will never be used except in an emergency.  I take it that in normal times the average citizen need not worry his head about the Bill. But we may not be living in normal times always.  The times are not quite normal all over Europe to-day.  You have so-called ideologies&mdash;strange ideologies&mdash;worshipped by quite a number of people; and in this country we have probably some people who believe in one or other of those ideologies. In the event of those people endeavouring to upset a democratic State such as ours is and endeavouring to force these new ideologies on the people of this country, these extraordinary powers would be necessary; and, despite the fears of the Labour men that these would be used against the labour interests&mdash;I think they are exaggerating those fears&mdash;there is no danger that the powers in this Bill will ever be used for the suppression of ordinary trade union activities. Trade unions are entitled to their organisation, entitled to protest, to organise against oppression if oppression exists; but there will never be any danger that the powers will be used to destroy their organisation.  No legitimate use made by the trade unions of their own powers will come under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that many of those who have been speaking on this Bill&mdash;both in the Lower House and in this House&mdash;have been suffering from undue fears.  None of us likes these things at all: we do not like Treason Acts, we do not like Acts of this nature to protect the people of the State; but these Acts are necessary.  If all the people in this State always had the interests of the <Col N="1552" /> State at heart, and were prepared to put the interests of the State before their private interests, then there would be no necessity for these Bills. But do you not have these people always and the time when the danger exists is not the time to rush these things through.  The proper time is when people can consider them calmly and quietly, without undue Party passion.  We are now considering these measures quietly, considering them in a quiet frame of mind, and I think that that is the best way to deal with them.  There is no use going back on the past and referring to what might have been our attitude in the past.  For the first time for centuries our people here in Ireland&mdash;in the south of Ireland&mdash;are in a position in which our people have not been for hundreds of years.  We are facing a different situation altogether.  In the past, when we were under foreign domination in this country, we were right to resist that domination; but when this country is in the control of its own people and when its laws are made by its own people, an entirely different situation arises.  If we did not take some steps to protect our people against aggression, we should not be doing our duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one section of this Bill that calls for some comment and that is Section 12, which reads partly as follows:</P>
      <P>The Government may, whenever it so thinks proper, make by order regulations for all or any of the following purposes, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>requiring printers and publishers to keep registers or other records of the documents printed or published by them and providing for the inspection by members of the Gárda Síochána of such registers and records;</P>
      <P>requiring the exhibition on all printed matters of the place at which such matter was printed, the name and address of the printer by whom it was printed, and the name and address of the person for whom or on whose instructions it was printed;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not pleading in this section for the employees at all, but I think that <Col N="1553" /> this imposes a very serious obligation on employing printers.  I speak in this matter with some knowledge, because during the several wars that took place in the past in this country, I was engaged on many occasions in producing documents of which my employers had no knowledge whatever.  I set up the first prospectus for the First Dáil Loan, my employer knew nothing whatever about the job; he did not know that it was in the house. It was given in the name of the Portobello Loan Fund Society.  My employer never saw the copy, because I took the copy into the office, set it up, and took the material home in a tram, and it was printed in a house not very far from where Senator Hayes lived at the time.  I also printed several documents admitting persons to Dublin Castle, and my employers knew nothing whatever about them.  I should like to know what the position of an employer would be under this section, if similar things were to take place when this Bill becomes law. Would the employer, if it was found out subsequently that these documents were being printed in his premises, be liable to have the penalties imposed upon him as provided in Section 12, sub-section (2) of this Bill?</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter and one to which I would like the Minister to give his attention.  I am pleading in particular for the employer, but so far as the Bill itself generally is concerned, we intend to oppose it; because the terms of it are altogether too drastic.</P>
    <P>As Senator Foran has pointed out, the trade union movement is pretty well perturbed about this Bill.  I am not too perturbed about it at all, because I am quite prepared to accept what the Minister said to the Trade Union Congress deputation the other day, that it is not intended to apply the terms of this Bill against the trade unions.  Of course, the Minister can only give that assurance for himself; another Government may very drastically use this Bill against the trade unions.  He gave the Trade Union Congress an assurance that it was not intended to apply it to the trade unions, but it would be only right to say that the trade union movement <Col N="1554" /> is gravely concerned about the powers given to the Minister under this Bill.  For that reason we will have to vote against the passing of this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me that most of the people who spoke against this Bill were really looking for some sort of excuse as to why they should voice their opinions against the Bill.  One speaker after another put up some sort of reason why he did not approve of the Bill.  While most of them did not approve of it, the majority of those who appeared to speak against it, before they sat down, declared that they intended to vote for the measure.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with Senator Campbell's point of view at all.  I believe, as Senator Campbell apparently believes, that there is no danger from the present Government as far as trades unions are concerned. I believe that there is no danger that the people of this country will in the future elect a Government from which there will be any danger of that kind either, and I believe that there would be more protection for trades unions as a result of the passage of this measure than there would be before. We all know what happened in other countries and we know what happened the trades unions in other countries. I believe that this measure is really to prevent an occurrence here in this country of the events which have taken place in other countries.  For that reason, I cannot see why the representatives of labour here should be opposed to the measure.</P>
      <P>The first question that anybody should ask himself in discussing legislation of this kind is, what was the idea of electing a Government at all? Was it not that they should govern the country?  If they are to govern the country, it is only possible by the establishment of discipline in the country.  If the Government say that for the good discipline of the State it is necessary to have this particular type of legislation, then, I say, there is no reason why they should not have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose it is only natural that my mind should run more or less in the same channels as the mind of my <Col N="1555" /> colleágue, Senator Seán Goulding. Numerous speakers have pointed out that this legislation was very drastic, and that that was, in fact, the only reason why they objected to it.  I would ask anybody reading the speeches in the Dáil and reading the statements made by the Minister in the Dáil and in this House, in the introduction of this measure, to prove that there is any reason in the world why they should be in the least uneasy with regard to the drastic provisions of this Bill.  It may be a slight exaggeration to say that, in the Dáil, the Minister accepted every suggestion that was put up to him but, in his opening speech here in the Seanad, he said that he would be prepared to accept any reasonable amendments suggested in the later stages of the Bill.  If, in the opinion of any Senators, the Bill is unduly drastic here and there, it is up to them in the meantime to put forward amendments. If those amendments are at all reasonable, I am quite sure the Minister will be prepared to meet Senators on them.</P>
    <P>As I say, most Senators, one after another, have made the particular statement that because the Bill was so terribly drastic they found it very hard to agree with it at all.  To my mind, the same thing may be said of any Bill.  I have been discussing this thing with various people all over the country, and I think I might repeat here what I said to a man the other day, which I believe is really logical: If any Bill were to be pursued to its extremes it would make life intolerable for the people of this country.  Take, for instance, the Noxious Weeds Act. If that were to be insisted on to the letter of the law, it would be very undesirable.  Suppose some indiscriminate person came along and inspected Senator Baxter's farm, under that particular piece of legislation, he could run Senator Baxter out of his farm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>He could not.  He might do that with Senator Quirke or some of the Senator's colleagues in my county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>To say that the Bill is <Col N="1556" /> premature is, in my opinion, also, a gross misstatement of facts.  In my opinion, the Bill should have been introduced long before now and, if it were introduced immediately after the Constitution, I believe there would be very little of the criticism that we hear to-day, not only in this House but elsewhere.</P>
      <P>It has been said that the measure is unnecessary.  Well, perhaps some Senators know more than the Minister knows.  My way of looking at this is, that if it were not necessary, it would not be introduced, and that the people who are in the best position to know whether it is necessary or not are the people who are responsible for the introduction of this measure.</P>
      <P>Senators have first of all to ask themselves the question&mdash;for what purpose was the Government elected? I think we all agree as to why they were elected and what their duties are when they are elected, or what would be the duties of any other Government that was elected.  You have got to accept the situation that we either have here in this country a sovereign independent State, or else that we have not.  If we have that particular situation here, then it is the duty of the Government to maintain that position at all costs.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter made a statement, I think unwisely, drawing up the past history.  We all know that a long debate could be carried on as to what happened at such a time, and decide who started the civil war, and that kind of thing.  Senator Baxter comes up here and deliberately introduces a question as to the shooting of the late Kevin O'Higgins.  Maybe Senator Baxter knows who shot Kevin O'Higgins. I would be as much in touch with things as anybody else, and my information is that it has never been proved who shot Kevin O'Higgins, and I stand up deliberately and say that I do not know even what organisation was involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>And still Senator Baxter tried to draw that matter into the debate.  I think it is ridiculous.  I <Col N="1557" /> think we have got to consider the position as it is to-day and eliminate the past, if we are to get anywhere.</P>
      <P>I feel the same as Senator Goulding feels about this thing.  None of us likes to stand up here and urge the Minister to introduce this kind of legislation.  I am quite sure the Minister did not want to come in here urging the Seanad to accept a Bill of this kind.  It was not introduced for the purpose of political kudos, if you like to put it in that way.  It was introduced because, in the opinion of the Minister and of the Government, it was necessary for the protection of the State.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that this measure is in itself undemocratic.  I say that it may appear undemocratic to some people, but it may be necessary, and is necessary at times, for a Government to appear undemocratic in order to preserve democracy for the people.  I believe that the Government would be shirking their responsibility as a Government if they did not take the measures that they believed were necessary to protect the independence of this State.</P>
      <P>If we are to have discipline in the country, the Government must be given the necessary powers to maintain that discipline.  If they believe that it is necessary to have certain powers, surely it is not necessary to wait for those powers until some couple of Senators are shot, as Senator Baxter suggests.  He suggested that if something like that had happened, he would be quite agreeable to a measure of this kind.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Senator has been converted but the fact of the matter is that I believe prevention is better than cure.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would say that this Bill should be brought in, even if the I.R.A. did not exist at all. I would be quite definite on that for the simple reason that there are people in this country, and some of them in this House, who in the past carried on a campaign which, if it recurred, would necessitate the introduction of a Bill of this kind.  We have little miniature dictators in this House and outside this House, not exactly I.R.A. or Republican supporters, but various other types and if this legislation is on the stocks, and this Bill is put through, legislation will be there to put such people in their place, should they determine to overthrow the Government of the country, as they tried in the past.  I am surprised to hear Senator MacDermot ask such a question as that because the answer was so obvious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that if we are to have any prosperity in this country, we can never have that prosperity until we have peace.  I believe that this measure is introduced to ensure the continuation of peaceful conditions in this country.  Some people argue against the measure because they say there is no necessity for it, that we have perfectly peaceful conditions in the country.  That is one thing we ought appreciate, and because we appreciate it, we should do everything we possibly can to ensure the continuance of these peaceful conditions. Unless we have peace we can have no prosperity, and unless we have ordered conditions in the country, we cannot have peace.  I would, therefore, appeal to those Senators who seem to be halfhearted in opposition to the Bill to give it their support, on the Second Stage at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the conclusion every day that the English language is an entirely useless medium of expression in this House, because nobody who speaks it appears to be understood by other people who speak it here.  I came into this House with the intention of voting for the Second Reading because, as I said on several occasions, the Seanad should not, in my opinion, reject a Bill on the Second Stage but should endeavour to amend it.  Really, after listening to Senator Quirke, I am almost sufficiently converted to the opposite point of view to go into the Lobby against the Bill.  The Bill does great credit to the Minister in two directions.  First and foremost, it shows an amazing ingenuity and an amazing knowledge in the way in which he stopped every loophole for illegal opposition to the Government. whether by word, act or thought.  It shows the truth of the old proverb that the poacher turned gamekeeper is very effective indeed.  Out of the Minister's <Col N="1560" /> experience and the experience of his colleagues&mdash;I do not know if he consulted Senator Quirke&mdash;he has succeeded in setting down a most extraordinarily minute and detailed number of things which people might think of doing against the State and he has made very effective provision against every single one of them.  I have no objection to that.</P>
      <P>In addition to its comprehensiveness, another thing that is to his credit is that in the other House he showed himself very receptive to suggestions.  In particular, he inserted in the other House a provision that when special courts are set up under Part V of the Bill, there will be appeals from the judges in matters of law to the Central Criminal Court and, I presume, afterwards to the Supreme Court, if necessary. Now, that is an excellent provision from the point of view of the ordinary citizen and goes a fairly good distance to allay the fears that ordinary, law-abiding citizens might have that this measure would be used against their legitimate trade and operations.</P>
      <P>I do not agree at all that we should vote for the Bill for the reasons that Senator Quirke put forward.  He wants to know what the Government was elected for.  I have not got the Fianna Fáil plan here, but I think the Government was elected to abolish unemployment and a number of other things, none of which it has done.  I do not think it was elected at all to bring in this kind of Bill.  The type of argument which says that because no one knows who shot a particular person, therefore, nothing should be done or said about it, is an argument which I cannot understand.  If anybody tries to shoot a Minister, and the Minister is shot, surely steps should be taken to see that no other Minister is shot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point that cannot be forgotten is that the present Minister's supporters objected to anything being done in this country on the lines of this measure until the present Ministers came into office.  They would not think of doing anything to uphold law and order until they were themselves placed in charge of law and order.  I have some doubts even now as to whether they have come to the point when they would <Col N="1561" /> agree to uphold law and order if they were again in Opposition.  We have had no clear declarations on that point.</P>
    <P>The absurd point that because this is a free and sovereign State now and because we have a certain type of Constitution now, this kind of legislation should be passed has no validity whatever. The Constitution that we have derives its legal validity from the Constitution which went before it.  It is an amendment of that Constitution and nothing else.  The Minister could not be here at all addressing this House of Parliament were it not for the Treaty and the Constitution established under it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">

What I said was that the Minister would not be here as a Minister addressing this House of Parliament only for the Treaty and the Constitution established thereunder and in accordance therewith, and that is the fact.  I hope I have made myself clear now.  I did not say that there was no difference between them.  I want to say to Senator Quirke and to other Senators who take his line&mdash;I do not think the Minister takes it&mdash;that nothing could be more dangerous for the peace of the country than this constant repetition that now that we have a Constitution we like, we want to see that a Minister for Justice will not be shot again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>If he was in it, or if anybody else was in it, it would make no difference.  I want to say that the point of view which urges that because you have a certain type of Constitution you can use armed opposition against the State, is entirely false.  There are certain people in this country who do not like the present Constitution.  Does anybody here say that they are entitled to use arms against the State, or to reject the authority of the State because of that Constitution?</P>
      <P>They do not like the present Constitution, but, whether they like it or not, and whether I like it or not, I do not believe in armed opposition to it.  I believe in legislation to prevent people having armed opposition, and I believe that people who oppose in arms should be punished and not let get away with it.  It is not because it is this particular type of Constitution at all.  As a matter of fact, there were more votes, if one wants to know, behind the last Constitution than behind this one.  I do not want to go into that now.  I think the whole idea of basing arguments for this Bill, and for the Treason Bill, upon the nature of the Constitution is a serious thing, and an encouragement to people outside.  If Senator Quirke had the right to oppose a particular Constitution because he did not like it, then some fellow outside, who now calls himself by the same name that Senator Quirke used at one time, can make the very same argument against this Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am far better informed on that question than Senator Quirke. That is not a very great boast.  If he is going to keep arguing that we must not debate it because we have a good Constitution, he is on a very shaky bog and ought not keep it up.  I think the present Constitution is a bad Constitution, and much less catholic, for example, than the Constitution that preceded it.  I am entitled to my opinion, but I am not entitled to use force against the State.  Whatever opinion anyone entertains about this Constitution, or any other Constitution, he has still no right to shoot a Minister for Justice, or any other Minister, and I feel that we are not going to get into any situation where we will get clarity, and where the people will recognise their duties and their obligations, if we keep on with this kind of nonsense, that a new State was established last year or the year before, and that we have now a new Constitution and a new State.  We have no such thing.  We have what we always had: a Government elected by the people, responsible to the people, with the right to govern, and people who oppose them in arms are guilty of treason and should be punished.  If there are drastic provisions in the Bill, they are not as drastic as when it was brought in, and I recognise sincerely that the Minister announced that he would be prepared to consider amendments.</P>
      <P>In the light of that I am prepared to vote for the Second Reading, but not for the absurd reason that this is year 2 of a republic that we do not call a republic.  It is not year 2; it is year 17 of the new State, and everything that was alleged against the previous Constitution could be alleged against this Constitution.  The whole line of argument was wrong, and if we are to get to any kind of peace, we will have to give that up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I might deal first with a few minor points that were raised.  Senator Foran raised a matter with regard to Section 9 (2).  There is <Col N="1564" /> a provision similar to this which arises under the Treasonable Offences Act, 1925, and if the Senator would look back over the debates at that time, he would see what was aimed at in that Act, and what is aimed at in this measure.  This question was raised in the other House, and exaggerated to such an extent, that an attempt was made to represent that even temporary employees, and employees on relief works, throughout the country would come into its meshes.  That is not the intention, and is not what could be covered in that provision.  What is intended, so far as we can meet it by means of drafting, is that we are not going to permit the dislocation of the public services.  It cannot be permitted, for example, that the Civil Service are to be incited, or that a position is brought about by some individual or body of individuals, that at a certain time, in order to bring Government to a standstill, they would interfere to the extent of dislocating that service.  If Senators want to see that question more fully debated, then it is necessary that they should go back to the debates on the Treasonable Offences Act, 1925.  That was the attitude every Minister for Finance adopted towards the dislocation of the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked by Senator Baxter to-day, and by Senator Hogan last evening, to give reasons for this Bill. I have indicated, I must say not to any considerable extent, the reasons, reasons that the public themselves are aware of&mdash;that there is common knowledge that there is a body there, which claims that by force it can alter or remove the Government of this country.  As I stated last night, there have been proclamations, and I am not satisfied, nor do I think anyone who knows the conditions is satisfied, that the people concerned are merely playacting. All the elements are there and, as I have said, the material is there, and if these elements are sufficiently welded together and sufficiently strong, then we know what the position might or could be.  I know that there are two ways of approaching this. There is the method of approach that says: &ldquo;We will treat those people as <Col N="1565" /> a badly-kept school would treat unruly schoolboys.  We will allow them, when the lights are out, to meet in the dormitory, and play and plan, and do certain minor unruly acts without attempting to correct them, but we will take action when they set the school on fire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That may not be a very clear analogy, but it conveys, in some way, what is in my mind at the present time with regard to these matters.  Are we going to allow, say, the plots to brew and take no action until the pot boils over?  I am not.  It would not help in any way to give a litany of things, not very serious if you take them one by one, but perhaps aiming to be serious if you take the sum total.  But, for the sake of this country, I think it is much better not to recite a litany of these things, which, if taken singly, might appear minor incidents, but if taken as a whole might point in a very serious direction.  We know how easy it is for some people to exaggerate and create a panic.  We know what is worse: that in certain branches of the Press outside this country those situations can be exaggerated out of all proportion to what the real situation is.  So much for that.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan says that we have sufficient ordinary law to deal with this situation.  I have explained in the other House and here, that the position is that Article 2A has been directly removed by the new Constitution, that the Treasonable Offences Act was of doubtful validity, and that the Public Safety Act of 1926 would be inappropriate in the new conditions. Now, whether Senator Hogan considers his legal opinion better or not than the Attorney-General's I am not going to criticise or say, and I do not say that in any critical way either, but so far as I am concerned, and so far as my Department is concerned, if I am advised by the Attorney-General's Department that I cannot rely on the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925, then it is my duty and my job to take that advice and that opinion.  If I act on that basis, what do I find?  If some body of people come into this House, or into the other House and remove the Senators from here or the Deputies <Col N="1566" /> from the other House, I do not say for a moment that there is no law to deal with them.  I certainly believe that you could get some method of dealing with them.  You could, I suppose prosecute them for trespass. That would be possible.  Or, if they kidnapped a Minister, a Senator or a Deputy, I suppose they could be prosecuted for assault.  That is so, but unfortunately, whether we like it or not, we have to face the position that when you are dealing with, or have in mind, certain bodies, and when you have in mind certain possibilities, you simply cannot rely on that kind of law.</P>
    <P>Take the first four parts of the Bill before the House.  If you examine them you will find similar legislation in practically every other country: practically every other country has laws based on similar lines to what is in the first four parts to protect the State and protect the citizen.  Parts V and VI, I agree, are emergency and exceptional provisions.  So far as the first four parts are concerned, I say that there is nothing abnormal and nothing exceptional in them that any State would not take steps to have in operation for the protection of itself and of its citizens.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter referred to what happened in 1927, and to the evidence that was put before them when they were brought to see the President at that time.  He spoke of the serious position as they saw it then.  I would like to see Senator Baxter looking back on the debates that took place when the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925 was being passed into law.  The contention of the Labour Deputies at that time was that there was no case made and no evidence given to them&mdash;that there were no particulars given to them&mdash;of any serious incidents in the country. The late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins pointed out at that time that it was much better to anticipate those things than to wait until they happened.  I consider that I have sufficient grounds for believing that we have reached the position that if this country is to maintain the peace that, thank goodness, it has at the present time, not only the first four parts which we are proposing in this measure should become the normal law and should be <Col N="1567" /> regarded as normal legislation, but further, that we should have the power, if the situation demanded it, to operate the emergency provisions in Parts V and VI.</P>
    <P>Take the 1927 Act or the Treasonable Offences Act.  When Senators talk about those Acts not being as drastic as this, that is not correct.  The 1927 Act was afterwards embodied in Article 2A.  Under Article 2A you had no appeal.  I speak subject to correction, but I do not think there was the right of appeal in the 1927 Act at all.  Practically in every place in this Bill where we provide for any sort of extraordinary measures, we also provide the right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  We have provided, as Senators know, the other ordinary safeguards which are simply these: In the first place, the Attorney-General has to be satisfied that it is a case for prosecution.  The accused person is brought before a judge and jury, or before the special courts if that portion of the Bill is in operation. If he is dissatisfied, he has the right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and, finally, he has the right of petition to the Government and he may put before them any extenuating or mitigating circumstance.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the controversial matters that very often lead to heated debate in the Dáil or here might have been avoided.  I do not think that the two big Parties who have had so many controversies are going to see each other's point of view.  These particular controversial matters have been raised time after time, but I feel that they do not get us anywhere in matters of this sort.  What I do want to point out, without entering into these controversial matters, is this: that the Party which elected and supports the Government of which I am a member have for a long time agitated for the removal of certain things which they regarded as an impediment to people coming into the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Those things have been removed, and at present anybody who can get a <Col N="1568" /> sufficient number of votes in the country can be elected to the Dáil without any violence to his conscience, or otherwise, and if a sufficient body of them are elected, they can take over the Government and declare whatever form of Government they wish.  With that position, there is no excuse for any people trying to get control of Governmental authority in this State by violent means and, in addition, there is no hope whatever of their succeeding in that attempt.  As I stated in the other House, I hope that some counsels will prevail which will obviate the necessity for any use of these extraordinary powers.</P>
    <P>We can discuss the various details of the Bill on Committee Stage, but I hope that the assurance I have given as to fair and reasonable consideration for any reasonable amendment will not be misunderstood to mean that I am going to accept any amendment.  I do not think any Senator would be so unreasonable.  What I stated in the Dáil holds good here&mdash;I am prepared to consider fairly and reasonably any reasonable amendment, keeping in mind all the time that those amendments will not have the result of making the Bill ineffective.  The Bill was very carefully drawn up, and there was considerable difficulty in getting the phrasing used in the Bill, and while certain phrases may appear to mean nothing, to interfere with the Bill in certain directions, or in certain ways, might have the effect of rendering it ineffective.  I do not think Senators are giving the Bill a Second Reading with the desire to render it absolutely useless when we come to deal with it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As Senator M. Hayes has mentioned, I made several very substantial amendments in the other House.  The one I was most doubtful about&mdash;and it was only after a great deal of consideration that I accepted it&mdash;was the innovation of an appeal from the special criminal courts to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The reason for my doubts about it was that if you had to meet an emergency and had special criminal courts operating, you possibly would have to deal quickly with that emergency.  When you have an <Col N="1569" /> emergency, the better and more humane way to deal with it is quickly, because it is the best way in which you can deal with it effectively.  However, I have made the concession.  I believe it is a considerable concession and I think it is at least worth a trial.  As I already indicated, I hope that I, or any other Minister, may go back to the Oireachtas and ask the Oireachtas to consider an alteration of these facilities if they prove ineffective. Some Senator said that it is no pleasure to anybody, in this country particularly, to be bringing in what some people will label a Coercion Bill. I do not regard this Bill, even in regard <Col N="1570" /> to the emergency provisions, as anything in the way of a Coercion Bill, but even if people want to put that tag on these parts, I feel that we would be lacking in our duty if we did not give the State these powers to protect itself and the lives of its citizens.  I hope the use of the emergency provisions will not at any time be necessary, but I should like to say at once that if the Government consider their use necessary they will not hesitate to use them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 10, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 45 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after the word &ldquo;appeal&rdquo; where that word first occurs in the said sub-section, of the words&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;to a committee of architects (or town planners) selected on the advice of the Institute of Architects, the Architectural Association, or a professional body of town planners who shall have power to affirm, vary, reverse or annul such decision of the responsible authority, and the person aggrieved <Col N="1571" /> may also appeal from the decision of the responsible authority (whether or not he may have already appealed to the committee aforesaid)'</P>
    <P>and by the deletion of the words &ldquo;from such decision&rdquo; where these words occur in the said sub-section and the said section shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>I have put down this amendment in the hope that the Government would accept it.  If the Government does accept it, I think analogously one or two other similar changes should also be made in other parts of this Bill. At the present time the local authorities can issue a veto on aesthetic grounds on a man who wants to build a house or carry out some such work; they can object to the design or to the colour or to some other detail like that.</P>
    <P>In this matter of taste with regard to beauty, harmony, colour and so on, there is nobody who can get up and affirm a standard or set up a court which, according to fixed and immutable rules, will be able to establish a norm to which other things must conform. At the present time I think the authority who would decide in this matter is very often an engineer.  I have great respect for engineers, but in matters of aesthetics I do not feel that an engineer is, by virtue of being an engineer, more competent than I am.  If a person, on his own property, proposes to build, under the terms of Article 45 of the original Bill, this authority, whose experience may have been in the building of roads, can say: &ldquo;No; we do not like that colour,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;We want all houses built in half-timbered fashion,&rdquo; or something like that, and, as far as the owner of the property is concerned he has to accept that veto, with the option of appealing to the District Court.  The District Court would then have to hear arguments as to the harmony of colour or design in the locality, and would have to decide on a question like that for which, obviously, a District Court is eminently unsuitable.  I think myself that, if I were proposing to build a place that I thought would harmonise with the district and would itself be <Col N="1572" /> satisfactory, convenient to live in, and beautiful to look at, and such veto came from the local authority, I would feel that there was nothing to do but sit down under that rather than go to the District Court and ask a justice whose function, presumably, would be to know positive law, to decide as to whether my taste or that of the local authority was right.</P>
    <P>I am not standing over the exact words of the amendment, but what I feel is that it is possible that your local authority would be a bit cranky, would have a certain fixed point of view that every house had to be in a certain form, and he, under this Bill, is given power to issue this veto where a man, possibly of great distinction, may be responsible for the design and the arrangement of the building proposed. It is always possible, especially in this realm of aesthetics it is always most likely, that you are going to have somebody cranky and unreasonable. There is no absolute way of overcoming that, but it does seem to me that if you have a vocational body, such as the Institute of Architects, proposing a committee of, say, three architects, to consider as to whether the architect of the building or the local authority was a better judge of beauty and harmony, that, amongst those three, you are likely to have what I might call the commonsense attitude; whereas you may not have it in the individual engineer or architect of the local authority.  It seems to me that, in fairness to the possible builders, they should have the option of appealing to a body or to a committee which would have some competence in the matter, who would know something about design, and who would have been selected by a body which is a vocational body in relation to building.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I thought that the Government would probably agree that this was a reasonable amendment.  If they do&mdash;I have not got a copy of this Bill in front of me now&mdash;I think there are places where, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, changes might be made.  For instance, there is an interim period, and that could go on for 15 years, and in one part of the Bill I think it says <Col N="1573" /> that such a body as I propose here may be set up.  I would like, if the Government accept this amendment, that they should also accept a proposal that that &ldquo;may&rdquo; shall be made &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, that it should be made mandatory, so that during that interim period, which at the present time is not fixed&mdash;it might last for years&mdash;a similar body should be set up.  I am not standing over the exact words of the amendment.  All I ask is that a committee, appointed on the advice of a vocational body, related to building or to design, would have power to give an opinion or even to give a ruling against the local authority if, in their judgment such a decision should be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It was really a very full amendment by Deputy Dillon, proposing to take Section 45 out of the Principal Act and to insert a new section, which seems to have been well set out.  If it had been accepted by the Minister, I think it would have fallen in with the general framework of the Bill.  It contained no less than eight sub-sections.  Unfortunately, the Tánaiste is unavoidably absent, and I regret that I cannot recommend the Seanad to accept Senator Fitzgerald's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 45 of the Principal Act, to which the Senator has referred, the position is that where a planning scheme contains a provision conferring on the responsible authority power to regulate and control (whether generally or in particular areas) the design, colour, or materials of structures, any person aggrieved by a decision of the responsible authority made in exercise of such power may appeal from such decision to the justice of the District Court.  When this Town and Regional Planning Act of 1934 was going through the Oireachtas, a second sub-section was put in, in order to meet the point of view which Senator Fitzgerald represents, that was, the anxiety that, if <Col N="1574" /> possible, the Minister should avail himself of whatever opportunities he might have to get in a tribunal of persons with special knowledge and practical experience of town planning as a court of appeal, so to speak, in this matter.  Sub-section (2) was inserted to meet that point of view.  It sets out what can be done when a planning scheme is being submitted to the Minister.  The Minister himself afterwards, under the Principal Act, could, I think, amend the actual scheme in order to insert this tribunal, if he so wished, but at present it happens that no scheme has been put up to him containing the tribunal of the character which the Senator desires.  The view of the Department is that sub-section (2) is a sufficient safeguard from the point of view of those who feel that special arrangements should be made to have persons who have special knowledge of town planning brought in as a tribunal.  It has not been found that the existing provisions are inadequate to the extent that the tribunal should be brought in under Article 45 (1), as an alternative appeal body to the district justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attitude is that he would like that the procedure should be that, when a planning scheme is submitted to him, if, in the circumstances, the planning authority or the Minister himself should consider it necessary to insert the provision regarding the tribunal in the scheme itself, that that can be done and is sufficiently covered under Article 45 (2) of the Principal Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that cover the <i>interim</i> period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The interim period is before the scheme has been promulgated and is in force.  Section 45 applies to the actual period when the scheme is in force.  It is thought that it would be rather cumbersome to have this double system of appeal by which an aggrieved person might appeal either to the tribunal or to the district justice, although the district justice is specifically named in the Principal Act as the Court of Appeal.  As I said, this provision for the setting up of a tribunal can be inserted in any planning <Col N="1575" /> scheme.  If the planning authority submits it, or if the Minister and his advisers consider it necessary, they can insert that provision. They feel, apart from this fact, that the anxiety that the Senator and others may have is fully met in sub-section (2) of the Principal Act.  They feel that there is no necessity to confine it to architects.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should mention that when, in the original Act, the term &ldquo;persons of special knowledge or practical experience&rdquo; was inserted, it was intended that, if the Minister wished, he could select architects but he need not necessarily confine himself to architects.  If he found from experience that a tribunal consisting solely of architects was not, in fact, the best one he would have some freedom, whereas under the proposals put up in regard to the present Bill, the Minister's hands would be tied.  I regret that I am not able to recommend the Seanad to accept the amendment.  I can assure the Senator that the anxiety of the Department and the Minister in charge of the Bill, as already explained, is to make the Bill as workable as possible.  They feel that the existing provisions are suitable and their experience leads them to believe that the special sub-section which was inserted in the Principal Act, providing for a special tribunal to be set up under any planning scheme, if the authority or the Minister so desires, is quite sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to fight this matter, but when the Minister talks about the experience which the Department has had, I should like to point out that I do not think they have had any experience.  I, myself, have as much experience in this matter as the Department.  Secondly, in this clause there is a provision that a person who is aggrieved by virtue of a ruling that a local authority has given under the Bill, can appeal to the District Court.  It is abundantly clear that the District Court is a completely unsuitable <Col N="1576" /> body to settle a question of aesthetics.  It seems to me that anybody who considers the matter must agree that a committee appointed for the purpose, when advised by a competent body, would be more appropriate to undertake a decision of this character than any District Court could be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, both sides can go into the District Court and the aggrieved person who, after all, is the chief person so far as the law is concerned, and who is the person we are anxious to see fully safeguarded in this matter of appeals, has the right&mdash;and the other side has equally the right&mdash; to make a case before the district justice.  It may not be entirely a question of aesthetics.  It may be a question of common sense, having regard to all the circumstances.  I would remind the Senator also that when the scheme is being planned, an inquiry has to be held first in public and the different interests, such as the Architects' Association, which have special interests in this matter, may come there and make their case.  They can make representations also to the authority concerned or subsequently they may wish to approach the Minister, so that I feel that, so far as the architects are concerned, they have ample opportunities to make whatever representations they consider right.  The experience of the Department, such as it is, in any event, is that the amendment is not necessary. If, after they have had more experience and if the Oireachtas considers that that experience shows that a departure should be made from the present provisions regarding the District Court, I am sure the Minister would be found agreeable to that departure.  It is not considered necessary at the present time.</P>

      <P>The local authority, after the plans are submitted, can take into consideration the advice of their own professional officers, their architects and engineers. The experience we have had, at all events, is that they are not anxious to interfere with any plans submitted to them.  I cannot see any justification for Senator Fitzgerald's fears of a cranky attitude on the part of local authorities.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to add two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  Any person aggrieved by a declaration made under Section 59 of the Principal Act or this section may appeal within the prescribed time to the Minister against such declaration, and thereupon the Minister shall either confirm or annul such declaration.</P>
      <P>(4)  Section 59 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion therefrom of paragraph (g) of sub-section (1) and the said section shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinConlon" hpid="Mr. Conlon Mr. Conlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have this matter explained somewhat more fully.  As far as I can see, this is merely a repetition of the first paragraph of Section 59 of the Principal Act.  I should like to have the necessity for this amendment explained, because there are a number of sub-paragraphs. As far as I can see, the whole matter was crowded into Section 59 as it stands.  I have an amendment, which appears later on the Order Paper, and I would prefer if it were taken before this amendment, not, I presume, that it makes very much difference, but <Col N="1578" /> in my amendment I propose to change the words &ldquo;The Minister&rdquo; to &ldquo;The justice of the District Court having jurisdiction in the district&rdquo;.  If my amendment were accepted, it would affect the amendment now under consideration. I thought the matter was covered by Section 59 as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not covered.  The procedure is that first there is a prohibition made, but that does not prevent people from going in and building or carrying out other work.  The intention is to strengthen the position. The special prohibition, which in itself is not sufficient, is followed up by a declaration, the effect of which is to make the building or carrying out of other work an offence.  That offence can be dealt with in the courts.  The person responsible is taken to the courts.  It is considered that Section 59 of the Principal Act is defective, because it makes the appeal from the declaration part of the appeal against the special prohibition in respect of which the declaration was made. When a declaration is made some time after the making of a special prohibition, there will be no appeal.  In order to appeal from the declaration at present there has to be an appeal against the special prohibition.  It is considered that the appeal from the declaration should be made, quite definite and separate, to the Minister.  It merely means on the question of appeal against the declaration that anything done which has been already prohibited becomes an offence.  If any person wishes to appeal against the declaration he can do so now by making a special appeal to the Minister. Really it is largely a legal question, and one of making the administration of the Act more flexible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinConlon" hpid="Mr. Conlon Mr. Conlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 12, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 59 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion of the words &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; whenever these words occur in that section, and by the substitution therefor of the words &ldquo;the Justice of the District Court having jurisdiction in the district,&rdquo; and the said section shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to occupy much of the time of the House with this amendment, because once a decision has been arrived at I am afraid it cannot be changed.  I am sorry the Minister is not here.  I think it would be more essential in this section to have the district justice dealing with these appeals.  If a person has a grievance he can, no doubt, appeal to the Minister, but very often people are not adepts at drawing up an appeal to be sent forward.  The point I want to make is that the individuals concerned in some cases are not satisfied.  In the first place they may not be able to make a good case on paper and as a result may suffer.  They think that if they could get a hearing before the Minister, that by coming up before him their chances of success would be much better.</P>
      <P>If a case could be brought before the district justice, as it can under Sections 44 and 52 of the Principal Act, it could be heard locally, and a person with a grievance would have an opportunity of making his case.  Even if he failed there he would be more satisfied than could be expected under the present circumstances.  However, if it is not possible to accept the amendment I do not wish to detain the House, and will refrain from saying anything that is not acceptable to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain the position.  The first step is to hold <Col N="1580" /> an inquiry at which all interests concerned have the right to make representations or subsequently to make representations to the planning authority or the Minister.  In the original Bill the Minister is the final authority in the planning scheme. After the planning scheme comes into operation, if persons are aggrieved they have then this right under Section 45, which I referred to on the previous amendment, to go to the District Court.  Up to the period when the planning scheme comes into operation, and particularly during the interim period, between the time the planning authority issues the advertisement and the scheme comes finally into operation, the Minister, under the main Act, is the final authority, and persons who wish to challenge any provision of the contemplated scheme have due access to him at all times.  I cannot see why they should have any difficulty in approaching the Minister.  I am informed that the officers of the Department, who are charged with looking after this question, are available to meet and discuss their difficulties with aggrieved persons.</P>
      <P>Once a scheme has been brought into operation, the Minister, having been the final authority in connection with it up to that stage, the question of an appeal as to whether persons shall get permission in respect of matters under Section 45 of the Act is one for the courts.  I do not know if the Senator was quite clear about the matter, but the position is that, up to the actual promulgation of the scheme, the Minister is the final authority, and anybody interested or anybody who feels aggrieved has the right of appeal to the Minister against its provisions. When the scheme is promulgated then it is taken out of the Minister's hands, and if persons are aggrieved they would have the right to go to the courts.  If the Senator would communicate to the Department any cases that he has in mind they will be examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinConlon" hpid="Mr. Conlon Mr. Conlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before a planning scheme is put into operation the local authorities have very great powers. Once they pass a resolution adopting the Act, and before putting up a <Col N="1581" /> scheme, they have power afterwards to prevent any individual erecting any structure without their permission.  I presume from that that there is an appeal to the Minister, and it is in that case that I would ask that the words &ldquo;district justice&rdquo; should be substituted for that of &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
