      <P>Before we take up business for to-day, I desire to say that the business will be as on the Order Paper.  If the Land Bill is under consideration at 6.30 p.m., I understand that it has been agreed to adjourn from 6.30 p.m., to 7.30 p.m., to enable the Minister and those Senators participating in the debate to have tea.  On the resumption at 7.30 p.m., consideration of the Land Bill will be resumed, and business will then continue until 10.30 p.m.  If the Land Bill and the Tourist Traffic Bill have not been completed by that hour, they will be taken over to to-morrow, when the proceedings on these Bills will be resumed.  After the Bills have been concluded to-morrow, it is the intention, I understand, to take Senator MacDermot's motion and the amendments to it.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: "That the Bill do now pass".</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill that more or less reached this distance without my being able to say what I should have liked to say about it on Second Reading debate, so I will deal very briefly with the points of general interest which I think should be considered before the Bill is finally allowed to pass.  I may say, to begin with, that I am not opposed to this Bill.  On the contrary, it is a Bill which, at all events, in the legislation it implies, commands my general assent, and my chief ground of criticism of it is that it is inopportune in the sense that it <Col N="562" /> would come more logically after the foreshadowed reform of public administration. At all events, in the counties, it might be said by the Minister that no revolutionary change in local government is proposed.  We will continue to have county councils, and, if I remember rightly, the chief reform of local administration in the counties will be the establishment of a county manager system of administration analogous to that which we already have in Dublin.  I may say that I heartily approve of the extension of the principle of county manager administration to the counties, but, even if no revolutionary change is contemplated with reference to the counties, I think we are on the eve of substantial changes in the local administration of the City and County of Dublin.  We should like to know what those changes are going to be, and in particular what area will be under the jurisdiction of greater Dublin when the Government has finally made up its mind upon this question, because I think a knowledge of that fact is germane not only to this Public Assistance Bill but to the whole subject matter of public assistance, of which this Bill is only a small part.</P>
      <P>One of the forms of public assistance is the assistance by the State and by the ratepayers towards the provision of houses for the less well-to-do classes at less than economic rents.  In fact, that assistance goes so far as to account for some two-thirds of the annual costs of such houses once they are built. That is a valuable and important form of public assistance which has reference to the general problem of public assistance to which this Bill also refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now it is a matter of common knowledge that it would be much less expensive to build houses for the workers on virgin sites some distance away from the present congested city area.  But these sites are not now under the jurisdiction of the municipal authority, and the Housing Committee at present in session cannot take into account the desirability of such sites, because it does not know what the future territorial limits of its jurisdiction will be. It is also a matter of common knowledge <Col N="563" /> that one of the difficulties about housing poorer citizens some distance from the city is the cost of travel to and from their work.  Another tribunal is at present investigating the problem of transport in general and, doubtless, the particular problem of suburban transport, and I suggest that the problem of transport, especially suburban transport, is related to the problem of housing, and the problem of housing, in fact, is part and parcel of the general problem of public assistance.</P>
    <P>It would be desirable, I think, if only the territory in the City of Dublin were wide enough, to establish one or two satellite towns, preferably some distance out along the old Great Southern and the old Great Western Railways and to connect those satellite towns with Dublin by a local suburban rail service, which at present is practically non-existent on those two lines. Everyone familiar with the matter is aware that rail transport, especially suburban transport, for season ticket holders is the cheapest of all forms of suburban transport, and the problem of housing workers in healthy surroundings some distance away from the city would be much less difficult and expensive from the point of view of the people, as well as the point of view of public authorities, if some scheme of this kind could be contemplated by the municipal council.  But at present it cannot contemplate any such thing, because it does not know what will be the future limits of its jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Further, there is also, I think, a general problem of public administration which might be adverted to in this Bill, because this Bill is, by implication, related to the general problem of public administration.  There is, I think, a certain lack of co-ordination between the various social services on which the taxpayers' money is being spent.  At the moment I think it is true to say that old age pensions are administered under the auspices of the Department of Finance and that the persons concerned primarily are pensions officers who are customs and <Col N="564" /> excise officials.  National health payments are, I believe, under the Department of Local Government. Unemployment assistance is administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  If I am wrong in any of these points, doubtless the Parliamentary Secretary will correct me. Military pensions are administered by the Department of Defence.  Poor law relief, or public assistance in the narrow and technical sense of the term, is administered by the local authorities under the supervision of the Department of Local Government.  Now all this chaotic departmental administration of the various beneficent activities of the State is bound to cause a lot of waste and loss and greater expenditure to the taxpayers in general than would be the case if the whole matter were better co-ordinated and better arranged.</P>
    <P>But, besides the taxpayers' point of view, there is also the point of view of the individual citizen.  Under the present system, there is no guarantee that individual citizens are getting all their rights in the matter of social services. Some families may, by excessive cuteness, what they call wangling, get more than their rights; but other families are probably getting less than their rights.  The trouble is that the ordinary citizen does not know to whom to apply for information covering the general scope of all the social services of the State.  A case came before my notice lately of a widow who may or may not be eligible for a widow's pension. I dare say that if I undertook laborious legalistic research I could ascertain whether that person is eligible for a widow's pension or not. But the point is that she is typical of perhaps thousands of cases.  For such people there ought to be some common central office where all the information would be coded and co-ordinated and where they would apply as a matter of course for information governing their cases.  It is impossible for the individual citizen to know all about our existing chaotic system of social services. The problem then is one not only of reforming a bit of local administration, but of co-ordinating the whole of our <Col N="565" /> central administration in the matter of social services, with some reorganised form of local administration in which the local county manager would play a central and what one might call a focal part.</P>
    <P>If I might conclude by making a few recommendations, which ought to be kept in mind when the whole problem of public administration in relation to public assistance is being considered, they are these: I should like to see the county manager under the future county council system having an office, of which he would be the supervisor, and that office should be a kind of local focus in every county for all the beneficent activities of the State, whether they take the form of so-called public assistance or of so-called social services. I should like to see associated with the county manager, though not necessarily under his departmental control, certain civil servants belonging to the Central Government, but seconded at a certain period of their service for this local duty in connection with the administration of the services in the county.  I think one advantage that would result from such local concentration of knowledge of all the social services and their effect on citizens would be that the State would have a single central office in each county which would have all the knowledge of all the effects of all the social services on the citizens generally and would have, and be ready to produce at a moment's notice, a complete picture of the social and economic condition of the people in the locality.</P>
    <P>Another advantage that would result from this temporary association in the case of individual civil servants, but permanent so far as the system is concerned, with local activities would be that we would teach our civil servants to know something about the real conditions of life in the country.  At present civil servants are too much concentrated in Dublin, and the only Central Government civil servants who have a local office in the country that I can think of at the moment are the people who are charged with relieving us of our surplus salaries, in other words, inspectors of taxes.  It would <Col N="566" /> be a good thing if some of the other departmental officials had to spend part of their official life down in the country.  It might help to counteract that excessively urban point of view which dominates government not only in legislation, but also in public administration.  May I illustrate what I mean?  I have felt for some time that my somewhat lurid picture of the effect of the agricultural depression on agriculture in general&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  If my remarks are not relevant to the Bill, the Chair will tell me so, and I do not require any interruption from other Senators.  I have felt for some time that the picture of agricultural depression requires certain qualifications, because I did not know to what extent the real hardships suffered by the small farming section of the community were, in effect, alleviated by the fact that many of them obtained work in connection with relief works, in connection with road work, and that many were qualified to obtain unemployment assistance.  In the Gaeltacht areas many were able to obtain State money in connection with various services for the development of the Gaeltacht.  To get a complete social picture of the condition of agriculture, one would need to know how these beneficent activities of the State alleviated the condition of a section of the farmers which, as far as agricultural records are concerned, was very distressful indeed.  If we had a system of public administration in relation to public assistance of the kind I recommend, there would be an easy way to acquire that picture in the future.</P>

      <P>Senator Johnston has covered a very wide field, and he introduced many matters, concerning our social services in general, that could only be remotely related to the terms of the Bill, if at all.  I have no complaint to make on that score.  The Senator is entitled to make whatever speech the Cathaoirleach considers he is entitled to make, but I am not prepared to follow him over the entire social field on the Fifth Stage of the Public Assistance Bill.  A considerable portion of his speech was based on an entirely false premise.  He seemed to form the impression that housing grants under the Housing Acts are a form of public assistance.  I suppose it might be argued that they are a form of public financial assistance for people desiring to live under better housing conditions, but housing grants are not public assistance.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion the Bill was before the House the Senator said that, so far as the Dublin area was concerned&mdash;and I think that is what he is mainly concerned about to-day&mdash;we were putting the cart before the horse.  I reminded him that we had a similar phrase a short time before in a leading article in one of the Dublin daily papers.  The horse, apparently, is to arise out of future legislation based on the report of the Greater Dublin Tribunal.  Why that possibility should be looked upon as the horse is something that I cannot understand. It seems to me that in this piece of legislation dealing with public assistance we have provided not only the horse but the cart and the harness &mdash;the complete machine ready to start.</P>

      <P>The Senator's idea is not a bad one at all.  If the Senator had taken the same line at an early stage of the Bill we might have had a more lively discussion, and perhaps something useful might result.  An occasional interruption like that is helpful to me, particularly, because I am inclined to take it rather easy until forced into action.  Senator Johnston said that this particular legislation is inopportune.  I presume he was referring to the application of it to the Dublin area.  To me it appears that it is long overdue.  Why did we not apply it to Dublin in the first instance?  That is really what is worrying the Senator.  He appears to have convinced himself of the fact that we excluded Dublin City and County from the Bill as it originally appeared, and that the exclusion was possibly with a view to future legislation regarding the area of Dublin City and County.  That had nothing whatever to do with it.  The Senator probably knows, if he has been following the development of the social services in Dublin City and County, and throughout the rest of the country, that Dublin City and County failed to adopt a county scheme.  Perhaps if he was listening to the Second Reading debate in the House, or if he read it, he will remember that during the years 1920-22 the Local Government Department of Dáil Eireann decided to reform the public assistance code, and to bring <Col N="569" /> it more into accordance with the sentiments of our people, and that in 1923, when the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act gave the necessary statutory sanction to the county schemes that were formulated by the various local authorities, Dublin City and County declined to adopt a county scheme.  Over a long period of years efforts have been made from time to time to get Dublin City and County to fall into line, as far as public assistance is concerned, with the rest of the country.  So far, we have been unsuccessful.  The old poor law code continued to operate in the City and County of Dublin, and will continue to operate, until this Bill becomes law. Not only the present Government, but the previous Minister for Local Government, tried unsuccessfully to get Dublin to come into line.</P>

      <P>Is Dublin City and County outside the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are inside it, and inside the jurisdiction of this Bill now. I am explaining to the Senator how that came about.  When the Bill reached the Second Stage in the Dáil representatives of Dublin City and County discovered that there were many attractive features in the new code of legislation, and they expressed a desire to have some 20 sections of the Bill grafted on to the old poor law code as far as Dublin City and County were concerned.  I pointed out on the Second Reading that that was not possible, and that if they wanted to have some 20 desirable sections in the Bill, they would have to take the whole Bill, and fall into line with the rest of the country.  I put this question to the House, and to the Dublin representatives particularly: Were there any objectionable features in the Bill that the representatives of Dublin City and County thought should not apply, or did the attractive features outweigh the objectionable features?  I expressed willingness on the Second Reading to reconsider the whole position if there was any general desire expressed to have the Bill applied to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> In the interval between Second Reading and the Committee Stage in the Dáil, representations were made to my Department that it would be desirable to apply the Bill to Dublin.  These representations came from responsible quarters and were made by representative people.  On Committee Stage, I stated in the Dáil that the principle of applying the Bill to the Dublin area had been agreed upon and that the necessary amendments would be moved on the Report Stage.  The necessary amendments were moved on Report Stage and, though Dublin City and County are very fully represented in the Dáil, a single word of protest or criticism of the extension of the terms of this Bill to Dublin City and County was not uttered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to the extension to Dublin City and County, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Senator now understands why Dublin was excluded in the first instance, and why the Bill was applied to Dublin at a subsequent stage, during the discussion on it in the Dáil, and that it had not any relation to the possibility of future legislation arising out of the Greater Dublin Tribunal Report.  Suppose, for the sake of discussion, that legislation is introduced that will alter the geographical area that now constitutes Dublin City.  That will not in any way interfere with the operation of this Bill. A consequential clause in such a Bill, if it ever saw the light of day, would provide for any geographical alteration that such a Bill might make in the existing public assistance areas in Dublin City and County.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnston suggested that we should co-ordinate all our social services. We could have a very interesting discussion on that matter.  It is quite possible that such a line of development is well worthy of consideration. But I put it to Senator Johnston that we must make a beginning somewhere and that we have made a definite beginning here when we co-ordinate our public assistance legislation, dating back fully 100 years <Col N="571" /> and embodying some 36 Acts of Parliament. I suggest to the Senator that that is no little task, that it is a very big work in itself, and the fact that we have taken that step is a very considerable advance towards the co-ordination of our social services.</P>
    <P>We have further legislation in contemplation. I dare say that there is some of it that the Senator would like to know more about, but I am not in a position to give him any further information upon it now.  The coming Public Health Bill, the coming Local Government Bill and the Managerial Bill will, I think, all be clearing the way and leading towards the better co-ordination of our social services anyhow; but we must take one Bill at a time.  We cannot present this House or the Dáil with half-a-dozen Bills of first-rate importance, at the same time.</P>

However, I cannot give him any further information on that save to say that when the more urgent matters that the Department are at present concerned with are dealt with, the report of the Greater Dublin Tribunal will then be dealt with.</P>

      <Col N="572" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will extend to the City of Waterford the system of city management that is already in operation in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Dun Laoghaire. The powers and duties of the county borough council as formerly constituted will be transferred to the corporation and will then be exercised by a newly-constituted council in relation to certain reserved matters which are set out in detail in Section 11 and in relation to matters not reserved by the city manager to be appointed under the Act.</P>
      <P>The new council will consist of 15 members, five of whom will be aldermen. The city will form one electoral area, but provision is made for the division of the city into two or more electoral areas after the first election. The council will have power to apply to the Minister for an order dividing the city into electoral areas and the Minister can make or refuse an order.</P>
      <P>The first election will be held within three months after the passing of the Act and there will be no further election within two years.  After the lapse of two years, the elections will be held in the same year in which a triennial election of county councillors is held.  The new council will elect a mayor whose duties will be substantially the same as heretofore.</P>
      <P>The council alone will have power to strike the municipal rate and to borrow money.  There is also reserved to the council the power to make bylaws, bring permissive Acts into force, promote legislation and appoint representatives on public bodies.  The power of the council can, if necessary, be extended by an order of the Minister.  Subject to the usual safeguards the council will have power to appoint, suspend or remove the manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> The city manager will be appointed on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners.  Pending the permanent appointment being made, the Minister can nominate a temporary manager.  The person appointed manager will also be town clerk.  It will be the duty of the manager to furnish information to the mayor, attend meetings, advise the council, plan works which the council wish to have executed and control and supervise the staff.  He will act by signed orders, of which a record will be kept and produced at every meeting of the council for the information of the members.</P>
    <P>All the existing separate funds will be merged in a new consolidated fund which is called the municipal fund.  A new municipal rate will take the place of the existing borough rate, poor rate and water rate.  The contract water rate will remain.  In order to preserve the existing partial exemptions as nearly as possible the municipal rate will be levied on seven-tenths of the valuation of arable land or meadow within the city and on three-fifths of the half-rents rateable under the Poor Relief Acts.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides machinery by which an application by the corporation for extension can be examined and a Provisional Order obtained.  The position of the officers and servants of the corporation will remain unchanged except that they will be under the control and supervision of the manager. Employees, if they have 20 years' service, are given the benefit of the provisions of Section 53 of the Local Government Act of 1925, with regard to superannuation, and this power can be exercised within a period of two years or longer if the Minister, on the application of the corporation, extends the period.  The corporation may acquire lands and drain them if they are capable of being improved by drainage and such improvement would increase the amenities of the city.  The lands which the section is to deal with are the Kilbarry marshes, which lie on the south boundary of the City of Waterford and are at present partly in the county.  They form a large tract <Col N="574" /> about 240 acres and are covered with water for the greater part of the year. The Bill has been presented with the object of making better provision for the administration of the municipal services in Waterford by bringing the system of civic government there into line with that now in operation in the other county boroughs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a matter of satisfaction that a Bill of this kind, extending the principle of city management, can be introduced by the present Government and that it can, as I believe it will, obtain, so far as the principle is concerned at any rate, support from every section of the House.  It is, I think, a matter of considerable satisfaction that that is so, because it does not seem so very long since certain sections of the country were violently opposed to the principle, and I think it shows that, when a new principle is introduced, which is opposed but which, nevertheless, in practice works well, it is possible to get acceptance and to get the principle carried unanimously. Although the Minister did not expressly say so, I take it that there is no local opposition to this measure, and if that is the case I think it is one which can be supported by every one in this House.  I, at any rate, am very glad to support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware, there is practically no opposition to this Bill in Waterford City, and I think that the majority of the citizens approve of it and that, with the exception perhaps of some small details, it will meet with universal acceptance. There are one or two small matters to which perhaps it will do no harm to call attention.  One is in connection with the extension of the borough boundary.  The Minister stated that this applies practically entirely to the Kilbarry Marshes on the Waterford side of the city.  I should like to know whether, if the council decided to reclaim these marshes, the area of charge would be confined to the council area within the boundary, or would it be extended to the county?  Formerly, when this matter was before the <Col N="575" /> County Council of Waterford, in consultation with the corporation, the difficulty was as to whether the area of charge should be confined to the city or extended to the county.  The county held that whatever advantage would be derived would be entirely to the city and that the county ratepayers would derive practically no benefit from such a scheme.  I do not think it is distinctly stated in the Bill that the area of charge is to be confined to the council, and I should like the Minister to let us know if I am right in my surmise that it can be extended to the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some may take exception to the powers that will be vested in the manager.  It will be said, of course, that the council will have the power to strike the rate, but will have no power in the expenditure of the money.  Well, that is a debatable point, I suppose, but looking at it from the business point of view, there has been so much of a load placed on the shoulders of members of public authorities in the various counties now that it is almost impossible to have this work done by voluntary means.  There has been too much of a load put on the shoulders of the public representatives to have this work carried out, and although I can see the danger in this type of measure of the introduction of the thin end of bureaucracy, still I must admit that, for the purposes of efficient administration, such a measure as this is essential. I have been a member of public bodies and I know what a tremendous amount of work was thrown on their shoulders, say, ten years ago, and that work has been considerably increased in the past few years, with the result, as I say, that it is almost impossible for the members to cope with it.  I myself have often presided at meetings of a county board of health and, after seven hours' work, we could not get the agenda completed.  I do not know how public bodies to-day manage to get through the agendas they often have to face, and whatever we might think about the danger of bureaucracy we must admit the necessity for such a change as this.  Work, to be efficiently <Col N="576" /> done, must be done by people who can devote their whole time to it, and under the present conditions and under the mass of work that councils now have to face, as I say, I think it would be almost impossible work for men meeting once a month or even once a fortnight, and when you take into account the various issues that arise and often cause a lot of controversy and keep men debating and disputing for hours at a stretch, you can understand how difficult it is to have the work completed satisfactorily.  All things considered, I think we have to agree that this measure is essential, and I think it will claim universal support.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and I believe the citizens of Waterford are pretty well satisfied with its provisions. I know that the Minister accepted some amendments that were moved in the Dáil by Waterford representatives on behalf of the City of Waterford, and as a result of the Minister's acceptance of these amendments I am confident that the Bill is very much more acceptable now than it was when it was first introduced.  I support the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, most of us are not directly interested in this Bill inasmuch as it applies to one city only, but had it been a general Bill, embracing all the urban councils of Eire, some of us might have something to say.  I would refer particularly to Section 28 of the Bill where reference is made to unoccupied houses.  That is a very sore point with most of the urban authorities in Eire, inasmuch as we find all buildings rated at the beginning of the year, including derelict old stores, houses and shops.  They are all rated and you find, at the end of the year, that only about five-sixths of the rate is productive; that is, that approximately one-sixth of the valuation of a town is non-productive. That affects the town adversely, in this way: when the county council are making their demand on the urban authority for their proportion of the poor rates they base their figure on the full valuation of the town, whereas, as I said before, about one-sixth of it is <Col N="577" /> non-productive.  The urban authorities then find that they have to pay a poor rate to the county council on unoccupied shops, stores and private houses from which they collect nothing. I do not know if Waterford is paying a rate to the county council. If it does I think that matter should be taken into consideration even for waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill related to the urban towns in general some of us would have considerably more to say.  As a matter of fact, I think most of the urban authorities at the present time are contemplating&mdash;at least I am contemplating and it is a common view &mdash;that urban towns must be deurbanised altogether.  The business of small towns has decreased so much owing to the revolutionary change in the distribution of goods that they will never be able to carry a double rate. I think the time is near at hand when the Government, whatever Government is in power, will find it necessary to de-urbanise small towns and have the small towns run by the county manager and on a flat rate with the rest of the county.  I understand that we will have more local government legislation in the neat future and the Minister who, among others, has always been associated with cities and towns, should at least understand something about towns. We generally find, both in the Dáil and the Seanad, that nobody seems to care two hoots what happens to towns. All the talk is about, well, other sections of the community.  The Minister here present should at least understand because, as I have said, he has been associated with the workings of towns and cities all his life.  I do wish now to bring before his notice the possibility that in future legislation he will take into consideration the desirability of de-urbanising small towns.  It will take a bit of organisation, I know.  They have borrowed moneys that could not be made good by the rest of the county but every urban town has incomes from houses and various sources, and I think the incomes would pay off the interest and sinking fund on all their loans. Savings could be effected in eliminating <Col N="578" /> the duplication of the staffs that exist at the present time.  There are borough surveyors, county surveyors and assistant county surveyors all over the place and there is no reason why one set of officials should not work the county and a small urban town in their stride.  This has no strict relation to the Waterford Bill. I am saying it chiefly because I wish the Minister to bear it in mind for a future occasion.</P>

      <P>I think that the principle of managership, certainly in boroughs, if not elsewhere, has been generally accepted as a good principle and, as the House knows, it has been pretty widely extended in the last few years.  I do not know, except from perhaps the Labour Party, that there was at any time strong objection in principle to managerial control.  I know that in the Dáil, when I went in there early, I and my Party took an interested part in discussing the Dublin Bill, but my recollection is that it was on questions of detail, not on the question of the principle of introducing a city manager into Dublin, that there was opposition from the Party with which I was associated.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Goulding, the Corporation of Waterford would first have to ask for and then get its boundaries extended before it could take in the Kilbarry Marshes and if the city's boundaries were extended to take in these marshes they would <Col N="579" /> become the property of the city, so to speak; they would come within the boundaries of the city; it would be for the corporation to decide what they wished to do with them in the way of drainage and they themselves and the citizens of Waterford would be responsible for whatever charge would accrue arising out of the improvements.  The county could not be assessed for rates for something they were not responsible for.</P>
      <P>I was rather surprised to hear a Senator from County Clare, I think, suggesting that the county council might take in the town of Ennis.  I gathered that was what was at the back of his mind, although he did not say that definitely.  I wonder if the Senator would receive in that the whole-hearted support of his citizens? I know he is in a responsible position to speak for the town, but I think that the people of Ennis would believe they were not certainly adding to the prestige of their town by being included in and put under the control of the county.  I would like to hear further expressions of opinions from the Senator and representatives on the various local authorities or on the urban council of Ennis as to whether they would like that idea put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we have three petitions or requests at the present time from different towns wanting to give up their urban status and be taken over and controlled by the county council. That is a new kind of development.  It has occurred before, but it is a new kind of development that is being watched with interest by the Department of Local Government.  We are considering the problem because these three cases have arisen and it is quite possible as we can see from reports we get from our inspectors, that there will be other moves from other towns in that direction.  Possibly Senators here know that there is a prospect, as has been mentioned before in the Dáil, that a County Managership Bill will be introduced, and when that is brought in and passed through the Oireachtas it is possible that there may <Col N="580" /> be other towns making the request that these three towns I speak of have recently made.  It may be that the system may become so popular in certain smaller urban areas that they would like to be included under the county council and under the managers that will be appointed.  It is also possible that economies could be made if that system were adopted but, for the moment, beyond the three cases that are under consideration, it is not likely that the system will be adopted in any other towns.</P>
    <P>So far as the managerial system has been in operation up to the present since it was first introduced in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Dun Laoghaire, I think I can say that it has worked with satisfaction.  There have been individual cases of complaint, mostly from Cork.  There have been practically no complaints of the system in Dublin, none in Dun Laoghaire and none in Limerick so far.  It has not been so long in operation in Limerick. There have been some complaints with regard to Cork, and there are at present under consideration some amendments of the system to meet criticisms that have been made by public men in the City of Cork.  But, on the whole, the system has worked well and advantageously for everyone concerned.  I think that is creditable to all who had a part in introducing it.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill follows the lines of the temporary Acts passed in the years 1935 and 1936 for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  It is a permanent measure, and further special legislation will become necessary only if it be decided to change the basis of distribution of the grant.  The grant for the present year is £1,870,000 and Section 4 of the Bill and the Schedule show the allocation of this grant between county councils.  If the additional grant voted in any year is £370,000, that is the same as this year, the allocation between counties will be as set out in the Bill.  If the extra amount is more or less than £370,000 the allocation will be determined by an order of the Government which will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The method of applying the grant to the relief of rates remains unchanged. Occupiers of holdings of a land valuation of £20 or less will get relief from rates by way of an allowance called the primary allowance.  The occupiers of holdings above £20 in land valuation get this allowance on the first £20 of valuation only.  This allowance is given at the same rate as was allowed in each county in the year 1933-34 on the first £10 of valuation.  The primary allowances absorb altogether £1,201,000 of the grant.</P>
      <P>For occupiers with land valuation above £20 there are employment allowances granted in respect of men at work on the holding.  The allowance is calculated on a valuation of £12 10s. 0d. for each man continuously employed throughout the previous calendar year. If the occupier has not so much additional valuation as £12 10s. 0d. for each man the allowance is calculated on the actual valuation in excess of £20. These employment allowances cost £333,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> A little over £9,000 goes to urban authorities in respect of relief on land that has been brought within urban boundaries since the year 1898.  There is then a balance of £326,000 which goes by way of supplementary allowance in relief of rates on the part of the land valuation above £20 that does not rank for an employment allowance.  The supplementary allowance is at a lower rate than the primary allowance.  In most counties it approximates to one half.</P>
    <P>A new provision has been introduced in section by which a reasonable sum may be set aside out of the grant to meet claims for additional allowances. These claims are due principally to holdings being divided after the valuation lists have been made up.</P>
    <P>Provision has also been made for the issue of credit notes for part of the rate relief.  Last year only five counties availed of their powers to issue credit notes under a corresponding section in the Act in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a mistake for the Minister, in getting this Bill through the House, to assume that by introducing it he is making the ratepayers in the county board of health areas satisfied: that he is doing what is fair and just by them.  I want to tell him that they are not satisfied.  Possibly, the Minister has been told that quite frequently and he may know that it is true.  Senator Honan has described the Minister as a townsman.  He may feel that, being a townsman administering the country's affairs, he has to give a divided allegiance.  But we know, although it is said that people do not speak up for the towns as they do for the country, that the town always comes off best.  It is a fact that the rates in the country districts to-day are higher by £852,000 than they were in 1931-32.  So far as the Minister's administration is concerned, there has been no corresponding increase in the amount of the grants coming to the rural community from the Central Fund.  It is a fact that the policy of the Minister has been responsible, to a very great extent, for this very considerable increase in the demand made <Col N="583" /> on the local ratepayers for all sorts of schemes, quite good in themselves, but very expensive.  All that increase is being borne by the occupiers of land.</P>
      <P>The Minister now wants to make this measure permanent on the lines on which it has been administered over the past four years.  The total amount of the Agricultural Grant is not anything like as large as it ought to be. I hold that the local ratepayers are definitely entitled to much greater relief from the Central Fund than the Minister is making available for them, mainly because there has been such a large increase in local taxation.  There is the additional fact that the capacity of the farmer to-day to carry this increased burden is not at all what it was in 1931-32.  There are many reasons for that.  A number of them are known to the Minister and to members of his Party.  I need not go into them at any length now, but the fact is not contested, even by members of the Minister's Party, that the capacity of the farmer to bear taxation is not as good now as it was in 1931-32.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position of the farmer with regard to the amount of rates which he is paying?  To-day, these amount to £3,057,558 as against £2,445,269 in 1931-32.  That being the position, one cannot expect the farmer to say that it is just.  On the other hand, there is no use in telling us of the benefits that have accrued to the farmer as a result of the halving of the land annuities.  It may be that when the farmers of this generation are dead and gone&mdash;when all they suffered during the economic war is long forgotten&mdash;a new generation, if a new generation is left, will derive some benefit from that particular process.  The position, undoubtedly, at the moment is not being met by what the Minister is making available through this Bill.  There are certain other considerations as well. His predecessors gave a larger grant than that which is forthcoming presently. The Minister changed the basis of the grant and started operating this scheme whereby the grant becomes available on the basis of the <Col N="584" /> employment given.  I do not know whether the Minister has ever thought of examining the results of this scheme, to see whether it is bearing fruit or not.</P>
    <P>In the first place, there has obviously been no encouragement given to employment on the land through the operations of this scheme. We have actually 43,000 people fewer employed&mdash;42,187 fewer males employed in agriculture now than we had when this Act started to operate&mdash;so that, if the Minister wants an answer as to whether he is getting anywhere in the matter of employment on the land under this scheme, the obvious answer, as shown by the figures themselves, is that he is not.  He thought that he was doing better by applying the grant in this way in the matter of giving employment.  Any sensible man&mdash;a farmer, anyhow&mdash;if he attempted some scheme that he believed was going to be for the betterment of himself or of his industry, and found after working it for three or four years that it was not bringing the expected results, would certainly contemplate a change.  The Minister is going to make this scheme permanent, instead of trying to introduce a change.</P>
    <P>I wonder has the Minister ever thought of applying a scheme from the point of view of trying to get increased production.  It seems to me that what we have got to face up to here is to try to get greater production in agriculture.  Greater production is the essential thing, greater production per unit of labour employed.  If the Minister is doing anything, it seems to me that this scheme is to encourage a type of labour on the land that is not the most efficient, that is costly. There is a certain encouragement to keep men working, whether the return is being obtained from them or not. Take the case of a farmer in, say, Limerick or Tipperary or North Cork, or in any of the dairying districts where to-day they have problems with regard to labour difficulties, including the difficulty of getting labour in consequence of the Agricultural Wages Act, the Hours of Employment Act, and so on, difficulties which, generally, <Col N="585" /> have to be met and faced by the dairy farmer in getting his work done, getting his cows milked punctually, regularly and efficiently.  Now, if a farmer placed like that decides to put in a milking machine and perhaps drops a man or two men, partly because the men are not available and perhaps, to some extent, because they are not as efficient as he would like them to be, that man actually may increase his total production.  He is the best type of citizen, the best type of farmer, but in spite of his greatly increased productivity, he will, if he drops a man, actually lose in the amount of grant which would be made available to him.  I do not think that is right.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to try to encourage in this country, so far as he can encourage work on the land at all, efficient production and greater quantities. The Minister's present scheme does not do that.  It works like this. A small farmer may have two or three, or perhaps four, sons.  The father of the sons will get relief in his rates, in the name of his sons, so to speak; and you will discover in fact that the sons are engaged in casual work with a neighbouring farmer.  In many cases because a man is not being permanently employed he will not be taken into account.  A great many of our farmers cannot afford to employ or engage as many permanent hands as they would like.  There is a great deal of seasonal employment in agriculture, but the Minister gives no consideration to that at all.  This seasonal employment is a very expensive type of labour, and the Minister ought to give some consideration to that point of view.  This scheme gives relief neither to the best farmers, nor to the best type of farming, nor to the type which ought to be encouraged by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  The Minister will tell us&mdash;at least he told the Deputies in the other House&mdash;that the farmers are well off, that he does not like to hear them grumbling, and, generally, that the condition of the farming community is comfortable enough, so that there is no justification <Col N="586" /> for any complaints.  I do not think that the farmer grumbles any more than he has justification for.  The farmers' difficulties are not, I think, treated by the Minister with the sympathy which they are entitled to get from him.  The Minister, for instance, is in charge of the Road Fund, yet we found in the Budget policy for this year that he was prepared to acquiesce in this fund being raided by the Minister for Finance to the extent of £150,000.  The ratepayers' grouse against the Minister is that he sends down orders from his Department to local authorities, laying down just what they are to do in the matter of administration of rates and what he will do for them if they do so-and-so. If they point out their difficulties, that they are not getting in rates&mdash;the greatly increased rates which ratepayers have to pay to-day&mdash;and say to the Minister that he ought to give them some money, he will reply that the money is not available, that it is not in the Road Fund.  It is not there because he has permitted the Minister for Finance to raid it.  The moneys in the Road Fund are there for a definite purpose, to relieve the burdens on the local ratepayers in the matter of the maintenance and construction of roads; but the Minister is prepared to acquiesce in the policy of the Minister for Finance in taking £150,000 from that fund.  As I have said before in this House, it is not the amount which the Minister has taken on this occasion that the local ratepayers are most concerned about: it is the attitude of the Government and the attitude of the Minister for Local Government himself, who does not seem to have sufficient appreciation and understanding of the position in which the local ratepayers are placed to-day, as he is permitting that policy to be established here as a practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to have done more this year towards the relief of local rates.  He is charged with the responsibility, in the administration of this money, in my view, of encouraging the greatest amount of production which it is possible to get from the land.  I do not believe that the way in which this scheme has been administered <Col N="587" /> so far has achieved those results at all.  The Minister set out, believing that he could encourage greater employment on the land by administering these moneys in this way.  They are gone, and he has failed; and, in view of the situation which confronts the country now, the Minister&mdash;in my judgment&mdash;ought to examine and recast his whole scheme.  In the first place, he is not giving the farmers what they ought to get nor what he ought to give them, in order that they may have what they require in the way of assistance. In the second place, he is not even doing what he hoped himself.  Instead of more employment, more production, we have definitely fewer people employed.  In circumstances like this, the Minister cannot say that his policy is justified, and I do not think he ought to ask this House to make permanent the situation that now exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the extraordinary position of farmers with agricultural land within some of the urban areas.  These farmers are not entitled to any benefits from the Agricultural Grant, and are compelled to pay the full county demand on very high valuations, while, on the other side of the fence, that is, in the rural area, the farmers are getting the full benefit of these grants.  So far as I can see, the urban farmer has no advantage over his neighbour in the rural area.  He has to compete in the same market; he gets the same price for his produce; and he pays the same wages.  Yet, the urban farmer has, in many instances, to pay three times as much in rates as the rural farmer, though they are both in the very same position in every respect, and all because the urban farmer is deprived of the benefits of the Agricultural Grant.  I hope the Minister will look into this matter before the next stage of the Bill, and I ask him to bring in an amendment to extend the benefits of the Agricultural Grant to urban farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisMByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>On whatever else I may disagree with Senator Baxter, I am <Col N="588" /> altogether in favour&mdash;and I think the Minister knows it&mdash;of getting increased agricultural grants.  In fact, I have been advocating that for a long time. What I particularly want to draw the Minister's attention to is the matter to which Senator Baxter has referred. The Minister told us that the allowances are now divided under three headings.  The primary allowance means that everybody gets a certain sum and, in the county with which I am most familiar, it amounts to about 5/11 in the £ on the first £20 of valuation. Then, there is the supplementary grant, which is the grant I want to emphasise.  In our county it works out at about 5/9 on the first £12 10s. of valuation for every man employed. When all that money is used up, the balance of the amount allocated to the country is spread over the land which has not yet been relieved.  I take quite a different view from that taken by Senator Baxter, because I believe that the reason there is not more employment is that that does not encourage people to employ.  Assume that I employ a man and that I get 5/9 in respect of £12 10s. of my valuation.  In our county it works out that the amount left for division over land not yet relieved comes to about 2/10 in the £, with the result that when I employ a man I get somewhere about £3 12s., whereas if I do not employ a man I get 24/-.  I know that it works out at only about 35/- or 36/- for every man I employ, and that is not going to encourage people to employ very many men.  A sum of 35/ in the year would not pay their insurance.  Many of the farmers I know do not stop half the insurance, but if they did it would take most of the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the remaining 2/10 in our county&mdash;it works out differently in other counties&mdash; should be spread over all the land and that a farmer should not be penalised because he employs men.  I suggest that when he gets his allowance up to £12 10s., any money left should be spread over everybody.  That would help us, to some extent.  Despite all that is said to the contrary I believe that the idea of encouraging people to give all the employment they possibly <Col N="589" /> can on the land is good.  We hear a good deal about people running away from the land.  People will continue to run away from the land when they cannot get a living on it.  We hear a good deal also about increasing our production. I am strongly in favour of it, but there is not much use in having increased or efficient production, until we are able to get cost of production out of what we have to sell.  That is the big problem.  We talk all the time about rates, rent and wages, but we never seem to concentrate, as organised farmers, except in very few instances, on getting what we are entitled to and what everybody else is entitled to, not only the cost of production, but something over and above for ourselves.  I want to emphasise that.  I am asking the Minister to look into that matter for next year.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal nowadays as to how the farmer should be relieved, as to derating, and we also have suggestions from time to time for the inauguration of a scheme by which part wages would be paid for men employed on land.  I think that, under this scheme, that could be developed to a much greater extent, and that if there is money available, under a scheme of this nature, it would confer much greater benefits than some of the schemes suggested.  Even at the cost of repetition, I emphasise again that the Minister will not induce people to employ more men if the man who is not giving any employment gets a much bigger share of this grant under the present system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter to which I want to refer.  I do not know whether I shall be strictly within the rules of debate in referring to it, but I base my remarks upon some sympathetic references made by the Minister to the towns.  I entirely endorse the remarks of Senator Honan in reference to this matter, and I sincerely hope that when the Valuation Bill is being considered here, he will put into practical effect, by the registration of his vote, the remarks he made about towns.  The Minister was rather surprised at, but, if you like, <Col N="590" /> welcomed, the remarks of Senator Honan that there ought to be a recasting with regard to the basis of rates in their application to urban towns.  I am here in a dual capacity.  While I live in a town, I also farm a very considerable acreage of land.  I also represent rural areas on a council elected by the farmers, but I must say that the condition of towns over a number of years has been despairingly bad.  Even before the economic war, the depression was perfectly obvious in the towns, due to conditions not attributable to either the previous or the present Government.  There are many agencies operating which have made it impossible for people in urban areas to meet their commitments to-day, but nobody will controvert this statement, that it is appalling to go through the towns to-day and to see the condition of shops and businesses generally.  Many of them have been closed and inevitably rural towns, apart from one or two shops will become, as I said here before, monuments of decay.  They get no relief from the Agricultural Grant.</P>
      <P>We have to meet the county rate as struck by the county council based upon the valuation of our premises in towns.  Assuming for argument's sake that the valuation of premises runs as it does in my town, from £14 to £30, there are many farms, something in the region of 40,000 whose valuation is £10 and under.  Take men doing very little business in towns, men with large families.  They have to pay that county rate from which they get no relief.  Even the Bill we are discussing to-day does not bring them within its ambit.  It does not bring within the ambit those dwellers in urban areas who have land.  Many of those in the towns have land and they pay the maximum county rate increased by serious charges in the town rate plus extras for electricity, water rate and so on, matters which the Minister may say are very beneficial. They are very beneficial services. But the conditions operating as a result of matters over which no Government had control has been intensified by the economic war.  But we are past that stage now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> I was delighted to hear a speech from the Minister holding out a sympathetic beacon to us in the towns. The Minister for Local Government and Public Health said he would welcome other towns forcing the issue upon him to introduce a Bill at a subsequent period to have a flat rate charged upon the county.  I, on hearing the Minister, was delighted with that statement, and I shall take every opportunity as an urban dweller to broadcast that sympathetic lead given here to-day.  I also trust that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health will consider the point raised by Senator C.M. Byrne.  It is obviously unfair that people who have poor, struggling shops in towns and have also land within the urban area, do not come within this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is this one other point.  In order to get relief in rates a farmer must send in a statistical return of his employees on the land.  Unless these people are employed for the whole year no relief is given.  I do not know whether this condition operates in other counties, but it does in mine. Men employed on the land are hired in my county about the month of March.  The terms of their employment terminate in December.  For that reason because they are not employed the whole year they do not come within the category stipulated in the Bill.  The result of that is that many farmers who were doing their best to give employment to labourers on the land are debarred from receiving relief in rates. I have met some farmers who may not have a very great scruple of conscience and they may put down that they are employing the men for the whole year. But I know a number of farmers who definitely refuse to take any such advantage; these latter have not an elastic conscience.  These men lose all relief on rates.  I hope the Minister will bear that point in mind with the other points that have been raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of telling the Minister that the position of the farmers to-day is not a good one.  Some Senators in this House <Col N="592" /> and many people outside would lay the blame for that on the economic war. These people seem to have never heard of the world-wide depression which followed the Wall Street crash in 1929. That world-wide depression wiped out whole countrysides of farmers in Europe and America and even without the economic war it would have had a very bad effect in this country.  Running side by side with the economic war, this depression operated very cruelly against the farmers.  The farmers have not yet retrieved the position they held before 1929.  I do not think that the Minister or his colleagues can be blamed for that.  They ought not be blamed to the extent to which they are blamed.  I think some blame might be laid upon the Opposition. Their attitude during that period was scarcely right.  It was not right in the circumstances that did arise.</P>
      <P>It is true that there are less people on the land now than there were last year or than there were even four years ago.  I think the figures would be about 40,000 less than four years ago. That is largely due, perhaps, to what is happening in a neighbouring country now largely engaged in the manufacture of armaments.  In that country high wages are paid to workmen.  Our own people have gone across there. That is really the principal reason why there are so many less people on the land now than there was four or five years ago.</P>
      <P>The scheme of relief in rates in accordance with the number of agricultural labourers employed on land has been dealt with by Senators on the Opposition side and on this side of the House in a different way.  It appears to me that the development of this scheme of relief based on the number of agricultural labourers employed on the land is a very desirable one.  I cannot understand Senator Baxter's attitude on that question at all.  It seems to me that it is a very excellent thing to encourage the employment of more working men on the land.  It appears to me that one of the best ways of helping the employment of labour on the land is through the development of this scheme of relief in the rates.</P>

      <P>It is not doing it but there are reasons why it is not doing it.  I have already mentioned the question of high wages in the neighbouring country.  There are many young people who have gone across to the neighbouring country to avail of the higher wages.  However, when things become more normal this development of relief in rates will serve its purpose very well.  Some reference has been made to relief in rates in the urban areas.  I think land in urban areas is valued very much higher than in rural areas.  I am aware that in my own town three acres of land recently realised something like £600. Other plots of land in the same district have also been sold at high prices recently.  I do not know whether that applies in towns that are not so progressive. Land in other areas may not have as much value as in my town. I do believe the people in urban areas are no worse off than their brothers in rural districts.  The decline in the towns has been also referred to.  My solution for the restoration of the prosperity of the towns would be to restore prosperity to the countryside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker seemed to imply that the one feasible way of increasing employment on the land was through this method of giving relief in the rates.  Now there is only one way in which employment on the land is going to be increased and that is by bringing about a situation in which the owner of the land will find that by employing men to work and exploit the land, its productiveness will be sufficient to give a fair wage to the men employed and an element of profit to the owner of that land.  The idea that relief to the extent of 30/- a year in rates is suddenly going to make the <Col N="594" /> land flourish and bloom like the bay tree is perfectly ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">

      <P>Yes, but the extension of that tenfold?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, then all I can say is that the land must necessarily be far too highly rated.  If you are going to have land rated to such an extent that there is going to be a difference between the profit and loss created by a provision in the law which gives a reduction of 30/- in rates for the employment of one man, that means that the basic rate on land is enormously too high.  There is only one way in which you can secure productive employment on the land and that is by creating a situation in which a man who owns 50, 100 or 1,000 acres will find that the application of human labour to that land will make it possible for the worker to receive a wage which will induce him to accept that work and not go off to the towns or emigrate to England.  If the employer who gives employment on the land sees that by the basic commodity which belongs to him, his position is improved, then that man will give employment.  But this business of pitiful relief in rates amounting from 30/- to 35/- is absolutely meaningless to the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is made clear to the man who owns the land that that land really belongs to him and if conditions are such that by the employment of labour he can make a profit, then there will be employment given.  At present the man is told that the land does not belong to him, that it belongs to the Government.  If I own a factory I pay the basic rates on my buildings which do not occupy much land.  I pay income-tax on the profit I make. If my men like to go on strike they can go on strike, and if I like to have a lock-out I can have a lock-out, but I do not think that is desirable.  I would much rather see State arbitration operating.  Now, behind the Bill with which we were dealing last week and behind this Bill is the assertion that the owner of the land does not own it.  We have been told the occupier of the land does not own it, <Col N="595" /> that it is the Government owns it.  We are to have a position in which the Government is to say whether the man occupying the land is using it in the best possible way.  We are told that is to be decided by somebody outside the owner of the land.  That is a view to which I strongly object.</P>
    <P>Again in this debate we have heard a lot of talk about relief.  &ldquo;Relief&rdquo; is a word that I do not like in this connection. This relief, as it is called, was administered, not by way of charity.  It was a facing up to equities and to the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>The last speaker set out at the beginning to try to argue that the appalling condition of agriculture in this country during the last number of years was only mildly conditioned by the economic war and that it was basically due to world economic conditions. What is the fact?  He referred to the slump in Wall Street in 1929.  The present Government did not come into office until 1932.  The Senator can look up the official statistics published by the League of Nations, and he will see that, during the preceding period when the Government of which I was a member was in power, the value of production and trade in this country diminished to a very small amount.  The decline, if I remember rightly, was only 10 per cent.  In fact the decline was less than in any other country for which the figures were given in that official report.  The present Government then came in and apparently chose that moment, which the previous speaker agrees was the last moment that any prudent man would choose, to embark on such an enterprise as the economic war.  If he will look up the figures, he will find that as far as the world economic condition was concerned, this country suffered less than any other country in the world while the previous Government was in office. On the other hand, he will find that, after the present Government was elected, this country suffered proportionately to a much higher degree than any other country in the world.  I am <Col N="596" /> not going to say that the difference as a result of a change in policy is exactly registered because undoubtedly certain other conditions may enter in.</P>
    <P>I object to the suggestion that the owner of land has not the same right of ownership as the owner of industrial property or any other form of property and I object to this being called &ldquo;relief.&rdquo;  I do not think anybody will contest that in the year 1934 a man who was unfortunate enough to own a certain number of acres of land in this country was very badly circumstanced, in comparison with other members of the community.  The ownership of land meant to him nothing else but a loss.  Taking the bulk of the farmers of the country in these years, whatever may be happening now, these men owned what was called an asset, but it was not an asset.  During that period the Government insisted that these men, for owning land which had only the effect of depleting their savings or of involving them in debt, for the privilege of being legally possessed of something which only meant a loss and which they could only continue to possess by having some savings behind them or by going into debt, should be assessed for rates.  You may remember that during that time when we pointed out the absolute inequity of the condition of things then prevailing, there was an appeal made to the baser passions of the people of the country that we were arguing that poor law relief should come to an end.  The first concern of the farmers during that period should have been for their families and, by the law of the land, they were technically getting relief from the Government. In fact, if they had savings they had to pour out these savings, not only to maintain their families but to maintain these charges which had been put upon them.</P>
    <P>I do feel that a great deal has got to be done if we are going to bring agriculture into the position that it should occupy as the only really effective production apart from one or two minor industries, which we have in this country.  One of the first steps we should take is to try to reduce <Col N="597" /> the fixed overhead charges on agriculture. We saw the effect of these fixed overhead charges in 1934.  These charges might have been equitable in relation to the conditions which existed in previous years but they were so fixed that, when the farmers were not in that condition, still the binding nature of these charges was enforced by the seizure of cattle and by every form of coercion the Government could bring to bear.  Therefore, I object to the word &ldquo;relief.&rdquo;  If I remember rightly, in the last year of office of the previous Government the relief given to agriculture amounted to almost £2,000,000. When we took over from the British in 1922, the relief given to agriculture from central taxation was roughly £600,000.  Another £600,000 was added in 1926 and 1927 and, I think in 1930 or 1931, a further sum of £750,000 was given, making in all a grant of £1,950,000, in relief of agricultural rates.  The only reason that that was done then, and the only reason it is done now, is that on examination of the local taxation of the country, it was found that when the local councils assess their rates for services, which are largely dictated to them by the central Government, it would impose a completely inequitable burden on the farmers of the country if they had to pay these rates as assessed.  Consequently you should not use the word &ldquo;relief&rdquo; in relation to these grants. The Government is trying by a rather devious method to arrange that the inequity operating against farmers shall be a little less inequitable than it has been previously.</P>
    <P>There is another question on which I should like some information.  There is a fixed sum here which is supposed to be applied for the relief of agriculture and, normally, the Government Department calculates on a sort of budget for that.  You can do that.  You could do it when we had nearly £2,000,000 given in relief of agriculture because you knew the acreage and the valuation of holdings throughout the country to which this sum would be applied.  I do not quite understand&mdash; I have no doubt the Minister can explain it quite simply&mdash;how it is proposed to apply this fixed sum in relief <Col N="598" /> or how he bases his calculation, which may vary according to circumstances. For instance, presumably some years ago it was calculated that this relief given in respect to the employment of labour would relate to the employment of so many men.  As a matter of fact, as Senator Baxter has pointed out, there are 42,000 less men employed now than there were some short time ago.  The Minister has made a certain calculation, I take it, of the number of men employed, but suppose one-half of the men employed cease to be employed during the next 12 months or suppose the number is doubled during the next 12 months.  I do not quite understand how his book-keeping will work out in that event because if you allow so much for every man, you will have that amount multiplied by the number employed on the land.  I should like to know how the Minister's calculations will work out in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to discuss the little incident of the financial dispute with England, and I rise merely to ask the Minister a question.  On the last occasion when there was a Relief of Rates Bill in this House, I moved an amendment which would grant relief of half the rates on land held in fee simple.  The Minister promised on that occasion to consider the matter, and to see if something could be done in the next Bill.  I want to know if the Minister has since considered the matter, and whether he proposes to do anything. In 1933 a Land Bill was introduced which granted relief of half the annuities to people who held land from the Land Commission or who were paying rents in other ways.  They got a reduction of half those annuities or half those rents.  The proposal I put up on that occasion was that, as the reduction was given as compensation for their losses during the economic war, the people who held agricultural land in fee simple were entitled to the same consideration.  They suffered quite as much as the people who paid annuities, and should receive some consideration. The Minister promised to consider the matter, and to do something if possible on his next Relief of Rates Bill.  I should like to know whether anything <Col N="599" /> has been done about it, and whether the Minister will accept an amendment on the Committee Stage of this Bill to do what I want to do, and what he spoke so sympathetically about on that occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to ask the Minister to increase the agricultural grant, because he would ask me where the money is to come from, and I could not answer that.  We are already burdened up to the hilt, and of course the only remedy is to reduce the charges on farms.  I am not going to pursue that; Senator Fitzgerald referred to it.  The farmers' overheads are growing every day, and that is where the trouble comes from.  There was a certain plea made for extending those agricultural grants, in some way or other to the towns.  I cannot see the soundness of that.  I agree that the towns are suffering, and there again of course that is a reflection of the suffering of the farmers.  The farmer adapts himself to his burden; the land goes on all the same, however poor he is. The townsman cannot do the same thing.  If his trade falls, the burden is more direct.  I cannot see any justification for diverting the agricultural grant.  The agricultural grant is intended to benefit the primary producers, and the primary producers are the people on whom the whole policy of the Government should be centred. That is why I have had differences with the Government for some years&mdash; because they have neglected the primary producers to the benefit of the secondary producers, and the burden of that artificial benefit to the secondary producers comes back on the primary producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter in relation to the Agricultural Grant about which the Minister has heard before, but I cannot neglect this opportunity to refer to it again, and that is the illusion which is conveyed by the figures given that that £1,800,000 is the sum the local authorities receive.  It is not. The iniquitous system of deducting sums on account of unpaid annuities still continues.  The Minister knows <Col N="600" /> the origin of that.  It has its origin in what we call those bad British days, when the British used that means of recovering arrears of annuities from the local taxation grant.  The British said: &ldquo;We are going to hold those grants against unpaid annuities as a sort of penal measure.&rdquo;  One would have thought that when this country became independent this penal method would have been abandoned.  Rates should be one thing and annuities another.  If the Land Commission fail to collect the annuities they should not penalise the local ratepayers, innocent men who had nothing to do with it at all.  Yet, in spite of repeated pressure &mdash;in fact an amendment was once passed by this Seanad, but was sent back by the Dáil&mdash;the system still continues. The Banking Commission reported against that iniquitous method, but it still goes on.  The effect of it is to make the Land Commission tardy in the collection of their annuities. When they know that the annuities are going to be paid for out of the rates, why should they bother to collect them?  There have been cases where five or six years' arrears were allowed to accumulate.  The land Commission does not mind; the ratepayers are paying for it.  The whole thing is a most unjust penalty on the local ratepayers.  I would ask the Minister whether the Government cannot seriously consider doing away with that anachronism, and separating altogether the collection of the annuities from the Agricultural Grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Senator Sir John Keane that the withholding of those grants on account of unpaid annuities is ridiculous.  It is very unfair to those who consistently and regularly pay their annuities that those who do not pay them are practically allowed to get away with it. I am afraid, as the Senator has pointed out, that the effect is to make the Land Commission rather indifferent as to whether they collect the annuities or not.  It is undoubtedly an incentive to the average ratepayer to get careless about paying his annuities, when he can see the indifferent, careless, or even wasteful and extravagant man <Col N="601" /> getting away with it.  Senator Baxter referred very rightly, to the fact that the burden of rates has increased during the past few years, but the Senator should realise that one cause of the increase is that schemes for the benefit of agriculture have been introduced. The cost of administering those schemes is borne by the local rates, and to some extent that has affected the burden.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all very well, but that is a scheme intended to aid the agricultural industry; it is not to aid the towns, about which we heard so much lately.  With regard to the inclusion of the urban areas, I am very sympathetic to that.  It is all very well for Senator O'Callaghan to say that land in urban areas is fetching so many hundred pounds an acre, but there are holdings in the urban areas paying very heavy urban rates in addition to the county rates, and those holdings will never have any value as potential building lands.  We are told, of course, that the farmer living within the urban area has certain privileges and certain facilities for the marketing of his produce.  Then we are always told that his land has a potential building value.  I know holdings in urban areas which will never be used for building at all, and those people have no advantage over their neighbours living a couple of miles out in the country.  With modern fast transport, it is a matter of indifference to a man whether he is living in an urban area or a couple of miles outside it; he can get his produce into the town just as quickly.  Of course the drawback in regard to this agitation <Col N="602" /> is that the people concerned are so few that nobody pays any attention to them, but their grievance is an undoubted one.  At the moment, of course, it would need special legislation to deal with them, but I would impress on the Minister that, although those people are few in number, they have a decided grievance, and some effort should be made to remedy that grievance.</P>
      <P>Some Senator said that if agricultural conditions were improved, the towns would improve.  I wonder would they.  Anyone who knows the country and is familiar with the changed conditions during the past few years knows that the tendency of legislation, and the tendency, I suppose, of trade, has been to do away with the towns. Legislation has helped the farmer, for instance, to establish co-operative societies.  Every effort has been made during the past few years by lectures and all sorts of inducements to get the farmers to co-operate.  I agree that the welfare of the towns up to the present, anyway, has depended on the surrounding country.  The reason for the existence of the small towns has been to cater for the needs of the surrounding country.  But look at what has happened in the past few years.  The farmer has begun to cater for himself. It would be interesting to get a return showing the turn-over of the various co-operative societies and especially of the shops which are run in opposition to the country shopkeeper.  There are many co-operative societies with a return of over £100,000 per year.  A considerable portion of that is made up of business taken away from the country shopkeeper.  I do not know if I am in order in introducing this, but it has some bearing on the question of the burden of rates as between the agriculturist and the townsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a new development.  These societies are there for the last 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that they have been operating for 20 years.  But the townsman has got no relief at all in his rates, and his business has been <Col N="603" /> going steadily downwards all the time. Some Senator pointed out that many of these towns will eventually become derelict and will be unable to pay any rates at all.  Of course, I can see no remedy in the Bill before us; but I wish to point out that other people in the country have grievances as well as the farmers.  We would all be very glad if we could give more relief to the farmers.  To reduce the overheads would be one way; but the best way would be to increase output, to increase production at a reasonable price, because I am afraid it will be very difficult to reduce overheads.  Whether we like it or not, the call for more and more social reforms is increasing.  We cannot resist it; no Government dare resist it.  The result, I am afraid, will be that the overhead costs, at least so far as the costs of public services are concerned, cannot be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can never speak of these things without bringing in the economic war. Of course, exception was taken to the statement that the depression in 1929 was used as an argument from the other side of the House.  But the real depression did not affect agriculture until 1933-1934.  It was then that the real agricultural depression came along.  It is very little use making a comparison between farmers in Ireland and farmers in America, Belgium, Holland, or anywhere else; but the agricultural depression certainly at the time was worldwide. I am not afraid to admit that it was accentuated by the economic war &mdash;there is no doubt about that.  But, even during the economic war, quite a number of farmers did not do too badly.  Many of them, by taking advantage of the schemes initiated at the time, certainly benefited largely. I know many of them, and I am sure every Senator knows others who, by taking advantage of the schemes initiated then, did not have such a bad time at all.  Undoubtedly, since then agricultural matters have not improved, prices have not improved.  Although the economic war is over, the price of cattle to-day is no better than during the last year or two of the economic war.  I am speaking subject to correction, but I understand that no better <Col N="604" /> price is obtainable to-day for cattle than was obtained two or three years ago.  If I am wrong in that, I shall be glad to be corrected.</P>
    <P>It all comes back to the question of rating.  However we try to administer relief, we must be careful to bear in mind the interests of the rest of the people.  Those who speak for the towns feel this matter very strongly. People in the towns have a decided grievance.  Many townspeople will tell you: &ldquo;The Government are using our money to help the farmers and to destroy us.  They are helping and encouraging the formation of co-operative societies, and using our money so that a certain price can be given for milk and milk products. That money is being used to destroy us.&rdquo;  Whether we like to admit it or not, the co-operative societies with their co-operative shops are one of the greatest factors in the destruction of the small towns.</P>

      <P>I wish to join in the request that has been made to the Minister on behalf of the agricultural holdings in urban areas.  We have a number of such holdings in Galway. A number of Senators stated that they do not see any reason why those people in the towns should get any relief.  I think Senators who make these statements do not know the exact position.  In the urban area of Galway there are some 200 people that this relief of rates will affect. Those people earn their living solely by agriculture.  They have to pay the county rate and the town rate.  If they engage workers, they have to give them a little more than if they were living in the rural areas.  They have no advantages.  The advantage of being near a market is gone now, because men who are living 15 or 20 miles away from a market can, with modern transport conditions, get to that market almost as quickly and almost as cheaply as those living in the urban areas.  People will say that they have facilities provided for them. The particular people for whom I am pleading have no facilities and never will have.  They will never have sewerage or water or light provided <Col N="605" /> for them.  Even if the Minister's Department or any other Department stated in the morning: &ldquo;We will give you a free grant to supply sewerage, water and light,&rdquo; that would not even put them into the advantageous position in which their neighbours in the rural areas are in the way of a market for their produce.</P>
      <P>In former times, of course, this was not such a great hardship, as those people, particularly around Galway City, were able to do some carting from the docks, and there were various other sorts of work they could undertake to supplement what they earned from agriculture.  Now, with modern transport, all that is gone.  As a matter of fact, the bulk of the milk supplied to the cities and towns at present comes from the rural areas. People talk about keeping people on the land, but the temptation to leave the land is certainly greater for the people who are nearest to the towns than it is for people further removed from them.  In order to succeed at present young people are doing their best to get positions in the towns. They are leaving the land to go to business in the towns, and if that continues there will be no one left on the land but old people.  If the land is to be worked properly, this relief of rates must be extended to all those who derive a living from agriculture.  As to the potential value of land for building purposes the area in the Bill should be extended for a few miles. The western side of Galway is suitable for building, but building will never take place in other portions of the city. I know of one family of ten that are eking out an existence on a few acres of land, but the owner cannot get a housing grant, although he has to compete with people on the urban boundary who get relief from rates.  I hope the Minister will amend the Bill, so that its benefits will be extended to the people I refer to.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great interest to this debate.  I do not think there was any suggestions made that I have not heard before, either here or in the Dáil, when similar Bills were under discussion. <Col N="606" /> Senator Sir John Keane put his finger on the only spot that gives any hope of meeting, to any extent, the various grievances that were put forward.  The remedy is to increase the Agricultural Grant.  I do not see that any recasting of the present Agricultural Grant would bring any great measure of relief to any of the classes that have been mentioned. I do not know that anybody minds very much whether it is called relief or not, as suggested by Senator Fitzgerald, provided there is enough money.  That is the principal point. If there is enough money there you can call it what you like.  As a matter of fact the Agricultural Grant has been very largely increased, more than quadrupled, in the last 20 years.  That was a big relief.  I am sorry for using a word to which Senator Fitzgerald objects so much, but it means the granting of relief, perhaps, to the largest section of our community. Senator Baxter, I know, did not mean to misquote me, but he paraphrased a number of statements I made in the Dáil in such a way, that he misquoted me, and did not quote accurately one phrase that I did use.</P>

      <P>The Senator misquoted me.  I did not use or intend to use the phrase he used.  I did not say that farmers were comfortably off.  If I used the word &ldquo;comfortably,&rdquo; I certainly did say that there was plenty of room for improvement.  I did say that they were &ldquo;monarchs of all they survey within the limits of their own farms.&rdquo;  That is true of them, much <Col N="607" /> more true than of any townsman in any kind of employment.  Farmers are in a much happier position.  I emphasise this, that they are not wealthy. Farmers are not wealthy in this or in any other country.  They will never become millionaires out of agriculture. That is a fact.  There is no comparison between farmers with 20 or 25 acres, or even if it is only 14 acres, and those who are town workers or small shopkeepers. There is no comparison of the life or of the freedom they enjoy.</P>

      <P>I know as many farmers as Senator Baxter or any other Senator.  I know them intimately and have lived with them.  I spoke to one farmer, after reading some criticism of some remarks of mine last week.  He is a big farmer and had 70 Irish acres, but is not wealthy.  I suppose he is 20 years farming for himself, but still not a wealthy man, with very little ready money.  He has now 115 acres of land.  I told him what his neighbours and himself would do, if five or ten acres of land were for sale in the neighbourhood&mdash;there would be a rush for them.  That is the fact.  I asked him why in the name of God they wanted more land, or if they had not enough.  His reply was that it was very hard to see it going.  When I said that they had not the money for it, he said they had credit.  Where will you get a shopkeeper or a townsman able to do the same thing?  You cannot get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been talk about the rates on agricultural land.  Actually the rates levied on agricultural land have not increased very much since 1929-30, certainly not since 1931-32.  Senator <Col N="608" /> Baxter quoted 1931, when the amount collected was £2,157,000 on all agricultural land.  What is the amount to-day?  £2,227,000.  Where is the enormous increase?  As Senator Baxter stated, there is an increase generally of roughly £100,000 on the total rate, but townspeople are bearing a much increased rate compared to the agricultural community.  Take any town you like and you will find increased rates.  I know that in the last few years my rates in Dublin have gone up 3/- in the £.  Everyone in Dublin pays that increase.  They are paying because they are getting increased and valuable services.  What applies to Dublin applies to Cork, Limerick and everywhere else.  The farmer is not bearing anything as large a proportion.  I would like to see him bearing less.  I would like to see the overhead charges on agriculture reduced.  I say that because, as Senator Goulding and Senator Baxter mentioned, I would like to see increased production.  I do not see any likelihood of any great decrease in overheads under present conditions.</P>
    <P>Every farmer, as well as other members of the community, looks for improved social services.  We all want to see them getting them.  If you ask farmers in this House or in the Dáil, whether we should have pensions for widows' and orphans', do you think any of them would turn down a proposition of that kind.  They would not.  They all want improved social services.  Every decent person in the country wants them, no matter what class he belongs to.  Of course, we cannot have them without paying for them, and every class of the community will have to bear their share.  The farmers are getting consideration from the Government. They got it from the last Government, they will get it from this Government, and they will always get special consideration because of their position.  Everybody knows that agriculture pays in the long run.  I do not agree that it does not pay.  Where are the families that came off the land three generations ago and went into Cork, Limerick and Dublin?  They have disappeared, but the families who remained on the land do not disappear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no comparison at all.  Go into any county and search back into the history of families and you will find they are on the same land generation after generation.  You cannot say the same of families in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Waterford.  There is that much advantage, anybody will have to admit, arising out of the life of the agriculturist as compared with the life of the townsman.  In 1924-25 the agricultural grant was £599,000. In 1935-36 it was £1,870,000.  That is a big growth in a short time.  Is there any other class of the community that has got anything comparable to that?</P>
      <P>I am not saying that the farmers do not deserve every penny of it and, if the money was there, that they should not get more.  I repeat what I said in the Dáil, that if the money was available, I do not see why they should not get more.  I do not deny that to them, and I would like to see them getting it, but, if they do get it, the farmers as well as everybody else will have to pay.  It is a matter of six of one and half-a-dozen of another.  It means increased taxation unless there can be such economies secured&mdash;and I do not see where the economies are going to be got&mdash;as would cover the amount required.</P>
      <P>In 1934-35 the agricultural grant was higher than at present.  It was £1,870,000 for the last three years, but in 1934-35 the amount was £1,950,000. There was a big increase in the years 1930 to 1932.  In 1930-31 the total agricultural grant was £1,198,000.  Then there was a general election in the offing.  There were at least two big Parties in the Parliament and I think it was the Fianna Fáil Party who proposed that the grant be increased by £1,000,000.  The Government of the time proposed £750,000.  The Government had to give in, seeing the general election coming, and they gave £750,000.</P>

      <P>We also increased the agricultural grant.  We went one better than the last Government and we increased it by £250,000.  A year or two later what did we do?  Senator Fitzgerald says we started the economic war.  We started the fight on behalf of the farmers, who were paying annuities that should never be paid. We kept these moneys and the farmers had their annuities reduced by 50 per cent., and we did not reduce the agricultural grant.  It is not as high as it was, but the farmers get the benefit of the halved annuities.  Every farmer, whether he came under the 1923 Act or any other Act, got the same benefit. That remains with the farmers.  The agricultural grant has been reduced by over £100,000 since 1934-35, but while it is somewhat reduced, there has been an enormous gift to all classes of <Col N="611" /> farmers except, perhaps, the ones Senator Counihan would be interested in, those who bought out.  They did not reap the same benefit, but all other farmers who pay annuities have got a 50 per cent. reduction, and that will remain with them for all time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how the Senator could say that.  I do not think I have anything more to say except in relation to the position in the towns.  Reference was made to agricultural land in urban areas.  That is admittedly a problem, and I have no doubt there are agriculturists in some towns who have a grievance.  I expect that when the valuation, which will be undertaken soon, I hope, of the hereditaments in the country in general is completed, that consideration will be given to that problem.  At present it would merely take off the agricultural grant a sum that is not sufficient to meet the demands that are being made on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to divide this agricultural grant over certain lands in urban areas for which demand is being made, there are lands that are not agricultural lands that would benefit and that ought not to benefit.  There are lands in the Galway area that I would not allow the money to go to if I could stop it. I happen to know something about the <Col N="612" /> City of Galway, where friends of mine have sold land at between £500 and £600 per plot for a house.  That would rank as agricultural land if we were to do what some Senators here want us to do.  If we were to buy the land for a housing scheme we would pay £200 to £300 an acre for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be the right thing to do unless we had a close examination of all land in the urban areas and have it divided into land that is really agricultural land and land that is building land and valued above what agricultural land normally would be.  The actual average increase in rates may be high on those who have little money and, generally speaking, the farming community have little ready money.  Taking the country as a whole, the average increase has not been so great.  Ten years ago, the time the Derating Commission sat, the average rate all over the country was 9/- in the pound.  Five years ago it was 10/-, and now it is 11/2 or 11/3.  But if that is so, there has been a great improvement in roads, and that is an advantage to the farmers as well as to other classes of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a town rate as well in most of the towns. However, take any county you like and get the members of the council and the board of health together to discuss what is required in that particular county and you will find that they want better hospitals, that they want improvements in the <Col N="613" /> mental hospital conditions, increases in the wages of the staff, increases of salaries for the officials, increases in sanatoria conditions, and so on, and you will find that the farmers, just as well as everybody else, will make these demands.  Now, it must be remembered that, while there are large sums available for the hospitals, even though these people succeeded in getting, as they have succeeded in some cases in getting, 100 per cent. of the cost of building a new hospital, that hospital has to be maintained, and the cost of maintenance of that hospital means a very material increase on the rates.  Therefore, I say, and I have said it on previous occasions, that the farmers themselves, as well as other people, are not wise, either for their own sakes or for the sake of the country, in making these huge demands.  I say that they should moderate their demands, and that they should not be asking for, say, the provision of 100 or 150 beds in a hospital where 70 or 75 beds would be quite sufficient, and they should remember that the cost of maintenance is going to remain a charge for ever on the community as long as that building lasts.  I would advise them, therefore, to look carefully to the cost in the future of these big institutions which they are demanding and also to the cost of the social services of every kind and the public health services that are being demanded on every side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see two kinds of public health services&mdash;in fact, all kinds of public health services&mdash; improved, but I often have to turn down demands made from county councils where the majority of the members on the county council and on the board of health are farmers.  I have to refuse the demands they make for large hospitals, new sanatoria, and fever hospitals all over the place. Once they think that the money is there, they want a new fever hospital in every town, where a few fever hospitals would do.  I am constantly arguing, fighting and turning down propositions of that kind.  Another kind of thing that I have to turn down &mdash;and I should like to remind farmer <Col N="614" /> members of this House as well as the farmers in the country of this&mdash;is requests that an official of a county council or a board of health, especially an official in a high office, should be given an increase of salary.  Now, very seldom is such a request turned down by the farmers.  I suppose, however, that they hope that the fellow up in Dublin will have to do the dirty work of turning down the request for them.  I do not know if that is what they have in their minds, but that is what happens very often.  They are very generous in voting for the giving of increased salaries to the officials, and yet the very same men who have granted these increases&mdash;and large increases, too&mdash;and who wish to grant them to officials, when they are meeting in county councils and boards of health, will come up to the Dáil, if they are members of it, and criticise the Minister for Local Government and Public Health&mdash;the present Minister as well as the last Minister&mdash;for the enormous increase in rates.  That happens very often.  Dáil Deputies and Senators will vote for these increases at meetings of the county councils or boards of health, and then come up here and tell us that we are ruining the country by allowing the rates to be increased.</P>

There would have to be some special way of dealing with it.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point I would like to raise, and perhaps I should have raised it on the Committee Stage.  Section 35 of the Bill provides that the State may make grants to local authorities in respect of expenditure under this Act up to a maximum of 70 per cent.  There is a difference between the machinery in this Bill and the British Bill and the Northern Ireland Bill on which this is largely modelled.  In Northern Ireland, for example, Belfast City gets 70 per cent. of the expenditure from the Government and outside Belfast 75 per cent. is paid.  Here the matter is left in the discretion of the Minister and I think I am right in saying that the Minister for Defence said that Dublin City would not get 70 per cent.  I wonder am I right in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have offered them 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>You have offered them 50?  Therefore, under this Bill, Dublin City, in relation to the State here, is going to be in a much worse position than Belfast is in relation to the Six Counties or London in relation to Great Britain.  That seems to be a very inequitable situation.  The citizens of Dublin already bear a very considerable burden upon the rates which is properly attributable to national purposes. <Col N="618" /> A good deal of Dublin housing expenditure which weighs very heavily on the rates is really to meet a national problem, and I will not for a moment go into how the present Government's policy has aggravated that, but if in addition they are going to have imposed upon them 50 per cent. instead of 30 per cent. of the expenditure upon air raid precautions, that would seem to me a very unreasonable position.  The matter is one in which Dublin should be treated by the State here at least as well as Belfast is treated in the Six Counties and London is treated in England. I do not know upon what the Minister bases his 50 per cent.  I think one of his colleagues once described Dublin as a rich city, but for those who live in it and have to pay rates in addition to income-tax and other burdens of rents and so on and the general cost of living, it is very far from being a rich city for the ordinary citizen, and his burden is going to be increased by this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say one word with reference to Section 12 of the Bill, which mentions among the matters for which local authorities are expected to prepare schemes the extinguishment of fires likely to result from air attack.  That is a matter which seems to be of enormously more practical importance than, shall we say, the provision of gas masks.  I want to ask what the Minister has in mind as to the provision of auxiliary personnel for fighting fire in case of need.  It is all very well to call upon the local authorities to prepare schemes, but is the Government going to help them by creating a regular force, such as has been created in England, of volunteers who are willing to work as an auxiliary fire service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Senator MacDermot's question, the Dublin Corporation will organise an auxiliary fire service, an extension of its present fire-fighting service.  That is portion of the activities that local authorities will perform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Senator Hayes's speech as to the 50 per cent for Dublin, we have offered Dublin 50 per cent. of the expenses that will be borne both by the <Col N="619" /> State and the local authority.  That, as I explained on the two previous stages of the Bill, is a very small proportion of the total bill.  In the whole of the country the State will bear about £320,000 directly on the State funds, leaving £180,000 or thereabouts to be borne partly by the State and partly by the local authority.</P>
    <P>I do not claim that Dublin is a very rich city, but I think that in comparison with places like Cobh it is rich. In England and in the Six Counties there is the situation that more than half the population is urbanised.  That does not obtain down here, and I think that we can ask the people who are living in very backward localities to bear only a fair share of the cost.  The people who live in Dublin and who have the amenities that go with city life will have to pay for that in insurance against air raids.  Air raids will not affect the people in backward districts, and I think the Government is going very far indeed in asking the people living in backward districts, who all have to pay into the general State Exchequer, to go to the extent of giving 50 per cent. to the City of Dublin.  That 50 per cent. is only 50 per cent. of one-third of the cost&mdash;about 15 per cent.  That is in relation to the passive air raid precautions, not counting the active resistance to air raids from guns or planes.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this Bill passes I should like to call the attention of the House to the fact that we are voting £500,000.  One might say that £500,000 in relation to what we vote to the Government every year is not a very great amount.  Last week, on one day, we were dealing with a Bill to give £600,000 to tourist traffic and to-day we were dealing with this Bill to give £500,000 for air-raid precautions. Those Bills came on at the same time and I would like to refer back to what I said about the Cabinet system which this Government carries on, which they inherited from us, <Col N="620" /> under which each Minister comes along with a case from his Department urging the expenditure of money; each Minister fights his case independently and the Bills come into this House in somewhat the same way.  It is proposed in this Bill to vote £500,000.  Personally, I do not think it should be voted. We read the papers every day and we know there is a state of tension in Europe.  A great number of people seem to take a morbid pleasure in assuming that war is imminent.  For the last year I have constantly had people assuring me that knowledgeable people assured them that war was due at such a date.  Personally, I believe that that is not so.  Of what I know from what I may call the rational data available the indications are not war. I admit that neither I nor anybody else could get up in court and swear to the knowledge that there was going to be no war within the next year.  But, in all these matters you exercise prudence. Is any prudence being exercised in relation to the matter here?  To begin with, £600,000 is voted for tourist development and £500,000 is being asked for air-raid precautions directed to a condition considered as likely, in which people will have to be running away to hide from bombs.  It is quite obvious that if you take the two together there is no real prudence whatever; there is only a waste of money.  One may make up his mind on one side that £600,000 is being thrown away or, on the other side, one may make up his mind that £500,000 is being thrown away.  You have got to assume that either one sum or the other is being thrown away.</P>
      <P>In relation to this individual sum here, at any time since air warfare was developed you could have got up and said it is possible that our State or our country may be bombed from the air, but we have not until the present proposed throwing away money on the thing, not because we said it could not happen, that it is impossible, but because we said, considering the facts that are knowable to us, we see that all the probability is against a situation arising here in which we have to be protected from attacks from the air. That is why we did not do it before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> In relation to the present situation, does prudence necessarily dictate that we should put out this money on this purpose?  My own judgment is that it does not.  As I have said already, my judgment of the situation inclines me to the belief that there will not be war. If there is war, this country has an enormous lot of disadvantages and some advantages.  We have the disadvantage of being next door to England. On the other hand, we have the advantage of having that great market at our door.  We have a disadvantage in being near Europe; we have an advantage in being on this side of England and not on the other side.  If we were, however, between England and the Continent, and that possible enemies of hers were in active warfare, then you might say there was a very good prospect of our coming into the sphere of active war.  Prudence would in that case, in my judgment, indicate, even though we could not afford it and even though it was going adversely to affect the lives of our people, that the throwing away of this money would be wise and we should say that it be given.</P>
    <P>The assumption of modern people is that life must be absolutely safe: that is to say, that the whole element of danger and adventure must be eliminated from life.  While that is right up to a certain point, life is essentially dangerous.  All through our lives we are having to weigh up one against another.  There is a danger, for instance, in crossing the road.  Road statistics show that quite a large number of people are killed crossing the road.  Nevertheless, throughout our lives we have to cross the road.  If we are going to spend our lives never crossing a road, then life for us will become very distorted and mutilated. It will be a tremendous hardship on us.</P>
    <P>I have seen all sorts of silly articles in the Press on this question, as to whether there is going to be a war between one party and another.  We must assume that neither party is completely lunatic, and that if a war is waged it will be with a view to a certain end, one party hoping by that means to attain its end.  That is to say, that it will not go out of its way to bring defeat upon itself.  I have <Col N="622" /> heard people talking about aeroplanes coming from Germany, facing a widespread barrage in England, refusing to drop bombs on vital points there, with the firm determination that the aeroplanes and the lives of the men in them should be risked crossing England for the purpose of dropping bombs on the Dublin mountains or in Connemara, then returning and facing the same barrage again on their way home through England.  I cannot imagine anything like that happening except in the event of a sudden outbreak of lunacy amongst those in control of armies.  I admit, as I have said, that there has to be an element of danger in life.  I admit that, at the present moment, people like to talk about the precautions that are being taken against this possible, and, I think, unlikely danger.</P>
    <P>I think that in proposing to spend this money we are taking a disastrous path.  I think that we should weigh up the remote possibility&mdash;I can hardly call it a possibility&mdash;of our being faced with air bombardment here.  I think that a certain amount of damage is being done to the country by throwing out money on this.  Personally, I am against this expenditure.  I cannot see that it is justifiable at all.  We are going now to spend £500,000, presumably on the assumption that somebody who is not formally at war with us, but who is at war with England, and is approaching England from the other side of England, will pass over England and drop bombs on us for the purpose of preventing us sending food to England.  I cannot imagine how any sane man, in control of a war that was being waged against England, would say to himself: we must use our air force and send men to their death, we must precipitate loss on vital instruments of aerial warfare, and pass over the real nerve centres and arteries of England, to go over to Ireland and try to prevent the people there sending cattle to England.  We know perfectly well that if the Dublin docks were damaged by attack to-morrow, taking this from the point of view of Army control and of the waging of a war against England, it might cause a <Col N="623" /> slight delay in the export of cattle, but if the cattle were vitally necessary to England we could send them to some other port and find some other means of getting them away.</P>
    <P>There is what one may call a certain amount of scaremongering going on. One reads in the newspapers of the enormous air raid precautions works which are being carried out in England. I think myself that if the British Government had been considering nothing but actual war protection utility value in what is being done, they would not be pursuing the identical course that they are pursuing.  I feel myself&mdash;I could not get up and prove it, and this is only my own judgment&mdash; that a great deal of this activity that you see going on in England is induced not by well-considered plans of a war precautionary nature but rather as something that one might describe as activity of a placatory nature.  You have an Opposition there and an irresponsible Press exciting the people.  It seems to me that a large amount of it is really for the purpose of satisfying the people's minds, of making them feel that the very maximum is being done to ensure that they will be completely immune if danger should arise through aerial attack.</P>
    <P>As far as this country is concerned, we are told that our Government's policy is one of neutrality.  I admit that our Government, in such circumstances as might possibly arise, would not be complete controllers of things. It would not be in the power of our Government to prevent the happening of a European war, or to say that we shall remain completely exempt and immune from the operations of that war.  In the present situation in this country, I say that the throwing away of this £500,000 is a very important matter and should only be embarked upon when a prudential judgment indicated that it was prudentially necessary to embark upon it.  My own judgment is that it is not necessary.  I admit that if we could spend untold millions we might be able to add a certain degree of safety for people here if war did take place.  As I have said, I do not think <Col N="624" /> it will take place.  Consequently, I am against the spending of this money.</P>
    <P>The peculiar thing is this: that if, during the last seven years, instead of throwing money away broadcast on all sorts of schemes&mdash;£300,000 on peat development, money on industrial alcohol factories and on 101 other schemes&mdash;the Government had been running the country wisely and saying what it must do to increase production, to economise, to put the minimum burden on the people because production was not greater: if, instead of the enormous increase that we have had in taxation and in Government expenditure there had been a reduction during all those years, then I say that the imposition of the additional burden outlined in this Bill would be much less harmful to the country than it is actually going to be.  If, in fact, the Government had reduced taxation to a reasonable level, instead of having increased it to a most unreasonable level, then I think that you, members of the Seanad, would have been much more shocked by this proposed expenditure, coupled with the £600,000 on tourist development, than you have been.  When a man is living on his capital he is spending wildly.  If a man has a certain income and he consumes a certain amount of that every week and puts a certain part aside for a rainy day, he is very careful about his expenditure; but, if things go badly, and instead of living within what he is earning he actually gets into the condition when he is living upon his capital, you will find that he is then spending much more wildly, although his position is much worse that it was when he was putting by a certain amount every week.  It seems to me that the position in which we are now is much the same.  There was a time when, if we were asked to spend £1,000,000 on this and £1,000,000 on that every day of the week, it would have drawn forth remarks; people would say &ldquo;Really, this is pretty serious; there must be some drastic necessity for it.&rdquo;  But now, a Minister comes in and says he wants £600,000.  As I said before, it is like the sweepstake.  The Minister asks: can we afford not to spend <Col N="625" /> £600,000 on tourist development and the Minister for Defence will say: can we afford not to spend £500,000 on this A.R.P. scheme.</P>
    <P>I think the public mind has been distorted by reading English newspapers and by reading the reports that have been issued by English news agencies in which a whole case has been made to try to exaggerate the danger of war in the first place, and then to try to exaggerate the probability or the possibility of war becoming active in our own sphere.  There is such a thing as passive warfare as well as active warfare.  This Bill is directed to a situation in which this country will be involved in active warfare. It is not impossible that such a situation should arise, but it is improbable to the extent to make it unwise to vote this money in this Bill. I, personally&mdash;if my word carried any weight against what I might call a newspaper-made hysteria throughout the country and against the organised majority in this House&mdash;would urge that this further burden upon our unfortunate people be not imposed.</P>
    <P>We are told about an amount of £500,000 that is to be spent under this Bill, but, as far as I can judge, that does not indicate the full amount of money that is to be spent.  Just last week the Minister explained that one of the reasons for urgency with regard to this Bill was the fact that the Dublin Corporation has already spent £10,000 upon precautions in relation to this matter.  From what the Minister said a while ago, I gathered that half of that expenditure may have been upon increasing our fire-fighting apparatus in this city.  As far as that is concerned I can quite see that, independent of this war bogey, some of that expenditure may be useful.  But, here we are giving 50 per cent. to Dublin and if that is to be done all over the country we are not imposing merely a burden of £500,000 on our people but a burden that is something nearer to £1,000,000. We fling millions about now so easily that we think nothing of doing so.  It is about time that we came to face facts.  It is about time that we said we cannot afford to go throwing money <Col N="626" /> away until we are satisfied that it is absolutely necessary to impose such a burden upon our people.  I, personally, am satisfied that it is not necessary to impose this burden.</P>

      <P>I would just like to ask the Minister in his concluding remarks to deal with one question which does not appear to have been considered, that is, the defence, in the case of air raids, of the Shannon scheme.  Under Section 11, apparently, the defence of the Shannon Scheme is a duty of the Limerick County Council&mdash;there is no special provision for it, at any rate&mdash;and I would draw particular attention to the fact that in September last there was in, I think, the <i>Militar Wochenblat</i>, an article which drew special attention to this particular scheme in the event of any attack on this country.</P>

      <P>There is just one point I would like to make regarding the financing of this Bill.  The radical difference between the financing of this Bill and that of similar Bills in Northern Ireland and Great Britain is that in Northern Ireland and Great Britain a schedule is attached to the Bill specifying for local areas and cities what proportion the Government will bear, whereas here the matter is left to the discretion of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, and they are to gauge it, apparently, in negotiations with the local bodies.  The result is that Dublin City is only going to get 50 per cent. of the expenditure.  I would like the Minister to elucidate that point a little and explain what he means by stating that it is 50 per cent. of one-third of the total.  While people in Dublin enjoy amenities&mdash;if I may use the expression&mdash;they enjoy the burden of having to pay very heavily for what amenities they have, and they also pay a very considerable portion of the taxation of the country as a whole.  In this particular measure, instead of having a right to get from the Government a certain proportion of the total cost of these air raid precautions, that may be reduced to 50 per cent., and if the Minister for Finance can to do it, it may be reduced even more.  However, I would like the Minister when concluding <Col N="627" /> to elaborate a little more the point that what Dublin is being asked to pay is 50 per cent. of one-third of the total cost.</P>

      <P>After the speech we have heard from Senator Fitzgerald, no doubt we will all go to our homes very calmly and very satisfied that there is going to be no war.  I am sure that it will slow down the pressure in armaments manufacture in every European country, and I have no doubt the Dublin Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Wall Street will flare up considerably when his speech is read in the Press.  Neutrality is the policy of this country, but something may happen in a world war that would drag us into the mess, and I think it would be very imprudent if we did not make some preparations for the protection of our people.  I do not want to hear from the Minister what arrangements he has made: I think it would be bad policy for him to disclose them. But it would be a good thing if every man in this House who has any idea as to what we should do, when a war takes place, to prevent panic and preserve order should give his view.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that evacuation should be one of the principal things, and if half of the people living within ten miles of the Nelson Pillar were moved out around the Province of Leinster, I think the casualties would be very considerably reduced.  There is no need to make arrangements like that for the people in Cork City; we will do that fairly well ourselves; I think we have some of those arrangements in hand already, and wise people are making arrangements to evacuate themselves if trouble should arise. Speaking of evacuation reminds me that many of the European cities have made arrangements for the evacuation of their people, and I think the policy they are adopting there would not be a bad policy for this country to adopt also.  I would rather see the money being spent in developing agriculture; I would rather see our swords welded into ploughshares; but I think it would be very imprudent if we were to make no preparation and expend no money on air raid precautions.</P>

      <P>There are just a few words I would like to say in connection with statements made by Senator Desmond Fitzgerald.

That may be his opinion, but I do not think it is the opinion of the majority of the people in the country, or even of the majority in this House.  The Senator suggests that his statement, or his opinion, would not have much effect on the &ldquo;organised majority in this House.&rdquo;  I resent such a statement that there is any such thing; but I hope there is a majority in the House of sensible people who will view this thing from the point of view that the people have a right to be protected against any possibility of attack should the war develop.  I say should the war develop, and I say that deliberately; as, in my opinion, the war has already started, and it is only a question of when it will extend this far, or extend as far as England, or as far as somewhere which might make it possible for us to be attacked here by some means or other.  The Senator made what anybody knowing him and his past would expect from him&mdash;a definitely political speech.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Senator that he was speaking a little fast and was inclined to become a little excited at times and that if he looks up the Official Report, he will find that that is what he said.  If I were to take the same line and to develop my argument on political lines, I would say to the Senator that if his Government had not sent across those £50,000,000 to England in the shape of land annuities, which the people of the country decided should not have been sent, we would then be in a position, not alone to defend ourselves, but the rest of Europe, or very nearly so.  I hope the Senator is right in his statement that we are not going to be affected at all by this war, and that it would be impossible for certain European powers to come across England and to attack this country by air, but as I say, the war has not yet developed, and, in my opinion, it is quite within the bounds of possibility that by the time the various armies are lined up, we would find that certain European powers would line up with the possible attackers and that it might be necessary for them to come across England to attack us.  In my opinion, the expenditure of this money is justified if for no other reason than as an insurance policy, because if some of the English cities were attacked, and our people heard that the people of these cities were being killed in large numbers by gas attacks, or something of the kind, and if we did not have any precautions taken here to protect our people, it is only natural to assume that the people here would get into a state of terrible panic.  Any measures we can take, within the means at our disposal, should be taken by the Government to protect the people not alone against the actual results of a possible attack, but even against the possible results of panic, which would be very nearly as bad.</P>

The contrast which Senator Fitzgerald drew between the Tourist Bill and this Bill appearing side by side on the same Order Paper is naturally one that provokes an ironical smile, but, at the same time, it is bad logic to say that the money must, in one case or the other, be money thrown away.  If you were prepared to say that, you would also have to say that the money which America is spending on its Army and Navy was thrown away, or else that the money spent on the New York World Fair was thrown away, or that the money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I admit that I cannot see why the analogy does not hold, except that the spending of money on tourism is more of a novelty in our case, and indeed the spending of money on aircraft defence, too, but, as Senator Fitzgerald said, we have to carry on our ordinary lives, whatever we do in the way of defence.  I was rather astonished at his suggesting that people nowadays are too much attached to safety and too much afraid of danger. I should have thought that the reverse was rather the case, that the era of &ldquo;safety first&rdquo; of a few years ago was definitely over and that if ever there was a time when the world was living dangerously, it is the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one other point to which I want to refer.  There is an element in this country which is doing its best to alter such relations of friendship as we have with Great Britain, and to replace them by relations of hatred, and to put everything in our communications with people on the other side of <Col N="631" /> the water on a basis of force.  It is curious that that should be done in this day and age, when it is becoming so excessively dangerous to put things on a basis of force.  It never seems to occur to these people, who, I am afraid, include one or two members even of this House, that if they succeeded in their attempt, we should have to consider, on this Bill and on any other Bill for national defence, how to defend ourselves against attack, not from some Continental country, but from England. It is very curious that in all the talk about being protected to some extent against aircraft attack, it does not seem to cross anybody's mind that the direction from which the aircraft attack might take place might be England, and if the element to which I have referred were to succeed in bringing about the change in our relations with England which they wish to bring about, the attack in all probability would be from England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to enter into any discussion whatever as to the direction from which we may expect hostile aircraft to come.  This Bill does not deal with that at all.  It has nothing to do with foreign Powers, good, bad, or indifferent, and it is not asking the Seanad for money, as Senator Fitzgerald says.  It is simply a Bill to enable the Government, with the help of the local authorities, to organise the citizens, so that if hostile aircraft, coming from where they may, should arrive here and drop certain missiles, we will be able to cope with them in the best way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald was going on a line which I think would be fatal to the liberties of this country if it were pursued. His line, generally, is that we may not expect trouble or that we need not be expecting any trouble here. There are other people going around the country at the moment too and they say that anything that we can do to protect ourselves is so small, compared with the scale of the likely attacks, that we should do nothing.  A lot of people are neglecting their ordinary duties as citizens in helping to protect the country by excuses of that nature.  Now, no matter where the <Col N="632" /> attack comes from, if we value our liberty, we should be prepared as men to defend our liberty.  Apart from active defence&mdash;that is hitting the other fellow as hard as you can if he attempts to hit you&mdash;there is with those modern conditions and modern weapons, a new phase in which the civilian population has to play its part in protecting itself.</P>
    <P>We are asking the civilian population to co-operate with the Government and with the local authorities, so that if a hostile attack does occur here the civilian casualties will be reduced to a minimum and the destruction of property will be reduced to a minimum.  Whatever danger there is of war here or an attack on this country, that danger will be reduced in proportion as we are ready to defend ourselves.  If we have a good chance of escaping from a world conflict with very little defences, we will have a much better chance the more we are in a position to defend ourselves. If we have a good chance of escaping from a hostile air attack with practically no defence at the moment or no air raid precautions, we will have a much better chance that the casualties or suffering will be less if we take precautions.</P>
    <P>We are not asking for any vast sum of money to be spent on air raid precautions. It is a matter in which a spirit of co-operation among ordinary citizens is worth very much more than money.  For instance, a few thousands of the people of Dublin who would come forward in their spare time for a few weeks or months and take lessons on how to lead the population, how to instruct the general population, how to deal with fires caused by incendiary bombs, how to avoid gas and how to take measures of precautions against high explosive bombs, would count very much more in safety to the city and country than if the Government spent £1,000,000 on it.</P>
    <P>In this matter of air raid precautions, the spending of money on the part of the State or the local authority will not in any way compensate the people if co-operation is not forthcoming. Recently the Dublin Corporation <Col N="633" /> issued an advertisement asking for people to come forward as air-raid wardens.  They only issued one small advertisement but within a day or two 400 people came forward and offered their services.  No matter what may be said in debates such as this as to the likelihood of air raids or otherwise, I think the citizens of Dublin, who have spent so much money on a good water system, on a good sewerage system and so on, will now spend a little fraction of what they spent on these services to safeguard themselves against what may be a very disastrous thing indeed&mdash;an air attack.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald talked about hysteria.  I do not think the Government has been hysterical at all in appealing to the people to take certain measures for the defence of the country.  If Senator Fitzgerald wanted to see naked hysteria he should read some of the speeches made by a very intimate friend of his in the Dáil. Really before the two of them speak again in public they should get together and see if there could be any common measure of agreement between them. Because one of them says that the war disaster, immediate and terrible war, is to be upon us, and Senator Fitzgerald says the direct opposite.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzgerald asked me to give more information.  As a matter of fact, I have given in the Seanad here and in the Dáil all the information I have about air raid precautions. It is altogether a new <Col N="634" /> activity in this country.  It is practically new all over the world.  We have spent certain sums of money up to the present time on laying in a store of gas masks, decontamination equipment, and fire fighting equipment, and we intend to expend more.  I indicated in the Dáil and here more or less how we propose to spend a total of £500,000. If that sum is to be spent, it is to be made up of contributions from the rates as well as from the State Exchequer. It may not cover the whole of it.  In certain circumstances it would only be a fraction of what would be spent here on air raid precautions. In the present situation, as far as we can we have estimated that about £500,000 will be spent, and of that sum the Government will bear 70, 75, 80, or 85 per cent.  Senator Hayes asked me to explain what did I mean by one-half or one-third of 50 per cent.  I explained here in the Seanad on the last day that of the £500,000 which we contemplate will be spent on air raid precautions, £320,000 will be spent directly by the State on gas masks, fire fighting equipment, and so on, leaving a balance of £180,000.  Of that £180,000 at least one-half will be contributed by the State.  The mathematics may not be exactly correct, but they are roughly correct anyhow.</P>

I think that the money we propose spending is worth spending, because if we have no gas masks, the temptation to a hostile attacking force to use gas would be increased considerably.  I think it is a good insurance to spend on gas masks a small proportion or a fair proportion of the money we proposed to spend on air raid precautions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>You probably could give complete immunity to all the population from air attack if you were prepared to spend sufficient time and energy on it, but if we were to do it, it would not be a question of half a million pounds.  It would be a question of how many hundreds of millions it would cost.  Life would not be worth living if we went that far.  I agree with Senator Fitzgerald to that extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, however, if we value our lives we should take some little precaution.  If we as a community can take certain precautions to avoid being caught in the open, or to prevent houses or buildings collapsing on us if a high explosive bomb drops in the immediate vicinity, then we shall be fairly safe.  We shall be reducing the chance of being hit, as far as possible, to nil.  If a high explosive bomb dropped in a neighbourhood in which there were rather shaky houses, it might take a lot of them down.  If a person had absolutely no protection, or had not some sort of air-raid shelter, if a bomb dropped on a house or outside it he might be hit with a splinter anywhere within a distance of several hundred yards.  If, on the other hand, he had a sheltered trench or a fairly strong protection, a high explosive bomb could drop within a few feet of him and he would be fairly safe.  There is no use in talking about deep shelters. If I proposed giving the community complete immunity by air-raid shelters from high explosive bombs, and if I were to put forward a proposition for building deep shelters, then the argument <Col N="636" /> of Senator Fitzgerald would become very strong&mdash;that rather than spend all the necessary money and energy on protecting ourselves from death through air raids, we should do nothing.  We are asking that something should be done within reason, that we should take some precautions. If a man is building a house, and if he comes to the point in good weather at which the roof has to be put on, he will not say to himself, &ldquo;Because there is good weather, there is no necessity to put on a roof.&rdquo;  We shall at least put the roof on the house, so that if rain should come we shall be fairly dry. I think the spending of half a million pounds, or round about that figure, on air-raid precautions will give us a fair amount of immunity.  If we spend that amount properly in educating the people, we can so reduce the risk of casualties or destruction from air raids as to make it not worth while for a potential enemy to attack us in that way.</P>

      <P>In regard to the steel forms for air-raid shelters that they are using in England, we have, I think, a better substitute made out of native materials.  That is a shelter in the form of a beehive.  It is very strong, much stronger than the steel shelter.  It has this advantage over the trench, that if you go down in a trench in this country in winter-time, you come on water level not more than 12 inches below the surface.  If we were to rely on such trenches constructed by ordinary people, we should be in more danger of being drowned than anything else. I think myself that a rather strong structure, as strong as we can conveniently <Col N="637" /> make it, built on ground level or a little over it, which people can enter conveniently, is as far as we can go in providing shelters.  If people take that precaution, they would be fairly safe.</P>

      <P>That is another question. In England, in vulnerable areas, they have given these steel structures out to people under a certain income level.  We have not got far enough with the Dublin Corporation to make plans for the building of private shelters in private houses.  What the final policy will be in that regard, I do not know.  I think, however, that the vast majority of our people should be able to provide in their own back yards or in their own back gardens, sufficient shelter for themselves and their families.  In the City of Dublin in any of these new flat buildings that are being put up for the working classes, you have a basement which would make a very good blast and gas-proof shelter.  The structures are strong and they would be easily rendered gas-proof.  The problem of putting up shelters for people caught in the streets, is a problem which the Dublin Corporation will have to examine.  That will be one of their first duties.  The provision of shelters in private homes is a job for the private individual, and whether any help can be given to them is a matter that has not yet been decided.  I think the vast majority of our people, by taking a little trouble and spending a few pounds, could provide shelters for themselves in their back yards or in the basements of their houses that would render them pretty safe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House is entitled to more information as to the policy proposed by the Government under this section.  The House, no doubt, will remember that this retention of the guarantee land deposit arises under a right the Government has taken to revise the standard purchase annuity.  At the time that power was taken it was understood, although I cannot trace any pledge being given in the House, that it would be used only in cases where there was collusion almost amounting to fraud, say where the landlord and tenant had agreed to place a fictitious and altogether too high rent on a holding, and by reason of that fraud the land would not be security for the advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission have gone a long way beyond that.  They have now taken power to revise the standard purchase annuity not only in the case of non-judicial holdings, but in the case of judicial holdings.  Now, the judicial rent was arrived at after full inquiry, by a process of law.  In all conscience if there ever was a legal or moral contract that was one.  It almost amounts to a breach of honour that any Government should take the right to revise contracts or agreements made on the basis of judicial rents.  That is what has been done.  I should like the Minister to give the House some indication as to how far, in practice, <Col N="639" /> the standard purchase annuities, fixed on the basis of judicial rents, have been revised.  The effect of these powers has even gone so far that owners who have been paid their bonds are asked to refund any amount which the Land Commission may claim to have been overpaid.  The effect of that is that in the case of a resident in this country the claim can be made effective.  In the case of an owner who has left, his external assets cannot be pursued.  No English court, I am informed, would give judgment on the basis of any such claim.  The whole thing is wholly inequitable, and amounts, I would suggest&mdash;I do not like to use the word, but I will use it&mdash;to a very shady action on the part of the Government, because if there was ever a firm basis for agreement it was the judicial rent.</P>
    <P>Now what happens?  Before the guarantee deposit is released, an inspector can go down and practically, with the powers of revision, fix a further judicial rent I would tell the House, moreover, that in any assessment of the value of the land for the advance you must have regard not to present values but to the values in 1923, the time at which the contract was made.  The whole thing seems to me not only complicated but unconscionably hard on owners who have been paid their money.  This section now goes further than the guarantee deposit.  Hitherto, the guarantee deposit was held, with justification, pending final inspection, but the interest hitherto has been paid.  It is now proposed even to hold the interest, and many of the people who now suffer are only residuary owners.  In many cases that interest is badly needed by men who have got very little remaining over after all charges have been paid.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to be specific and clear as to what the intentions of the Government are, and whether, as time goes on, under the powers they now enjoy, the final inspection is practically going to be a revision of the values of land.  In law the owners have no protection whatever.  The inspector who will finally verify the boundary <Col N="640" /> and inspect the land before the guarantee deposit is released will practically revise every holding, wipe out the guarantee deposit altogether, and ask owners even to refund money which has been paid.  I hope the House realises the seriousness of this matter and the basic injustice contained in this provision.  I repeat that you are cutting away the whole basis of a contract made under the 1923 Act and taking powers to revise values without limitation, merely on the basis of whether the land was or was not security for the money.  If you had that sort of thing in commercial life, no court of common law would recognise it for a moment.  The Government are taking powers which citizens as between one another could never claim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the second point, and I presume the less important point that Senator Sir John Keane made, it appears on the reading of this section that, where interest accrues on a guarantee deposit, it will not be paid out automatically, but that the person must make application to the Judicial Commissioner for the payment of his own money.  If that is the exact meaning of the section, it appears to be a reversal of every principle of ordinary law.  If we provided in the section that, where the Land Commission desire to retain the interest, they could make application to the Judicial Commissioner and that he could give them leave to retain the interest, that would appear to be reasonable and in accordance with ordinary legal principles and the ordinary principles of natural justice.  But, where you compel a man to make an application to the Judicial Commissioner for money which is presumed to be his own, it seems to be an extraordinary provision. I do not know why a man should be made to show special reasons why he should get money which belongs to him and which is being held by the Land Commission.  One would imagine that the onus would be the other way round.  Am I right in thinking that the effect of this section will be to involve every owner in the costs of an application to the Judicial Commissioner if he wants to get the interest? <Col N="641" /> Where will the costs come from in that case?  Surely the person who owns the interest, and who successfully asserts his right under this provision, will not have to bear the costs of his application?</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that the retention of the ten per cent. deposit was introduced under the 1931 Act in order to speed up the payment of bonds.  Otherwise the owners might have had to wait for a very long time before they would get the bonds at all.  That was part of the bargain. There is no going back on any bargain. The purchase price has not been definitely fixed.  It was felt to be fairly safe to pay out 90 per cent. of the purchase money and to retain ten per cent., which may have to be held or may have to be refunded.  It was in order to enable speedy payments to be made that ten per cent. was held and that authority was given under the 1931 Act.  Therefore it is not correct to say, as Senator Hayes suggested, that that money is the property of the landowner.  That has to be decided when the purchase price is finally fixed by the Judicial Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of interest, what is sought to be done is to retain the interest.  There have been cases in which it was found that the ten per cent. was not sufficient, and that meant trying to get a refund of an overpayment.  The State has to have regard to the value of the land they are taking over and, of course, what the security is going to be for the money advanced for it.  I do not think there is any question of going back on a bargain.  I could not say, without examination, in how many cases it has been found that the money was inadequate. The thing that is of importance is that, in order to help the owner to get his bonds quickly, it was provided that he should get 90 per cent. of the price and then, when the thing was finally settled, it would be decided whether he would get more or less.  Of course, even the landlord could object to the price and say that it was not sufficient.  The tenant might say  it was too much.  That is the <Col N="642" /> question that has to be decided.  I do know that in some cases the landlord's price has been increased; I would not say in many cases, but it has been in some cases.  There is no going back on any bargain.</P>
    <P>As to the question of fraud, that might have been an element in it; there could easily be collusion.  That would be one consideration, but it would not be the main consideration, as it is not a thing that would occur generally.  Of course, it could happen that there would be collusion between the landlord and the tenant.  That would be only one consideration.  But the main consideration is in order that landlords, who are very often in great difficulties about getting cash, should not be kept unduly long out of it.  In order that that might be done with safety to the State, and so that too much money would not be given, part of the understanding was that ten per cent. should be held.  That was found not to be sufficient in some cases.  I dare say that, before the Judicial Commissioner will decide to issue the interest, he will have to have some idea as to what the purchase price is finally going to be.</P>

      <P>I do not see on what ground the Judicial Commissioner is going to decide to release money without an inspection of the land.  If I apply for the 10 per cent. guarantee deposit held, the case could not be decided unless there was an inspection of the whole estate.  It cannot be decided in an office.  The thing seems utterly unconvincing except it be that the Government want to lay their hands on all the money they can.  It looks as if they were simply going to lay their hands on the money as long as they can.  There is no logical basis on which the Judicial Commissioner sitting in a court in Dublin can decide the matter.  The only basis would be to have an inspection of the land, and on that inspection to decide that in some cases the land was not sufficient security for the money.  I was hoping that the Minister would at least differentiate between non-judicial rents and judicial rents.  It seems to be utterly inconsistent to take one judicial tenancy out of a number and say that one, which has been decided by a full process of law, was not fairly decided, whereas another judicial tenancy, decided by an equal process was.  Surely the judicial rent should be, in every case, the basis of the standard annuity. The Government must take some risk in the matter.  To safeguard itself by gross injustice seems an absurd position.  I could understand the Government saying that they could not permit that for judicial tenants.  Would the Minister consider, before the Report Stage, whether he would say: &ldquo;We will not re-open cases based on judicial rents, but we will take power to re-open cases based on non-judicial rents&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>I do not think I can say any more about the matter.  I understand that out of 85,000 cases only 400 have been reviewed.  The main point is that landlords, undoubtedly, had a grievance up to 1931, as they might be waiting for years.  Inspection of the land is necessary and, of course, there might be an objection from either the landlord or the tenant, and there might have to be another inspection before the purchase price was finally <Col N="644" /> fixed.  If we had not that provision to retain ten per cent., the owners would have a far greater grievance, in having to wait for a long time before the price could be finally fixed.  That was part of the arrangement and is understood, and I am sure the landlords were glad to get it.  I believe it was an advantage to them.  If people had to wait for years it was a great hardship.  This provision prevented that.  If it is their money they will get it.  It happened on a few occasions that they got more.  If interest is held it will be recovered, too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of paragraph (b), to add the following words &ldquo;and the cash so paid shall be applied in such manner as the Judicial Commissioner shall specify including payment of costs&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with the costs fund. Section 5 of the Land Act of 1923 provided for the payment out of the costs fund to the vendor in 4½ per cent. British Guaranteed Bonds of such sum as the Judicial Commissioner would <Col N="645" /> certify to be reasonable, having regard to the work done in connection with the sale.  This clearly shows that the intention was that payment should be provided for the purposes of costs, that is to say, added to the purchase money. The costs were not paid direct to the solicitor as if he had a charge on the estate, but were paid to the vendor who in due course paid the costs. Section 7 of the Land Bond Act, 1933, provided for payment in new 4½ per cent. bonds.  Section 8 of the Land Bond Act, 1934, provided for payment in different categories of bonds, as the early categories became exhausted. Section 4 (1) of the Land Bond Act, 1925, provided for payment of all claims against purchase money in bonds, and sub-section (3) of that Act provided that the Judicial Commissioner might, in any particular case which justice appeared to him to require, make such order inconsistent with the form of the section as appeared to him to be proper in regard to any claims against the purchase money.  Under this provision the Judicial Commissioner can order payment out of the costs fund to be made in cash instead of in bonds.  I think he has got discretion.  Having the power to pay in cash, of course he will always exercise it when the bonds are standing at a premium.</P>
    <P>That is introducing a new principle. It is the first time in the whole of these Acts where anyone is taking power to pay in whatever is the cheapest form.  It was always in bonds. If the bonds were at a discount the vendor suffered, and if at a premium, the vendor gained.  It seems to me to be the prevailing tendency always to give the vendor the dirty end of the stick.  This arrangement might be equitable if, having paid the vendor his proportion of the costs in cash, he had power to pay his solicitor in cash. The provision remains that the vendor should be paid, with the adjudged amount of the costs, in cash, but he will still have to pay his solicitor in bonds.</P>
    <P>In the case of 4½ per cent.  Land Bonds, which are at a substantial premium, the vendor would suffer.  If they were at a discount it would be another story.  Surely there should be <Col N="646" /> consistency throughout.  If you depart from payment on all sides in bonds you should, at least, allow the same treatment to both, to the vendor and to the person whom he has to pay.  If you pay the vendor in cash he should have the right to pay the solicitor in cash. The Minister may say that this section gives full discretion to the judicial commissioner. I cannot agree that he is likely to interpret the section as meaning that discretion given in a particular case shall apply in all cases, that is to say, where the costs fund of the land bonds are concerned.  It means that the Judicial Commissioner has full discretion to order payment in cash for costs, but he can only do so in particular cases.  The effect of the amendment is that he can do so in all cases where costs are concerned.  Apparently it is necessary to put it in this form, because the Judicial Commissioner has power to order payment of costs in cash and he can order payment of any charges on the estate in cash.  I do not know if it has been done, but he has the power.  That is the reason the amendment is in this form, that having discretion to pay anything in bonds, he shall also have power to include payment of the costs in cash.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an unnecessary amendment, because the Judicial Commissioner has the power to decide&mdash;it is a matter for him&mdash;first of all, as to whether he will pay any costs.  An amount equal to 2 per cent. of the purchase money is set aside in a cost fund. There are three cost funds.  One is appropriate to the old 4½ per cent. pre-1923 bonds.  Then there is one for the new 4½ per cent. bonds, and there is the cost fund at the present rate of 4 per cent.  The cost fund is made up of 2 per cent. of the purchase money.  It happens that in the new 4½ per cent. cost fund there is not sufficient money to meet the costs, and the Judicial Commissioner is empowered under the provisions of this section to treat all the cost funds as a pool, out of which he can draw, and he can order the bonds to be sold to realise whatever amount of cash he orders in his discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see that there is anything in <Col N="647" /> the amendment.  He has already the discretion which it is proposed to give him.  That is the position.  It is to enable him to pool the three cost funds because of the fact that one fund is very small.  The 2 per cent. in that case did not reach a sufficient amount to pay costs arising out of transactions appropriate to that particular denomination, the 4½ per cent.  That is really all that is in it, and the amendment is unnecessary.  It is a matter for the Commissioner to decide whether or not he will award costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Judicial Commissioner should have no discretion in the matter.  Where cash is paid to the vendor for costs, the vendor should be assured by law that he will be empowered to pay cash to his solicitor. Is that not elementary justice?  I quite understand that the Minister wants to bolster up the cost fund by this device. There is not enough money, apparently, and when that is so the vendor suffers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Assuming there is not enough money, what is the position? The Minister says that the object is to treat all the cost funds as a pool. Assume you are going to pay out in cash instead of in bonds.  Having paid in cash to the vendor, surely there should be no question of discretion? There should be common justice and the solicitor should be paid in cash. The Minister says the Judicial Commissioner has discretion.  This is the section under which he has discretion. Listen to me while I read it, and decide whether, as an ordinary jury, you consider this gives absolute discretion: &ldquo;The Judicial Commissioner may, in a particular case in which justice appears so to require&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; That, surely, does not cover my contention? There is no question of particularity at all.  In all cases cash should be paid and why tie it down to a section which will certainly give the Judicial Commissioner power to pick and choose?  On what basis will he pick and choose?  Not on any basis of justice.  He may be influenced by the <Col N="648" /> colour of the hair of the counsel, or whomsoever is appearing before him. There is no logical basis on which he can pick and choose.</P>

      <P>The Judicial Commissioner is the person who decides whether any costs will be paid.  That is purely a matter for himself.  I would remind the Senator that it is not a question of there not being money. There is plenty of money in the cost funds, but not in this particular one, the new four-and-a-half per cent. bonds.  The Senator talks about the colour of a man's hair deciding whether the Commissioner may award costs or not.  We must leave that to the judge to decide.  The amount of the costs awarded will be decided by him and he will have regard to what is the justice of the case, whether it will be better for the person to get bonds or cash, or be paid partly in both.  He has to pay the money out of a particular cost fund which is there and all we are asking is to give him the right to treat the three cost funds as one.  There is plenty of money set by in the three cost funds, but in one particular cost fund there is not.  There is no point in trying to compel the Judicial Commissioner to take a certain course when the actual awarding of costs is a matter for himself.  Surely the Senator can see that?</P>

      <P>It seems to me the whole point is being missed by the Minister.  If the vendor is required in any case to receive payment in bonds, he should have the right to pass on payment of costs to the solicitor in bonds, and if he is to receive payment in cash he should have the right to pay the solicitor in cash, bearing in mind that to receive payment in cash is a distinct disadvantage where the bonds are at a premium.  That is a point the Minister should meet, and he does not seem to me meeting it at all.</P>

I do not suppose he gives <Col N="649" /> the full costs in any case.  I do not think I have missed the point.  I am afraid the Senators who have spoken do not seem to have got the point. The Judicial Commissioner awards the costs, and whether they will be paid in bonds or cash is a matter for him.  If the cash is not available in one cost fund he cannot get it there; he goes to the others.  The transaction between the solicitor and the vendor is a matter for themselves; the Judicial Commissioner does not settle that.  We give him power to draw on a pool of three cost funds where before he had to draw the money out of a particular fund.  I do not think I have missed the point, but I think the significance of this section has not been grasped by Senator Sir John Keane.</P>

      <P>I have to clear that point up.  I cannot clear it up now.  I still think I am right in this matter. The central point is that no costs need be awarded if the Judicial Commissioner does not wish to award them. He need not award costs at all and, therefore, it is superfluous to try to force him to pay in bonds or cash, when it is a matter for his discretion whether he will pay costs at all.  As to the point whether he is bound to pay the solicitor in cash or bonds, there may be some case in which it is necessary to pay in bonds.  Generally, I do not think it is.  By the Report Stage <Col N="650" /> I will be able to let the Senator know definitely.</P>

      <P>If it be the case that, according to the law, costs must be paid in bonds, then it will be necessary to provide, if the Commissioner gives costs, that they may be paid in cash, which is what I understand the amendment to be.  It is not a matter of any great principle.  He has discretion.  If he does not award costs, the question will not arise.  It only arises if he does so award, and this amendment is clearly based on the assumption stated by Senator Sir John Keane, that at present he should pay in bonds.  The Minister ought to undertake to consider this amendment on the Report Stage and, if Senator Sir John Keane's statement is correct, the Minister might carefully consider whether there is any objection to giving the Commissioner power, if he does so award costs, to provide the manner in which they will be paid.</P>

      <P>I understand that he has got to pay in bonds.  It is only in this Bill that the law is being changed.  Hitherto, if the vendor were being paid in bonds, the costs were paid in bonds&mdash;either the 4 per cent. or the 4½ per cent., whichever was appropriate.  No question of payment in cash has ever arisen heretofore, and it is only being brought in by this Act. That is what I believe, and I stand to be corrected if I am wrong.  Now the Minister keeps stressing the inter-changeability of these bonds.  That does not concern me, and there may be good reasons for it.  My concern is this: that if an award is made&mdash;of course, as Senator Douglas said, if no award is made, then nothing arises&mdash; but if an award is made, then I say that it is only common justice that the solicitor should be paid in the same currency as that in which the award is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that it is only common justice.  Generally, I think it will be found that the solicitor's costs are more than the costs awarded.  I think that Senators should look at this matter from the purely commonsense point of view and not as a debating point across the floor of the House.  It is purely a case of commonsense argument. Let us say that the solicitor's costs come to £100.  Unless the Minister accepts this amendment, what is likely to happen is that £100 cash will be paid to the vendor and, by law, he will have to pay the solicitor £108, because if they are bonds it is equivalent to £108 and that is what he will have to pay.  Is that justice?  I think <Col N="652" /> we should get away from this sort of orientation of mind about the poor man and the rich man, and that we should get back to the question of ordinary justice.</P>
      <P>Is it justice that, to enable you to pay a bill if £108, you should be given £100.  That is the effect here, unless the Commissioner exercises his discretion and, under the law, he can only exercise his discretion in particular cases.  Why should it not be mandatory on him to exercise his discretion in every case where similar circumstances apply?  It is getting terribly heart-breaking to try to get anything accepted by the authorities. There seems to be a sort of barrier which has the effect that nothing that is suggested by the Opposition will be considered on its merits.  I say that this is a case, not for Party outlook, but for looking at the matter from the point of view of sheer justice.  Should not a matter of this kind be considered on its merits, instead of taking the attitude that, because you have a sledge-hammer majority the thing will be passed whether we like it or not?</P>

I think that anybody who has taken the trouble to follow the debates on this Bill in the Dáil will admit that I tried in every way to meet any suggestions that were put forward there and that, although I was fiercely attacked by the Opposition, I went to the limit of compromise in order to meet any points that were raised.  I can assure Senator Sir John Keane that, if I saw anything at all in his proposal, I should do the same and would go as far as I could to meet him but I can tell him that there is nothing in the point he is raising.  I am sure that, when he examines the matter himself, he will be satisfied that there is nothing in it and I can also assure him that I am not approaching this matter in any Party spirit at all.  I would refer him to the debates in the Dáil on this Bill in order to show him that I have not taken that line at all.  I am not looking <Col N="653" /> on this matter from a Party point of view because I would like to go as far as I possibly could, in a Land Bill, to get agreement if agreement could be found, and I think it will be agreed that, in the Dáil, we almost got to that point.  If members of this House who are connected with Fine Gael would ask their own people in the Dáil, I think they would find that it would be admitted that we came to agreement on almost every point that was raised.</P>

      <P>I say that, when and if the Judicial Commissioner is awarding costs, he has regard to all these things. He is not bound to pay a round figure, and he will pay in bonds, if they are there&mdash;either out of the old 4½ per cent. bonds or out of the new 4½ or 4 per cent. bonds.  In this case, however, the bonds are not there, and consequently we give him power to pay, if he likes to do so, partly in bonds and partly in cash, and he is not compelled to give a round figure of £100.  He will know whether the bonds are at a premium or not, and I am sure that none of us will accuse him, at any rate, of being a politician.  Anyhow, the Judicial Commissioner, whoever he may be, will act judicially, and if he sees that the bonds are at £108 he will say that he will either deduct so much from what he is awarding or else provide for it <Col N="654" /> in some other way, but he would certainly have regard to that fact.</P>

It was the attitude of Senator McEllin that made me feel in that mood.  I think he ought to try and treat this as a business proposition.  I want to return it.  I am not satisfied.

    <P>Every provision of the Land Purchase Acts whereby a right to require the Lay Commissioners to state a case in respect of a question of law <Col N="655" /> is conferred is hereby repealed, and in lieu thereof it is hereby enacted as follows, that is to say:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think that I am asking any great concession of the Minister when I ask to have an appeal to the Appeal Tribunal from the decision of the Lay Commissioners.  If this clause stands in its present form, the decision of the Lay Commissioners is final on all questions relating to the compulsory acquisition of land, and there is no appeal except on a question of law.  At this time an appeal on a question of law is, I think, out of the question, having regard to experience in regard to appeals on questions of law.  The Land Commission have been consolidating their law and their Land Acts since 1923.</P>

I suggest, if I may, that it might be more properly dealt with on Section 39, because if you read the section you will find that it deals with questions of law arising before the Lay Commissioners.  That will not debar the Senator from having his full say, but I think we would have it at the wrong time, and perhaps would have it again on Section 39.  There is one point in Section 39&mdash;that the certificate of the Lay Commissioner shall be conclusive evidence&mdash;which was the main subject of debate in the Dáil.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If this clause stands in its present form, the decision of the Lay Commissioners will be final on all questions relating to compulsory acquisition of land.  I was arguing that there was no question of law at the present time because if the Land Commission find that they have made a mistake and that any decision of theirs is upset in a court of law or before the Judicial Commissioner they immediately bring in an amending Bill to legalise whatever illegal action they have performed under the previous Land Acts and making that retrospective.  We had the experience that whenever the Land Commission made a mistake there is an amending Bill brought in.  The question of appeal on a question of law is not what any man with any common sense will consider for the future.  For that reason, I want the Minister to be reasonable.  There is nothing unreasonable in asking for an appeal to the Appeal Tribunal on all questions which the Lay Commissioners decide. I am not going outside the Land Commission in my amendment.  I am still within appeal to the officers of the Land Commission, the Lay Commissioners and the Judicial Commissioners. <Col N="658" /> The only difference is that in that particular case we may obtain some justice in having a High Court judge on the tribunal.  As the law stands, any two Lay Commissioners may come along and say, &ldquo;we require this land; we are going to acquire it compulsorily for any of the particular purposes, for the purpose of relieving congestion, for the purpose of the provision of land for resale or any other purpose mentioned in Section 31 of the Land Act of 1923 as amended by later Acts, or for the purpose of increasing the food supply of the country or for the purpose of improving or rearranging holdings.&rdquo;  All that is required to be done by the Lay Commissioners is to make out a certificate that the Land Commissioners require the land for any of these particular objects and the Appeal Tribunal has to declare that the land must be acquired without any further appeal.  To say that the owner of the land may appeal to the Lay Commissioners does not mean much, because when the Lay Commissioners give their decision that the land must be acquired that finishes it.  The Appeal Tribunal, once the certificate of the Lay Commissioners has been issued, have no say in the matter except a question of law arises. I think this is a very reasonable proposal. It is reasonable protection to give the people whose land may be acquired in the future.  It will have the effect of creating some confidence.  It will not do a great lot but at the same time it gives one a chance of seeking justice where one feels that he has been badly treated.  It will give the right of appeal to a tribunal on which there is a High Court judge.  It will allay some of the fears which many landholders have in connection with the acquisition of land by the Land Commission.</P>

Senator Counihan's amendment is not a substitute.  Paragraph (a) of the section deals with one matter, and paragraphs (b) and (c) deal with the matter which the section sets out to deal with. <Col N="659" /> Is not this amendment calculated to create confusion?

It may be that in the first part of the section we are limiting the right of appeal, as it was limited in the previous Acts, to questions of law.  I cannot see Senator Hogan's point about the over-riding principle in the first part of the section.  It merely refers to what is in previous Acts, and goes on to set out what shall take the place of that.  I am not making the point that this is the most appropriate place for Senator Counihan to get what he wants, but it seems to me that if you are changing a thing and saying, &ldquo;Knock out that and put in something else,&rdquo; it is quite legitimate for Senator Counihan to get up and say, &ldquo;Knock out that and put in not merely what you propose but something else that I want in as well.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so much concerned with the method proposed here, but I am with the equities and the principle involved.  You have this extraordinary position: that if your neighbour trespasses on your land or claims a right of way over it, you can take him, if you are dissatisfied with the decision given in the Circuit Court, to the High Court&mdash;to what corresponds to the Assize Court.  There is that right of appeal in the case of trivial disputes between two neighbours, but here you have a Department of the Government, a bureaucracy, coming in and taking your land, and there is no right of appeal.  That land may have been in the family for generations. This Department of the Government may come along and drive you out of your home and your land.  There is, I believe, the right of appeal on the question of price, but otherwise they <Col N="661" /> practically can do whatever they wish to your property.  They are the sole judges in the matter.  Let us get away from what has been done before and see where we are going.  Elementary justice is being cast aside under this land code.  As I have already said, on trivial matters neighbours have the right of appeal to a higher court from the Circuit Court.  One has the right of appeal on ordinary questions of fact.  The appeal is now heard on full evidence from the Circuit Court.  But here, where we are dealing with the vital question of a man's property: on the question as to why it is being taken, whether he is farming it according to the requirements of the Government or not, the decision rests with one body, a Government body, not in a position in any way comparable to our courts of law.  That Government body is, one may say, being given the power of life and death over a person who has property.  I think it is most unjust, and that the principle in this amendment should be accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>As far as I can see, the principle may be a very laudable one in its own way, but the facts as existing are that, under the Land Acts up to now, there is power to take land anywhere and at any time.  Now, the effect of the amendment means in practice that a landlord or extensive land-owner who has the misfortune to come up under those conditions would be the victim of all sorts of valuers and solicitors and, ultimately, not alone driven to the Lay Commissioners but tempted to go still further and bring the case to the Supreme Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that the Government has power to take land anywhere and at any time, and when a man comes before the Court and is turned down there is the temptation to drive the fool further. These appeals from one court to another ultimately mean increased cost and more outlay, and in the long run it all comes back to the position that the Land Commission can take land anywhere and any time. <Col N="662" /> Personally, I do not think it is going to be of any benefit to the man who has to give up his land or to the man whose land is taken from him, compulsorily or otherwise, as ultimately the decision will be the same.</P>

But, if there are going to be appeals from one tribunal to another it is only a case of sending the unfortunate man further, with growing cost to himself.  This whole question of appeal from the Land Commission should be left as it is and if I might say it, let the man take his medicine as he gets it from the Land Commission. Otherwise it means greater costs to himself and far greater losses ultimately, without any change in the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McEllin's line of reasoning is something that I think one could not apply generally.  After all, if a citizen has property which he owns and which he believes he has a right to own, I think&mdash;in justice to the citizen&mdash;if he wants to spend his last farthing to hold on to the possession of what he maintains is his property, we ought to give him the opportunity to do so.  I do not think that it would be just to shut him off from all right of appeal to an upper court merely because it is bad for him and that he is going to spend money on it.  The question of justice is an entirely different point.  I do not know if Senator McEllin or the House generally has such a low opinion as that of the justice one can obtain in the courts. I think that is not representative of the conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of whether it is applicable to this particular section or not, or where afterwards an amendment might fit into the Bill, I put it to the Minister that, if he could see his way to accept the principle which Senator Counihan is arguing, he would do a very great deal to restore people's nerves and restore confidence that has been disturbed with regard to the possession of land.  I think it is only fair <Col N="663" /> to the Minister to say it was generally accepted that he met the other House very fairly and displayed an attitude of reasonableness and sense, and the desire to do the right thing; and I am sure that this House has no desire&mdash; once it has given assent to the Second Reading and to the principle of the Bill &mdash;to tie up the Minister in a steel frame which will make it impossible for him to operate the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is this consideration, whether he accepts it or not, and whether a certain number of Senators in the House believe it or not.  A very considerable number of landowners are disturbed by the thought that the Land Commission can come in and decide to take over a particular farm.  I am not thinking now of the 1,000 or 2,000 or 4,000 acre holding: I am thinking of the possibility of going in on smaller holdings and taking them over.  A very considerable number of people are troubled about that.  Surely, it would not be argued that it is going to retard the Minister in the administration of his policy to give leave to appeal to the Judicial Commissioners in the way Senator Counihan seeks.  The Judicial Commissioners are just men, we hope, and they are anxious to pass judgment on the case on the facts and, if they are going to stand in the way of the Minister's policy, the position becomes quite impossible.  Beyond doubt, if landowners felt that there was another court of appeal outside the first, there would be an atmosphere of confidence that does not exist at the moment.</P>
    <P>Senator McEllin may be right to this extent, that the decision might not be very different to the first decision. There might actually not be a reversal of the original decision.  Nevertheless, there is a certain amount of satisfaction in feeling that the first word of the Land Commission is not the last word, and that there is somewhere else another group of men before whom one can appear to plead his case.  I believe myself that the reactions, as a result of the acceptance of that principle by the Minister, would be very satisfactory. It would remove a great deal of argument about the instability and the <Col N="664" /> unsettled conditions of land holders and the weakness of title, and so on. I do not believe that the possibility of the Minister getting his scheme of land division through would be hindered in any way.  I believe justice would be done.  At least, one could be certain that, as far as the courts could decide on the facts, the owner of the land would get a fair hunt.  His feeling to-day is that he is not getting a chance of having a fair hunt.  I have no personal experience myself&mdash;none whatever&mdash;I am only arguing from what I hear from various parts of the country, and we know that there is no smoke without fire.</P>
    <P>I would say, however, to the Minister that he would be wise to accept this amendment, that if he made this concession he would be going a very long distance to remove a great many of the objections that are being made. While, ultimately, as Senator McEllin says, the decision may not, in many cases, be reversed, nevertheless, the fact that there would be another court of appeal would satisfy public opinion generally, and I think the Minister's acceptance of the amendment would be wise, in view of the disturbing idea prevalent in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesParkinson" hpid="Mr. Parkinson Mr. Parkinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parkinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would strongly appeal to the Minister to view favourably Senator Counihan's amendment, not perhaps, on the ground that we have listened to so far, but on the ground that something will have to be done to create and make permanent credit for the farmers.  If the farmer is in the position that he is without money, without stock, and without hope of getting any, I certainly cannot see how agriculture is going to be carried on.  We know that the banks will not grant credit to the farmer on the security of his holding and, if any title that he has at the moment is finally destroyed when this Bill becomes an Act, where is the unfortunate farmer to look to for help?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of a farmer in the future will be: &ldquo;A landless man, living on the farm.&rdquo;  He will be worse than the farmer was in the old days when he was merely a tenant.  He will <Col N="665" /> not even have the right to his farm; it will belong to people who begrudge him the right to it and who want to take it away from him and divide it up.  If it was divided up fairly, if the man got reasonable compensation&mdash;the value of the land plus what you would give anybody at present when you take land for certain purposes, when there is a certain amount of compensation allotted for disturbance&mdash;one can understand the right of the Government to do it; but, where there are no such rights given to the unfortunate farmer, where he has to take a certificate and then know that he has appeal to no higher court than the Land Commission, what hope is there in the future of carrying on the fundamental part of the social State here?</P>
    <P>Who are the people who are to-day appealing to a national Government for this justice?  Are they not the descendants of the clansmen of old who for 700 years carried on the battle to retain the land of Ireland for the Irish people?  To-day they see a Government of their own passing a measure like this which deprives them of the £250,000,000 invested in that land by these people.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that this question should be approached from the point of view of elementary constitutional rights.  We have, as we all know, a Constitution which is, I hope, respected by all of us, and which is held in very especial honour by some of us, and it seems to me that this Bill as it stands deprives, or attempts to deprive, citizens of some of their elementary constitutional rights.  The Bill seeks to remove altogether the right of appeal to the High Court on <Col N="666" /> questions of fact and severely to restrict the right of appeal on questions of law, but it is part of Article 34, Section 3, of the Constitution, that &ldquo;there shall be a High Court invested with full original jurisdiction in and power to determine all matters and questions, whether of law or fact, civil or criminal&rdquo;.  In other words, as the Bill now stands, it seems to me to be clearly repugnant to the letter as well as to the spirit of the Constitution, and if a leading case came before the High Court, involving a question as to whether this clause is <i>ultra vires</i> or not, in my humble opinion, it would be the duty of the High Court to hold that this clause, and all similar clauses in all existing land legislation, are <i>ultra vires</i> as being repugnant to the Constitution.</P>

      <P>We are always being told in this House that too much responsibility for decisions is being thrown on judges.  Again and again that is impressed on us, and then we suddenly find an inconsistency in this shape.  We have two Lay Commissioners who are asked to decide on a question of fact.  The Minister and everybody in the House, I think, will admit in what might be called a round table discussion here that, in many of these cases, the most terrific political pressure is brought to obtain some particular thing.  I have seen thick files of letters from T.D.s, local people, and every type of person brought down by inspectors.  I was concerned in a particular case&mdash;a question of fact.  I was served by the Land Commission with a notice that they desired to acquire a piece of land under the 1923 Act for the relief of congestion.  It finally came before the tribunal; I made my case, and the commissioners reserved their decision.  The pressure was colossal, and the commissioners went down to the district, and, having seen the place, realised that the facts as originally presented to them were entirely wrong.  I suggest that it would be a relief to the Lay Commissioners to have the chance, if they are in doubt, of going to someone, of saying: &ldquo;We are not quite sure about this.  Let us take it a little further.&rdquo;  It would be justice both to the appellant and to the original <Col N="667" /> judges, apart from the fact that, as other Senators have said, it would preserve a legal right to which, I believe, every citizen of the country is entitled.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister ought to accept this amendment.  Senator The McGillycuddy has referred to the files he saw.  In the case of a judge of the High Court, or of any court, if T.D.s, when a matter was coming before him, wrote letters to him on the matter of his decision, they would be chargeable with embracery. If a T.D. writes to the Lay Commissioners in the matter, is he due for trial on that very grave charge of embracery?  The Senator who made the best case for this amendment was Senator McEllin.  Look at the picture he drew.  He said that you must not hinder the work of these commissioners, but must make it easy for them, and he said that peace and order in this country would be impossible unless land distribution continues and, therefore, let us make their path smooth for the taking of land from the people to whom it belongs and giving it to people to whom it does not belong.  The big Land Act was the 1923 Act, and while we cannot exactly say at what point the land which is due for division is used up, we can say roughly that it is used up now.  If there are a few acres left, compared with what has taken place, they do not amount to much, but if it is a fact that we can have no peace or order in the country unless we constantly divide land, you are going to have this thing going on for ever.  If the Minister looks at the map of the country and finds that the land is all divided, the maximum portions of it being 100 acres, and if I have only 25 acres, I will go agitating to get those 100 acres divided until we come to the point at which we will have nothing, but a nation of congests.  If it were a fact, as the Senator says, that you cannot have peace and order, once you cease dividing land, the only thing for us to do is to set out on an imperial policy of trying to conquer other lands so as to have land to divide amongst the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, there is a feeling, which <Col N="668" /> is very real and which has concrete results, that there is no security in the ownership of land.  The Government's attitude distinctly differentiates between the ownership of land and ownership of any other goods.  As I pointed out earlier, the Lay Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture were created for the division of land and their life has been the dividing of land. What may have been good, desirable and necessary in one set of circumstances may be bad, undesirable and unnecessary in another.  There was a time when a man with thousands of acres knew that, under certain Land Acts, the question of dividing that land might arise.  When it was divided, the farmer owned the land, plus a debt to be paid back in land annuities.  There was a tangible asset there on which, as Senator Parkinson says, for the purpose of exploiting that land and increasing its productivity, he could raise the necessary capital by pledging his possession as an asset for the acquisition of capital.</P>
    <P>We have here the position where, according to Senator McEllin, no matter what portion of land a man may have, the Land Commissioners&mdash; who are civil servants, and who are subject to pressure from T.D.s and other people, and subject to the additional pressure of knowing that they must provide the lands in the interests of peace and order in this country&mdash;are given power in this matter.  But at some stage we must recognise stability in the ownership of land.  As I said to-day, if I own a factory and the men go on strike, I have to face that strike, but I am not faced with the position of having a Government inspector coming along to me and saying: &ldquo;This factory is not being worked in the best interests of the nation, and I must take it up from you.&rdquo;  During the last week the picture of the Minister for Lands brought us to tears, with his story of that unfortunate woman whose lands were covered by weeds; that land was not producing what she had to pay for it in rates, annuities and other costs.  That case moved the great heart of the Minister to pity, and he came along and he took the land from her. He did not charge her for taking it <Col N="669" /> from her.  He relieved her of this heavy burden.  Other people had additional burdens put on them, but in this case the Minister came along and took that land, thus relieving the unfortunate ratepayers in the district.  So we have that case where the land was covered with weeds and the Minister divided it.</P>
    <P>I have always noticed that Government philanthropy is exercised with very great brutality.  During the election last summer or the summer before there was a man came to me with his grievance.  This man had a large number of sons, 10 or 12 I think he had.  He had two farms.  One of his sons was proposed for one of the farms. It was not exactly like the case in which the Minister was acting, as he described himself the other day, where the land was taken from the poor woman because it was a burden to her. Now, that man with 10 or 12 sons came to me and said the Government was demanding one of his farms.  The result was that one of his sons who had been brought up with the prospect of being given that farm was now in the position that his father had to prepare him for some profession, medical or otherwise. As long as we have that sort of a position operated by the Minister and his Department, with their enthusiasms to work a desirable revolution in this country, as long as his Department has this extraordinary power that they can take land from annuitants, then, according to Senator McEllin, the sub-division must go on for ever: for, as he said, otherwise we are to have a revolution in the country.  Surely it is desirable that, as far as annuitants are concerned, they should have some continuity in their holdings.  What Senator Counihan proposes in this amendment does not give them a great deal of continuity, but it would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan talks of the fact that when the commissioners have been proved to have acted contrary to law, the Minister comes in and promptly amends the law with retroactive effect so as to make what was illegal quite legal.  We have no power to prevent that.  It is a modern doctrine of the absolute supremacy of states and <Col N="670" /> governments, that a government can go in at any time and bring in any Act to justify any action of theirs or their servants in the present or in the future.  We are now trying in this amendment to prevent the Government bringing in legislation to justify the illegal acts of themselves and their servants.  I submit that anything that will remove that general feeling that there is no stability in land and that you cannot own land as you own any commodity will help the credit of the farmers.</P>
    <P>I think an amendment such as that proposed by Senator Counihan is desirable in the interests of justice.  It is an impossible position for a farmer to find himself in when something that he owns can be taken from him and that his last appeal is to a body of men subject to political and other pressure, a form of political blackmail.  These commissioners are civil servants and they may be approached by any number of persons, T.D.s and others; whereas the judge of a court if so approached would have the person brought up and charged with contempt of court and, I think, with embracery.  The Lay Commissioners can be approached and no such charge will lie against the person approaching them.  At all events, if it does lie it is very extraordinary that no such charge has been laid so far. As long as we have a method of Government taking further power with regard to the acquisition of land, the farms become, as time passes on, smaller and smaller.  In such circumstances I think we must give some protection to the land-owner.  The amendment proposed by Senator Counihan is desirable as far as it goes, but it is not nearly as adequate as it should be.  That is my complaint against the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McEllin has inspired and really encouraged me to contribute just a little to this debate. It seems an extraordinary thing that the great work achieved by Davitt and Parnell has been nullified to a large extent by our own Parliament.  Senator McEllin tells us that under the Land Act of 1923 it is set out that land <Col N="671" /> may be taken by the Land Commission any time, anywhere.  He did not say it, but I might add &ldquo;and at any price.&rdquo; That was a tragedy.  The resultant effect of that and subsequent legislation has disastrous consequences for the credit of the farmers, as has been so well pointed out by Senator Baxter. Now, will anybody deny that there has been a great loss of confidence on the part of the farmers?  Will anybody in this House deny that there is amongst the agricultural community to-day an atmosphere of timidity, insecurity and instability?  I have within the last six months met quite a number of people who, with perfect honesty, asked me did I think from my experience in this House that it was the purpose and intention of the Government to seize land, particularly where there were large farms.  I replied that in the Act passed in 1923, unfortunately, the Land Commission were invested with that authority and power.  As Senator Parkinson said on another occasion, land is no longer taken as collateral security for money and, consequently, the position of the farmer has been very considerably interfered with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point to which I want specially to draw the attention of the Minister.  With great emphasis he pledged his word that no man who worked his land, using his own words, &ldquo;moderately well,&rdquo; would be interfered with.  On Thursday last in this House he supplemented that and, in fact, clarified the position very specifically and very definitely when he added that not alone did that apply to tillage farms, but that grass farmers who worked their lands &ldquo;moderately well&rdquo; would not be interfered with or impaired in any degree.  I was delighted to hear that definite assurance from the Minister, and in order to strengthen the two previous statements and promises he said that no Government could last for an indefinite period if, in any way, they interfered with farmers who worked their land &ldquo;moderately well.&rdquo;  I suppose there are some promises that the Government intend to fulfil.  I cannot, for the life of me, understand the reluctance <Col N="672" /> of the Minister after making that promise&mdash;and I believe he was sincere &mdash;to concede the right of appeal.  As matters stand at present, what do we find?  An inspector from the Land Commission comes to a certain decision and he does not submit himself to be cross-examined by the Lay Commissioners on that decision.  Does it not seem an extraordinary thing that young inspectors from the Land Commission&mdash;and they are generally young &mdash;have these great powers over the properties of the people?  It is for them to decide what lands they may take, and there is no right of appeal from that decision.</P>
    <P>I have received particulars of a case with which the Minister and his Department are presumably familiar. The circumstances justify me in saying that the promises and the pledges given by the Minister have been grossly violated.  I have authority to state that the particulars have been vouched for on solemn oath.  I might mention that the case arose near Listowel, in County Kerry, so that, perhaps, the Minister may remember the details of it.  When the House hears the details, I am sure Senators will be appalled by them.  They afford the greatest justification for the arguments that have been put forward by the various Senators who have supported Senator Counihan's amendment.  Sworn evidence was given before two Lay Commissioners that the despoiled owner had expended over £3,750 on improvements, draining and remodelling this farm, which consisted of 130 acres, and that his wage bill had exceeded £275 per annum for three years prior to the resumption of the land by the Land Commission.  Wage books and account books were produced for inspection by the commissioners, and were testified to on oath. Three maps were submitted, two of them fair rent maps and the other a Land Registry map, showing plainly at intervals of ten years the great improvements that had been carried out.</P>
    <P>A very well-known auctioneer and valuer testified to the perfect maintenance of this farm, but, the Minister's pledge notwithstanding, it has been <Col N="673" /> resumed by the Land Commission, who never questioned, nor even attempted to rebut, the evidence that this land had been not alone moderately well worked, but had been maintained at great expense by the unremitting care and attention of the owner.</P>
    <P>The excuse given for the resumption in this case is, not that the land was not properly worked, not that the most that could be extracted out of the land was not so extracted, not that the essential labour, in harmony with the size of the farm and in view of the fact that it was subjected to very considerable flooding, was not employed. None of these was the reason set out or assigned by the Land Commission for their action in taking over this farm.  What was it?  That the owner's wife had a shop.  In other words, there is an unenacted but operative provision which impels the Land Commission to declare that no farmer may feel secure in the possession of his land, as is exemplified and demonstrated on oath in this case, no matter how well worked, no matter if 100 per cent. production is extracted from it, if his wife runs a shop.  It was taken notwithstanding the fact, as I have said, that it was more than moderately well worked, in harmony with the statement, the promise and pledge made in this House and in the other House on more than one occasion.  Everybody will agree that land must be utilised in this country to extract from it the maximum of its productivity.</P>

      <P>I said quite distinctly and clearly, for any intelligent man to understand, that the Lay Commissioners or any commissioner or any judge in this country will have to work on the law as it exists in the Land Acts; and it is that the Land Commission have power to take land anywhere at any time.  Surely to goodness that is perfectly obvious.  That did not mean that I wanted to make it easier for those Lay Commissioners. <Col N="676" /> I know the meaning, in practice, of those Land Acts, because my family and myself have been victims over the last 40 years of decisions both of the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board.  I have been a victim&mdash;if you like to call it that&mdash;of such decisions within the last three years.  Consequently, in connection with the operation of the law as it exists to-day, I do say that misleading landlords who are brought before the Land Commission into the belief that the law is going to be differently interpreted in any other court is simply sending the fool further.  It is merely involving them in greater costs with lawyers, solicitors, land valuers and everybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In actual practice what this whole amendment means is that you want to take away from the Land Commission a power that is already in existence in the Land Acts.  You are asking a higher judge to change the law.  It cannot be done.  We must get down to the reason why all those land laws are being brought in.  Personally, I do not see any hope of having the law repealed. When I said that it was essential for peace and order, I believed that.  This whole question of land division is rooted in our history.  The Land League, the Fenian Movement, and every other movement of that kind, were intended to free the people from the grasp of the landlords of the time, and to rectify the wrongs inflicted on them by the confiscations in Cromwellian times.  Parnell and Davitt afterwards came along and advocated land reform.  They succeeded in bringing in the Wyndham Acts, and so on. Parnell and Davitt never intended that three-fourths of the people of this country should live on valuations of £1, 30/- or £5, while the other fourth lived on valuations of £100.  In County Mayo at present the average valuation is about £5, while, as another example, the average in County Meath is about £120.  As I see the position now, quite frankly I do not believe there is any future for any extensive landowners' operations.  I am quite satisfied that if the Party to which Senator Fitzgerald belongs were to go up to-morrow at a general election, seeking a return to power, one of the main planks of the <Col N="677" /> platform of that Party would be the continuation of land division.  The same applies to the Fianna Fáil Party. Neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael has the courage to extract that particular plank from their platform?  Why? Because the majority of the farming community of this country are living on holdings the valuations of which are so low that they cannot get a living on them, and each Party knows perfectly well that they would not be returned as a Government if they withdrew that policy of land division.</P>

      <P>To what extent?  Senator Baxter knows the country fairly well, and I suggest to him that he would not say in a calm, rational moment that 3 per cent. of that is correct.  This amendment suggests that there should be an opportunity of submitting all questions to the Appeal Tribunal.  Whatever is the intention of the amendment as submitted by Senator Counihan, the effect will be to hold up land distribution indefinitely.  There are innumerable questions that can be raised if it is proposed to distribute land; there are innumerable questions of fact which can be raised and brought before the Appeal Tribunal.  Whoever heard of appeals on fact being taken <Col N="679" /> before a higher tribunal?  Is not the lower tribunal always the tribunal which is in touch with the actualities of the situation in the district and more likely to know the particular facts than the higher tribunal to which leave to appeal is now being sought?</P>

      <P>Will the Senator tell me any Workmen's Compensation Act case where there is an appeal to a higher tribunal on a question of fact?  If questions of fact may be brought before the Appeal Tribunal it will indefinitely postpone land distribution.  The question of the suitability of congests, the question of whether the particular land is capable of growing wheat, the question of whether there are minerals on the land&mdash;all these matters can be raised and brought before the Appeal Tribunal, indefinitely postponing the distribution of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to criticise the Land Commission and the Appeal Tribunal and the Lay Commissioners as much as anybody, but no case has ever come to my knowledge, as a representative either in the other House or here, where the Land Commission endeavoured to interfere with any prac-  farmer who was working his land. I  know that in my own county there are still thousands of acres which could be distributed, and distributed beneficially, to the community.  I know that any man who likes can raise innumerable objections to the acquisition of these lands and bring these objections to the Appeal Tribunal and indefinitely delay distribution of these lands, while there are hundreds of congests waiting to be put on these lands and to work them beneficially.  It is ridiculous for people to come into an assembly of this kind and suggest that questions of fact ought to be brought to the Appeal Tribunal.  A question of law can be brought to the <Col N="680" /> Appeal Tribunal and decided.  The Appeal Tribunal should not be asked to decide questions of fact when you have the Lay Commissioners with their inspectors and their local knowledge to decide all these matters of fact, where the land is there for distribution and the congests are waiting for it and the Land Commission has acted honestly and independently up to the present in the distribution of land.</P>

      <P>I want to challenge the statement&mdash;I was astonished to hear it made by Senator Hogan&mdash;that the fear of compulsory acquisition is not affecting the lending of money on land. I happen to know something about the considerations that affect people landing money on land.  Obviously, if anybody has power to come in without giving any reason and take the land practically at their own price there can be no free sale.  That alone, added to the social boycott which always operates, is, of course, going to affect the lending of money to a tremendous extent.  You cannot exaggerate the limitations to credit on land under the present law.  What Senator here would lend money on land with the law as it is at present?  I would not mind saying that very few would lend a penny piece on land.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane said that he was stung to speech by some remarks that were made.  I am stung to speech also by the remarks made by the Senator just now.  I have just come from my own county, and the existence of the Land Commission is scarcely known there, for the reason that the people there are all comparatively small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no such thing there as believing that the tenure of their land is in jeopardy, because I questioned them about it.  I also questioned them <Col N="681" /> on the matter of getting credit from the banks.  Fortunately, the people I was questioning did not require credit from the banks, but they told me that the reason why credit was not so freely available from the banks now was because credit was forced on the people before, and the banks got bitten too severely and, once bitten, are twice shy.  Senator Sir John Keane should remember that that is one of the principal things that is preventing the banks from lending money on land to-day.  You need not shake your head.</P>

      <P>I think the only remark I did not make through the Chair was the remark about shaking his head.  I apologise for noticing that Senator Sir John Keane shook his head.  One remark passed by Senator Professor Johnston attracted my attention, and that was the reason why, as he told us, he voted for and was a supporter of the Constitution, and then saying that the missing of a legal point, as to the tenure of land, was <i>ultra vires</i> according to the Constitution. That interested me personally, but his argument there was just as sinister as the argument that he gave for voting for the Constitution, and I do not place much credit upon it.  I might compare the attitude of Senator Johnston in voting for the Constitution to that of the boy in Pears' soap advertisement, who would not be happy until he got it.</P>

      <P>It is on the records, and if it is analogous to the other stories he told I think it is relevant to mention it now.  On the question of appeals to another tribunal on law I do not think it deals with knowledge of the facts.  That is correct as far as the valuation of land goes, or knowledge as to whether land should be taken over or not.  I think it would be as safe in the hands of whatever number of commissioners there are as I would be in the hands of a judge of the High Court.  That is my opinion and I am entitled to hold it.  The question <Col N="682" /> of amending the law goes back to democratic control.  Some people seem to object to the Government having a majority to support what they did.  Well, if a succeeding Government gets a majority in favour of a change in the law I do not see how any argument could be put up against a change, if the majority of the people change their mind.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in the debate on this amendment, but when Senator Counihan moved it I felt he had some little grounds to stand on.  Now I think it would be right in saying that the Senator feels like saying: &ldquo;Lord, save me from my friends.&rdquo;  As a result of the debate it is quite evident to Senator Counihan that the amendment has not a leg to stand on, and that, in fact, the speeches in favour of it are obviously speeches aimed at cutting the Bill to pieces, and destroying the whole principle of it.  This Bill was introduced as far as I know, and I stated so on the Second Reading, to oil the machinery of the Land Commission, to make it easier to carry on the work of the Land Commission without unnecessary holding up of the machine, so that it would not be, as it has been for the last three years, running partly idle.  Arguments put up <Col N="683" /> in support of the amendment are really the greatest arguments against it.</P>
      <P>I will not mention anyone particularly, but we had various speakers putting up the argument that the people were in terror of the Land Commission lest it would acquire land, and that, therefore, they could get no credit. Anybody who has studied the position knows that that is not a fact, and that banks refused to advance money on land because the value of land had depreciated for various reasons that it is unnecessary to go into now.  It depreciated because of world depression since the Great War.  Because land deteriorated in value the banks would not advance money on it.  It would be a very serious position if the value of land was regulated in proportion to the amount of credit available. If that was the situation we would have a repetition of what happened in 1921 and about that period, when people went to the banks to borrow money irrespective of the value of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Keane said that the fear of compulsory acquisition had destroyed credit.  That is not so.  The fear of compulsory acquisition existed long before the present Government came into power.  As far back as 1923 credit was given on land, and the banks were not in terror of compulsory acquisition then, although, as a matter of fact, the power was there to acquire land compulsorily. As Senator Hogan pointed out, the amendment, if accepted, would result in bringing us back to the same position we were in in the past, and instead of helping as the section intends, we would have the greatest delay about every conceivable matter that could be brought up, and in certain parts we would have the people standing around estates that might be acquired, expecting them to be divided, as well as the unrest and dissatisfaction that we have had for three or four years.  In my opinion, the question of credit cuts both ways.  I know certain people who have been refused credit not because of the fear that the Land Commission would acquire land, but because of the fear that the Land Commission could not acquire it owing to <Col N="684" /> some technicality.  People who went into banks to ask for credit on farms that they were going to sell to the Land Commission were told that the sale might or might not come off, that it might come off in one year or in five years, and an estate that was to be divided two years previously, but that was still there, was pointed to, as apparently there was some hold up in the Land Commission.  In that way it cuts both ways.  This Bill was provided after having due consideration for the interests of people selling land, proposing to sell land, or proposing to secure land, and also those who eventually will be going into the land.  In fact, it was prepared in the interests of the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>We have had a very valuable statement from Senator Hogan, and I should like to compliment him on making it.  I do so, particularly because of the fact that he cannot be branded as one of the so-called organised majority in this House.  Senator Hogan made the statement that, in his long career in public life, he never knew of one case where the Land Commission interferred with a man who was working his land along proper lines of husbandry.  I believe the same thing.  I have had a fairly long career and a fairly long connection with agricultural interests in the country, not alone in one county but all over the country, and I have never known any man being interfered with who was working his land along the proper lines.  That statement should not go unnoticed, especially coming from Senator Hogan, who cannot be classed as one of the organised majority in the House.</P>
    <P>I believe whatever argument Senator Counihan had at the beginning, it has been knocked into a cocked hat by those who spoke in support of his amendment.  If this amendment were accepted by the Minister&mdash;I hope it will not be, and I am quite sure it will not be&mdash;I doubt very much if there will be any noticeable change in the attitude of the banks.  Senator Sir John Keane is the principal spokesman in that connection, and I ask him, if the amendment were accepted, would <Col N="685" /> the banks be prepared to give credit, or would they be prepared to seek invitations for credit from the 350,000 who have been refused credit, according to the Senator and to other members of his Party?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the question whether the banks are influenced in their decision to lend to farmers by the absence of legal ownership of the farms is a question of fact. On that question we have, on the one hand, the sweeping statements made by Senator O'Donovan and, on the other hand, we have the statements made by Senator Sir John Keane, who is also a banker and who may be presumed to know what he is talking about.  I am not quite sure whether the other Senator is not sometimes rather irrelevant.  The contents of the Banking Commission Report may not be accepted by all persons as the last word in wisdom with regard to its recommendations, but surely where its paragraphs contain plain statements of fact, we must accept these statements of fact as made with the greatest possible authority and the greatest possible certainty.</P>
      <P>If any Senator doubts whether the credit policy of the banks is affected by the existing compulsory powers of the Land Commission, I will refer him to paragraph 514 of the Banking Commission Report.  There we have a paragraph stressing the importance, from the credit point of view, of terminating the compulsory powers of land acquisition possessed by the Land Commission. This amendment does not propose to terminate the compulsory powers relating to such land acquisition, but it does propose to protect the owner of property by giving him a right of appeal to the High Court on questions of fact as well as of law, giving him what I regard as an elementary constitutional right, and to that extent it is a step in the direction of restoring some degree of security of tenure without which his credit with the banks can never be fully established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say, finally, that this whole legislation has been setting up a machinery of confiscation, not that <Col N="686" /> I am accusing either the present Government or its predecessor of any desire to operate that machinery in such a way as to bring about the wholesale confiscation of land.  I do believe there has been some degree of confiscation involved in the treatment of land, but I do not accuse the Government of either having used or intending to use this machinery as a method of wholesale confiscation and expropriation without compensation.  But this Government is not necessarily the last Government, and the next Government will not necessarily be Fine Gael, and it is quite possible a government more in sympathy with the views expressed by Senator Hogan will one day rule this country and, if it does, it will find right to its hand the whole machinery of confiscation, without supervision by any proper expert legal tribunal, a machinery operated by civil servants, subject to all kinds of political pressure, and with that machinery it will be very easy to proceed to the extreme of social revolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Johnston Mr. Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing the latitude that has been allowed to some speakers, I feel that I should like to dwell upon certain aspects of this matter.  Senator Counihan proposes to amend this clause by substituting the words &ldquo;any question&rdquo; for &ldquo;a question of law,&rdquo; and later on, in paragraph (a), he proposes to substitute the words &ldquo;any such question&rdquo; for &ldquo;on that question.&rdquo;  If that were carried it would mean, when we come down to paragraph (b), that there could be an appeal on any question from the decision of the Appeal Tribunal to the Supreme Court.  I put it to the House that it is largely because of the possibility of land acquisition and land distribution being held up that this legislation is put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this amendment were carried it would, in my opinion, put the Land Commission in practically the same position as it was when these two remarkable cases were decided by a court of law.  That decision meant that land acquisition and distribution were at a standstill, and it was that decision that necessitated the introduction of a special Land Bill.  If we are going to go <Col N="687" /> back to that position, then all the time spent on the introduction and the consideration of this Bill has been uselessly spent.</P>
    <P>I am strongly opposed to any change being made in the section.  I am strongly opposed to the attitude of those who are in opposition to the Bill. To my mind, they are not concerned with the dangers that present themselves and that the Bill seeks to deal with.  Their arguments, to my mind, were concerned more with political propaganda than with the objects of the Bill.  I believe they were influenced more by political motives than by anything else.</P>

      <P>I do not agree that the present credit position of the farmers is due to the operation of any Land Acts.  There are many small farmers who up to this could not possibly come under the Land Acts.  I do not agree with many of the arguments advanced in favour of this amendment. I recognise that the process of land division must go on until as many people as possible are planted on the land.  I appreciate also that this amendment might mean some delay and difficulty in the matter of land acquisition.  Nevertheless, I would appeal to the Minister, if it is possible to give consideration to the spirit of the amendment in view of the gravity of the position of some landholders whose land might be taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all recognise how hard it is for the holders of land to be dispossessed. This applies more in the case of people with fairly small farms and large families. If it is at all possible, consistent with the policy of land acquisition to allow an appeal to the Appeal Court of the Land Commission.  I think it should be done.  I understand from the amendment that it is not proposed to go beyond the Land Commission Appeal Court.  I do not think there can be any great question of costs involved. There is already an appeal, as regards the price, from the Land Commissioners to the Appeal Commissioners. Therefore two of these could go on together, but I would ask him to look into the matter because I think <Col N="688" /> it might be possible to make some arrangement, and I know that it would create a good deal of goodwill towards land purchase in general if the Minister could see his way to do something to meet that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of the credit afforded by the banks to the farmers at the moment, I agree with Senator Hogan when he says that not more than 3 per cent. of the people down the country are affected because of this Land Bill.  I think that credit from the banks has ceased for a number of years and, as I mentioned here before, that was entirely due to the manner in which the banks advanced money to the farmers when they were buying land at three or four times its value.  They have now no credit in the banks and you would not hear one case in a hundred of a farmer knowing or believing that it is on account of the possession he holds of his land that he is refused credit. The banks are not prepared to give him credit if they know or have the slightest inkling that the farmer requires money in advance for the purchase of cattle to re-stock his land or to improve his land, or to pay his debts, but they are prepared to give money to the farmers who do not want the money.  They are coaxing such men, but they are not prepared to give money to a man who is trying to do the best he can for his land, and I do not think that this Bill will have the slightest effect on such a man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a great deal about the instability in the country at the moment and about confiscation of land and the courts of appeal, but there are old people living down the country who can tell you to this day that some years ago, so far as regards courts of appeal for the Irish farmer were concerned, it was just a matter of having to clear out within 48 hours, and there was not one word of compensation either. They had to clear out under the old régime and there was no court of appeal for them and no question of fixity of tenure, or of the right they had to the land.  The Minister mentioned here, on the Second Reading of this Bill, that the Government were <Col N="689" /> not prepared to penalise a farmer who was working his land; that neither the last Government nor the present Government, nor any future Government of this country could ever attempt it because there would be no place for a government in this country if they attempted to take the land from the people who owned it and who were prepared to work it.  The Minister gave that as his word and I am sure he will see that his word will be carried into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Douglas asked me to tell the House, when replying, what was the position with regard to the independence of the Land Commissioners. The position of the Lay Commissioners is that the two Appeals Tribunal Commissioners hold their office by a tenure similar to that of a Circuit Court judge, and they can only be removed by a resolution of both Houses.  The other commissioners, not members of the tribunal, may be dismissed for incompetence or misconduct, but if that happens a resolution of both Houses could reinstate them.  In that respect, I think they differ from the ordinary civil servant.  On the point as to how they were affected by all these stacks of letters that, we were told, were on the files, I think that Senator The McGillycuddy himself has told us, in the case he mentioned, that when the commissioners heard that case they upheld the objection, and that has been the universal experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall have to reply at length to the case made by Senator Madden.  I must say that I do not know of the particular case he mentions, but I have had inquiries made about a case in that particular area, which was referred to by one of the Deputies in the other House publicly, and I had the matter inquired into.  This case may not be the same but, certainly, from the investigations I made into it is would appear to be similar, if not actually the same case.  While I am on that, I should have reminded Senator Douglas that the Minister is excluded from interfering in cases of acquisition.  Section 6 of the 1933 Act removes from the Minister the right to interfere in questions of acquisition of land, allocation of land, or the price <Col N="690" /> to be given for it.  I should have mentioned that.</P>
    <P>When, however, questions are raised, I can ask the Land Commissioners to give me particulars about any case that has been decided, and I did so in this case, to which I have referred, and found that it was a question of a farm of 120 acres or thereabouts, situated in a district in which there was local congestion, and owned by an old man in the seventies, a shopkeeper and hotel owner.  On that farm there was a herd who occupied a cottage which had been condemned in 1935 as unfit for habitation.  Even if that had been a well worked farm, and occupied by an ordinary farmer who was running it properly, there is power, where there is local congestion, to take that farm if the Land Commission are satisfied that the circumstances of the case require that to be done, but if he is a farmer working his land properly, and with no other land, he is definitely entitled to an alternative holding to the value of £2,000, if his land is of such value, and, if of greater value than that, bonds for the balance.  He gets that security, and I do not think there is much objection to that.  He has that protection.</P>
    <P>If, however, he is not a farmer, if he has some other business, such as a shopkeeper&mdash;and in this case the particular person concerned had two children, one in a profession and the other married and away from the place&mdash;the position is different.  I am not saying that it is the same case, as I have not the particulars, but I would be very much surprised to hear that this particular farmer was able to show that he had a wages bill and that the particulars mentioned by the Senator applied to him.  I would be very much surprised if that could have happened, and when I stated that these things had not happened I was relying on what I was told by those who deal with these matters.  The same Senator, I think, said that an ordinary inspector, a young fellow, goes down the country and that his word is final. It is not final, and Senator The McGillycuddy answered that.</P>
    <P>Now, I am going to deal with the <Col N="691" /> amendment in time, but I want to deal with some of these general points first. Senator Fitzgerald dealt with a fundamental point when he said that the Government differentiated between ownership of land and ownership of other property.  He is quite right. They certainly do, and the last Government did so.  Why should they not?  Everybody recognises that there is a difference between the ownership of land and the ownership of other property, and it is only where land has not been properly worked or, as I said previously, even moderately worked, that there is any danger of its being taken.  I think there is agreement, even on Senator Sir John Keane's side, that if land is neglected and not properly worked, it ought to be properly worked in the interests of the national economy.  I do not know if they do agree on that, but I think that there should be agreement on that.  There is certainly that difference between the ownership of land and the ownership of other property. I do not want to deny that.  It has been recognised by this Government, by the last Government, and even by the British Government, and it would have to be recognised by any Government in a country like this.  I quite admit that there is that difference.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I did say, and I repeat now, that lands have not been taken and will not be taken if they are even moderately well worked.  There is power to take them in certain circumstances, which are set out, and on the Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil I undertook to bring in extra protection for a type of farmer who had not got legal protection although, in actual practice, he had&mdash;that is, the unvested farmer&mdash;and that protection is contained, I think, in sub-section (5) of Section 39.  I do not think he is one bit more secure now than before that was brought in, because, in practice, he was all right if he was working his land even moderately well.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  I refused it in the other House, although I met the Opposition on practically every other point.  On this point, if I <Col N="692" /> thought any wrong was being inflicted, I would meet them too.  I am quite satisfied that no wrong is being done. I am quite satisfied that what Senator Hogan has said is correct and that is the reason why I am not accepting the amendment&mdash;that there would be undue delay which would have no ultimate effect at all because before the Land Commission decided to take over that land the fullest possible hearing is given in open court.  Everything that can be said against acquiring or resuming land can be said in open court.  The Land Commission hear the case in open court and in a very large number of cases the result is the same as in the case mentioned by Senator The McGillycuddy.  Whether the local people, or the Fianna Fáil, or other T.D.s wish otherwise, the fact is that in many and many a case&mdash;I cannot give the proportion&mdash;the objection is upheld. I am perfectly certain of that.  But, there would be interminable delays if we agreed to this amendment, that is, to allow an appeal on fact.  I would say that Senator Hogan is quite right that this is not the only case in which there is no appeal on fact.  Juries decide questions of fact and very vital questions of fact at times, which might involve a man's life, and as far as I know, on the question of fact there is no appeal.  There is an appeal on law. We have the appeal on law there which has been availed of and, I am sure, will be availed of again.  The very big, important question is the question of price.  There is also an appeal on that. I say, as I said before, that there is no danger in the world of anybody losing his land.  I cannot understand such an attitude.  If Senators are really speaking from their experience, they must meet a different type of person in the country from what I meet.  They certainly must.  I have never heard yet of a demand for well-worked land to be acquired anywhere, even from the most rabid advocates of land division.  I have not.  I have never heard of that feeling of insecurity from people in the country.</P>
    <P>What Senator Hogan and Senator O'Donovan have said has been my experience too&mdash;that there is no feeling of insecurity except by certain people &mdash;shopkeepers and business people like <Col N="693" /> that, and others who have a lot of outside farms which they do not work and on which they do not reside.  We have a big problem still to solve, of thousands of uneconomic holders living in wretched conditions.  We have not solved that problem, and there are others, a certain number of landless men to be provided for, but we have to provide mostly for congests.  With that position, and with the fact that a lot of this land is almost derelict, I do not see how anyone can object to our proceeding and seeing that that land is worked in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>I would repeat, for the benefit of some Senators present now who were not present on the last occasion, that a lot of the land that has been divided has been offered to the Land Commission.  Some of those big estates that have been giving a lot of employment would never have been acquired compulsorily any more than the Forestry Department would have acquired the Guinness estate in Cong. The Land Commission would never have dreamt of going to estates like these, but we were the only purchasers. There are several of these cases.  I would say the majority of these big estates were not confiscated.  The owners were very glad that the Land Commission came in and took them off their hands, because the house and a lot of the lands were going derelict.  It was, and is, good national work to proceed with division of that land.</P>
    <P>The lands we are looking for are lands which we want to relieve congestion, which are not being worked, and which in that way are anything but a benefit to the country.  We are doing nothing to destroy the security of any farmer, and I am quite satisfied that anyone who goes through the country and meets the ordinary farmer, unless they listen to speeches will not hear that the ordinary farmer has any grievance. It is only those people who listen to speeches who will get alarmed. There is no doubt about that.  The ordinary farmer has no reason in the world for alarm.</P>
    <P>I intend to investigate the case the Senator mentioned, but I doubt very much if the particulars are correct.  It <Col N="694" /> is very like the case that I have investigated, and in a case of that kind we certainly had no alternative.  There was local congestion, and we had to go ahead and divide that land amongst those who badly wanted it.  I cannot accept the amendment for the reason I have stated.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister's attitude is really disappointing.  However earnest and frank and honest he may appear here&mdash;and we accept that he is&mdash;in his intentions, nothing which he could say or nothing which he said so far, or that has been said in the other House, will allay the fears and suspicions existing in the country. Senator O'Donovan says he goes through one part of the country, and he finds the people he is living with are not afraid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator may be as much out of order as he was the last time he spoke, but he can make a reply. Senator Quirke and, I think, the Minister say that as far as the people they meet are concerned, they are not afraid.  Why?  The people Senator Quirke would be dealing with would be mainly people who would be wanting land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>

      <P>The policy of quite a number of people is the distribution of land&mdash;always the distribution of other people's land.  That has to be remembered. This question of the distribution of land is a problem in certain parts of the country, but there are certain other parts where the people's minds are not disturbed, although it would not be too hard to disturb them.  There is no doubt at all that there has been too much propaganda throughout the country about the distribution of land and the idea has been created all over that there were millions of acres to be <Col N="695" /> distributed and made available.  Senator McEllin may have had that in mind when he said that it might mean something very like a revolution if we did not go on like this.  He did not say that exactly but something to that effect.  The point is that the people of this country have waited for generations for the solution of this problem that we call the land problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I think, gave us approximate figures of what he thought was the area available for final distribution.  It is very limited now and becoming smaller every day, and I fail to understand why the Minister is not prepared to make this concession to the people who have grave fears and who are distrubed.  I cannot understand his line of reasoning.  I refuse to believe that it would hold up the machinery of the Land Commission to the extent which the Minister <Col N="696" /> gives us the impression it will. He made a statement that well-worked farms will not be disturbed in their ownership.  The Minister and anyone who knows anything about the country knows that owing to the conditions of certain families the lands cannot be well worked.  We all know the conditions under which families have to operate at particular times. Picture a farmer with two or three acres who is left with perhaps four or five children.  Perhaps it may be a widow with four or five or six children. She is not working the land and she cannot work the land for all sorts of reasons.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported, the Seanad to sit again to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 o'clock on Thursday, 20th July.</P>
