      <P>Before moving my motion, I wish merely to state that I understand agreement has been reached in the Dáil between all Parties there that the guillotine motion be not moved in the Dáil and I take it that the same thing will apply here as general agreement is assumed in this House also, the idea being that, while the guillotine motion is not being <Col N="1012" /> moved, the House will be agreeable to act in the spirit of the motion and accommodate as far as possible the Government and the House in the carrying out of the legislation necessary at to-day's sitting.  I accordingly move that business be now suspended until the First Amendment of the Constitution Bill has been received from the Dáil.</P>

    <Title>First Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1939&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, this amendment is required to resolve a doubt which has arisen as to whether, under Article 28 of the Constitution, a &ldquo;time of war&rdquo; means any time except one in which the State is actually participating as a belligerent.  My view was that a &ldquo;time of war&rdquo;, as defined in the Constitution, covered an emergency of this sort&mdash;an emergency such as we are now facing.  However, if we get from the Oireachtas the powers that are sought in the Bills that are now before you, it would not do to have at any time the possibility of legal action being taken, questioning the validity of any orders that may be issued, on the ground that such powers were not contemplated at the time of the enactment of the Constitution, and that, therefore, any act that might be taken would be <i>ultra vires</i> and that the powers we seek would be also <i>ultra vires.</i>  To remove that doubt we want to include in the phrase &ldquo;time of war&rdquo; a time when an armed conflict is taking place, which armed conflict might menace the vital interests of the State. It has been suggested in the Dáil, and may be suggested in the Seanad, that the moment you leave it to a majority of both Houses of the Oireachtas to determine when a time of emergency of this sort exists, you make it possible for a majority in both Houses of the Oireachtas to suspend the Constitution, <Col N="1013" /> and that therefore there is nothing to prevent an unscrupulous Party, with a majority in both Houses, from changing the Constitution, even in accordance with law.</P>
      <P>Apart from normal times, I think it must be recognised that, in certain times of emergency, it is essential for the service of the State that the Executive should be furnished with ample powers to face any contingency that might arise.  I notice that an amendment has been suggested which tries further to define a time of armed conflict as a time when a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations would be engaged in war.  I do not think, however, that that would cover possible emergencies.  One can visualise a case in which, let us say, Canada might be at war in the East, and that war might not in any way affect our vital interests.  Neither would it be of much help to suggest that, because Great Britain, let us say, were at war defending her own interests in the East, such a war might menace our vital interests.  Even if Great Britain were engaged in a European War, that might not necessarily affect our vital interests, but one can easily visualise circumstances in which a particular war, although it might not menace our territory actually, might affect our vital interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach observed that the amendment does not touch that phrase about vital interests, that it leaves that intact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, but it is an attempt to narrow down the circumstances under which a particular type of conflict, which causes conditions here approximating to war conditions in which we would be not actually a belligerent, could be said to exist.  I do not think it is within the wit of man to devise a phrase which will prevent, in certain circumstances, an unscrupulous majority from betraying its democratic obligations and overturning democracy if it considers itself strong enough to do so.  I think there is no use in trying to provide against all possible <Col N="1014" /> things of that sort.  A democracy, any representative government, in order to be successful has to be run according to rules, has to have popular opinion behind it and to be supported in that way.  If at any time, an occasion should arise, when the majority could so flout the ideals of representative government, it would be done otherwise and there would be an end to this system of government.  I think, therefore, we would give ourselves fruitless trouble in trying to devise a phrase which would narrow down the definition.  There was a suggestion made in the Dáil that the President as guardian of the Constitution &mdash;it was not put in these precise terms &mdash;might be brought in as an outside referee to say whether such an emergency had in fact arisen and that his concurrence with the resolutions of the two Houses might be obtained. Well, that was an idea which had not suggested itself in that particular form to us who were dealing with this matter though it had existed in another form.  Difficulty would arise if we go beyond what is obviously a verbal amendment of the Constitution, because I held the view, when the Constitution was being discussed, that when we spoke of a time of war, we had in mind conditions such as the conditions which would obtain in this country when Great Britain went to war and our vital interests would be affected in such a manner that it would be necessary for the Executive to be armed with powers such as I have indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Oireachtas can agree to this amendment of the Constitution.  I promised in the Dáil that I would consider the matter again before the period has elapsed in which it is possible to amend the Constitution by legislation, to see whether it is possible to give some further guarantees such as might be implied by having the concurrence of the President. In this particular case, we shall have the concurrence of the President, because if the President thought there was an attempt being made at this particular time by a majority in both Houses to subvert the Constitution, he could refuse to sign this measure and <Col N="1015" /> he could insist on the will of the country being obtained about it.</P>
    <P>The President, as you know, according to the Constitution, has the power to say: &ldquo;I cannot sign that; you have got to get the opinion of the people upon it&rdquo;.  So, if the President in this particular case, signs the Bill, we may take it as his concurrence with the opinion of the Dáil and the Seanad that the emergency which we envisage in this Article in the Constitution immediately occurs.  That does not, of course, provide for the future.  I shall consider whether similar concurrence of some such sort should not be necessary in order that the Dáil and the Seanad by majority resolutions should say that a state of emergency exists.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to say more.  Members of the Seanad are aware of the situation that is facing us.  It would appear that we are going to be faced with another terrible European War.  As I said in the Dáil, the interests of our country, in the view of the Government, would be best served by trying to keep our country out of it.  One of the Deputies in the Dáil asked whether that meant that we were indifferent.  I do not want to suggest by that that individuals in this country are indifferent to the conflict that is taking place, but our individual sympathies are one matter; the action which the Government should take on behalf of the nation, for the protection of the vital interests of the nation, is quite another.  It is in our capacity as guardians of the interests of our people that we put before Parliament a policy to try to preserve this nation from war, and to keep as neutral as conditions will make it possible for us so to do.  Undoubtedly we are a next-door neighbour of Britain and, being in that situation relative to her, and not in a similar situation relative to the other parties to the conflict, it does mean that, in that particular case, there will be difficulties which we have not, perhaps at the moment at any rate, got to face in regard to the more remote contestant. There will have to be an arrangement <Col N="1016" /> made for carrying on our trade, the greatest part of our trade, in the market in which we sell most of our supplies and the source from which we get most of our essential commodities. Arrangements will have to be made for the continuance of that particular trade and in a variety of ways like that we shall be brought into closer contact&mdash;&ldquo;contact&rdquo; is the best word I can use in the circumstances&mdash;with Britain than we are likely to be with the other parties to the contest. However, we are determined to keep our country out of war if we can.</P>
    <P>I said a long time ago in the Dáil, but it was not appreciated, that it is one thing to desire to keep neutral, to desire to keep out of conflict, but that it is not sufficient to have the will.  We want to have the way and the power to prevent use being made of our position in favour of one or other of the parties.  It is necessary for us to have the power to do that.  It is not sufficient to have a good-will towards other people; they may not have good-will towards you in return.  It may happen that though you may not wish to injure any one of the contending parties, they may make up their minds that it would be useful for them to pretend, let us say, that you were injuring their interests and, therefore, try one way or another to use whatever power they might possess to interfere with your legitimate rights.  One, therefore, has to prepare oneself to preserve one's rights.  I have no doubt, anxious as are the times that are ahead, that our people will, if called upon, defend our interests as other people would defend their interests if they were attacked. We are anxious about the situation, naturally.  We deplore the situation that has arisen, but I think we can face it as courageously and with as bold a heart as any other people can. Therefore, whilst I mention this necessity, I do not want to make it appear at all that we find ourselves in a position in which we would not be able, reasonably, to defend our rights.  I think we shall.</P>
    <P>I said also that, whatever might be the individual opinions of members of the community, our history and the <Col N="1017" /> fact that portion of our territory is still cut off from the nation makes any other course for this nation&mdash;whatever sympathies it might have&mdash;or for the responsible Government in this country, impossible.  So not merely is it a question of our opinion that it is important for the State to keep out of this war, but I believe it is the only course possible and that, no matter what Government was in office, it could in the circumstances adopt no other course.  I ask the Seanad to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill the Second Reading of which I think ought to be passed.  It is interesting and quite understandable that a doubt should have arisen on the first emergency with which the new Constitution was confronted.  That Constitution was framed in an atmosphere of peace and the work took a considerable time but it has been discovered in this particular emergency that legislation is necessary to amend it.  Certain suggestions may be made with regard to the form of the legislation. Article 28 of the Constitution made provision for dealing with an emergency created by war or armed rebellion and there is no doubt that such a provision is necessary in every Constitution. If there is now advice from the legal advisers of the Government that the Article may prove to be defective in the present circumstances, then, undoubtedly, the need for this particular measure arises.  It seems to me that there can be no doubt that there is, in fact, an emergency affecting the vital interests of the State. Not only that but that there is confronting the Government and the people of the country an emergency the ultimate nature of which nobody can foretell.  We are entering now upon unknown country and the problems which will confront us no Government, however wise, and no Parliament, however earnest, can possibly foresee.  We are discovering that the freedom for which we fought so long carries, besides rights, very grave obligations. It may involve not only more work but graver risks to exercise our freedom than were necessary actually <Col N="1018" /> to obtain it.  I agree that neutrality is a desirable thing for this State if it can be preserved and that we should cease to believe, as I think a good many people in the country do believe, we are one of the most important nations in Europe.  In a world war, we are certainly no such thing.  But we have our own problems to solve and it is from the point of view of our own problems and of the interests of our own people that we must have regard to a conflict such as that which is, unfortunately, upon us to-day. Whether in our journey in an unknown and unpredictable state of things we shall be able to preserve our neutrality is, as the Taoiseach said, an entirely different matter. Certain things we must have and certain difficulties we must confront but we really do not know in what direction we are proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Bill proper, we ought to understand and the public ought to understand, exactly what it is the Bill does.  It creates a situation in which, taken with the other Bill which we are to consider to-day, the Government will have immense dictatorial powers.  This Bill places beyond doubt the fact that a citizen will have no right to appeal to the courts against the deprivation of his rights under the Constitution whether the right concerned be that of free speech or any other class of right.  For the preservation of democracy that may, of course, be necessary.  I agree that it is necessary but we should be quite clear as to exactly what we are doing.  We can discuss in detail the powers which the Government propose to take in the Emergency Powers Bill when we come to that measure.  So far as this particular Bill is concerned, it abrogates the Constitution by a simple majority of both Houses. While I agree that it is impossible to write into the Constitution safeguards which will prevent an unscrupulous majority from doing wrong things, still we should, in our circumstances, do the best we can to see that that cannot happen.  When we see in this Bill a provision that a resolution must be passed by both Houses of the <Col N="1019" /> Oireachtas, that means in fact a resolution by one House of the Oireachtas because, under our Constitution and under the Act which creates this House, care has been taken to provide that this House is, in its Party constitution, a reflection of the other House.  The Party which has a majority in the Dáil is bound to have not only that majority but a rather larger majority in this House.  Therefore, the requirement that the resolution has to be passed by both Houses provides no safeguard.</P>
    <P>In the case of this particular Bill Article 51 of the Constitution does give the President a certain right.  I recognise that, in the present emergency, it is not desirable to insert an amendment in the Bill with regard to the type of majority in both Houses which would be necessary for the passing of the resolution but I suggest to the Taoiseach that when there is no emergency and when he is considering&mdash;as we all hope he will&mdash;a permanent amendment of the Constitution, he might consider whether more than a simple majority of both Houses should be necessary&mdash;say, a majority of two-thirds or three-fifths.</P>
    <P>I am very far from saying that that provision would be quite satisfactory but, if the matter is going to be considered, apart from giving extra powers to the President to concur with both Houses before an amendment of the Constitution becomes law, consideration might be given to the question whether more than a simple majority of both Houses should be necessary for the passing of the resolution. The Taoiseach dealt with an amendment to the Bill which can be considered in Committee.  In the meantime, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, it seems to me that no alternative is open to us but to give the Government the powers which they are now seeking and to hope that any group of Irishmen entrusted with these powers will exercise them wisely and that the Oireachtas will have opportunities to discuss the exercise of these powers from time to <Col N="1020" /> time.  Therefore, I intend to support the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>If I voice a dissentient note, I hope Senators will not think that I wish to embarrass the Government in any way.  I realise the responsibility of every member of the House in these grave times and I appreciate the difficulties of the Government, but I am voicing the opinion not of the majority but of quite a substantial section of people in this country who are unhappy about this attitude of neutrality.  The way I put it is this: we are undoubtedly a sovereign State with no obligations to any other country but to our own people.  As a sovereign State I feel sure that we must all of us abhor the causes and regret the causes that have brought about this present conflict.  We must surely&mdash;and I claim that nobody will deny it&mdash;be in sympathy with the democracies in this matter.  If that is accepted, I cannot help feeling that there is a very thin dividing line between our national interests and our national honour.  Unfortunately, I feel this trend of thought is influencing the mind of the Government, in connection with our relations to the British Commonwealth in this matter. The Taoiseach even suggested that our attitude must be in some degree determined by the fact that our country is divided and that that division is maintained by force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do feel that although that consideration is present it cannot override and should not override our responsibilities as a sovereign power, which we are, towards the issues that are involved, issues which I feel we ought to hold to be sacred, to be essential, to the civilisation of the whole world.  It will, I know, be urged that other countries who feel as strongly as we do in this matter of the vital rights of civilisation and democracy are also remaining neutral, but I would suggest that that attitude is determined largely by strategic considerations, and when we come to examine strategic considerations we find that their strategic position is very different from our own.  If the <Col N="1021" /> Government had the courage to come out, as other Dominions have done in this matter, and say: &ldquo;It is not because we are a member of the Commonwealth at all, but because we feel so deeply the issues involved that we are prepared to declare ourselves as siding openly with the democracies,&rdquo; I believe we would do more in that act alone to unite our country and break down the unfortunate barriers that now divide it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the time nor are the conditions such as to demand very long speeches on the Bill before the House.  An Taoiseach is asking in this Bill for greater powers than have ever been conferred upon him before, and he has exercised, I should say, very great powers all through the course of his political career.  He has faced difficulties as many of those who were his colleagues at another time faced difficulties too, but, collectively, we have never faced anything like what the future unfortunately holds for all. Grave as is the situation in the world to-day there must be for An Taoiseach and others in this House a certain measure of satisfaction that we have won for ourselves the right and the power to decide what part we are to play in the days that are ahead, and that we are not dependent on the will of others to decide for us whether we are to fight or not to fight.  There ought to be appreciation of the liberty which in our own day we have secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that this liberty should be preserved for our people and that our nation should be preserved. The manner in which we use these liberties and the discretion and the sanity and calmness with which we approach the problems that confront us are going to determine what the life of this nation in the future will be. We cannot refuse these powers to the Government, whatever our feelings may be about how they are to be exercised.  The liberties which the citizens enjoy under the Constitution are going to be taken from them.  Let us hope that it is in order that they may be preserved for them in the future that they will have to abandon <Col N="1022" /> them now for a short time.  Let us hope that An Taoiseach and those around him will exercise these powers in such a rational, sensible way that there will be no cause for apprehension in the hearts of our people about the conduct of affairs in the future.</P>
    <P>As to the attitude which our country is to adopt and our position in this conflict which evidently has come upon the world, I think there can be no doubt as to what the great bulk of our people think.  When An Taoiseach says that as far as this Government is concerned, they want to keep out of war, I believe myself that there would not be any Government here which would have any other point of view. I am convinced that when An Taoiseach says that, he speaks for the great majority of his country.  Self-preservation is the first law of nature.  While we may have our individual sympathies as to the rights and wrongs, while Senator Sir John Keane has adverted to the fact that we are not doing what a minority here would like us to do, that we are doing as other nations on the Continent are doing for strategic reasons, we can say this for ourselves&mdash;and perhaps few other nations can say it&mdash;that the conditions of the world to-day were made yesterday and the day before, and in the making of these conditions we had very little responsibility, less than any other nation in Europe.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes has said that we are not great and mighty now but I say that the part we are to play in the future is going to depend on the vitality which we display in a policy of neutrality.  I do not like to hear anyone say that we are going to be neutral &ldquo;if we can&rdquo;.  I believe that what we ought to say in the interests of this nation is that we are going to be neutral, that we must be neutral and that we are not going to be drawn into the conflict.  I know it might be argued that if we want to maintain here a standard of life and comfort that we can only enjoy by bringing in commodities from abroad we might be forced to do certain things and to adopt a certain attitude but I believe <Col N="1023" /> it would be far better for us to reduce considerably our standard of living, to go without much that we are enjoying to-day and keep all our people alive. I believe we would be serving the best interests of the nation by doing that than by any other course we might pursue.  Let us hope that all our people will face that path and make their contribution towards achieving that end.  Perhaps by doing that we may make a greater contribution to the reconstruction of the civilisation of Europe, if there is any of it left when this conflagration is over, than by any little way in which we could influence the conduct of the war even if we were prepared to throw our weight in on one side or the other.  An Taoiseach or anybody else at the head of the Government in this country to-day would have to be given these powers.  I would like to think that in exercising these powers An Taoiseach will take into account that there is a great body of people who may have a different point of view as to how these powers ought to be used in the best interests of the citizens. I think myself that there should be consultation and discussion with regard to the use of them but the necessity for doing that is something that cannot be questioned at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The few remarks I propose to make will be confined entirely to the first measure and not to the measure which has not yet reached us, a measure which is of a different nature, and which will be criticised in some respects.  I entirely agree with the Taoiseach when he states that this is exactly the kind of emergency which was envisaged when the Constitution was introduced, and if there is in that Constitution a flaw, in consequence of which we may not be able to deal with this particular kind of emergency, then there is no possible option but to give the Government the powers which are necessary to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like the exact form of the measure, but I am prepared to accept the promise made by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government that within <Col N="1024" /> a reasonable time he will reconsider the provisions of this Bill, and that he will not be satisfied that an amendment introduced hastily in an emergency should necessarily be a permanent part of the Constitution without further consideration.  I think it will be found that it would be possible to safeguard the position, possibly by the method suggested by the Leader of the Opposition to-day by something like a two-thirds majority and not by a bare majority in both Houses.  I agree that that cannot be done hastily.  To introduce hastily now and to draft amendments would possibly serve no useful purpose.  I, therefore, agree that the House should pass this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Baxter when he says that self-preservation is the first law for every State.  I think there are times when you have to be prepared to lose your life in order to save it.  There are times when the State must be prepared to take risks. For my part I do not think this is a war between democracies and a particular form of government.  I think the events of the last few days are such that almost all of us are perfectly clear as to where our sympathies lie.  I have just returned from a visit to two of the most democratic States in Europe and they are going to remain neutral as long as they can.  I have no doubt as to where their sympathies lie.  Nevertheless they do not believe that they can do any good by entering into the war and I do not believe that any purpose of any kind can be gained, no matter how intense our sympathies are&mdash;and I make no secret of my sympathies&mdash; by saying our country is not going to be neutral and that we are going to fight Germany in the war between that country and France and England.</P>
    <P>No matter what we might have felt with regard to the Government in the past, they deserve our support and sympathy in everything they have in hands in the next days, weeks, months or perhaps years for all I know.  It may be that hell is going to be let loose and that the worst that we have been able to conceive may happen.  Or <Col N="1025" /> it may be quite the contrary.  It may be that we may have to undergo a certain amount of economic difficulty which will have to be dealt with.  If the Government use the powers which may be given them as a national Government and use them in friendly consultation, such as they are entitled to and such friendly co-operation as they will get from every section of the community, then there may be no danger to our ultimate position as a democratic State.  But if the Government abuse these powers, the possible damage that can come from them would be worse possibly than if this country had been engaged in the war. Nevertheless, I do not believe&mdash;sympathetic as I might be in some respects to some of the remarks made by Senator Sir John Keane&mdash;that we could be serving this country, the British Commonwealth of Nations or the world by saying &ldquo;we can be neutral but we will not&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill and while doing so I would like to congratulate the Taoiseach and his Government on the calmness with which they have handled this whole situation up to the present.  I believe it was largely because of the example shown by the Taoiseach and his Government that the people as a whole have retained the calmness which is almost inexplicable in the circumstances. I feel proud, too, more proud than on many other occasions, that I am an Irishman and that I have lived to see the day when the members of this House and the members of the Dáil regardless of their political affiliations can rally to the flag of their country when they realise that that flag is in danger.  I believe that the attitude of the members of both Houses of the Oireachtas in this crisis will go out to the world as proof that whatever differences we may have, we all realise that Ireland is ours and that it is our duty to protect her in the hour of danger.  I am not going to go into the statements made or into the arguments put up by Senator Hayes about the majorities in both Houses and the majority in this House being a foregone conclusion.  I think I am <Col N="1026" /> right in saying that, on a few occasions, Government amendments have been defeated here.  However that question does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say that I disagree 100 per cent. with the attitude of Senator Sir John Keane and the views expressed by him as representing certain sections in this country. When the Senator says that very large sections of the people in this country are unhappy about our policy of neutrality, I want to assure the Taoiseach what he already knows, that Senator Sir John Keane represents a very small minority in the country and that that small minority, or at all events a great number of the people who formed that minority, have already left this country to perform what they believe to be their duty.  I want further to assure the Taoiseach that as long as he and his Government pursue that policy of neutrality they will have behind them the overwhelming majority of the plain people of this country.  We all realise the difficulties which may crop up from time to time but the people of the country will welcome the statement made by the Taoiseach on this policy of neutrality.  I am 100 per cent. in agreement with Senator Baxter&mdash;and it is very seldom we do agree in anything&mdash;in his attitude on this problem of neutrality.  I do believe with the backing of the people and the overwhelming majority of the people behind the Government that they will be able to protect the people and to protect that neutrality which is so essential to the well-being of this State.  Some people may expect miracles.  I do not and it is ridiculous to expect that we here in this country can escape altogether the curse which is bound to follow this unfortunate European war.  I believe that we are definitely the happiest country in Europe to-day.  I believe that we are to-day possibly faced with the happiest conditions of any country in Europe. I appeal to all the people with whom I have ever been in contact to take this question up and throw in their weight with the Government.  I am convinced that if the Government get <Col N="1027" /> the support they ought to get, we will maintain our neutrality and come out of this crisis with our country intact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I only intervene for a minute, and I only intervene because it seems to me that most people who spoke did not seem to advert to the Bill we have in front of us. We are talking about neutrality and about the present Constitution.  What happened is this.  When the Constitution was passed it adverted to a thing that might arise&mdash;armed rebellion or a state of war.  A state of war could mean nothing but this, that you are actively belligerent.  The Constitution has now revealed to us a weakness. Without there being a state of war or active belligerency on the part of our country, and without there being armed rebellion, there is a situation in which for the national good it is necessary to give the Government extraordinary powers.  We have a situation now in which we are not at war or actively belligerent because it is impossible for us to be in such a war at present.  Up to the last news that I heard even Great Britain is not at war.  Yet, with Great Britain not at war, and with our country not at war, you can have such extraordinary circumstances that it is necessary for extraordinary powers to be given to the Government.  I think every side of the House realises that these circumstances and what may arise out of them are so extraordinary, and may have such an effect that we must give the Government not merely powers specifically directed to what we know at the moment; but, in order to see that the Government have adequate powers, we have to give them practically unlimited powers.  That is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now changing the Constitution as a permanent thing, although I think the Taoiseach has indicated that when we have more leisure and when we get over the immediate situation he may bring in an amendment changing this amendment.  At the moment, what we are doing is changing our <Col N="1028" /> Constitution, so that in future, until such time within the next two years as the Constitution is again changed for all time, under circumstances which do not involve armed rebellion or active belligerency on the part of the country, a resolution may be passed giving power to abrogate the Constitution. We recognise that, in the peculiar circumstances which we are under, by immediate contact, it is necessary to do that.  We recognise that in the unforeseeable future and the contingencies that it may bring about it may be necessary to do the same thing again.  All this talk about neutrality and the rest of it is, to my mind, completely irrelevant.</P>
    <P>Having protested against that irrelevancy, I want to be irrelevant myself on the same subject.  I do not agree with Senator Sir John Keane in what he says on this question of neutrality, because our geographical position and one thing and another mean that if we wanted to be actively belligerent we cannot be actively belligerent, and if you are not actively belligerent you are effectively neutral.  To my mind then, it is rather useless to argue whether you are neutral or not on the principle of Senator Sir John Keane. I want to say now that if I were a native of Patagonia and not of Ireland I would still desire in such a situation that as large a part of the world as possible should be kept outside the sphere of war.  This modern theory, particularly of what I might call Left Wing people, that if one country is going to fight another, or a few countries are going to fight a few others, automatically you must have a universal totalitarian war, is a doctrine which is diametrically opposed to the well-being of the human race and of civilisation.  First of all, I would desire at almost any price to avoid war; but when war is taking place, the next best thing we can do is to circumscribe the area of activity.  I do not entirely agree with my colleague Senator Baxter in saying that the only way is one of self-preservation.  I think other considerations come in.  But the suggestion that, if you do not uphold that egotistical doctrine, you must <Col N="1029" /> accept the other, that every war is to be universal and totalitarian, is one that I do not accept.</P>
    <P>We are bringing in this Bill because it has been revealed to us that there may be circumstances that were not foreseen by the Constitution when drafted and we have to meet them. That involves giving the Government extensive powers, more powers than we think they need for fear we should give less than they need, so that they will be in a position to provide for the well-being of the people of the country in the circumstances that may come. That is what we are dealing with now. A resolution comes afterwards stating that the circumstances of the moment are such circumstances.  The thing could arise on many other occasions. When the Constitution was going through I remember thinking that if the League of Nations was still operating and sanctions were being applied against England you would have had to have such a Bill as this.  I ask the House to remember that what we are doing now is changing the Constitution to give the Oireachtas power from time to time, when circumstances demand it, to hand over to the Government power to abrogate the Constitution, and to do that even when there are not such circumstances as armed rebellion or active participation in war.  That is what we are doing now, and most of what has been said to my mind is utterly irrelevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the merits of neutrality does not seem to me to be as irrelevant as Deputy Fitzgerald thinks, and I suggest therefore that he may be pardoned for sinning against his own definition of what is relevant and what is not.  The stupendous powers we are going to be asked to hand over to the Government are not powers that would be required by any ordinary neutral.  The amendment put down by Senator Sir John Keane really points to the reason why these powers are being asked for.  He has generalised to the extent of saying that they might reasonably be asked for in a case where any member of the British Commonwealth was involved in <Col N="1030" /> war.  But, in point of fact, these powers would not be asked for in connection with any war in which Great Britain was not involved, and it is because of our very peculiar and intimate relation with Great Britain that these powers are now being sought.</P>
      <P>That fact brings us to consider whether our neutrality is not going to be of a very special and peculiar kind. Now, I quite admit, as a practical politician, that the vast majority of the people of this country are in favour of a policy of neutrality, and that it would not be practicable at present for any Government to follow any other policy than that which the Taoiseach has announced he is going to follow.  Nevertheless, I think the duty lies upon those of us who feel as I do to say whether or not we think that that view on the part of the country is right.  I do not think it is right.  I do not think it is right, even putting it on the narrowest ground of self-preservation, to which Senator Baxter refers.  In my opinion, there is not a single country in the world whose spiritual and material interests are so immediately and overwhelmingly affected by this war as our own. If France, England, and Poland are defeated, everything spiritually that the Irish race has stood for will be defeated too, will perhaps go down into oblivion and destruction.  More than that, this country will be reduced to a state of rags and beggary that it has not known for many centuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been argued&mdash;and that is an argument which has more apparent force in it than anything else which has been said on the subject&mdash;that if we abandon neutrality it will not do any good.  I disagree with that view. I am not suggesting that it would be practicable for us to send an expeditionary force to the Continent; I quite appreciate that our resources would not admit of anything of the kind.  But I do think that our entering into the war would mean a practical co-operation in the defence of the British Isles as a whole, and in the defence of the shipping upon which we <Col N="1031" /> ourselves depend just as much as England, that would be of great value.  Moreover, I think the moral effect of our standing out of the war is bad and that the moral effect of our coming into the war would be exceedingly good.</P>
    <P>I confess I am amazed by the discrepancy between the terms in which Senators and Deputies talk about the position of Ireland at different times, according to the sort of point they are trying to make.  At one moment we are an unimportant little country, tucked away on the fringe of Europe, a country that has no concern in any sort of issues at stake in this war.  At another moment we boast ourselves to be a mother country, a mother country that has sent out her sons to all parts of the world, in particular, and what concerns us in regard to this conflict is, to such countries as America, Australia and Canada, countries in which our attitude is of significance, countries in which our spiritual influence is strong.  If we have a place in history, if we are a mother country, if we always have stood for the ideals of liberty and justice, if there is a special parallel in history between the case of Ireland and the case of Poland, surely this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While agreeing that no other course but neutrality is possible for a Government of this country, with the sentiment of the people as it is, I wish to put myself on record as saying that that sentiment is wrong and some day or other realities are going to change it.  An object lesson is going to be provided that will change it, for this war will have tremendously important effects in regard to everything we hold dear in the spiritual world and on our every hope of prosperity in the material world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Fitzgerald when he says that the question of neutrality is irrelevant. The powers sought in this Bill are powers to enable the Government to do what the vast majority of the people in this country want&mdash;to keep the Irish people neutral.  There is grave danger in this country, and probably in other countries, that sections of the people may be swayed by one sympathy or another and may endeavour to force this country into the conflict.  The powers asked for are powers that the Government need in order to see that the wishes of the vast majority of the Irish people are preserved.  I believe the members on both sides of the House are quite willing that those powers should be given and it is hardly necessary to labour the point any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid I cannot agree entirely with Senator MacDermot.  It is quite <Col N="1033" /> possible a grave misunderstanding might arise as to the attitude of the Irish people in a European conflict. There are in this country people who feel strongly, perhaps, on one side or the other.  We Irish people have a problem of our own to solve and we should be very careful in what way we display our sympathies.  We have portion of our country held against the wishes of the majority of the Irish people and it would be very invidious of the people of Ireland to display any sympathy with any Government in Europe that might endeavour in any part of Europe to preserve the same state of affairs that exists in our own country.</P>

      <P>I want to say on behalf of the Labour Party that we agree to this alteration in the Constitution.  We have heard the Taoiseach give an assurance which makes it somewhat easier to approve of the change.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go further than to say that we are in favour of the alteration in the Constitution because we believe there is going to be a world-wide conflict and however we may wish for neutrality the big powers will not respect our neutrality for very long.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do think it is rather a pity that this whole question of our neutrality and our attitude towards this conflict should come up in this particular way.  There was plenty of time to discuss this question of our attitude towards European countries and Great Britain.  We are now standing on the edge of a most tremendous danger, and I suggest to everybody that the time has passed when it is safe for public men to make elaborate pronouncements about the sentiments of the people of this country or the attitude this country ought to adopt in relation to the terrible struggle that seems to be upon us.  We do not know from one week to another what frightful dangers may arise for this country out of a war of this kind and we do not know what use may be made of speeches and statements that responsible public men may make in <Col N="1034" /> this country on any side in a war of this kind.</P>
      <P>I am not going to make any pronouncement myself, having uttered this warning, because I believe the dangers we have to face may come from any side, and it behoves all our public men to be extremely cautious in everything they say and not let their sentiments or feelings or ideological beliefs draw them into making statements about what the people here ought or ought not to do.  We have met here to-day in order to entrust our Government with very wide and far reaching powers so that they may protect the life of the people of this country in this conflict.  We ought to be extremely cautious, at least from now on, in what we say about anything connected with the conflict that seems about to break upon us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope in the few sentences that I utter I will not go against the advice given by Senator Tierney.  Like Senator Foran and other Senators, I see the seriousness of the amendment which the Taoiseach has put before the Oireachtas, but, like other Senators too, I recognise that the Government have a tremendous responsibility, and that they do not ask for such great powers without considering that they cannot shoulder the responsibilities which rest on them unless they get these powers.  I think in a case like this, while we recognise the gravity of the decision we are making, we must also realise the gravity of the task they have to face, and we must, I think, give them every support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The few remarks I wish to make are rather intended to deal briefly with the background of the legislation which the Taoiseach has put before us. While recognising the danger of arousing opposition so early in my speech, I say at once that I agree with the greater part of what Senator MacDermot said a few moments ago. I do not propose to argue the question at any length, or to follow the arguments he has used but I do in general agree with the line of thought <Col N="1035" /> that he has told us is his, and I suggest that there are certain considerations which some Senators have not borne in mind in making the very pronounced statements that were made to-day.  The Taoiseach has told us, and we approve of it of course, that his first interest and the first interest of his Government is the protection of the immediate interests of the people of Ireland.  The Taoiseach might have gone on to say&mdash;it would have been becoming to him, as it has been in the past&mdash;that he recognises that there are other interests, and that the people of this country have other interests, in no narrow sense. Before the world, in prominent positions, he has maintained other interests, of importance not merely to the people of Ireland but of interest to the people of every country in the world, and he has recognised that when he held a responsible position in Geneva in the past that he had responsibilities which went far outside the constituency of this country which he represented.  I am sure that he has them in mind, although he has not given expression to them to-day in the few remarks he made in his speech as to the background of this legislation.  I make these remarks not to criticise him but to encourage him to keep those considerations in mind perhaps even more fully than the pressure of daily affairs permits him to do with ease.</P>
    <P>Even taking the narrower point of view of the immediate self-centred&mdash;I will not say &ldquo;selfish,&rdquo; as I do not want to use an offensive word&mdash;interests of the people of Ireland, I think it is necessary to consider whether the policy which the Taoiseach has pursued, and of which some Senators have approved very vehemently, is likely to be either a practicable one or a useful one.  Is neutrality likely to be practicable during a war such as, unfortunately, we appear to be on the brink of?  It seems to me to require a good deal of consideration.  The Taoiseach himself has suggested some of the difficulties which are certain to arise.  We are very closely associated, by propinquity, by business <Col N="1036" /> relations, by personal relations, with a country which will be one of the principal participants.  Difficulties will arise on a thousand points of contacts. The Taoiseach has suggested that himself, but he has not dwelt on the point.  I should like Senators to dwell a little further on the matter.  Take for instance the control of shipping, the protection of shipping, the trade between the two countries; is that really likely to be an easier task with a policy of neutrality than with another policy?  I am not giving an answer to that, but I think it is a point which should be seriously considered.</P>
    <P>Is a policy of neutrality likely to help us in any other way?  I do not know, but I do suggest this: The war will not last for ever, we hope.  There will be a future policy for this country.  The future policy of the Taoiseach, if he is still the leader of the country, will be, as it is to-day, to promote the reunion of Ireland.  Will he find that task easier if this country has pursued a line of neutrality during a struggle which has endangered the existence of other States to which we are closely related?  That may be taken as a selfish argument.  I do not mind in what way it is taken; it is an argument of which I am quite sure the Taoiseach cannot afford to lose sight. I am not offering any alternative policy to that which the Taoiseach has declared to be the policy of his Government. I do not know, as he knows, the difficulties that face him, but I do suggest that Senators ought to weigh these matters in their minds and should not keep on repeating the word &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; which may be an impossible dream, and a dream which, if it were to come true, might prove a very bad dream indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I naturally rise in support of this amendment.  In doing so, I do not think that congratulations either for the Taoiseach or the Government are necessary at all.  The course they have adopted was of such an obvious nature that all we might reasonably do is to assure the Taoiseach and the Government of the approval of 90 per cent. of the people <Col N="1037" /> of the country.  I think the Government have adopted a very proper attitude.  We ourselves have been in conflict for many years, many centuries, and none of us can find anything in history to show that any country in Europe went at breakneck speed into war in our support.  We have been left to our own resources at all times, and, now that we are in a position to adopt an attitude of neutrality in regard to all other people who have neither offended nor helped us, I think it is a very proper attitude.  Let us all hope that it will be possible for the Government and the country to maintain that attitude to the end.  Of course, if any country should deem it expedient to invade or attempt to invade our country in any way, I am sure the full resources and man power of this country would be at the disposal of the Government to repel any such movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this amendment, but I feel it my duty to be perfectly frank.  I think everybody here, all sections of Irishmen, should stand behind the Taoiseach and the Government at the present juncture.  Whatever our individual opinions are, or have been in the past, we should give him all the powers that he may want or he does want, because this is a time of extreme danger and gravity, and the situation is changing from hour to hour.  The world is in an hysterical condition, and we want to give our doctors, as it were, full powers to control the patient.  I think we ought to give the Government all the powers and all the encouragement they require.  The Taoiseach said that neutrality did not mean indifference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be straining human nature too much to think that we can view this horrible quarrel, this awful struggle, completely unmoved.  We all have our feelings and our sympathies; we have very strong sympathies certainly with one side&mdash; perhaps with one side and the other&mdash; but I think the majority of our sympathies in this country are with <Col N="1038" /> the peace front.  I hope that nothing will be done to muzzle those opinions and that the efforts of this country will be felt in the world as a compellent and as an effective force to stop the spread of this horrible war and to bring it to an end quickly if possible. I do not see how at the present moment any other course but neutrality is open to the Taoiseach. The opinion of the country at large is in favour of such an attitude.  A minority of individuals&mdash;indeed I possibly am one of them myself&mdash;has a different opinion, but I think we have to face what is possible and not expect miracles.</P>
    <P>I would like to say just one thing more.  I join with those Senators who took exception to that principle of Senator Baxter's that life is the most important thing in a nation.  Any nation that has risen to greatness has learned to risk life and that was the characteristic of this nation where there were vital adventures and spiritual adventures.  Please God, we will always be ready to take risks of that sort.  We cannot say what the morrow will bring us, but I think it is right to give the Government full powers to take whatever steps are necessary and that they should have our support, though it may happen that they will have to take another line before this awful struggle is ended.  Let us stand together, however, behind the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, thinking originally that it would be rather short; but, in view of some statements in which it has been advocated that a country like this should participate in the catastrophe which is about to take place, it rather strikes me as a reason for intervening.  After all, we are a small nation of 3,000,000 people and after generations of fighting everyone's battles but our own we are now faced with the position of responsibility, as a sovereign State, of safeguarding the interests of our country.  It seems to me that it will take all the ingenuity of the Government and the wholehearted co-operation and rigid discipline <Col N="1039" /> of every section of the community behind that Government to help this country to pull through the morass that is facing the world.</P>
      <P>As I see it now, whether we like it or not, our whole commercial enterprises and trade channels are likely to be thrown out of gear; the whole food supplies of our people are likely to be upset and seriously curtailed.  As I see this country in the last 24 hours, the people are not fully alive to the danger and do not appreciate the serious difficulties ahead.  While we are all talking here, Senator McDermot and a few more irresponsible narrowminded people are watching the war and talking about self-sacrifices in the best interests of it.  What is the British Government or any other country going to gain from what they are fighting for?  The whole lot of them have gone mad.  Let us at least show a certain amount of practical commonsense in our own small way.</P>
      <P>Let us ask the people down the country in the different parishes to organise and discipline themselves and to subject themselves without criticism &mdash;I lay emphasis on the words &ldquo;without criticism&rdquo;&mdash;of the efforts of the Government to secure the food supplies and the peace of the country. That is going to take a lot of doing and I think that the only hope of successfully carrying it out is through committees of all Parties in every parish, which should be set up within the next 24 hours.  If we succeed in disciplining ourselves and accepting the dictates of the Government loyally and with full co-operation, we are doing far more to preserve the western flank of Britain, as well as preserve our own security, than we could do by such methods as are advocated by irresponsible people who are asking us to join in the catastrophe which is about to take place.  I sincerely hope that this discipline and loyal wholehearted co-operation will be manifested by our people.  I hope that we shall tell the people the truth and ask them to give us that co-operation in the interests of our own country.</P>

      <P>I feel that I would be wanting in my responsibility and in my duty here as a Senator if I allowed this meeting to terminate without giving my views.  I am very sorry to have listened to some of the speeches in this critical atmosphere in which the country finds itself in the present time. I would rather agree with the terms suggested by Senator McEllin in the closing remarks of his speech.  From time to time over a number of years I have offered criticism to the Government at present in office and to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I offered criticism in another capacity to the Government anterior to the present one.  Now, as a citizen of this State and as a member of this House and as an Irishman, I can visualise the serious and terrible outlook that is before our country and before civilisation.  Those of us my age who lived through the last war saw the terrible and continuing consequences, which are even alive yet, saw the cripples and the economic consequences to the States which were involved as well as to the States which were not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My contribution to-day is this: we have here a Government elected by the people; they have been returned successfully by the considered and serious vote of the people.  I am perfectly sure that, noting the manner of expression and the language used by the Taioseach in the other House to-day and here to-night, anyone could realise the feeling and the temperament and the anxiety that characterised every word that came from his lips.  It appears to me that he too sees the terrible consequences that are facing Europe and the world to-day.  I am perfectly sure that the Executive Council responsible to the people of this country&mdash;we have been told in the other House that they have been sitting day and night; I do not know for how long&mdash;must have examined from A to Z all the consequences and ramifications of the action that they were indicating that the Irish people should take and that they as the elected Government of that people indicated as the best and proper course to pursue in the interests of the <Col N="1041" /> nation.  It is my opinion that Senator McEllin's appeal to-day should be heard, that there ought to be a unification of the forces of this country to stand in these critical days behind the Government in what they consider should be done.  We ought to do that and I, for one, am prepared to give them all my support as an individual unit in this House.</P>

I find that there is nothing very fantastic in the proposal in the Bill, which might have been devised for that purpose somewhat hurriedly.  The Taoiseach referred to the method as not a very practical method of effecting the purpose of limiting the occasions on which these powers would be sought, and, therefore, I do not propose to press the amendment.  I should like to say in view of the Taoiseach's remarks that perhaps there was a misunderstanding. I did not intend that it should give emergency powers to this Government in case of a conflict between any members of the British Commonwealth but with some other person.  We are only giving them permissive powers, and these should be confined only to a conflict when a member of the British Commonwealth was engaged.</P>

      <P>I should like to add a word on the lines of the discussion we have had.  Certain Senators have been accused of irresponsibility.  It is not because they advocated that the Government should abandon the policy of neutrality, because as a matter of fact I think all Senators, with the possible exception of one, agreed that no other policy is practicable for the Government except neutrality, that that is what the country wanted, and that nothing else could be done.  It is not irresponsible to attempt to bring home the realities of the situation to the people of this country.  It is not irresponsible to attempt to show this catastrophe for what it is.  A catastrophe of course it is, but it is not one that we can escape by calling ourselves neutral.  I believe that the best hope of limiting its effects on ourselves is to join France and the Commonwealth <Col N="1043" /> countries.  Nobody here wants wild adventure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>One or two aspects of the general question have not, I think, been adverted to yet.  I refer to them with considerable <Col N="1045" /> diffidence because the last thing I should desire would be to start any kind of acrimonious debate in this critical hour of the nation's and the world's fate.  I, personally, regard the policy of neutrality as the only one possible for us in present circumstances and, therefore, one on which we can unite in supporting the Government. At the same time, there are some aspects of the problem of neutrality of which it would be well to remind ourselves, not so much with reference to the present as with reference to the lessons of the past ten years of European history and in the hope that when a saner world arises&mdash;which may happen in six months or a year's time &mdash;we may learn something from the lessons of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under present conditions, neutrality is the only possible policy one could recommend to a country situated as we are or as Holland is or as the Scandinavian countries are.  But let me remind the House that, if the covenant of the League of Nations had been effectively respected by these nations, big and small, that were members of it and if the terms of that covenant had been lived up to in connection first, with China, later with Abyssinia, later with reference to Spain and Czechoslovakia&mdash;in other words, if the principle of collective security which is part and parcel of the doctrine of the League of Nations was a reality&mdash;neutrality, so far from being an honourable and desirable policy for any nation, big or small, would be the height of dishonour.  The individual, when the public peace is at stake, cannot be neutral when it is a question of helping the forces of law and order to keep the peace.  The individual citizen is bound to use his force on the side of law.  To be neutral in the face of aggression is bad citizenship in the individual.  Similarly, if proper relations existed between States, members of the League of Nations, then neutrality would be a policy which would not be honourable even for the smallest of nations.  It is precisely because that world order, which was attempted to be established at Geneva ten or 15 years ago has been broken up <Col N="1046" /> or destroyed, that we are faced with this world conflict.  Because that world order has been broken up or destroyed, it is not possible for us to maintain, under present circumstances, any other policy than a policy of rigid neutrality.  That does not mean that our sympathies are not deeply engaged on the side of the democratic nations of the west which are now fighting for their own lives because some years ago they were unwilling to put into force the principles of the League of Nations which would have preserved the law of Europe against the beginnings of aggression.  They are now fighting for their own lives and, as a matter of fact, they are fighting for our lives and our interests.  Nevertheless, under present circumstances, neutrality is the only policy we can advocate and recommend.  But the time may come when the question of erecting a new world order will arise.  Then, we should bear in mind the lessons of the past ten years.  One of these lessons seems to me to be that you cannot have the principle of collective security and, at the same time, have the principle of unlimited sovereignty of the nations of the world, big or small.  It is precisely because none of the nations of the world, particularly the big nations, was willing to surrender one jot or tittle of its own unlimited sovereignty to a common international Government of any kind that the League of Nations became a thing of no account and unable to function effectively.</P>
    <P>In future if any kind of world order is to be built up, and there must be such an order, there must be a willing surrender on the part of big nations as well as on the part of small nations of some of their sovereignty.  If in the future any kind of world order is to emerge it will have to be regarded as just as irrational and as immoral for a single nation, big or small, to maintain a private army for its own private quarrels as it would now be regarded for an individual citizen in any State to maintain a private army for his own purposes.  In other words, armed forces in the future will have to be at the disposition not of national law but <Col N="1047" /> of international law.  To give effect to that it would be necessary to bring into the comity of European nations that great Republic of the West, the American Republic, whose failure to co-operate in the work of the League of Nations was, in the first place, one of the reasons why that League was not able to be an effective success.  I do not in the least know how to go about bringing that result about, but in the new social order, in the new world order, American co-operation will be absolutely necessary if any kind of world order is to be maintained or established.  I do think that Ireland, small as she is, does occupy a big position in the spheres of spiritual and moral values and we will be making a large contribution to the world if we throw our weight in the direction of promoting world order, a work in which we and America will play an honourable part.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think members of the Seanad will understand that we are asking here for very exceptional powers&mdash;powers that no democratic Executive would think of asking for except in an emergency such as we contemplate at the moment.  In the <Col N="1048" /> Dáil remarks were made somewhat to the effect that we were ending the Constitution, and so on, by what we were doing, and I tried to point out that, as a matter of fact, we were implementing the Constitution, except in one particular regard, which I mentioned here to-day, and that is by defining a time of war in, perhaps, a wider sense than some legal men might consider reasonable or correct. In the Constitution, provision is made for annulment of the protective powers for the individual and so on, in a time of emergency or the emergency of war; and although we ourselves are not dragged, or hope we will not be dragged, into this war, I think I mentioned, when Senator Baxter found fault with the phrase &ldquo;if at all possible&rdquo; that what I meant was that, in our own interests, we might have to defend ourselves and might have to abandon our neutrality in order to defend our own interests: that it was not a question of our own will in the matter, but that a situation might arise in which we would have to defend our own and national interests.  That is one case in which we might have to pass from the position of neutrality, which we hope to maintain, into active belligerency, but even as a neutral State we shall still need these powers to protect the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dáil there was a great deal of criticism as to whether the Executive needed these powers in the very wide form in which they are proposed to be given here.  This measure is really proposed as a result of the deliberations of a committee that has been sitting for a considerable time.  As you all know, the possibility of war and a situation such as now exists could have been envisaged by anybody, and naturally, of course, it was envisaged by us, for a considerable time past, as being possible.  We set up a committee to examine the whole question and to inquire into the matter of what powers might be necessary to protect the interests of the State if this particular type of emergency arose, and the powers that were set down there in a general form were all felt to be necessary.  They were not set down <Col N="1049" /> for political reasons by members of the Government, for example, regarding themselves as politicians or as members of a political Party.  In the first instance, they were set down by officers of the State who have no political affiliations and who were only considering the possibilities as to the various questions that might arise in a time of war.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, these powers are very wide, and there is not the slightest doubt that they could be abused by an unscrupulous Executive that tried to take advantage of the particular circumstances to put themselves in a position in which they would be able to ignore the ordinary methods of democratic control.  I think it is not necessary to assure the Seanad that there is no such intention whatever on the part of the present Government. I think we have been sufficiently long in office, and I think our attitude towards democratic control is sufficiently known, to dispel any suspicions of that sort.  If the Seanad were to approach this matter from the point of view of suspicion of the Government and try to limit the powers of the Government to do wrong, they might very well succeed in preventing the Government, not alone from doing wrong, but from doing right and from doing their duty towards the State.</P>
    <P>I began to fear, at the end of the discussion in the Dáil, that, in giving way and making changes, in order to meet suspicions such as were evidenced by the remarks made from the Opposition Benches, we might very well reach a position in which the purposes for which this Bill was originally designed might not be met at all and that we might find ourselves, in a case of necessity, in such a position that we would not be able to do the work that a Government has to do in times like this&mdash;work that the Constitution itself recognised has to be done by a Government.  Practically every democratic Constitution has a clause for its own abrogation in the case of an emergency of war or a warlike situation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Seanad, then, to please <Col N="1050" /> remember these broader considerations. I think there is no way in which, by trying to impose all such limitations as were suggested in the Dáil, you could actually limit the power to do wrong, and the variety of circumstances that exist and might arise is such that you would have to have a very extensive code of regulations to specify all the things that you wanted not to be done and a lot of other things that you wanted to have done.  However, I think that the Seanad would have the same misgivings as were expressed by members of the Dáil, and I think that the amendments we have accepted in the Dáil&mdash; which, I understand, you have not yet got, but which will be circulated to you &mdash;should relieve considerably any uneasiness with which members of the Seanad may face the giving of these very wide and extensive powers that are suggested should be given to the Executive in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is really, in the main, a Committee Stage Bill, and in Committee you will have an opportunity of dealing with the various clauses, and I do not think it is necessary to go over them in detail in a Second Reading speech.  You will notice that there are general powers given and that then, as it were, specific instances are set forth.  As a matter of fact, these specific instances need not be given at all.  The wide powers that are sought for will probably be sufficient to cover them all, but the fact that these instances were specified and mentioned gave rise to discussion in the Dáil. I think, however, that the general powers which are sought would cover them all and that they need not have been mentioned.  We thought, however, that it might be necessary to indicate the type of circumstance that might arise or the type of procedure that might have to be adopted and we thought it was well to give these particular instances.  Again, however, I say that they are only particular instances and that they are covered, in the main, by the more general clauses in the Bill.  We could have taken these general clauses and not have given these particular instances at all, but <Col N="1051" /> we felt that the Bill would be a more educative Bill, so to speak, by having all these particular instances set forth.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need say more except to recommend the Bill to the Seanad and to ask you, if possible, to pass it without amendment, because if there is any considerable amendment of it, or indeed any amendment of it, we shall have to go back to the Dáil with it. I do not say that if you think it should be amended in any important respect, you should simply, because of the question of time, refrain from putting forward such amendment, but I would ask the Seanad to bear in mind that if any amendments are passed here, their adoption will necessitate a further meeting of the Dáil and will prolong the sittings very much more.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down there is a matter which I should like to communicate to the Seanad.  It was my intention to mention it in the Dáil but, unfortunately, the Dáil ended rather suddenly and when I got there it had finished its sitting.  On Thursday last the German Minister called on me to find out what was likely to be the attitude of the Government in the event of a European War.  I referred him to a statement which I had made back in February indicating what the aim of Government policy was.  The Minister said that the German attitude towards our country in case of war would be peaceful and that it would respect our neutrality.  I replied that, as far as we were concerned, we wished to be at peace with Germany as well as with other States.  An agreed communiqué was to be issued to the Press, and I think that communiqué has been issued to the Press now.  I just want to explain that I intended to make the statement I have just made now in the Dáil and as it may appear in the announcement in the Press that I had made that statement in the Dáil, members of the Oireachtas might be puzzled.  As I say I had intended to make it to the Dáil had the House not adjourned before the time I anticipated. I want to make it clear that the fault is mine and not the fault of the <Col N="1052" /> newspapers.  It was agreed that this communiqué should be issued to the Press.  I do not think there is anything further I have to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quite clear that the Taoiseach was merely communicating <Col N="1053" /> the matter to the members of the Oireachtas simply because he desired that they would know of the matter before it appeared in the Press.  It is quite clearly a matter that cannot be discussed now.  With regard to the Bill itself, at this hour of the morning one can be brief.  There can be no doubt as to the existence of an emergency and there can be no doubt as to the necessity of the Government here, like Governments in other places, getting special powers.  The question is whether the powers should be oppressive to the ordinary citizen.</P>
      <P>It is rather a question of how the powers are going to be administered rather than one of the precise provisions that are contained in the Bill. As the Taoiseach has said, the necessity has not been a sudden one.  There has been a considerable amount of time to consider what should be put into the Bill but I think it is characteristic of the Civil Service that they want to provide for every possible emergency.  It is interesting, for example, to note that the Bill, although published after the British Bill, did not contain certain safeguards for the ordinary citizen which were inserted in the British Act, such, for example, as the amendment which has now been accepted in the Dáil and which was suggested to the Taoiseach yesterday, making it clear that this Bill will not be used for the purpose of imposing either general military service or industrial conscription.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as we have it now, or rather as we hope to have it in a few minutes when we get the amendments from the Dáil, is a more acceptable measure than the Bill that was presented to the Dáil.  I think the discussion in the Dáil, although it was a long one, in one sense was a much more desirable discussion and much more helpful to the Government, and to the people generally, than any discussion could have been under a time table or what is classed a guillotine motion.  It is satisfactory, for example, that the Bill does now contain, as a result of the discussion in the Dáil, a proviso that it cannot be used to impose conscription <Col N="1054" /> or used for the abrogation of ordinary labour conditions or rights. Apart from the general difficulty that has been mentioned, it is quite clear, from all experience, that you might have regulation and perhaps very stringent regulation with regard to food supplies and hoarding.  In time of war and stress, when there is a great deal of talk about sacrifice, I think it is the business of the Government, and that it is the unanimous desire of each House of the Oireachtas, that that sacrifice should be as evenly distributed as it can possibly be.</P>
    <P>It is not, of course, possible to put a person with a small amount of money on the same footing as a person with a great deal more money but, at the same time, with regard to essential services and food, it is right to see that the burdens or the privations resulting from a war situation do not fall more harshly upon the poor and upon persons with lower incomes and lower wages, than upon more fortunately placed citizens.  For that reason some parts of this measure, at any rate, are very necessary.</P>
    <P>There are a good many points which can be raised in Committee, the question of censorship for example.  It seems to me that very much will depend upon the type of person appointed to discharge that particular duty.  In the administration of the Bill, and in the general conduct of its provisions, it appears to me that it would be easier to accomplish all that it is desired to accomplish, by a moderate exercise of the powers given under it rather than by taking extreme or panicky measures.  It was agreed in the Dáil that the Bill would be administered so as to involve the smallest possible disturbance to the ordinary processes of trade.  If that be done&mdash;and I am confident it will be done&mdash;the Bill is likely to get public acceptance and it is worth going a very considerable distance to get public acceptance of a measure like this. I know that no Ministers of any Government are enthusiastic about sittings of Parliament but I should <Col N="1055" /> like to suggest that, in the operation of this measure, while it might impose a little extra labour on Ministers who are already working hard, it would be of advantage to call the Dáil and Seanad together.  That would impose a greater strain on Ministers, in one sense, but, on balance, that course would be of assistance to them and to the public.  If the Dáil were called together before the date to which it now stands adjourned and if the business of discussing regulations made under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, could be discharged in the same temper and with the same reasonableness as was displayed in the Dáil and which, I am sure, would be displayed here, then very considerable good, publicly, would result.  We can leave over other matters for consideration until we come to the Committee Stage. Meantime, the Bill on Second Stage should, certainly, be accepted.</P>

      <P>I have not got the amendments made to the Bill in the Dáil.  The Taoiseach stated that the first part of Section 2 gives wide. general powers and that the other part merely gave instances.  Do the amendments affect part 1 of that section?  If they do not, they cannot amount to anything because that part will be still operative and it provides that the Government may make such regulations as it thinks fit.  That is surely the operative part of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I have heard no reasons to justify the extreme haste with which this measure is being passed into law and I think that there is very considerable danger in that haste.  When I saw the original proposal for a time-table, I was seriously disturbed as to the reactions it might have in the country.  I think that the <Col N="1056" /> Government has been very wise in giving way on that point and allowing the free debate we are having here to-night.  What I am concerned about is the virtual abrogation of Parliament once this measure is passed. There is very considerable danger in that.  If I myself were a Minister, I should resent the necessity for having all these matters discussed, perhaps in an injudicious way, but I think we must admit that Parliament, in spite of its irrelevancy and waste of time, is of very great value in the reassuring of public opinion.  I wish the Government had found it possible to be more deliberate in its procedure in respect of this measure.  They could have introduced certain urgent sections straight away by means of legislation and very much reduced the volume of orders that will now be necessary.  In fact, after this measure becomes law, there will be no legislation at all.  It would have been possible to take powers in regard to urgent matters, like censorship and control of commodities, in a fairly extensive measure and limited the numbers of orders.  These questions of arrest and detention&mdash;which I consider the most disturbing features of this measure&mdash;could have been taken separately in view of the fact that the Government have very considerable powers in the Offences Against the State Bill to deal with matters of that kind.  At this stage, I suppose all we can do is ask the Government to summon the Dáil and Seanad to consider specific orders of a non-urgent character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have put down an amendment which I do not consider very suitable or scientific so far as the wording is concerned, but I feel that two courses are open.  One course is to collect the non-urgent matters in which there might be considerable danger, such as currency and acquisition of securities There cannot be any great urgency about these matters and I know and the House knows the danger there might be if the public got alarmed or uneasy about them.  It would be a great safeguard to the public if these matters were to be dealt with by direct and specific resolution only after <Col N="1057" /> debate and endorsement.  Failing that, they should not come into force until the resolution is endorsed by the Oireachtas.  Another matter which deserves serious consideration is the residual effect of these resolutions. The principle of these Orders will impregnate the whole life of the country.  They may be made in a time of war but they will not cease immediately the war is over.  I think that we should have an assurance from the Government that any resultant effect of these Orders will be subject to normal peace-time legislation when the occasion arises.  Otherwise, I can see the danger of exceptional measures, which were only intended to apply to a war period, becoming part of our peace-time existence.  Other matters I can raise on Committee Stage but I entreat the Government to set a due value on the power of Parliament and, although it may seem a waste of time, to do as the British have done and take Parliament into their confidence, however great a nuisance it may be to the administration.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will admit I think that as I have said, earlier to-day, he is asking for extraordinary powers.  He can have no complaint about the attitude of either Chamber in their generosity and in their desire to be helpful in the situation which confronts the country.  I would urge on the Taoiseach that there is very good reason for harkening to the suggestion of Senator M. Hayes that if the country is to be kept calm and solid under the conditions which a world war will create for all of us, the best way by which the Taoiseach will achieve that end will be by taking the people into his confidence occasionally through their elected representatives.  All sorts of restrictions are to be imposed upon the decent, industrious, thrifty citizens of the State.  It may be that it is true that it is to their own interest <Col N="1059" /> and with an eye to the future, but it is difficult to convince the hardworking, decent, thrifty and industrious citizens that that is so.  It is easy enough to make people restless and distrustful.  Whatever may be said against criticisms and opposition in a Parliament, these fulfil a very vital function in the life of the people. Because subconsciously or in some way they operate in the minds of the Government.  I am convinced myself that the arguments of the Opposition carry weight with the Government and very often make them shape their policy in the direction suggested by these arguments rather than to the course which they would steer if these arguments were not advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government by decrees is a very simple thing in one way but it is much more difficult to carry the people along with you than it would be with the advantage of having the matter discussed here in Parliament.  In this matter of government by decrees there is no consultation with anybody except with the staffs of the Minister's Department, perhaps only to a limited degree with their own supporters and perhaps not at all with the other representatives of the people.  I do not think that would be satisfactory at all.  As regards the powers which the Taoiseach is asking for here and which he is going to receive, the position may arise by which the operation of these powers is going to create difficulties of a far-reaching character.  None of us know what sort of reaction there would be on the part of people to these things because we did not have experience of them hitherto.  I think the Taoiseach ought to guard against any possible developments like that.  The Taoiseach is convinced that the Oireachtas can be trusted and that they will be ready to help.  If a spirit of co-operation is invited that will be forthcoming.  The right way to get that co-operation is by asking for it from the members of the Oireachtas.  If he is not prepared to do that, obviously there should be contact with the elected representatives of the people through whatever machinery may be devised to have <Col N="1060" /> those contacts made available.  There are certain other things arising out of the consideration of these matters.  It is possible that certain sections may not be made operative or that the necessity for that may not arise.  But if the worst happens in Europe, this Bill as a whole will take the place of the ordinary law.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce recently indicated that we here may have experience of a rather disconcerting nature.  We are going to have unemployment in certain industries and general dislocation of our economic life, a dislocation which at the moment it is not easy to realise. I believe that ordinarily if we had Parliament meeting and problems like that dealt with, we would have suggestions made as to how these problems could be met.  Parliament will not be meeting but I would urge that in anticipation of a situation like that developing, the responsibility is on the Government to sit down and plan to meet such a position as inevitably will have to be faced by the country.  All sorts of businesses will be disorganised and perhaps thousands of people will be put out of employment.</P>
    <P>It will not be sufficient for the Government merely to govern by decree in a sort of negative way. There must be a definite, positive plan as to how the economic life of the country will not only be held intact but will be strengthened.  The Government must have some sort of plan.  It must be a sound plan and it must proceed on sane and normal lines. How exactly the Ministry is to have that advice and criticism without Parliament meeting is beyond me to suggest at the moment.  But I am convinced that if we have not the people behind the operation of these laws there will possibly be much unrest. The Government must meet by anticipation and planning the new conditions which will arise.  It will be found that a great many people will be leaving their employment.  The Government must be able to turn the activities of these people into profitable directions wherein their labour can be employed.  If we are giving these powers to the Ministry to operate them <Col N="1061" /> in the way they want to operate them it must be expected that the Government will be prepared to meet such a situation as that.</P>
    <P>There are various questions which will arise on the sections to one or two at least of which I would like to refer. With regard to the position of neutrality, on which we are all united, I feel that even there again, if it be possible, the Government ought to take positive action, to get into communication with those other states in Europe whose policy in this international conflict, if it comes, is apparently to be the same as our own. If a great country like Italy is not to be in the world war, we should immediately make contact with her and with all the other neutral states on the Continent so that we could collectively galvanise into action all the forces in Europe and throughout the world that want peace rather than war.  The leaders of the neutral states should, as far as possible, have a concrete policy, a thought-out plan, as to how war can be confined to the least number of states.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, I think, on consideration, will realise that, in the interests of our own people here, it is essential that they be carried along with the Oireachtas in the operation of this measure.  We are rather suspicious, doubtful even, when people who are politicians are attempting to legislate for people in this sort of way, that they are meaning to do the right thing. I think the people must be kept informed. There need not be much discussion of questions that might be dangerous to combatants outside but in connection with Orders which would be made and any references to our economic life, I think the more discussion there is and the more reasons which can be put before the public the more co-operation you will get from the public as a whole.  I think the right way for the Taoiseach to secure that end is by getting Parliament to meet as frequently as it is possible for him to do so.  I believe that if that were done much of the labour that would fall to Ministers could be lessened because you would <Col N="1062" /> get the co-operation, not only of the political parties, but of the people of the country as well.  That is what the country will require most in the days ahead when calm and steadiness and resolution will be necessary and when it will be desirable that we should all pull together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not rise at all this time in the morning if it were not that I have a somewhat different point of view from that which has been expressed. I think probably I am in a minority of one as far as this House is concerned.  On the last Bill I expressed my approval because I believed that it was necessary to give extensive and wide powers to the Executive.  I made it clear then that I was supporting that Bill.  In spite of all that has been said, I am not convinced that the method adopted in the second Bill is the right one.  I cannot agree with the Taoiseach that this is implementing the Constitution.  It is quite true that the Constitution envisaged a possibility of abnormal powers.  The Constitution did not say &mdash;or at any rate I cannot see it in it &mdash;that complete democratic totalitarian powers should be given to the Executive as soon as an emergency arose.  In my opinion, certain powers are essential.  I believe it is necessary to deal with people entering the country.  I believe it is absolutely essential to deal with the distribution of food and raw materials and various other materials.  I believe a good many of the powers which are mentioned in this Bill are necessary.  I do not believe that it is necessary or wise to immediately give the complete and absolute powers that are provided in Section 2, sub-section (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that if those powers, which include, as far as I can see, every type of executive and legislative function, are to be given, they ought not be given under a Party system to a Party Government.  They should only be given to a national Government.  Even then, they should only be given when there is no other way out.  I do not want to develop this at any length.  I hold the view very strongly that in an emergency one ought not embarrass <Col N="1063" /> those responsible.  I only give these views because they are my deliberate, considered and honest opinions.  I am not going to press them further than that.  I think some day we may be sorry they went so far.</P>
    <P>Having expressed those views, I would like to say this: The powers given may be exercised on every occasion by the Executive.  They should be exercised only when the normal method of parliamentary procedure is not suitable.  I would like to suggest to the Executive, seriously suggest to them that, although they are getting these complete totalitarian powers, on every occasion when it is possible and wise they should not use them; they should use the ordinary machinery of legislation even though they could legislate in the same way by decree and, by that means, should maintain as far as is possible the parliamentary system and establish the totalitarian system as little as possible.</P>
    <P>I believe, further, that in the control and distribution of commodities it is absolutely essential that existing trade, labour, employers' and industrial organisations should be taken fully into consultation.  I would go further and say, subject to a policy specifically laid down by the Government, I think, as far as possible, the actual administration might be handed over to other bodies where that is feasible.  I think in many cases existing trade organisations, with the additional powers that the Minister has, and with his guidance, could undertake a good deal of the work and in a case of an emergency, with their expert knowledge, do it better even than the best civil servants.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer because I think it comes under the powers of this Bill. I would like to refer to the question of insurance.  I think the Government, at a very early date, should give consideration to the question of insurance for war risks on property.  To the best of my belief, it is impossible to obtain that, at any price as far as property is concerned and, as far as transit is <Col N="1064" /> concerned, only at a rate which is high and which may easily become abnormally high.  I think if our industries, including agriculture, are to continue with confidence, some kind of insurance will have to be devised.  We are not a large enough country to have mutual insurance, but we might combine the idea of mutual insurance with some kind of Government action.  I am convinced, as the Taoiseach has made perfectly clear, that the Government will do their utmost to maintain neutrality, but we have to face the possibility that it may not be possible. There is uneasiness, and I think if some kind of insurance could be devised it would go a long way to creating confidence and preventing dislocation in certain industries.  I am not speaking now on this matter for myself. I am speaking after consultation with other responsible people who, I know, are exceedingly uneasy.  I wanted to register my own honest opinion that it was not necessary immediately, and possibly might never have been necessary, to take all the powers in this Bill.  I am content with placing on record my own view.  Once the Bill is passed and the powers are taken, I will take an attitude of complete loyalty to the Executive, in so far as I believe they are acting rightly, and I believe that every citizen should do the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am most concerned about is the manner in which the orders and regulations made under this Bill, particularly as regards the live-stock trade, will be carried out.  My principal object in rising is to try and get an assurance from the Minister that before these orders will be put into force he will set up a consultative council to advise him on these matters.  Some of us who were engaged in the export of live stock during the Great War and during the economic war know of the many injustices which were caused through not having a consultative council such as I suggest the Minister should set up. In the licensing period during the economic war we know how some people suffered from the regulations made by the Government at that time. During the Great War shipping was at <Col N="1065" /> a premium, and space in the boats during some of these years was worth as much as £3 a beast.  All these things would not be known to anyone except people who have experience and practical knowledge of how the business is worked.  For that reason I impress on the Minister that, before these orders and regulations with regard to the shipping, particularly, of live stock, are put into operation he would set up such a council to consult with the Minister as to the best means of carrying them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there is anything that has arisen that requires any special remarks from me now.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will take charge of the Committee Stage and will probably meet the particular points of detail that may be raised.  The question of urgency was raised in the Dáil&mdash;I mean the question of summoning the Dáil and Seanad by telegram and trying to get this put through in a single sitting.  Some members blamed us for not having called the Dáil earlier, and others for calling the Dáil now and trying to put this through, saying that there was no need for any particular speed.  We were naturally in touch with the international situation. As Minister for External Affairs it was my business to be in as close touch as it was possible for me with any information I was able to get and, as I said in the Dáil, until the guns began to speak in Poland I still had hopes, and I think there were others in responsible positions, and who were in touch with the situation, who had similar hopes, that war might at the end be averted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had asked the Dáil to consider this before the emergency was upon us, I have no doubt that all sorts of questions would have been asked, such as, &ldquo;Why do you want these powers now?  Why not wait until the emergency occurs?  We will not arm you with these powers in advance.&rdquo;  Now, when we come to you within a short time of the possibility of the actual emergency that we are anticipating being in existence, we are told, &ldquo;You can delay further.&rdquo;<Col N="1066" /> In summoning the Dáil and the Seanad at the time, I feared that before the Dáil and the Seanad had discussed this Bill we would actually find ourselves in a position in which, for the safety of the State, we should already have made certain orders under these Bills.  A number of orders are, in fact, in draft.  Once this Bill is passed they are ready for signature.  For instance, if Great Britain was at war&mdash; because that is the sort of circumstance which will most affect us immediately anyhow&mdash;some of these powers which are provided for should be in the hands of the Executive.  Consequently, we had to choose between summoning the Dáil, finding there was no necessity for taking the powers and being opposed in a more suspicious way than we have been by members of the Dáil, and waiting.  We had to wait, and I think that we were justified in waiting until the last possible moment, because there is no doubt that a sitting like this does cause a certain amount of public excitement.</P>
    <P>If the Government were to give advice to the public at the moment, it would be not to change their present mode of life until they are directed to do it by the Government, until the necessity for it has clearly arisen, because the less dislocation there is, the less attempt there is to anticipate the future, the better we will be able to pass into the new set of circumstances with the greatest safety to the community as a whole.  Sittings like this do excite the public, and if there was no need, then there would be a great deal of public loss.  Consequently we were anxious not to look for these powers if the actual emergency contemplated did not take place.  On the other hand, having delayed to the last possible moment, when, so far as we could see, nothing but an absolute miracle could stop the war, we felt that we had to act at once.  That is the explanation of the manner in which this is being introduced.</P>
    <P>With regard to the way in which the powers will be exercised, I think I can assure the Seanad, as I assured the Dáil, that the considerations which <Col N="1067" /> have been very properly put forward by a number of the members of the Dáil will be the considerations which we will have in mind.  Certain examples were brought up in the Dáil.  We were asked for a decision in particular cases.  Really, in regard to a particular instance, without consideration of the circumstances you cannot decide straight off what particular line you will take.  I will give an example.  I was asked in the Dáil whether the reports of the Dáil and Seanad would be censored.  My first impression was, because it would be the foremost idea in mind: &ldquo;No, we will not; the Dáil and the Seanad are privileged and it would be rather strange to be using these powers to censor the publication of expressions of opinion in the Dáil and Seanad.&rdquo;  But one of my colleagues pointed out to me immediately &mdash;I think it was the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;&ldquo;What would happen if one of the members of the Dáil or Seanad gave information which was of a type that would damage the State.&rdquo;  Supposing that information was that we had not supplies of essential materials, for instance, of a military character or something of that sort.  Information of that sort might immediately endanger the State.  Obviously, there should be some means by which that damage would not be done to the State&mdash;by which the State would be saved from the damage that would be done.  That was a case, for instance, of an attitude of mind leading to a very hasty conclusion as to what would happen.  The moment, of course, that the opposite consideration, which would occur to anybody dealing with that situation, was put forward, I would have to balance the two, and try to get the best possible means which would enable, in the first instance, the rightful expression of opinion to be published, and, on the other hand, see that any positive damage to the State would not be done.  You may have to provide some special machinery to try to make a compromise between the two&mdash;to try to save, as far as possible, the freedom of expression of opinion in the Dáil and Seanad and at the same time save the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" /> I think it would be the same about a number of other questions that may be raised here.  If we were asked what is our intention, we could give in general terms what our general attitude of mind will be, but there may be some particular means of safeguarding the State which would operate, and which would make it necessary to set aside the general attitude from which those problems might be approached. Naturally, we do not want to interfere with private enterprise.  Members of other Parties may not agree, but I think we have tried as far as possible not to interfere with private enterprise. We have tried to do our best, and we have only interfered where it became, in our opinion anyhow, necessary in the general interests of the community as a whole to interfere in that particular way.</P>
    <P>Before I finish, I want to assure the Seanad that our attitude in approaching those matters would be very largely the attitude of members who have spoken here in regard to the circumstances that should be borne in mind in the operation of those powers, and, insofar as it is possible to summon the Dáil and Seanad to give them an opportunity of discussing those matters, that will be done.  I have only, however, to plead here, as I did in the Dáil, for a recognition of this fact, that at the outset in an emergency such as we are contemplating there will be work of an Executive character that will engage the attention of Ministers practically day and night for a considerable period.  So many problems will arise for solution, so much work will have to be done, that it would be almost impossible, humanly speaking, for the members of the Executive to be in attendance at the Dáil and do the Executive work at the same time However, it may not be as bad as I anticipate.  If it is not, there is no doubt whatever that it would be helpful both to the Ministers and in regard to their work itself&mdash;because we get, very often, helpful and constructive criticism&mdash;and also in regard to keeping public opinion behind the Ministry in the measures which it has to take.  Everybody recognises the importance of that.  I, for one, believe <Col N="1069" /> there is no better way of keeping public confidence than for Ministers who are satisfied that what they are doing is in the public interest to get an opportunity in Parliament to meet criticism and to show why it is they are adopting such measures.  That consideration will be clearly borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I may not speak any more on this measure to-night, and I want to say that, as far as I am concerned, I have no reason to complain of the manner in which we have been met by Parliament in this matter.  I should like to repeat here what I said in the other House, and that is that I am myself a firm believer&mdash;and I think every member of the Government is also a firm believer&mdash;in democratic institutions.  I believe that, in the long run, they serve the interests of the community better than any other form.  Other forms may give temporarily better results, but, taking it over a long period, the democratic form is more suitable, and is in the long run best for the community as a whole.  I would certainly be the last person to do anything under powers of this sort ultimately to endanger democratic institutions. In fact the aim is to make sure that they are saved.  I think everybody who has studied the history of democracies will recognise that they can be lost by not having them sufficiently elastic in a period of crisis to dispense with their own forms.  I think that is true.  I think even Senator Douglas would agree with me that history has shown that democracies have very often been lost because they have not been able to defend themselves on account of the forms which they have not been ready to abandon in the case of a crisis&mdash;a crisis in which those forms became really a burden and a menace to the community as a whole.  I think I can finish by recommending the Seanad to give us this Bill, and with as few amendments as possible.</P>

      <P>In regard to sub-section (2) (a), what I feel about this matter is that the control of bulk commodities is a comparatively simple matter, and that, in any case, it is to a certain extent out of our hands; we may find ourselves in the position of having to put up with what we can get.  But what is serious, and what I feel should have been attended to before now, is the control of the consumers' side of it.  I do not think the Government can really put up any good defence as to why preparations are not far advanced in that direction.  This morning I understand there were queues of people in shops struggling to buy undue and excessive quantities of goods, and it was only through the good sense and goodwill of the suppliers that large quantities were not sold.  Surely, by now the Government should have the rationing system cut and dried.  The ration cards should all be ready, and above all, machinery for petrol control should be ready to put into operation to-morrow.  By that I mean that every car should have a ration, and that on that ration card the quantity should be stated, after examining the claims of the owner as to the quantity with which he may justly be supplied, and that it should be an offence for any garage owner to supply a greater quantity than that prescribed at any given time; orders to be made from time to time increasing or alternatively decreasing the quantity.  I do feel that, unless the Government can tell us that that is ready, considerable blame attaches to <Col N="1071" /> the Government for not having all that cut and dried by now, because that, to my mind, is the most serious end of the control of commodities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the ordinary necessaries of life are concerned&mdash; sugar, tea, bread, butter, meat, flour and poultry&mdash;it is not anticipated that any rationing system will be necessary at present or for a considerable time to come.  There are adequate stocks of these goods in the country, sufficient to meet our requirements for a considerable period into the future.  It is only if there should develop circumstances which we do not foresee or anticipate, that any control of the distribution or consumption of these articles would be necessary.  In our view, it is only in relation to petrol that any immediate regulation would be necessary, and so far as petrol is concerned, we are in a position to bring a system of control into operation forthwith on receipt of the necessary powers from the Government under this measure.</P>
      <P>A lot of the excessive purchasing of stocks by individual householders, which the Senator referred to, was due to a misunderstanding of the position by members of the public.  The people who have, in fact, acquired quantities of sugar, tea, butter or other commodities, have gained nothing.  There will be no necessity to restrict supplies of most of these commodities for a long time to come.  So far as sugar is concerned, we are in a position to see our way for 12 months ahead, and if we can increase the production of beet in this year to enable the Sugar Company to supply the full requirements of the home market, there need at no time be any limitation of the supply of sugar, no matter how long the emergency may last.  So far as tea is concerned, there are considerable stocks in the country, and there should be no difficulty in obtaining supplies. In respect to other commodities, we are, of course, producers in sufficient quantities to supply far more than our own needs.</P>

      <P>On this question of petrol, the Minister says he has the <Col N="1072" /> machinery to deal with it.  Has he considered the individual aspect?

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane's remarks seem peculiar to me, because he just accused the Government of indecent haste in bringing in this legislation and at the same time he tries to force an atmosphere of panic on the Government in regard to the distribution of foodstuffs.

      <P>Do not let us get into these small petty debating points. My suggestion was that the Government should have got the machinery ready, which is a totally different thing.  On Section 2 (c), I would like to ask the Minister in what respect his present powers are really inadequate.  As far as I know, he has almost at present totalitarian powers in the matter of control and regulation of the imports of commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the exports of commodities are concerned, we have very few powers at all, and it clearly will be necessary to regulate exports of a number of commodities which are essential for various purposes here, and which must be regulated in connection with any arrangements which may be made with other countries for the interchange of goods.  So far as the regulation of imports are concerned, that also will be necessary for more reasons than one.  I think it is quite clear that should an emergency develop in which the available imports will be limited we would have to eliminate some commodities and class others as luxuries, and the Government must have power to determine what are the commodities which are the most essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the export of various classes or kinds of commodities, I take it that that applies to agricultural goods as well as other kinds. It may be necessary to restrict export. <Col N="1074" /> One thing the Minister ought to provide against is this.  If I am selling quantities of pigs and cattle and have some ready for the market when an order is issued that export is prohibited I go to the bacon factory the next day with my pigs and, because this export is prohibited, the quota will not be sufficient for me, and will not permit me to get away from my farm the number of pigs that I wish. In a week, a fortnight or three weeks, they have gone long over the weights, they are heavy and the yield will be an uneconomic price to me.  They are getting more food and get heavier and are worth less money.  These restrictions are of a dangerous character.  I think if they impose such a hardship as means a loss, there should be compensation. If, in the interests of the State, it is necessary to impose restrictions which will mean a loss to the individual producer because he cannot get away from his farm the cattle, pigs and sheep that are ready for the market, I think he ought not be the loser.  If it is done in the interests of the State, the State should meet the loss.  If such restrictions have to be imposed, it ought not to be at a day's notice, or even at a week's notice, but at such a distance away from the date as would give the man a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a number of people concerned in different commodities&mdash;pigs, particularly fairly heavy producers who are turning out week after week constant supplies and fulfilling contracts to factories. That requires very careful consideration and investigation, and I would point that out to the Minister, because it is not just a thing that one can make satisfactory by a stroke of the pen.  I think that the Minister ought to be prepared to say that if, by this prohibition of export farm producers suffer a loss through its application, the State ought to be responsible to the individual producer. We have been bitten in various ways in the past, and this is not the way to encourage production.  It may be necessary to do all sorts of things like the guaranteeing of prices in order to get particular types of <Col N="1075" /> production, but this will have to be met as well.  I do not know whether the Minister's attention was drawn to that in the other House or not, but that is definitely a situation with which he will be confronted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I may inform the Senator that any regulations which may be made will be for the purpose of protecting the interests of our own people and in order to make the best of the circumstances such as they are.  There may be regulations imposed by another country, regulations imposed outside our country, which would have a very serious effect on our prosperity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We may to a limited extent have to restrict exports for the purpose of ensuring adequate supplies here, but it may also be necessary to restrict exports in order to conform to the requirements and conditions which the importer may impose.  As far as Great Britain is concerned, agricultural produce will be exported by us through one central agency and there will be only one central buyer there.  The question of the conditions under which he will buy, the price to be paid, etc., will be settled by negotiation.  There may be circumstances in which we might refuse to export if the price in our opinion is not remunerative. Generally, however, these matters will be settled by agreement and, naturally, the representatives of the Department of Agriculture will have regard to all the circumstances.</P>

      <P>In regard to Section 2 (d) this, in my opinion, is the most delicate section of the Bill and requires very careful handling.  If it is not handled in that manner it is filled with danger to the whole of our stability as regards price levels and to the whole of our economic structure. I cannot conceive any necessity for <Col N="1076" /> urgent action.  I am glad to see that the Minister for Finance is here at present and I do hope that he will give the House an assurance that in the case of this section it will be possible to proceed by direct resolution.  I have put down an amendment to be brought in later on which gives that power.  I am speaking now in the interests of the confidence of investors and depositors throughout the country.  It is most important that nothing should be sprung upon the people suddenly.  I do not wish to create alarm: I do not believe there is any reason for alarm, unless these powers are used in a hasty, ill-considered manner.  I hope that some assurance to that effect will be given by the Minister for Finance and that he will give the further assurance that nothing will be done under this section that is not strictly necessary for war time and that any legislation that can follow the ordinary peace time methods in connection with the control of finance shall be done in that manner.  I can assure the House that I am not speaking now on behalf of any vested interest but on behalf of confidence for investors and the stability of our monetary system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister what the point is in this whole section.  I do not think that there is any real danger, even under the present circumstances, of any flight from Irish currency into any other currency I can think of.  The existence of this paragraph may, however, tend to produce a disposition on the part of certain ill-advised people to fly from Irish currency.  Consequently the passage as it stands certainly requires some fuller explanation than any given to us yet.  It appears to empower the Government to acquire compulsorily from the joint stock banks the sterling assets which those banks might dispose of.  I do not suppose that the Government proposes to do anything of the kind, yet it is rather a mistake to draw attention to the possibility of such drastic use of public authority.  There may be a reason for having some regulation of this kind in the Bill, some reason which I have not been able to <Col N="1077" /> think of; and, if the Minister assures me that those reasons are of the character which he would prefer not to disclose publicly, I would be prepared to accept a good deal, knowing that I must rely on his discretion and judgment in a crisis of this nature.  However, in a matter of this kind, we should require Ministers to exercise full responsibility and should not be hypercritical.  I would suggest to the Minister that, in exercising powers of such a delicate character as these, he would carry out the spirit of the recommendations of that much-discussed Ranking Commission Report, and that he would fortify himself with expert opinion in any use which he may make of these powers.</P>

However, we should try to discuss these things from the national point of view and not from that of bankers or farmers.  Certainly, if we are going to take up the attitude that no order should be issued relevant to currency, I think that no order should be issued either relevant to pigs and live stock.

      <P>I should like to give the House an assurance, first of all, that these powers will not be used to make any change in the fundamentals of our currency law or banking institutions.  They are designed entirely to preserve the integrity of our monetary unit, to safeguard, so far as we possibly can, the resources of this country, and to allay and prevent any tendency to panic which might manifest itself in any unforseeable circumstances which await us.  I think the House, and all our people, must have felt a great deal of comfort and assurance in the fact that, during these days of crisis, it has not been necessary for us to take any special steps to safeguard the public credit, but we do not know what tendency may manifest itself in the near future.  I have been advised that in certain possible&mdash;not probable&mdash;circumstances, it would be essential for the Government to have powers of this sort immediately available to its hand. I can give an undertaking that they will not be lightly used.  They will be used with a full sense of responsibility, in the careful exercise of discretion, and after full consultation with all those people who are competent to advise me as to what would be the best thing to do in certain circumstances.  I ask Senator Sir John Keane not to press that I should give an undertaking that we should only operate this paragraph by resolution, because it would be quite impossible for me to give that undertaking.  As I already said, I shall consult all those people who are competent to advise me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may ultimately have to take a decision on my own responsibility, but it will be taken with fullest consideration of all the circumstances. Again, for what it is worth I can give the assurance that we shall not, and could not, operate these powers, in fact, to make any change in the fundamental banking law or the currency law of this State.

The House knows how closely associated we are with other countries.  The fact that the great bulk of our trade is with our neighbour makes the maintenance of our parity of exchange a matter of importance to us.  The fortunes of war and other things like that might necessitate our taking action with some rapidity under the section. We cannot visualise these circumstances.

      <P>I stated in the Dáil, and, perhaps, I should state here, that the general policy we are operating in relation to these matters is that of securing, as far as possible, and as long as possible, that private enterprise will be called upon to supply the requirements of the country and, only when private enterprise has failed, or is unable to operate, because of the circumstances, will the State intervene for the purpose either of assisting private enterprise or taking over from private enterprise the obligations under the Bill.  It is clear that commonsense dictates that course, because the Government has not the organisation and could not without great difficulty get the organisation for which this Bill gives them power.</P>

      <P>With regard to paragraph (i), I should like to place before the Minister certain considerations which arise out of our position of neutrality.  The powers under this sub-section cover a wide ambit.  I was hoping that this country would be prepared to offer hospitality&mdash;I do not mean in the financial sense, but in the sense of asylum&mdash;to women and children of other nationalities than our own&mdash;British&mdash;who wish to come here, but I view with very considerable apprehension our sheltering people of military age who are escaping from their obligations across the water.  I feel that no encouragement, and, in fact, discouragement should be given to such persons.  One form of discouragement which I hope the Government will consider is the getting of taxation out of persons of that kind. As the Minister knows, taxation machinery operates very slowly, and it is quite possible for persons to be sheltered here for a year, 18 months, or even two years, and escape with possibly one year's taxation.  From the point of view of the material interests of the State, as well as good relations with another country, we should not encourage persons of that kind to come and shelter here.  Although, under our neutrality laws, we may not be able to prevent them, we should put them in a special category and get all the taxation we can out of them.</P>

      <P>I gather that the British will institute, if they have not already instituted, a system of permits to leave England and that no person will be allowed to leave without a permit.  In such event, we might require what would be equivalent to a visa from our authorities in the United Kingdom. In the ordinary course, there will have to be considerable restrictions upon travel if the situation develops as is feared, but I do not anticipate we will be placing any impediment on the <Col N="1083" /> movement in here of non-combatants from the United Kingdom, except, of course, they were to come in such numbers that an immediate problem of supplying the necessities of such persons would arise for us.  Some such circumstances might arise in which, in our own interests, we might have to restrict any such movement.  It might also be necessary in the interests of citizens travelling abroad to carry our passports with them, and it is in order to institute regulations of this kind that the paragraphs appear here and that these powers are taken.  It is impossible to foresee how things will develop, but in order to protect our own people, to ensure their safety as well as the national interest against the entrance of undesirable people or persons without whom we would be better off, these powers of controlling the inward and outward movement of persons are required.</P>

I do not think there is any point in raising the question of neutrality in connection with that matter.  I am sure the Government would give sanctuary to women and children, and to wounded.</P>

These people would not have committed an offence and there would be no question of their appealing against their being suspected of an offence.  It is first a question of national policy to intern them.  In the case of persons interned for offences against the Safety Act, there is, of course, an appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If, when an emergency order is made under this Act, and if, at the time such order is made, the Houses of the Oireachtas, or either of them, stand adjourned for a period of more than ten days, and if, during such adjournment twenty members of either House, by notice in writing given to the Chairman of the House of which they are members, require Dáil Eireann or Seanad Eireann, as the case may be, to be summoned, the said Chairman shall summon Dáil Eireann or Seanad Eireann to meet on a day to be named by him, not being more than twenty-one days after the receipt by the said Chairman of such notice, nor less than ten days after the issue of such summons.</P>
      <P>The amendment, if the Government could agree to accept it in principle, would make it perfectly clear that the nature of the Bill was definitely not totalitarian.  At present complete powers are given in Section 2, and the Government may call Parliament as and when they think fit.  The power of calling the Dáil is in the hands of the Executive, and if there could be agreement that a reasonable number could call the House together, it would establish quite clearly the principle that Parliament was supreme to the extent that it could insist on an opportunity to discuss matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>I do not think it will make a terrific amount of difference, because the Ministry will not do anything that would lead to the exercise of the powers.  At the same time, I think this is a matter of considerable importance. We should make it clear that we are not adopting the principles of a totalitarian State although giving totalitarian powers in this Bill.</P>

    <Col N="1086" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The view of the Government is that there can be no question about the desirability of having meetings of the Dáil and Seanad to discuss any of the Orders made by the Government under this Bill whenever it is made clear that any reasonable number of members in either House, or any organised Party in either House, intimate that they are seriously perturbed by these Orders and desire to have an opportunity of moving for their annulment. While that is the view of the Government, we consider that it is not desirable to make any cast-iron provision of this kind.  When an amendment, somewhat on the same lines, was moved in the Dáil, I, on behalf of the Government, gave the Dáil an assurance that if a number of members of the House or the leaders of the Parties there made a request to the Government to summon a meeting of the Dáil for the purpose of considering a motion for the annulment of an Order about which they were seriously concerned, the Government would do so. I am prepared to give a similar undertaking here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Senator, and those who support the amendment, agree to that arrangement, I think it would be preferable to having in the Bill a provision of this kind which might necessitate the holding of a meeting of the Oireachtas at a time when it might be inconvenient to do so, or, for some other reason, undesirable to have it. If the Senator is prepared to accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the assurance I give him, he will get the same result as the one he hopes to achieve under his amendment, with this advantage, that the undertaking I give will permit of the circumstances of the time being taken into account when the time and place of the meeting of either House is being arranged.  If there is any approach to the Government by responsible members of the House on the grounds that I have stated, namely, than an Order made under the Bill is causing serious concern, and they think a meeting of the House should be called as early as possible to move a motion for its annulment, then a meeting of the House will be held for <Col N="1087" /> that purpose.  The Opposition in the Dáil accepted such an assurance, and I suggest that Senator Douglas might take a similar course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's assurance without question, because I have no doubt it will be kept.  It would be foolish for me, however, to pretend that that assurance is the same thing as the insertion of a provision of this kind in the Bill.  I am very glad indeed that the Minister has made the statement we have listened to, but yet I cannot help feeling that it would be a good thing if we had the principle established that a certain number of members would have the right to get the House recalled in the circumstances I have already mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The preceding section shall only apply to such orders as the Government considers urgent.  In all other cases orders shall be approved by direct resolution of both Houses before they take effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the amendment, if accepted, would be to mitigate to some extent the dangers of this Bill.  Some one said in the Dáil that it was unprecedented that powers, such as we find in this Bill, should be taken in democratic countries.  The people who say that do not know, of course, what democracies have done in the past. But, apart from that, there are grounds for apprehension, because what is being done?  Parliament is being practically put in cold storage under this Bill.  I hope the Minister will accept the spirit of the amendment. What we find in Section 9 is the usual procedure laid down since the setting up of this House.  An order is made with provision for its annulment afterwards. Personally, I consider that procedure very ineffective.  That has been my experience of it.  In fact, I doubt if this power of annulment has ever been used.  I do not see why it should <Col N="1088" /> not be possible to collect orders that are not of an urgent character, and there must be a number of them&mdash;currency, financial, and agricultural&mdash;and in respect of them give to both Houses the power of control.  That is the effect of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the Senator's proposal is to ensure that orders can be discussed in the Dáil or Seanad shortly after they are made, the need for this amendment only arises in relation to the period of adjournment.  It might not be a satisfactory position to be in if the procedure was to be that orders deemed necessary, if not immediately urgent, could not be brought into effect until a special meeting of either the Dáil or the Seanad had been held, or the period of the adjournment had expired, or until Senators had resumed their meetings in the ordinary course.  I think the Senator will have to accept the position that the Government are being given very wide powers under this Bill on trust.  Of course, if they cannot be trusted with these powers, then I do not think the amendment is any safeguard.  I think the Senator will have to leave this to the discretion of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an exceptional measure and there is no use in trying to apply to it the standards and the safeguards that might be regarded as proper in normal peace times.  The Government are being given those powers to protect the national interests, to secure supplies of vital commodities during a time of national emergency, and so on.  At such a time orders will not be made unless they are urgently required.  Consequently, I think the amendment could be no safeguard at all.  As the Taoiseach explained in the Dáil, in the circumstances that now exist this power to take effective action on behalf of the State depends on the extent to which public opinion is behind the Government.  It cannot get that unless it keeps in constant touch with the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is through the Houses of the Oireachtas that the Government will become aware of the matters that are disturbing opinion&mdash;matters of <Col N="1089" /> public concern&mdash;and will be able to give the explanations that are necessary and the indications which will enable public opinion to be formed in support of the Government's action. The idea that the Government would use the powers given by this Bill for the purpose of avoiding meetings of the Dáil and Seanad is fundamentally wrong.  In the first instance, we think that that would be bad policy, and would not resort to it.</P>

Everybody who has even a slight acquaintance with what goes on behind the scenes knows that, and I am sure the Minister will not deny it.  We will be told that it is inconvenient to call the Dáil or Seanad together, and that is admitted; and in times of stress it is more inconvenient; but I hope that the Minister, in spite of any inconvenience that might possibly arise, will rigidly and conscientiously adhere to the promise he has given to the House.</P>
