      <P>Could the Minister tell the House what the duties on sugar were when he came into office, and from 1922 until the present imposition? What was the rate of duty in 1932, when the first Budget was introduced by the present Government, what did they make it then, and what has it been since?</P>

      <P>In 1924, the rate was 2¾d. per lb.; 1925, 2¾d.; 1926, 2¾d. from 1st April-5th May, 1925; 1d., 6th May, 1925-31st March, 1926; 1927, 1d.; 1928, 1d., 1st January-25th April; 1¼d. 26th April-31st December; 1929, 1d., 1st April-25th April, 1928; 1¼., 26th April, 1928-31st March, 1929; 1¼d., 1930; 1¼d., 1931; 1¼d., 1st January-6th May; 1¾d., 7th May-31st December; 1932, 1¼d., 1st April-6th May, 1931; 1¾d., 7th May, 1931-31st March, 1932; 1933, 1¾d., 1st April, 1932-30th May, 1932; 1¼d., 31st May, 1932-31st March, 1933; 1934, 1¼d., 1st April, 1933-6th February, 1934; 1¾d., 7th February-31st March, 1934; 1935, 1¾d., 1st April, 1934-12th October, 1934; 2d., 13th October, 1934-31st March, 1934-31st March, 1935; 1936, 2d., 1st April-15th May, 1935; 2¼d., 16th May, 1935-31st March, 1936; 1937, 2¼d., 1st April-31st July, 1936; 2d., 1st August, 1936-31st March, 1937; 1938, 2d., 1st April-31st May, 1937; 1¾d., 1st June, 1937-31st March, 1938; 1939, 1¾d., 1st January-8th November.</P>

      <P>Without going into the half years, those are exactly the <Col N="116" /> figures the Minister gave in the Dáil and in which, I understand, there was a slight flaw because they were not given in the newspaper reports, or the Official Reports, with regard to the half years.  The facts about the sugar tax are, I think, quite clear.  In 1924, 1925, and 1926, there was 2¾d. on sugar. That was for the purpose of paying the extra costs of an army.  The normal cost was fixed at £1,500,000 and the extra cost of the Army in 1924 was £9,500,000.  In 1925, it was £1,500,000 and, in 1926, £1,000,000, so that in 1924, 1925 and 1926, when sugar was taxed at the present rate of 2¾d., £12,000,000 was paid by the State as the cost of an army which was set up to settle a civil war, of which, I am sure, the Minister has heard and which we can leave at that.  In any event, sugar was taxed at 2¾d. for the purpose of paying off the expenses of an army in connection with a civil war.  Other expenses were also paid out of other taxes.  In 1927, the excess cost of the Army had come down to £250,000, and in 1927, the tax on sugar was reduced to 1d.  When the Minister came into office, he found a tax of 1¼d., and, in order to illustrate my point of yesterday that this Budget is not something new, but is a continuation of a well-established policy, the tax on sugar was increased from 1¼d. to 1¾d., and to 2d. and 2¼d., before the European War began, and before anything was being done here in the way of building up extra defences in the military and naval sense.  Therefore, this Government's policy has been to tax sugar, and what we have here is not the result of the European War but the result of their own particular policy.  They brought the tax to 2¾d. before the war broke out at all, and I think that point is well worth making.  Apart altogether from the cost of sugar and the tax on sugar, there was another £1,000,000, I think, between the cost of the sugar since it was made here and the cost of imported sugar.  That was to save us in an emergency. The emergency is upon us now and we find sugar both highly priced and highly taxed.</P>

      <P>Might I ask what the estimated output of the beet <Col N="117" /> sugar factories in the coming season is likely to be?  Am I right in thinking that we aim at producing practically the whole of our sugar supplies next year from our own sugar factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to point out in that connection that apparently the difference between the customs duty on sugar and the excise duty on sugar is now in the region of 15/- a cwt., or £15 a ton.  Consequently, if we produce at home the whole of the 100,000 tons of sugar which we hope to consume in 1940, the loss of revenue from the customs duty on sugar will amount not to £1,000,000 in the year, as I said yesterday, but to £1,500,000 in a full year, and that sum will have to be found by the taxpayers from some other source, in addition to paying the same price for sugar as they would be paying if that sugar were contributing to the revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute at all the points which Senator Hayes made.  The only thing I said in the Dáil, and which I repeat now, is that the previous Government had a heavier tax on sugar than this Government, and that they had a tax on sugar all the time, as we have had a tax on sugar all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not had it anything like as high as it is; not all the time, either.  I said here last night and in the Dáil that I do not dispute that an emergency existed in the days of the last Government for which they needed the revenue derived from that taxation. There was a very strong attack made on the tax on sugar in particular, and all human feelings and emotions were played upon to a great extent by one member, not in this House, who pointed out the inquity of any tax on sugar when one considers how heavily it bears on the poor.  That is what drew from me the statement that sugar was always taxed by the previous Government and that they had a <Col N="118" /> heavier tax on sugar, perhaps for good reasons, than is now proposed.  I was told immediately: &ldquo;But you know what we had to have the tax on sugar for&rdquo;.  I do not deny that, and I say that we are in an emergency now. There were some years during which that tax was raised, 1934, 1935, 1936, and 1937, when we were in a state of emergency, to some extent, too, because our economy was being upset as a result of the economic situation then prevailing.  I do not propose, however, to go into that now, but the tax on sugar we took over from the British.  A tax has been on sugar for 38 or 39 years.  It was not this Government, or the previous Government who initiated that tax.  It has always been there and the previous Government as well as this Government took advantage of it.  The previous Government increased it when they needed money, and we have done the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that the Minister got a tax on sugar at 1¼d., and it is now 2½d.  It was 2d. before there was any emergency and along with the tax on sugar which bears very heavily upon the poor, the policy of this Government, with no regard for this present war, increased the price of the necessaries of life, increased the cost of living, and, therefore, makes a 2½d. tax on sugar even bigger than it looks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I could go further and say that when the previous Government had a tax on sugar, they had also a heavy tax on tea.  There is no tax on tea now.  There are taxes on other things, of course.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would give some indication as to whether he would be able to make any arrangements on the question of plug tobacco of the common type which I spoke about yesterday and, if so, what remission he may be able to make to these working people who use this type more than anybody else.  I would suggest that those young men and older people who smoke cigarettes in very great quantities might easily suffer a little bit more in order to relieve the poorer man who gets his plug tobacco and has to make it last a week.  I hope the Minister will be able to do something for these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>I must take this last opportunity of protesting strongly against the Minister&mdash; according to the newspaper report&mdash; saying in his reply to the Second Reading of this Bill yesterday that, instead <Col N="121" /> of the Budget for the last years being of an unbalanced nature&mdash;as I had said&mdash;there had been surpluses of £629,000, £464,000 and in 1936 just over £1,000,000 and that there had been only one deficit.  Loan or no loan, I think the country should be aware of what the position has been here in those past years.  In 1937/38, the Minister claims a surplus of £629,000 but he does not in this take into account unemployment schemes, export bounties and alcohol factories which amount in all to £1,289,000 and which turn his surplus into a deficit of £659,958.  In 1938/39 there were no export bounties, but the other two items I have referred to increased his deficit&mdash; which he has already admitted&mdash;to £777,000.  For 1935/36 his £1,000,000 surplus is turned in the same way into a deficit of £422,000.  These are purely official figures which I went into and took the opportunity to collect in detail.</P>
      <P>Admittedly, as he says, there is divergence of opinion as to what a balanced Budget should be; but, excepting the elasticity which a State possesses in its powers of borrowing, to the ordinary working man in the country the Budget of a nation should be exactly similar to that of the working man who earns a weekly wage. Borrowing is correct finance when the charge is an endemic one or one which it would be unfair, owing to its amount, to place on the taxpayer in one year, but anybody who has even a general knowledge of the principles of finance will cut out immediately such things as unemployment assistance and subsidies as being an entirely unjustifiable method of meeting a deficiency in taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget which the Minister has introduced is one of the most depressing events which the country has had for a long time.  The Minister is a jovial sort of character himself and I think it is not what was expected of him.  People were wondering just what was going to happen when he was transferred to the Department of Finance.  I am afraid his reputation will be rather different, <Col N="122" /> to a great many people in the country.  He was a very kindly and good-natured gentleman until he was put in charge of the country's finances.</P>
      <P>I am at the disadvantage that I was elsewhere engaged yesterday and have not the benefit of knowing exactly the arguments put forward against the Bill.  My own feeling is that what matters most is not the amount of taxation imposed but the capacity of the people to bear it.  I think that is what is troubling every intelligent person in the country.  One would expect that that would be present in the minds of the members of the Government, whatever about people on the Government side who have to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to things to which they would prefer to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I believe that is true of a great many people in the Government ranks to-day.  None of them want these taxes; none of them want to make people pay more for sugar.  What Senator Hayes and everybody else says is true: the people are not able to bear these taxes, in addition to the increased taxation, which, year after year, has been made to the amount of taxation levied on industry and agriculture.</P>
      <P>Industry anywhere to be a success must always have a reserve left.  The farmer, the business man and the individual can only pay taxation out of what they have got from their earnings, out of some surplus that is left. What the Ministerial policy is doing and has been doing for a considerable time is to take away year after year the money which should have been left as a reserve to go into capital enterprise in the country, to replenish the reserves which keep the wheels of industry turning in the fields and in the towns.  Under the present scheme people are being impoverished and a situation is being created where the capacity to produce is depreciating one year after another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have reached a stage to-day where you are imposing this additional burden on a country suffering now the first reactions of a war in which the country is not engaged, suffering reactions which are the consequence of the policy which you have been pursuing <Col N="123" /> yourself to a certain extent.  The first result is that quite a number of people who were employed have ceased to be employed.  To the extent to which that employment has affected their livelihood, they are less able to bear the burden of taxation and the net result is that there is hardship and poverty in the country to a degree about which none of us can be very happy.  The Minister and his colleagues talk a good deal about co-operation.  As far as I am concerned, I feel anyway that this is a time in which it would be a good thing for the people of the country if we had a leadership that would be able to say to them: &ldquo;Steady, let us step together,&rdquo; but we have not got that. The kind of leadership we have is not a leadership that will make men steady in their minds, their thoughts or their actions, or that will get them to step together.  You know that when you are asking people to co-operate, you can only get them to co-operate on the basis that there is general agreement about the job that has to be done and the way you are to do it.  I do not suggest that if we had to face up to the problem of Finland, which God forbid, there would not be a different set of conditions here.  We would be fighting then for our very lives.  The method would not count then.  We would have to do things and we would have to forget the inefficiency and the incapacity of some leaders, simply because they had been thrown into their jobs.  Perhaps, one would have to march out and not bother whether they were behind or where they were.  We are not faced with a situation of that kind yet, but if we should have to face a situation like that our ability and our capacity to face it are definitely being worsened by the kind of policy you are pursuing.  Therefore, when the Minister talks about co-operation he can only get from sane men, normal human beings, co-operation on the basis that there is reasonably general agreement about what has to be done and the way it is to be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that there are fundamental differences about the kind <Col N="124" /> of things the Government are doing and the way they are doing them.  I believe myself it should be possible to get a much greater measure of agreement about what the country ought to do to-day.  As far as I am concerned as a countryman, my great difficulty about this Bill is that you are imposing taxes on sugar, tobacco and alcohol and you have raised income-tax.  In my judgment, the country is much less able to bear these increased taxes to-day than it was seven or eight years ago.  That is true, because of the policy which you have pursued.  Our productive capacity has been definitely falling.  The money which should have been left in production has been taken away and spent.  It is gone.  Now, you are adding to our Budget liabilities. You are even going to put a loan, amounting to £7,000,000, on the market.  I should like to see the purposes on which that loan is to be spent. I cannot see that 1d. of it is going to be put into anything which could be called, in my judgment, a productive enterprise.  Although things like what you are doing in the case of electricity, from one point of view, may be regarded by some Senators as improving the conditions of certain people in the country, nevertheless this country to-day is thrown back again on its agriculture and its farmers.  Quite a number of our industrial workers and the people in our towns are going to be unemployed because the raw materials of their industry, which were imported, will not be available, so that to a much greater extent perhaps than at any time during the period of office of the present Government, they have got to depend on the farmers again.</P>
    <P>Had the advice of some of us in this House been taken two or three years ago, had very considerable additional sums by way of capital been put into Irish agriculture, the strength and the vitality of that particular industry to-day would be very different.  The total productivity of the nation in 1940 and 1941 could very easily be 25 per cent. more than it is going to be. The Minister's predecessor in office had no sympathy with rural problems.  He displayed a complete lack of understanding of the problems of rural Ireland, <Col N="125" /> and what was worse, he did not display any sympathy with them.  I do not suggest that the present Minister would be unsympathetic, but his sympathy has not been demonstrated in a very practical way.</P>
    <P>The effects of the war on our economic life are very different from its effects on life in England.  There has been a very considerable increase in purchasing capacity there owing to war expenditure.  One of the ablest economists on the other side has been advocating a compulsory savings plan for people across in England.  In his judgment, the people there are earning more money than they can wisely spend after paying all taxes.  The Chancellor there however has initiated a campaign of voluntary savings.  I should like to see our Minister going out after this Budget to initiate a campaign of voluntary savings on the part of our people.  There is no use in exhorting people to save who have no money.  They have not the necessary capital to work their industry or whatever occupation they may be engaged in, even to 60 per cent., in many cases, of its total capacity.  I believe myself the Labour Party are not saying anything like as much as they might about conditions in the country, but I would say to the Minister that we are definitely going to add to the numbers of &ldquo;have nots&rdquo; in this country.  In our local paper the other day, I was reading where a deputation of working men went to the Board of Health to put their case for consideration for the Christmas season.  They put before the board the fact that there were a number of married men unemployed in the town of Cavan.  These men were getting 14/- a week, some of them less. They were paying a rent at the rate of 4/6d., some of them up to 5/-.  They said that a cwt. of coal cost 3/6, so that there was 5/6 left to feed a married man his wife and family.  What can you do in the country under conditions like these?</P>
    <P>This country has certain things which it could exploit.  It has the land, and it has the physical energy and intelligence.  Therefore, there is not any justification for anybody being pessimistic if there was leadership to <Col N="126" /> show the way to get work done.  My complaint is that we have not got that leadership in the country.  Added to that, you have a number of &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo; in the community.  The number is being increased month after month in our towns.  The unemployed are the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo; from the point of view of some people.  Goodness knows, they must be possessed of magnificent virtues to be as good as they are.  In the country we have a number of farmers whose places are uncapitalised. The number is growing, and they will be soon thrown in amongst the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo; because the farmer who cannot work his place to the full, and who is not able to meet the extra demands which the Government make upon him, is just as much a &ldquo;have-not&rdquo; as the unemployed workers in the towns.  The Government are adding to the number of these, but they cannot continue doing so because very soon the result will be a lop-sided economy.  Is it not tragic to be facing a situation like that when one thinks of all the other things that are possible for us.  I am not the least bit pessimistic.  Some people like to say that I am.  But I am not.  I prefer being a realist.  I believe that the Minister and his colleagues must face up to this: that if they are going to keep peace and order and have progress in the country, if they find it essential to increase the burden of taxation on the people year after year, that can only be done if they, on their part, see to it that our productive capacity is fully utilised, and that the balance which is left to our people, as a result of their increased production, will be enough to meet the increased taxes imposed and, at the same time, will enable them to maintain a decent standard of living.  What I say is, that the Government is attending to one side of that but not to the other.  The obligation, however, is on the Government to do what I suggest.</P>
    <P>We see that in England at the present time millions of pounds can be found for enterprises, quite a number of which cannot be said to be productive. Here with us there are enterprises which we know definitely could be made productive.  Work on the land, <Col N="127" /> for instance, holds possibilities.  In present circumstances that is absolutely essential for us, but there is no good in telling me to go home and plough up my fields and to do so-and-so, if the first essential to all that is not available to me.  Agriculture has been bled white, and the result is that we have not any reserve in the shape of capital, which is essential for us if we are to increase our production.  To the extent to which that is lacking, our income in the future is going to be lower, and so is the Minister's capacity to rake the money off the taxpayers of the country which he wants to spend on his various activities.  I am not going to say now whether the way this money is going to be spent is wise or not.  That question has been argued at length.  There are vital differences of opinion on it.  My own judgment is that the best way to preserve our sovereignty is to have conditions created here whereby all our people will have a chance of living and working in the country, and of getting paid for their labour.  To the extent to which Government activity can assist that, in my opinion, is the best method they could adopt to maintain the sovereignty of our people.  I hold that the Government are neglecting to do that.  They have neglected it for years as far as agriculture is concerned, and there can be no doubt about it but that we will reap the whirlwind.</P>
    <P>The outbreak of war has definitely found us in this position: that we are not able to produce anything up to our full capacity from the land.  Everyone who bothers his head to think about it knows that is true.  At the moment, I am not thinking of people who have resources other than what comes off the the land.  I am thinking of the man whom we style &ldquo;John Farmer.&rdquo;  The people that he is typical of are oppressed and depressed.  War is costly and all peoples, whether they are in it or out of it, are called upon to hear increased burdens.  We are not in it, but our burden of taxation is just as high as that which is being borne by the people in the war.  The Government are not doing their obvious job to put our farmers into production in <Col N="128" /> the manner in which they should, and the result is that our people are depressed. The Government and their supporters will, of course, say that that is not so.</P>
    <P>There have been various disturbances amongst our farming community recently.  However much the Government may decry the things which these people did, or however much they may disagree with them, this, at least, I think will be accepted by all, that the farmer is not a revolutionary by nature.  He does not like to waste time if he can spend it to better advantage on his farm at home. The things which certain farmers did recently were done in an attitude of despair.  The strange thing about it is that quite a number of those farmers were led by men who, to my own knowledge, were some years ago most active exponents of the policy of the present Government.  One of our troubles here is that we find it very hard to go back on things that we did and said in the past.  The Minister knows that quite well himself.  It must be said, however, that he has shown more sense with regard to the past than some of his colleagues. While that is so, it must be admitted that it is very difficult to get men who espoused a particular cause or policy in the past to come out now and repudiate it.  But, it is a fact that quite a number of farmers who, in a great many counties marched out in protest a week ago, had been active supporters of the Government Party in the past.  Why did they do that?  I put it to the Minister that they did it because they are broken, disappointed and angered.  I am not saying that the banner under which they marched out on this occasion was the best that they could unfold, but we know also that the British did not go to war with Germany just because of Poland.</P>

      <P>&mdash;that while we are nonbelligerents we are raising a Budget <Col N="129" /> that is going to be as costly on the country as if it were at war.  What I am trying to indicate is that this non-belligerency which we are trying to preserve is very expensive.  Cost is being imposed on people who have been impoverished in pursuance of a certain policy, and the burden can only be borne by them if the Government, on its part, will do things which are essential, if the people are to be put into production and this taxation carried.  I have not been in consultation about this, but I am quite satisfied that the recent farmers' strike was a symptom, and a dangerous symptom.  People may shout out and decry them, saying that they were only a certain type of farmers, but I know many of them to be valiant men.  It is all right to say that they are fine fellows when they agree with you but, as soon as they disagree, give them the kick.  We have had experience of that, even in this House.</P>

      <P>That is true.  If there is to be progress there must be understanding, fair play and reasonable action on the part of the Government in the way of helping the citizens.  It should be realised that you cannot impose such burdens as will break them without doing the obvious thing, helping them to bear them.  If this additional taxation is taken from the country, and if nothing is done to put people into greater production, you will find when you come back that they will be weaker.  Where would that end?  If there were people who wanted trouble I say that the policy being pursued has all the essentials for breaking people who want to work, who want to develop the part of the country they have got, and who want peace and order.  The Minister is not very long in his present office.  He will be doing very badly as far as the rural community is concerned, if he does not do better for them than his predecessor. Many people are dissatisfied, whether through political reasons or their shadows, but they are trying to look on the country's future from the point of view, not so much of political reactions, or as to what was done, <Col N="130" /> but to the economic and spiritual consequences.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is prepared to face up to the problems of rural Ireland then, even though he was brought up in Dublin, he should realise that only for rural Ireland Dublin would not be what it is.  I suggest that if rural Ireland cannot be kept working to full capacity, Dublin will be a very queer place for the residents before 20 years have passed.  If the Minister tries to get a sympathetic understanding of the mind of rural Ireland, I am convinced that in his term of office he can bring about a change in the conditions there. I suggest that some of the Loan of £7,000,000, if not all, which is going to be provided by the Irish people&mdash;and which I hope will be a thundering success&mdash;will be put into agriculture. When the Minister gets the money let him sit down and see how many millions he can put into agriculture. There is no way in which he could spend the money if he wants to get a better return.  If he has to come to the House again in a few months to ask for more taxation he will find that the position is not improved at all, as it cannot be improved when you take away all the substance and put nothing back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the matter to which I propose to refer should perhaps more properly have been raised on Section 1, dealing with income-tax, but I had not the opportunity of raising it.  I have raised this matter several times before, but where a palpable injustice exists, or is alleged to exist&mdash;and I think it can be proved to exist&mdash;it is the duty of any Senator to keep on referring to it, in the hope that, in the course of time, the consciences of the Minister and of those who advise him may soften.  I refer to the injustice that exists in respect of the taxation of people on income which they do not receive.  I refer to people under Schedule A.  There are two classes of people who receive income under Schedule A.  One class is that which has property let&mdash;the landlord who owns property and lets it for certain rents.  He receives a certain rent, but that rent is not the actual money he has to spend in many cases.  There is, in connection with property, the cost of upkeep which may be very considerable, and, under amendments to the Income-Tax Acts, carried out by the present Government, <Col N="132" /> of which the Minister may not be aware in detail, but of which his predecessor is fully aware, owners are taxed not on their net income, but on their gross income.  No allowance whatever is made now for repairs except on property of £5 valuation or less.  That is the position with regard to the people who actually receive money, where you can apply a definite test of what the income is.  As far as I know, in no other case, no case of farmers or commercial undertakings, is anybody taxed on income they do not receive.  That is the only case, the case of people who own property which is let and property of over £5 valuation.</P>
      <P>I come to the case of people who occupy property themselves.  I think we all know the sad spectacle throughout the country of these derelict demesnes, and whatever may be our political feelings I think we all must admit that the remnants of the resident gentry are an asset to the country.  They contribute very largely, as far as they are able, to the amenities of sport and social work. They are definitely, in many cases, almost pioneers and leaders in such matters as district nursing, and matters of that kind.  They are, without suggesting anything snobbish, remnant centres of civilisation in the country. They occupy in many cases what one might call the remnant demesnes, on which the upkeep is exceedingly heavy. They have the upkeep of biggish houses, the upkeep of grounds and gardens. I suggest that, considering that they are a social asset in the country, their case should be considered and they should not be taxed on notional incomes and not be allowed to set off the actual expenditure incurred in the maintenance and upkeep of their places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the position up to three or four years ago, when the Government, when Mr. MacEntee was Minister for Finance, swept all that away.  Up to that time, there was a definite allowance given for repairs, which could act as a basis test.  If your valuation were £100, so much of that could be set off as the allowance for repairs; I think it was about £20.  Then you could relate <Col N="133" /> that allowance to the actual expenditure, and if an owner occupier was proved to have spent more than that £20 it was set off against his total income.  But now the whole of that basis test of upkeep is being swept away.  The valuation of these properties has been increased by 50 per cent. and they have no relief whatever.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to accept the fact that those people are an asset, living as almost economic prisoners&mdash;as I know many of them to be&mdash;on their properties. I know many of them cannot afford the money to go away.  As long as they stay in their homes they can just live, but if they want to go away for a holiday they have not got the spare money.  These people deserve consideration just as much as farmers or the wage-earning class or anybody else, and they should not be taxed on income they do not receive.  That is the position now.</P>
    <P>I know there are administrative difficulties in this.  In fact, if I were to hazard a guess, it is the administrative inconvenience that is at the bottom of all this injustice.  The old system necessitated reference and examination of cases and a lot of extra work in the income-tax offices.  I do not want to be hard, but I want to be only human and suggest that the officials naturally did not like all that and, in the interests of simplification, they introduced this system which, in my opinion, is a gross injustice.</P>
    <P>We have now a new Minister for Finance and I would ask him to examine that matter <i>de novo</i> and try to detach himself to a certain extent from the official advice which I am afraid he will receive in this matter, and try to look at the bare justice of the case.  I would ask him to start out, first of all, on the assumption that nobody should be taxed on income they do not receive and that, in the case of people who live in the country, who contribute largely to its amenities and to its social life, they should be allowed to set off the costs of their repairs and the upkeep on their places against their incomes.</P>
    <P>If you go back to the origin of this <Col N="134" /> thing, a Socialist Minister, Mr. Lloyd George, whose whole political life was the abuse of the capitalists, admitted the injustice in the case of residents on the land and allowed the very concessions that I am now asking for and which the Minister's predecessor in the Government to which he belongs swept away.  I would ask that this matter might be reconsidered in the light of plain and elementary justice.</P>

      <P>As Senator Sir John Keane has mentioned this particular matter of taxation on income not received, and as it is an old hobby of mine, I think I might mention it again because I agree with him, but my arguments would be somewhat different. Perhaps not different, but I relate them to an entirely different class of persons.  There seems to be a good deal of hope among members of this House that the sympathy of a new Minister may bring about changes.  I am afraid I have been too much impressed by what is called collective responsibility to share their hopes to that extent.</P>

      <P>Nevertheless it might be possible that the brain of one man may take in and re-examine something which we failed entirely to get into the brain of another, and he might persuade other persons.  The late Minister was adamant in this particular matter, and one never got even sympathy. I am not attacking him on that, because it often happens that one person sees a point very differently from another.</P>
      <P>The removal of the allowance for repairs was proposed by the late Government. It was proposed first of all when Mr. Blythe was Minister for Finance. It came down to this House and I had the privilege of moving a recommendation, the only recommendation, I think, that this House ever carried against a Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Col N="135" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The removal of the allowance for repairs was first proposed by the Government when Mr. Blythe was Minister for Finance. That Finance Bill came to this House and I had the privilege of proposing a recommendation that that be deleted and that the allowance for repairs should continue.  To the best of my belief that was the only recommendation from this House that ever went back to the Dáil and was accepted against the Executive.  There was, I think, a small majority.  Some members of this House who were then members of the Dáil had the privilege in this particular matter of voting against the Government which they ordinarily supported.  My optimism does not extend to the belief that this House, which has a majority for the present Government, could possibly be persuaded to act in the same independent manner as it did when it had a majority generally supporting the late Government, but at the same time I do think that some day this question ought to be re-examined.</P>
      <P>I want particularly to emphasise the assertion of Senator Sir John Keane that income-tax should not be paid on income not received, and I personally think that the Schedule A tax, which is for all practical purposes a tax on house property, should not be mixed up with income-tax, and should be a separate tax altogether, relating to the facts of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not disputing for a moment what Senator Sir John Keane has said, but I want to draw attention to a completely different class of persons for whom, I know, this new tax is creating a very serious problem at the moment. Quite a number of people have spoken to me.  I raised this question before when the tax was increased to 4/6, and it is very much more serious now when the tax has been increased to 6/6.  I am referring to persons who bought houses at a price which they believed, within their income, it would be possible for them to live in and to meet the expenditure.  They knew the valuation or the approximate valuation.  If they were new houses they were able to find out the valuation of similar houses in the exact neighbourhood.  If <Col N="136" /> they were not new houses they knew the valuation, and they made their calculations accordingly.  When you have an actual income-tax and your income goes down, the rate of tax may be higher, but there is an adjustment, but that is not the case where you own a house.  There is great hardship in the case of people, lower middle-class or upper lower-class, I think the Minister knows the exact class I am referring to&mdash;people with £20 to £25 valuation. Of course, it applies to higher valuations too, but the hardship is greater in the class living in houses of £20 to £25 valuation.  They calculated what they were going to spend.  In many cases they had to find a lump sum to commence with, and then they arranged for the balance, perhaps, with the Dublin Corporation or a building society or an insurance company. They knew they had so much per annum, and that the income-tax was 3/- or 4/- or 4/6.  Now they find themselves with a 20 per cent. addition on to the valuation of the property when they bought it, and 6/6 instead of 3/- income-tax.  The additional rate there is a very real hardship, and I think that if income-tax is going to be at the rate of 6/6 and, perhaps, for all we know, 7/6 or anything, there should be a special different taxation for people who are living in their own houses.  I know, theoretically, that you set that off against another person who has to pay rent.  I know the basis and the reasons for it, and I recognise a certain justice.  I am not saying that persons living in their own house should pay no tax, but I am suggesting that you dislocate the position with regard to people with moderate incomes in a way they cannot adjust it.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has had the experience of selling a house again and moving to a cheaper one knows that the actual cost of doing that is probably the amount he would save in three or four years.  I know two or three young people who do not know how they are going to meet the position, for whom the increased cost is very serious.  It may be only the difference between 4/6 and 6/6 on £20, but to some people that means a great deal.  It means a lot to young married men who could not get houses to rent in Dublin and <Col N="137" /> who saw a chance of getting a house for which they could pay over 20 or 30 years.  I do say their position is a serious one.  I say this particularly to this Minister because I believe it is exactly the kind of problem in which he is personally interested, apart altogether from his position as Minister. As Senator Sir John Keane raised the point, I thought I might make an appeal to the Minister for this particular class before the next Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want very briefly to make one particular point.  I have always had some sympathy with a Minister for Finance.  I have heard a great deal of abuse of Ministers for Finance in my time and it always seems to me rather unjust to attack the individual who, for the moment, is bearing that particular burden because he has no more responsibility than any of his colleagues for the measures he introduces.  Sometimes, indeed, he is acting against his will; he has made a valiant fight against expenditure, has been overborne by weight of numbers and arguments and finds himself arguing in favour of things against which he privately argues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>And it is not the Minister but the policy of the Government itself that ought to be abused. It seems to me that the situation with regard to our finances here needs a great many remedies, but there is one I would like to suggest.  Undoubtedly, if any standard of life is to be maintained here, and if the Minister's revenue is to be kept up, we must have increased agricultural production, not only for home consumption but also for export.  It is all very fine to say we do not need to import goods, but if we are not going to import anything then we are going to have a Robinson Crusoe mode of existence.  We also need to export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="138" /> The Minister for Finance and his colleagues in the Government at one time proclaimed that they could find alternative markets for our agricultural products.  They have found by bitter and very costly experiment that they can do no such thing.  They have now come around in that, as in many other things, to the opinion of their opponents in public life in this country. That being so, and in the situation which you now have, of European War &mdash;and the British are planning for a long war&mdash;they surely must have taken into consideration their position with regard to foodstuffs.  Surely our position with regard to the British market for foodstuffs ought now be a stronger one than ever it was before, and this surely ought to be an auspicious moment for going to the British, not by means of civil servants, but by Ministers themselves making up their minds here as to what they would like to do and then inviting British Ministers on a personal man-to-man basis.  There is no derogation of their sovereign status &mdash;that is a familiar phrase to myself and the Minister from particular debate &mdash;there is no derogation of their sovereign status in doing that.  All over the world at the present moment kings, queens, prime ministers, chiefs-of-staff, commanders-in-chief and admirals are flying from capital to capital making arrangements and negotiating from the point of view of their particular countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Particularly.  There is nothing at all derogatory in an Irish Minister for Finance or an Irish Prime Minister or any Irish Minister flying to another capital and endeavouring to make a long term agreement with regard to our agricultural production here which would enable him to give guaranteed prices and would enormously increase agricultural employment, and, I think, to a certain extent, other employment.  That is one step which could be taken which would serve the country, and I think if it were known that the Minister were going to take that step it would help in his effort to get this loan or any other loan he <Col N="139" /> may intend to float.  He certainly asks for co-operation.  I am never quite clear what he means by co-operation, although I suspect he means that people should be silent while he does whatever he pleases.  When the economic war was on the Minister, if my recollection serves me right, is the very person who came back from Ottawa in 1932 and said that an agreement was in sight.  The agreement which was then in sight did not actually materialise until six years later, 1938.  It was six years before that they decided to settle the problem by personal negotiation. And may I point out&mdash;it is relevant, I think&mdash;that while these negotiations were going on for the settlement of the economic war, the Minister and his colleague got the co-operation of the Opposition in so far as not one single word was said by any Party in the country opposed to the Government about that matter.  I think if they did the same thing again they would find that they would get plenty of co-operation in like manner.</P>
      <P>I always thought that the settlement of the economic war was merely the beginning of an economic peace, was merely the beginning of more and more arrangements because Ministers&mdash;I say it in no captious spirit&mdash;had to rid themselves of all kinds of foolish opinions into which they were deceived by their own propaganda.  Experience has shown them that certain things cannot be done.  One thought, one hoped that the end of the economic war was the beginning of a series of agreements. If there were any difficulties before the European.  War broke out, the incidence of the European War must surely have considerably reduced, if not entirely removed these difficulties. I think there would be plenty of co-operation in a real sense if Ministers would endeavour, by personal negotiation, to see what they can do with regard to long-term agreements with the British in the matter of our agricultural produce.  If they did that, it would, I think increase the yield of taxation and might eventually enable us to reduce the burden.  Both these things would be very desirable.</P>

      <P>As far as I see, we cannot even hope to get agreement on the Front Bench of the Opposition and if we cannot do that I am afraid I, like others, will begin to get pessimistic. If Senator Hayes had been listening to Senator Baxter's speech&mdash;he seemed to be listening to it but he must not have been&mdash;he would find where the whole trouble lies.  Senator Baxter said in his speech that there are fundamental differences which, apparently, cannot be reconciled.  That has been running through the whole debate here and it is quite obvious that the differences which Senator Baxter sees and which any sensible man would see are the differences between the policy of free trade and the policy of protection.</P>

      <P>It is quite possible, but in any case I have to paddle along and do the best I can.  I understand that Senator Johnston suggests that the Minister is very foolish to take the risk of missing all the revenue which would be gained by the importation of sugar in the near or in the distant future. As an alternative to the production of sugar here in this country, he suggests that we should continue to import sugar.  I ask the Senator if he seriously thinks that the Minister would be carrying out his responsibility as Minister or that the Government would be carrying out their responsibilities to the people if they took the chance on the further development of the war and the possibility that in a year or two years, six months or two months for that matter, we might not be able to import any sugar at all.  If that is not a policy of free trade I do not know what it is.  Then we had Senator Baxter saying that what we are short of is leadership.  If we are <Col N="141" /> short of leadership, Senator Baxter did not tell us how we are going to get leadership.  What is his method? We have got the present leadership and we have got the same leadership repeatedly time after time and would undoubtedly get the same leadership to-morrow if another election were to take place.  Senator Baxter knows that and so do the other Senators.</P>

But they will not say that: they keep on criticising the Government about the taxes which have been imposed, without their having any possible alternative to put up against it.  Two or three of the Opposition speakers have suggested that it was a great thing that some members supporting them on the other side of the House voted against the then Government, and they suggested it would be a great thing if some of the people on this side of the House could take their courage in their hands and vote as they really believed rather than for what they had been told to vote.</P>

If there were a world in which all people believed that it was their duty to supply food wherever it was required, at a reasonable price, that would be all right; but unfortunately we have not a Christian world.  In practically every country at the present time we have barricades being thrown up against imports from outside.</P>

I suggest that we should, by every word and act here, maintain a policy of neutrality, and think of no such act.  I am not a military expert any more than the ex-Minister for Defence.</P>

In any case, I am not sufficiently a military expert to question the military knowledge of Senator Stafford, as was done by the ex-Minister for Defence, and I think that, whatever may be coming to the rest of us, we should all at least take off our hats to the one link with the Fenians&mdash;Senator Matt Stafford.</P>
      <P>The point is this: while we may differ on various things, we have come together in the past in a time of crisis. We have come together, as Senator Hayes has pointed out, and members of the Opposition have at least kept quiet while certain negotiations were going on.  I suggest that we are not up against a more serious proposition now than we were in the past.  If Senators were sincere in their attitude heretofore and if they are sincere now, all their efforts will be to do the best that they can for the good of this country. Rather than try to pick holes in a policy for which they have no alternative, they should do as they did in the past and admit that the Government is doing its best; rather than put obstacles in the way they should throw in their weight behind it and help it.</P>

      <P>On this matter of co-operation, I do not see any objection to co-operation but, of course, under no circumstances are we going to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; when the truth requires the answer &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I think Senator Quirke has not only a certain amount of difficulty in English but a certain amount of difficulty in thought.  He sees things much more clearly than anybody else.  He challenged Senator Baxter as to whether he stands over the policy of the farmers in the recent strike.  I do not know what Senator Baxter's view may have been&mdash;I can speak only for myself &mdash;but if you ask me do I stand over the recent strike it would be the same as asking me do I beat my wife?  I would only be able to answer that there may have been justification for the strike with regard to the price of milk, but I could not say that there was justification for a strike aiming at derating or at a moratorium on payment of annuities. <Col N="145" /> Things are not quite as clear as the Senator thinks.  He talks about free trade and protection.  If you ask me am I a free trader I would have to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and if you ask me am I a protectionist, probably I would have to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, also.  It is another thing to say that if you do not support the lunatic policy of the present Government you stand immutably over the doctrine of free trade.  Things are not just like that.  The Senator is out of touch with the realities of the situation.  You could say that we were a protectionist Government when we imposed tariffs and maintained the Tariff Commission. Were we protectionist or free trade when we were imposing protection?  As the Senator gets older he will realise&mdash; perhaps too late&mdash;the law of Aristotle: &ldquo;Not too little, and not too much&rdquo;. That is the golden mean.</P>

      <P>The Senator may remember the early history of the Church when one heresy sprang up after another, and the second one to spring up, in trying to rectify the first, would go too much to the other side and the pendulum would swing right over to the left.  The real truth lies in the fact that the Senator does not understand.  He talks about differences on this side and on the front bench here.  I am now going to differ with my colleague, Senator Hayes, who has said that the policy advocated by Senator Quirke seems to be absolutely autarchic and suitable only for such a land as that of Robinson Crusoe.  I think he is quite wrong.  If you read the story of Robinson Crusoe you will see that when Defoe wrote it he realised that it was not going to be possible to write a novel about a man placed entirely alone, and unaided by the law of nature.  If you throw your mind back, you will remember that Defoe arranged that the ship which was wrecked should be wrecked just near the shore.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

      <P>Defoe was able to arrange for Crusoe to get guns made of metal dug out of the soil and smelted in great factories, and that soil had to be acquired in a place that was productive of iron.  Also, there had to be a supply of gunpowder, which is acquired from places where there is nitre and saltpetre and so on.  He required, in order to live that crude life, the resources of an enormous and complicated civilisation.  As far as this country is concerned and as far as I can judge&mdash;I do not pretend to be an authority on the policy of free trade&mdash; I believe that to consider how absolute self-sufficiency can come about we must go back to the copper age and the bronze age.</P>
      <P>When there was a copper age, this country produced copper but when it came to the bronze age, as the bronze required an admixture of tin, this country had to resort to imports.  It seems to me, therefore, that to establish what Senators on the other side want, is not merely a matter of going back to the bronze age but to the early iron age.  You have got, literally, to go back to the stone age.  If you look at anything in this room, or any article which any Senator may have in his possession, I think I can prove that if we had for the last 200 years been completely cut off from the rest of the world, that article could not have been produced here.  Even in the case of sugar, it is manufactured by complicated machinery made of steel and this country does not produce steel.  As civilisation developed, this idea of absolute State supremacy gave way to a system of interdependence between countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators challenged me yesterday on what I said following the Minister's statement.  My point was that we are spending more than £5,000,000 on an Army which a few years ago cost only £1,100,000.  Some Senators seem to think that if an army costs £5,000,000, it must automatically be five times as good as an army costing £1,000,000. That is not so at all.  It does not necessarily follow that an army costing £5,000,000 may be five times better than an army costing £1,000,000.  What is the point of spending all this money? <Col N="147" /> The Army can be used in a number of ways.  We know that an army and its reserve are necessary for the general maintenance of order.  It may be needed for other purposes.  The Minister referred yesterday, directly or indirectly, to Finland.  He talked about what the position in Finland was and referred to the money spent by other neutral countries.  That analogy, however does not hold.  Finland and, as I said, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are a sort of inland lake, surrounded by their potential enemies, while their potential friends cannot get to them.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, does any. Senator think that our Army, enormously inflated in cost, is going to be called on for defensive purposes here? It may be&mdash;I am not suggesting it&mdash; that the Minister has in view a fight against England.  In that case, we would be rather in the position of Poland and Finland.  The potential enemy would be immediately beside us and our potential supporters, or the potential enemy of our enemy, would be more or less cut off from us.  You might also have an Army inflated in this way for dealing with disorder in this country, though in this country, where we had the Head of the Government appearing with tears in his eyes making an impassioned speech about hunger strikers, stating that the Government would rather go down than surrender to a hunger strike, and where you read a few days later that the hunger strikers have been released, I do not see why we should spend £5,000,000 on an Army, merely for the purpose of suppressing internal disorders.</P>
    <P>Again, it may be suggested that you have an Army to fight the North. Sometimes when a man commits a murder it is pleaded that he is a lunatic, in modification of the crime of murder.  If anybody talks about the Army existing for the purpose of waging a war on the North, I would not suggest that it was criminal lunacy because lunacy is a modification of criminality.  If the Government's proposal were to wage war on Northern Ireland, I would say that you would have the totality of criminality together with the totality of lunacy.  It would <Col N="148" /> be most unparliamentary for me to say, however, that people on the other side manifested the totality of criminality and the totality of lunacy and, I assume, therefore, that is not the policy.  The only possibility left is that of some external enemy waging war on this country arising out of the fact that it was at war with England.  The geographical position and the relations between these two countries are such that a large-scale attack on this country could only be possible if the British Navy were overcome.  That is the position as I see it.  The Senator may be able to correct me.  It may be that he thinks that we shall come to a period when we shall have to fight against the same enemy as England has to fight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be a rather cantankerous person, but I have my moments of good nature, and what I am trying is to assist the Senator.  I have tried by a process of elimination to discover what the Army is intended to do.  Up to a few years ago the Army, when it cost a little over £1,000,000, was deemed adequate.  At the present moment, at a time of what is called crisis&mdash;remember the word means judgment&mdash;it is deemed necessary to raise a loan to provide an army which admittedly could not be maintained out of the ordinary taxation of the country.  That is in relation to the crisis.  In that crisis it is conceivable that a situation may arise when the enemy now fighting England would be in a position to invade this country.  In that case, it means that you have a joint defence of these islands.  The Senator is now leaving the House, but I should like to ask him or any other Senator, why in this time of crisis this country is putting an enormous burden on the taxpayers and extending that burden into future years within which <Col N="149" /> the debt which we are incurring now will be repaid.  The Army, presumably, is not to be used against Britain. Perhaps the Army is being maintained to face a possibility of attack arising out of this war.  In that case there would be co-operative resistance.  If that is the purpose for which this money is to be spent, it is proper that some steps should be taken by way of consultation between our military experts and the British.  I do not know whether we have any military experts. Personally my own view is that I do not think this expenditure is necessary at all.</P>
      <P>Senator Quirke says that we have no policy here.  I agree that once a thing is done it cannot be undone. I would not say that if, by any unfortunate chance, I had to take the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, I would be able to get back to the position we were in in 1931, because he has extended the Civil Service, he has employed all sorts of other people, vested interests have been created, and, therefore, I think it would be against justice if any new Government were to come in and say that all those people were going to be sacked.  I do think, however, that enormous economy, amounting to millions of pounds, could be effected in the case of the Army.  I think that could be done without being unjust to anybody in the Army.  I also think that enormous economy could be effected in the case of the police force. In my opinion there could be a modification of our industrial revival business.  Anyway, I think that is going to modify itself irrespective of anything that the Government may do. I do want to make it plain that I would not favour any modification of it which would injure people who have expended a large amount of money under the law of the country, but, as I have said, I think it will modify itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Bill to raise additional taxation. When one is faced with a certain position you have two alternatives. The first is to consider how you will set about raising the additional taxation, the other, how to create a situation in which the additional taxation will not be necessary.  I do not think <Col N="150" /> that any Government taking the place of the present Government could guarantee to reduce taxation to the level it was at when the previous Government was in power, because, as I have said, too many vested interests, rights and so on have been created since, and these would have to be recognised.  But I think it is demonstrably true that, without doing any injustice, the additional taxation proposed here could be made unnecessary by diminishing the completely useless expenditure that I referred to yesterday. A great deal of the expenditure on the Army is not only useless but has, in fact, proved to be definitely harmful.</P>
    <P>I have not got up here merely for the purpose of making party points against the Government.  I am, myself, far from looking for some little points to attack the Government on a popular issue.  I have never done that. I always like to be mixed up in anything of an unpopular nature.  I realise that the Government have a great deal of responsibility.  Whenever they have been forced to take a certain line which might easily bring on me a reaction of unpopularity, as long as I was convinced that the good of the country required that they should take that line, I have always hastened to associate myself with the Government.</P>
    <P>It does not follow from that that I wish to see millions of our unfortunate people's money being thrown away in useless and harmful expenditure, or that I am bound by a spirit of co-operation, in view of the crisis in the world, to support everything that the Government do.  I am prepared to give that co-operation on just terms, but I do not agree that I have got to say: &ldquo;It is splendid that you are throwing this money away.&rdquo;  I would not be just to myself or to the people if I did that, and if anybody asks me to do that then I say the sooner you abolish free speech altogether and abolish this Legislature the better.  I, for one, realise that the Government are up against difficulties: that certain things must be done to safeguard and protect the interests of the country.  I am quite prepared to co-operate with them in anything that tends to do that, even though that co-operation may involve <Col N="151" /> some unpopularity for myself, because I rather enjoy unpopularity.</P>

      <P>After the flights of fancy and imagination reached by the last speaker I want to say a few words on this Bill in case the Minister should lose touch with the ordinary common things that matter in the life of this country.  I would be glad if we could have some information from the Minister as to what the Government's attitude is towards the poor, the unemployed, the old age pensioners and the blind people throughout the country. At the time their allowances were fixed, there was no crisis in the world. Since the outbreak of war there has been a substantial increase in the cost of living.  The proposals in this Bill will make their burden a heavier one than it was hitherto, and they are the people who are least able to bear that burden.  Senator Fitzgerald talked about all the iniquities connected with Army expenditure.  I presume he was referring to the regular Army.  To-day we have in this country another army, a hungry army of over 100,000 people. I submit that this army is a bigger menace to the welfare of the country than the trained army on which we are supposed to be wasting so much money. What are the Government going to do about those people?  Apparently there is no possible hope of finding employment for them.  The allowances they are receiving are miserable and entirely inadequate.  I want to know what steps the Government are likely to take to make their position more bearable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that huge army of unemployed, we have people in employment who are feeling the pinch of the present situation very severely, due to the rise in the cost of living.  They have remained very quiet, and the country is fortunate in this, that a great number of people in the trade union movement realise that there is a crises in the world, and have tried to prevent industrial upheavals.  Fortunately the threat made by the Minister recently&mdash; shaking the whip at them and telling them that they must not make any effort to counteract the high cost of <Col N="152" /> living by seeking increases in their wages&mdash;has been explained away.  A good deal of satisfaction has been expressed in connection with it, but it does not end there.  The cause is there, and at any time it may come to a head. I fear that the burden will become so great that people generally will have to demand increases in wages.  What is the Government's attitude on that? Unemployment, as I have said, is going to go on increasing.  To my mind these are matters that are fundamental to the future of the country and to its ordinary everyday life.</P>
    <P>We had evidence recently that the farming community are feeling the burden.  I do not think they were well advised in the action they took, but at the same time I am of the opinion that the Government propaganda, and the powers which they exercised under the emergency legislation, will not get rid of the unrest that prevails amongst those people.  Hence we must take notice of possible turbulence in the country.  When I spoke on a former occasion about co-operation, I realised the serious position the country was in. After two months of war we find that the number of unemployed has gone up by something like 20,000.  We are told that some of the combatants are making preparations for a three years' war.  One does not want to have the imagination of Senator Fitzgerald to realise what that means.  How are we planning?  What steps are we taking to ensure that the ordinary, every-day life of the country will be carried on? These are points to which I would like the Minister to refer at the close of the debate.  I am offering no suggestion, beyond saying that we realise the serious position that confronts the country.  I am not going to scarify the Government.  I know their difficulties, but, as far as we are concerned, we are prepared to co-operate in helping them to solve our problems.  Certainly, we should have an expression of opinion from the Minister as to how the Government is going to deal with the hungry army, and what steps will be taken to increase social services?</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an <Col N="153" /> mBille seo.  Following the remarks of Senator Foran about the new Budget, unquestionably, the increase in the price of sugar has hit the poor people very heavily.  There is no doubt about that.  We have had discussions about farming in this House for some time, and on each occasion we have what is practically a repetition of the same speeches.  As the Minister has always shown great interest in the housing question, I want to impress upon him the necessity of doing something for Dublin at an early date.  I was speaking to one of our principal builders, who is carrying out a contract in the city, and he told me that he would shortly be compelled to disemploy all his hands, as the contract he had on hands for flats at Marrowbone Lane was ending.  The building trade in the city is at a very low ebb at present.  I think the Dublin Corporation has only one new contract on hands, and that the others will be completed soon after Christmas.  Knowing the Minister's interest in the housing question, as a loan of £7,000,000 is about to be floated, I hope he will give some consideration to the necessity of providing building schemes in Dublin.  Dublin Corporation has the ground developed for housing schemes, and the roads and sewers are completed.  The corporation is now held up for money.  I appeal to the Minister to give consideration to the question of continuing the building programme in Dublin.</P>

      <P>In connection with the discussions that took place in the last few days, I think the House should disassociate itself from some of the statements that were made.  I think it ill-becomes members of this House to make statements on the lines of those made by Senator McLoughlin.  We have been asked if the present taxation is the price of our neutrality.  My answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The price of our neutrality was paid by the blood and the sacrifices that were made by those who made it possible for us to assemble here and discuss this Bill.  If we have to make sacrifices now, in order to maintain the freedom that we have got, I think it will be well worth making them.  As a worker, I can cheerfully say that the workers are prepared to <Col N="154" /> bear any little imposts in the way of taxation that is necessary in order to achieve our full freedom.  I do not like the term &ldquo;Opposition&rdquo; being used in this House, because I understood that the Seanad was established as an attempt to set up a form of organisation on a vocational basis.  I cannot understand why this House should carry on on Party lines.  Every day we hear talk about the Opposition and about the Government supporters. That should not happen.  This House should consider representations from every section of the people, and should deal with any measures that come before it, not from the Government or from the Opposition point of view, but in the interests of the people who sent us here.</P>
      <P>Several speakers referred to the effect of these taxes on the poor.  If this House were an election platform, there would be some excuse for some of the remarks that were made.  Some of those who spoke in that way advocate derating and other schemes that would certainly impose greater taxation on the poor, but which would relieve people who are in a position to bear taxation.  While Senator Sir John Keane was speaking, I thought he might have mentioned a subject that I had in mind.  A new loan is about to be raised, and I notice from the terms mentioned that the interest will be 4 per cent.  I suggest that if the rate of interest was reduced to 3 per cent, or to 3¼ per cent., the loan would be just as well subscribed, and the £30,000 or £40,000 that would be saved in that way could be used for other useful purposes.  However, we heard nothing about the matter from the Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned the Senator's name because he knows more about that subject than I do, and I thought he might have referred to it. While it is rather late to make a suggestion now, perhaps the Minister would bear this in mind, that when this country was engaged in a struggle <Col N="155" /> for independence, our people in America generously came to our aid with financial assistance.  Now that we have secured freedom for part of our country, and when there is an attempt being made to build it up by doing work of national importance, and developing its resources, I believe if the Government asked our people in America, who helped to build up this State in the past, they would subscribe generously to such an appeal. That suggestion might be considered in the near future.  There is plenty of work to be done here.  We know that any amount of land is under water, that the rivers required to be drained, and that our sea fisheries, which have been neglected, should be developed. The only thing that is preventing that work being done is the want of money. I have the idea that money could be obtained, some, probably, at home, but some from our people across the water who, I think, would help us at this time.  This is about the only nation in Europe to-day which is not spending money for use in another direction, and I think it would be well if we made this clear to our people there.  I have another suggestion to make.  I think the present would be the ideal time to get into more close contact, both for international reasons and financial reasons, with our people in America.  We have something like 20,000,000 people there and, if properly organised, these people could exercise a great influence on the American nation.  We seem to be losing touch with them since we got our freedom, and I think an effort should be made now to develop closer contact with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to unemployment and social services, I believe that, to an extent, some of the money being spent on these services is wasted, because while we have such large numbers of our people unemployed, the benefits that would naturally accrue if they were in productive occupations, or at least getting a decent wage, would be greater than the benefits arising from the money now being spent.  In order to explain my point, I want to give an <Col N="156" /> illustration.  Some weeks ago, I met a man who had been unemployed for about six weeks.  He has a family and he was notified one morning by the labour exchange to attend for work on a particular scheme.  He was allowed to work the day, but, in the evening, the ganger in charge of the work said: &ldquo;I do not think you are fit for this type of work.  Your health does not seem to be such as to enable you to carry on.&rdquo;  The man said he knew that, but asked what he could do in view of being unemployed for such a long time. The ganger notified the labour exchange, and, because the man was not eligible for work, he was struck off the dole.  The alternative for him was home assistance, but home assistance is only assistance.  The point I want to make is that if machinery goes wrong, an expert examines it, and the new parts required are put in.  In the case of that man, however, there is no system by which he could be examined with a view to finding out what the deficiency was, and how soon he could be put back to work again.  Probably that man will be drawing home assistance for the rest of his life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested to me that in connection with this whole matter, the experience of Sweden may not be without interest to the House.  In Sweden, as I understand, the principle is that the Budget is balanced but not with reference to a particular year, which, after all, is a purely arbitrary period of time in the history of economic affairs, but with reference to what is called &ldquo;the business cycle,&rdquo; which is likely to run for a matter of five or ten years.  In other words, in time of prosperity, they budget for a surplus of revenue which is used for the reduction of national debt, and, in time of adversity, acute business depression or economic dislocation, they allow their Budget to remain unbalanced for a year or two, and borrow from the banking system the means of maintaining the public services.  There is a lot to be said for a policy of that kind, if we were dealing with a country of the wisdom and experience in public matters of that great democracy of Sweden.  Incidentally, I may observe, in passing, that <Col N="157" /> professional economists wield great influence in Sweden, and it is partly in consequence of their advice that the Swedish Government has, in recent years, adopted that policy of deliberately allowing a deficit to take place in certain times, budgeting for a surplus in certain other times and balancing the Budget with reference to a period of five or ten years and not necessarily with reference to a single year.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to say that I cannot recommend a similar policy for this country, partly for the obvious reason that this country is not governed or dominated by the wisdom of economists, but if the wisdom of professional economists had had any influence in the guidance of the affairs of this nation over the last seven years, then I may say that I, personally, in 1931, would not have been prepared to recommend the increase of taxation that was adopted by the Government of that day with a view to balancing their Budget.  At that time, a time when the world was suffering, not from real want, but from a terrific glut of goods cluttering up the channels of commerce which were trying to achieve consumption and were unable to do so, it would have been, in my view, sound policy to allow the money incomes of individuals to remain higher than they were allowed to remain by budgetary stringency, in order to contribute towards a restoration of the proper balance between consumption and production, and the maintenance of world production and world trade.  However, the wisdom of financial orthodoxy and even the wisdom of orthodox economists, in that year, took the form of advising that taxation should be increased, but in the light of subsequent events, I think it is true to say that professional economic opinion would be that, in a crisis of the 1931 type, budget balancing by increased taxation is not the obvious and necessary remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, we cannot argue from what would have been wisdom in 1931 to conditions which are totally different in 1939, for now we are confronted with a world which is not a world bursting with surplus wealth and excessive production, but a world threatened with a world-wide scarcity, <Col N="158" /> on account mainly of the terrific destruction of goods taking place in Europe, and on account of the wasteful economic policies pursued in our own country, and in others, during the last seven years.  We have had in the interval restrictionist economic policies, and, consequently, it would not be wise to recommend now expansionist monetary policies or to recommend any acquiescence in budgetary deficits. Consequently, although I deplore the restrictionist economic policies of the Government during the last seven years, I applaud the stringent financial Budget of the Government which is on all fours with their own restrictionist economic policies, for the one thing that no country can tolerate, and the high road to public ruin in any country, is a combination of economic restriction and monetary expansion.</P>
    <P>I said enough yesterday to give reasons for thinking that the policies pursued during the last seven years had, on the whole, the effect of impoverishing this nation rather than enriching it, and I do not propose to develop that argument further now, but there are other matters that might be referred to in this connection.  The outbreak of the economic war was not something for which our Government should be exclusively blamed.  It takes two to make any quarrel, and two Governments were concerned in that problem, but, at the same time, I think it is true to say that the opportunity presented by the outbreak of that war was seized upon by our Government to push through a policy of rapid industrial development which, under ordinary circumstances, would not have been accepted even by their own followers.</P>
    <P>They took advantage of the situation in order to pursue a restrictionist economic policy with a view to creating, as far as possible, a self-contained national economy.  That was no doubt good politics, but exactly the same kind of thing seems to be happening now.  The emergency created by the outbreak of the European War is being seized on by our Government, not to develop a policy of economic expansion which might enrich the country here, while at the same time co-operating with our neighbours, but to pursue to <Col N="159" /> a still further degree the impoverishment and perversion of our national economic structure.</P>
    <P>Let me develop that in some more detail.  I have been challenged on the question of beet.  If our farmers were not going to grow beet next year&mdash;at a terrific expense to the consumers of sugar and to the taxpayers, who by that policy are going to pay £1,500,000 more in taxation than otherwise&mdash;if they were not going to devote 60,000 acres to the growing of beet next year, then it is presumably agreed that they will grow things like mangolds and turnips and other forage crops instead and use them for the feeding of animals.  Those animals in due course would reach the market and be exported and consumed probably in England, and with the money thus acquired we would buy many other things like sugar, which we do not produce ourselves.  In other words we would be pursuing a policy of economic co-operation with our neighbours, while at the same time pursuing a policy on all fours with our natural economic conditions which are to promote and foster live stock production based on grass, our principal raw material, and the cultivation of root crops of which we do not produce half enough.</P>
    <P>One of the results of this artificial production of beet is that the acreage devoted to mangolds and turnips has diminished, I think, by more than the acreage under beet has increased.  To develop our economic facilities in the right direction we must enrich the country as a whole without impoverishing farmers, as we seem to be doing by wasting land on the growing of beet.  We should use that land instead for the growing of other things in a general live stock policy.  That policy would be the policy of encouraging agricultural expansion, not at the expense of the consumer and the taxpayer, but undoubtedly with the effect of increasing the proportion of our total output which would be either exported or consumed.  If that policy were established it would enrich the country and bring good to all concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Government policy is with reference to this question <Col N="160" /> of co-operation with Great Britain, but if we are prepared to co-operate in the economic field with Britain we can get better terms there now than we could have got at any time in the last seven years.  We can get terms now that will guarantee the future advancement and prosperity of this country, which depends on agricultural development more than any other single factor.</P>
    <P>In my view, the opportunities for rapid increase of the national income by expansion of our much-neglected agricultural industry are by far the greatest opportunities which are available to us.  That expansion means an expansion for export, as the home market is rigidly limited by the fact that we have a population of only 3,000,000 people, and our urban population consumes only about £12,000,000 of the agricultural production produced at home.  We must expand for export, and that export must be to England; so that provides us with a reason why we should now approach England, not by civil servants, but by responsible members of the Government, with a view to determining the terms of economic co-operation on a basis which would be most favourable for us.  I would urge the Government to consider that aspect of the matter very seriously.  If we do, and if we take that policy of economic expansion rather than economic restriction, we will make up for Budgetary alleviations and will have no trouble whatever in balancing the Budget.  Instead of increasing taxation, this expanding of the real national wealth will produce greater real revenue than is obtained by the existing taxation rates.</P>

I am afraid my capacity is limited, that I could not, even if I tried, attempt to follow the distinguished gentlemen who went into those realms.  I do not intend to try.

      <P>No, not a bit boring. I am certainly not bored at any time when a man is using his opportunities to press forward a policy that he conscientiously believes in.  I do not find any fault at all with that.  I can say to the Senator and to the House that I have been brought up on another policy.  As I said last night here, there are many admirers of Arthur Griffith in this House on both sides.  He was my teacher, and I was his colleague in pressing forward that policy and in doing the best I could to get it adopted.  When I became a member of the Government, I enthusiastically took the opportunity to put it into practice.  It was not by reason of the economic war arising or in any other haphazard way that the policy of protection was inaugurated by the Government when they came into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who are interested might throw their minds back to the programme and policy on which this Government was elected in a sufficient majority to form a Government.  That programme of protection&mdash;the programme of the old Sinn Féin organisation&mdash; was the economic programme on which we stood before the country and got the first time, not a majority, indeed, but just enough to be elected as a Government.  Our deliberate intention was, economic war or no economic war, to put that policy into operation in the country, and we have done it.  The Senator and some of <Col N="162" /> his colleagues will say we have done it with disastrous results, but the country does not say that.  That policy has been put to the country on several occasions since 1932; the country has had at least three opportunities of deciding.  The issues were put fully to the country, I believe, by both sides.  The Opposition used their opportunity properly to put their views before the country and criticised and pointed out the failures and the hurtful way&mdash;as they said&mdash; that that policy was interfering with the country's prosperity and welfare in general and particularly the way in which it was hurting agriculture.  All that was thrashed out over and over again, during general elections, in between general elections and at other times up to the present.  We do not know how the next general election in four or five years' time may result, when we come before that same judge to which we all have to come&mdash;the Irish populace.  The Irish voters will decide then but, at any rate, up to the present they have backed that policy.</P>
    <P>Of course, I know it is true that at a general election you have not a clear issue on an economic programme. There are a number of other things that get mixed up with it&mdash;politics and other things.  Of course economics are a part of politics too, but it is not easy as I say to get a verdict on the economic issue alone.  We have had nothing like a referendum on economics so far, and I hope that we shall not, but it is only in some way like that, that you could have a single issue of that kind decided.  In a general election, you have a variety of issues all taken together but, within reason, I think we can claim that the economic issue was put to the country and debated fully by both sides and that the country gave its verdict.  We had to abide by that.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter talked of the great increase in taxation.  It was not so much to the increase of taxation he referred as to the relative capacity of the people to meet the taxation imposed. As far as the figures show, there is no reason to believe that the capacity to bear taxation has lessened. Take the various items.  There was an increase in the tax on tobacco last May. So far as I can understand from the <Col N="163" /> revenue returns, there is nothing to show that consumption has decreased. Of course, if we go back over a long time and look at the consumption of beer and spirits, consumption had radically decreased over the last 15 or 20 years.  That may be due largely to the price of beer and spirits.  I know there are people who say that they would be able to imbibe a good deal more if they could afford it, but I think it is also true that the habits of the people have changed.  Some people may argue that they changed because they had to change.  I do not think that is true.  I think the habits of the people have changed away from liquor and that they find other ways of spending their money, perhaps with better advantage to themselves and to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>On the economic issue there does seem to be a definite dividing line between members of the Opposition, or, at any rate, between some of them, and the present Government and those who support them in the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>

On this particular issue, there are some who may agree with Senators on the other side, but whatever the difference is, it is pretty evident that some Opposition Senators do not intend to give the Government any support on the economic policy at present in operation in the country. They are entitled to do that and nobody objects to it.  At any rate the policy of the Government is a protectionist policy.  It has protected the home market and it is going to continue that policy.  A good deal has also been done for the farmer.  The Taoiseach went into that matter on the last day we were discussing the Budget in the Dáil.  I do not intend taking up the time of the House going into that matter again, but I would refer anybody, who has not read the speech of the Taoiseach before, to that speech now.  He will find therein figures and particulars of what the Government has tried to do to provide additional moneys for agriculture.</P>
      <P>Moneys have been provided to a very considerable extent to assist agriculture. Part of the moneys we are now looking for, by way of loan, will also go to help agriculture.  We announced in the Dáil in the last few weeks that the Minister for Agriculture has got sanction from the Government for a scheme of agricultural credits to facilitate the purchase of machinery, manures, etc.  Funds have been put at the disposal of the Minister for this purpose.</P>

It is very hard to satisfy everybody.  I think if Saint Michael were here, as Minister for Finance, he could not satisfy everybody or go anywhere near it.</P>

      <P>I agree, first things first.  I agree that agriculture occupies a very prominent position in this country.  A very large part of the people of this country derive a livelihood from agriculture.  That is fundamental to the situation.  That has been borne in mind by this Government. Again I may say&mdash;I said it last night and I repeat it now&mdash;that this Government would not be in office if it had not the backing of the farmers of the country.  It has not the backing of all of them, I know only too well.  The majority, as I have said, derive their living out of agriculture in one way or another, so that their interests must have been touched by the actions of this Government.  Therefore, if the interests of agriculture were as adversely affected as some Senators would seem to think, judging by the speeches we have listened to here this evening and yesterday, surely those farmers would have turned against the Government, and have turned it out of office at any time from 1933 on.</P>

      <P>That is one item, unquestionably, that is hurtful to the farmer, but there were even bigger <Col N="166" /> things, because during the economic war the price of cattle went down by 20 or 25 per cent.</P>

      <P>I will not dispute that with the Senator.  He knows more about it than I do.  Unquestionably, the farmers were badly hit, but it was not all due to the economic war.  Everybody knows that there was a big fall in prices started in 1929 or 1930 and continued for some years.  But even if we say that a certain amount of the decrease in prices was due to the economic war, and that the farmers were badly hit, nevertheless, as I have said, they did not turn out this Government and they could have done so if they wanted to.  They evidently were not sufficiently hit to do that, or else they felt that the Government were trying to do something for them and for the country that eventually would be to the advantage of both.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not able to answer that question now, but I think if I were to ask the Minister for Agriculture he would be able to tell me. He knows his facts in regard to agriculture. No man knows his <i>metier</i> better than the present Minister for Agriculture, and I am sure that if he gave me an answer to the Senator's question it would be one that I could stand over.  It would be my desire to see all the money that the State could afford put into productive enterprises. The other night, after spending a long time debating economies, seeing if economies could be made where people did not want to see them, I was presented at the end of the meeting with a Supplementary Estimate for Forestry for £30,000 odd.  That Estimate is before the Dáil to-day.  I do not know whether Senator Baxter will regard <Col N="167" /> that as productive expenditure or not. Of course, it is productive, but it takes a long time to fructify.  It is really reproductive expenditure, but there will be no return, in the way of value, from it for 20, 30 or 40 years.</P>

      <P>We have increased expenditure considerably on afforestation in the last seven years.  I imagine that Senator Baxter has a special interest in the subject, but I want to tell him that during the period I have mentioned we have doubled the acreage under forests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be a great lot, but at any rate the acreage, as I have said, has been doubled.  On the other hand, we are criticised for every penny of additional taxation. While the members of the Opposition criticise us severely, they never give us a word of credit for expenditure of that kind.  Senator Baxter is interested in that subject, and there, at any rate, is one item on which we have spent a considerable sum.  He might at least have said that that money was well spent.  During the debate on this Budget to-day and yesterday we had not one word from Senator Baxter or from any member of the Opposition saying that any single item of this additional expenditure for which we are making provision was worthy of support. I think we had a word of commendation from a member of the Labour Party in regard to one item, but that was all.  On forestry, Senator Baxter might have said a word about this expenditure, because I am sure he agrees with it.  We have done a great deal in connection with afforestation compared to what was done by the last Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>The mention of this subject takes my mind back to the early <Col N="168" /> beginnings of the movement that brought the Parliament, and the measure of independence that we enjoy, into existence.  In the early Sinn Féin days, afforestation was one of the great things advocated by Arthur Griffith, and I would love to see it go ahead.  I would be prepared to give it every backing that I could.  As I have said, there is a Supplementary Estimate for Forestry before the Dáil to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is £30,000 odd, and I am often put to the pin of my collar to meet demands for much smaller sums.  The sum of £30,000 is not to be sneezed at.  The Senator would like to see more credit made available for agriculture.  I would like to see agriculture get as much as we could afford, taking the demands of all classes of the community into consideration. He says that agriculture is entitled to first consideration.  I agree. At the same time, I remember that at the end of the last war, although I have not had any connection with agriculture personally, I was asked by friends and members of my own Party to go with them to interview the bank directors of various banks in Dublin to try to get some settlements made in cases where, I think, the banks had been too generous in giving credit during the last war.  The criticism that I have heard from all sides has been that, during the last war, the banks were over-generous in giving credit to agriculturists.  Some of the banks have suffered for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>For giving credit to buy farms at fabulous prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>To buy farms in some cases and, in others, to buy cattle, and for other forms of agricultural work.  I remember having had the experience of going to the headquarters of three different banks in Dublin with the people I have referred to.  We met bank directors and managers.  The position was that the individuals I have referred to were not able to meet their obligations.  I am bound to say that I found those bank directors and managers reasonable men to deal with, and that they treated their clients, in <Col N="169" /> these cases at any rate, with due consideration. I do not know what sums of money these same bank directors had to write off, but probably it ran into hundreds of thousands of pounds.</P>
      <P>I do not know what it was.  In cases I came across, some of them were for considerable amounts of money, that they agreed to write off.  I do not want to say that in order to induce anyone who may hear me, or who may read what I have said, to tighten the purse strings, and not be generous or give credit.  I think where they find an individual credit-worthy, or find farmers to be industrious men who will make a sincere and honest effort to honour their bonds and obligations, the banks will meet these men to the fullest extent in their power.  That was the history in the past, and I am sure there will not be any change in the future.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the farmers' attitude towards the Government, and their recent activities, Senator Baxter mentioned that, as far as he knew, some of the gentlemen from the farmers' organisation who were active in recent attacks against the Government were members of the Fianna Fáil Party. Maybe the Senator said former members of Fianna Fáil.  I think in some cases that came to my notice they are actual members.  I do not think that proves anything.  Some of the most enthusiastic and active backers of Fianna Fáil since it was founded are former members of the Senator's Party.  We would not be here only we got the backing of a great many former supporters of his Party.  They saw the light.</P>

Senator Hayes said it was not the previous Minister for Finance nor the present Minister for Finance should be blamed in matters of that kind.  It is Government policy, and whoever the Minister <Col N="170" /> is, he has to take the responsibility of standing for that policy and backing it.</P>

      <P>Not in politics anyway, as many in this House should know.  This question of taxes under Schedule A is an intricate one.  It is one in which no Minister for Finance could give a considered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; without detailed examination. The Valuation Bill was already before the Dáil.  I suppose it will be coming before this House as soon as the Dáil is finished with it, when matters of that kind, Schedule A and others, will get consideration.</P>

      <P>May I suggest to the Minister that he should put himself into the position of a judge when reconsidering the matter by listening to others besides his official advisers? I am afraid that in these matters the Government is very much influenced, when taking up an attitude, by hearing only one side of a story&mdash;the official side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to hear Senator Sir John Keane at any time he wishes to come along.  I know a little about the matter, but not very much.  If the Senator wishes to see me I would be happy to hear anything he has to say, or any friend that he cares to bring along.  As to the speech of Senator Baxter, I agree that we ought to go in for increased production. Senator Hayes made the same point about increased production for export as well as for home consumption.  The more we can produce and the more we can sell, the more we will be able to buy.  Certainly, I am old enough in the way I have been brought up in not wanting to go back, as someone described it, to the Robinson Crusoe method.  I do not want to change. Whatever modern means have been invented to make life easier, as far as they can be availed of I hope to encourage <Col N="171" /> them.  If we cannot make those things at home, I suppose we will have to import them, but if we want to import them according to the economic laws, we will have to find the money to buy them with exports.  We will keep the figure as low as possible by making as much as we can at home. There are things we cannot get here, and these we will have to continue to import.  Therefore, we will have to do all we can to encourage everyone here to produce more and more.</P>
      <P>On the subject of export that opens up the remarks of Senator Hayes, there is no reason why Ministers should not go to meet Ministers in Great Britain, or in any other country, in an effort to find markets for our agriculture or other produce, or to increase our exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  But there are two sides to that question. Senator Hayes suggested that from 1932 I said I thought there was a settlement in sight.  I had reason for making that statement at that time. The Senator said it took six years to get Ministers to negotiate with British Ministers.  That is not correct, to the extent that I was in London, and the Taoiseach and three or four other Ministers were in England at different times negotiating and making efforts to try to make a settlement.  I made a statement in 1932 that I thought a settlement was in sight.  I had good reason for making it, but other people were not able to get their views adopted by their own Government. Perhaps the settlement would have come in 1932.  It was a hope, but it was not realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difficulty in the situation now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such difficulty now, but it takes two.  We have not been failing in our efforts to get prices improved, and to get markets improved, and if there was any belief that these markets could be improved <Col N="172" /> or expanded for our use and benefit by Ministers going to London or anywhere else, there is no reason why they would not go.  They have no objection to going.  As to remarks of Senator Campbell and Senator Foran, I know that our social services are not as high and are not as generous as those of other countries.  I know that there is not a living, such as we would like to see given widows and orphans and unemployed people, to be got out of even the most generous unemployment assistance given where families are large.  I think the same might apply to old age pensions.  But when some of these social services were introduced the cost of living was higher than it is now. All I can say is that the Government does think of the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be able to say more.  I should like to be able to say that we would increase the old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions, but I do not see any prospect of that immediately.  I should like to do it, and the Government would like to do it.  I know there are bound to be increases, and already we have seen increases in certain items that form a material part of the ordinary ways of living of our people.  There is nobody who has ever suggested that workers, whether wage earners or salaried workers, would not, and should not, ask for increases.  No Government could stop that and no Government here, at any rate, intends to stop it.  What I did say was that we remember the disastrous consequences of the vicious circle of rises during the last war, and that we would make every effort to prevent the disastrous consequences of the collapse that occurred afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Healy's point, I am not aware that the Dublin Corporation has been left without money arising out of any action of the Government, or of the Minister for Finance, in recent months.  I know that, quite recently, the Minister for Local Government told the Dublin <Col N="173" /> Corporation that £250,000 was at their disposal for a certain housing scheme.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Corporation, when it wants more, will not fail to ask for it, but my recollection, and I was on the Corporation for a long time, is that the Corporation were always able to stand on their own feet, and did not have to come, hat in hand, to the Government, or to the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>No, it does not follow, because the credit of the Corporation, so far as the manager is concerned, has certainly not been injured by the economic management introduced by him.</P>
      <P>I do not know much about Sweden, but I was interested in what Senator Johnston said about the system they adopted in Sweden of cycles of budgets and being able to run for a number of years, short or long, with deficits while waiting for the rosy time when surpluses would be available which they could earmark to wipe out their deficits.  Would it not be a magnificent thing for a Government to be able to remain in power for five years, running up deficits all the time, and then to get out, and leave those who followed to meet their obligations?  It might not be as good a system as some people, perhaps, think.</P>

      <P>As unfortunately I was not able to be present at the Second Reading, I would like to ask whether the policy involved in these duties is in general that of restriction and an increase of duties or that of a diminution of duties and freer trade?</P>

      <P>A certain number of Orders have been made in consequence of the London Agreement of 1938 and as a result of certain references which were before the Prices Commission and recommendations thereon.  So far as some of them do represent a diminution of duty I suppose they do represent freer trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some points in regard to reference No. 3 in the Schedule to which I wish to direct the attention of the Minister and the House.  It is the reference which deals with the imposition of duties on sutures and ligatures used for surgical purposes.  Before speaking at all on this matter I wish to make it clear that I do not desire to raise any criticism on the quality of the home-produced material.  It would be unjust to make such a criticism until there is a chance of proving their value.  As far as I could get information from those who have used the home-prepared material, it has given entire satisfaction. I want to make that clear, as I have some comments to make on the manner in which this Order is introduced and on the effect it has, which might be regarded as carrying with them some criticism on the quality of the material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I have been able to learn, the quality has given entire satisfaction to those who have used these Irish sutures and ligatures.  I think, however, the House would expect that, before imposing an Order of this sort dealing with a highly technical matter, some persons who had knowledge based on their own experience of the effects likely to be produced by this Order would be asked their opinions and would be consulted in the matter.  I do not know whether the Department or the Minister at the time did seek advice on such matters, but it is clear that in his own Department he had no one who could give him any advice from the technical point of view.  He may have sought advice through other persons in conference. The Minister may be able to answer that query; but, as far as advice from any representative body which could have spoken on behalf of the surgical profession as a whole or with the expert knowledge that only <Col N="177" /> surgeons could possess, I think neither the Medical Union, which represents the whole profession, nor the Royal College of Surgeons, which represents particularly the surgical branch, was consulted.  The first that the ordinary operating surgeons or hospitals knew about the Order was when it came into effect and when they found a very considerable increase in the prices of materials which they had been accustomed to use.  It has to be admitted, of course, that the manufacture is carried out under strict Governmental control and that otherwise no manufacture of any therapeutical substances is allowed in this country.  Whether produced in this country or elsewhere, those therapeutical substances are not allowed except under licence of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and upon its being proved to his satisfaction that the methods of production and that the premises where the production is carried on comply with very strict regulations.  That applies whether the manufacture is inside Ireland or in another part of the world. I know the Minister's inspectors have visited, not only British factories where therapeutical substances are manufactured but also American factories which are licensed to import them into this country.</P>
    <P>From these two points of view&mdash;that of quality and control&mdash;I have no complaint whatever to make.  I think, however, it is a principle of which the House should not approve that an imposition of a duty like this should be made without consultation with those persons best fitted to give advice.  This Order has been brought in without consultation and even without the knowledge of surgeons, until they learned from the dealers that they had to pay nearly double what was paid before for certain products.</P>
    <P>I think it is important to point out some of the effects of the increased cost on certain parties concerned. Prior to the imposition of this duty&mdash; which took place, I think, about six or seven months ago&mdash;the price of a dozen tubes of catgut for a particular purpose of surgical use, of British manufacture and allowing for discount, was 11/2.  The price of the American product <Col N="178" /> was 9/7.  From June to October the prices were raised by the imposition of a duty of 75 per cent. in the case of the American and 50 per cent. in the case of the British produced goods, and they have risen from 11/2 to 16/8 and from 9/7 to 14/5 respectively. From June to October the Irish product came on the market and was produced, allowing for discount, at 9/7 for the same quantity of the same material.  That is to say, there was a very direct inducement&mdash;more than an inducement, almost a compulsion&mdash;put on surgeons and hospitals using this material, to use Irish materials.</P>
    <P>In November and at the beginning of December the prices rose further, and the British price now is 17/7 as compared with 11/2 before the Order was introduced.  The American price is 14/5 as compared with 9/7 before the Order was introduced.  The price for the Irish goods since the 1st November has been raised from 9/7 to 12/&mdash;roughly a 25 per cent. increase, so that the natural result of this Order has been not only to raise the prices of imported goods but to give the manufacturer here the power to raise his own prices after a few months' control.  These are the figures so far as I have been able to-get them; I took them from the most trustworthy source I could.  It is a serious matter that, in the case of any substances such as these which are essential to the carrying on of surgical work, there should have been such a high percentage increase in cost.</P>
    <P>Who has to bear that cost?  The greatest part of that cost has to fall on the general hospitals and these get very little consideration now, as people think that they have an unlimited source of demand for any money they want.  That is not their own experience. This increase also falls on the nursing homes, which are trading institutions run for profit and carrying on a service very essential to the community.  The private hospitals or nursing homes have very considerable difficulty in meeting costs as it is, without having to pay any increased cost.  The costings have to be done by the manager or proprietors with very great care.  The individual surgeon, of course, will also have to meet these increased costs in <Col N="179" /> cases where he has to supply material for private patients outside nursing homes.  Ultimately the cost to a considerable extent falls on the patients; in the nursing homes it must fall on the patients if the nursing home is to continue.</P>
    <P>Although that is an important point, it is not the most important.  The most important point is that compulsion is put on the surgeon, on other than professional grounds, to use certain goods. His choice is limited.  A surgeon of experience who has tried various substances recommended to him and who has decided in his judgment and in the interests of his patients&mdash;he has no personal interest more than that&mdash;that he prefers to use a certain material, now finds that compulsion is put on him to a certain extent either to increase the cost to his patient considerably or to use an article with which he was previously unfamiliar.</P>
    <P>That is a point to which attention was drawn in the debate in the other House, and the Minister used some phrases which I think showed the danger of this procedure.  In column 668 of the Official Debates on the 29th November, on the subject of the exercise of choice by the surgeon, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It may be that a certain element of prejudice may enter into these things.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No element of prejudice can enter in. The surgeon's only object is the protection of his patients, and if this is to be called prejudice, call it prejudice, but it is a misnomer.  He is certainly loath to use an article which he has not tried, of which he has no report and no experience, when he knows that another article has given every satisfaction in the past.  The Minister went on to add almost a paraphrase of what I have just said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Naturally, surgeons who have relied for a long time upon the satisfactory products of other manufacturers may not be disposed readily to change, but I think Deputy Cosgrave will agree that it may sometimes be necessary to induce surgeons to look at the products of alternative manufacturers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> I submit that it is not necessary for the Government to induce&mdash;call it induce, but put it in inverted commas &mdash;surgeons to change from the materials which they have found useful to patients and in which they have confidence. The word &ldquo;induce&rdquo; is misplaced in such a sense.  The effect of the Order is almost to put compulsion on surgeons in certain cases to adopt these.  So far any harm may not have been caused by the use of this particular product, but the principle involved is bad.  Where interference is being made by a tax which affects the lives and health of people who have to submit to surgical operations, I think it confirms my view that the advice and opinions of the responsible authorities should be invited before such an Order is made.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which I think is of some importance.  I do not desire to cast any reflection on the status of this company.  I believe it is the only company which is carrying on the manufacture of these products in Ireland, but, according to reports in the Press, it has been registered with a capital of £100.  I have no doubt that there is plenty of money behind the company, but its nominal capital, as reported in the Press, is £100.  Accidents may happen with the best product, and a patient who suffers injury, or the friends of a patient who suffers death following the use of ligatures or sutures, might conceivably bring an action for damages.  We saw recently a case tried in Dublin in regard to a deplorable accident of this kind which occurred in Waterford.  We saw how certain persons, who considered themselves aggrieved, took an action against an English manufacturing company of the highest repute, for damages.  They did not succeed in their action, but that point is irrelevant. What is the possibility of a patient or the friends of a patient recovering damages against a company whose capital is limited to £100?  That seems a very grave matter for the Government Order to have made possible. There are alternative courses of action, of course, for the patient or the friends of the patient to consider.  They may take an action against the surgeon or against the tradesman who sold <Col N="181" /> the products he has got from the manufacturer. That would certainly be an injustice to the surgeon, who has no opportunity of testing the materials except by experience, even under the &ldquo;inducement&rdquo; put to him by the Department of Industry and Commerce. If an action is taken against him, he may have a good defence, but he is put to considerable trouble, and his reputation is at stake.  Probably he will have to bear his own costs.</P>
    <P>A similar statement would be true in regard to an action against a trading firm which has sold the goods.  They simply buy them in bulk from the manufacturers and sell them retail.  It would be grossly unfair if they had to suffer any penalty for an accident arising from the use of articles which they had only handled in packages and when they were not in any way responsible for the quality of the material supplied. It might be urged, as it might have been in the Waterford case, that by selling these materials they guaranteed them.  That might or might not hold with the jury, but, in any event, it is not just that a trader should be put to considerable expense and risk in that way.  I should be very glad if the Minister could assure us that no such accidents could happen.</P>
    <P>There are three points which I should like the Minister to explain.  The first as whether he can say if any consultation was held by his Department before this order was made, and, if such consultation was held, why was it not held with some representative body that could speak authoritatively for the medical profession?  Secondly, can he give any justification for the increased expense entailed as a result of this order, and thirdly, can he say why the company was registered with such a small capital as £100?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Sir, that I should emphasise a point which Senator Rowlette has made, that so far, at any rate, the products of this company have <Col N="182" /> afforded no ground for complaint, that they are of a quality which would be generally and almost universally accepted by the members of the surgical profession.  I think I should also stress that the whole process of manufacture is under almost constant supervision by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think more frequently. I am informed that batches of samples of catgut are submitted to tests by the State authorities and that, in fact, the products of this firm are supervised in exactly the same way as the product of any British or Continental firm would be.  Therefore, I take it, it is rather unlikely that these products would be the cause or the occasion of disease, and that it would be a very difficult matter indeed to convince a jury if such a case as the Senator has mentioned were to be brought before them, that sutures and ligatures manufactured by the firm were the source of any infection which a patient might contract.  I am only making that point to show that at any rate the profession is not asked to use an article in the preparation and manufacture of which any less care was taken than would be taken in the manufacture of any alternative product. Furthermore, I would suggest that a person who suffers by reason of the fact that a surgeon was to some extent forced, or induced, to use this particular article is not likely on the whole to be at any loss merely by reason of the fact that the capitalisation of the company concerned seems to be inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that if a case like that arose, and that it was clearly ascribable to some carelessness in the manufacture, that for its own protection the firm involved would make some reasonable amend, so far as a monetary amend could be made to the person concerned.  I am saying that not because I feel that the position is satisfactory, because I, personally, do not think it is.  I feel that if a company is carrying on a manufacture of this sort it ought to be a substantial concern <Col N="183" /> in every way.  On the other hand, it is not, I think, correct to say that the nominal capital of this concern is only £100.  There are two companies involved.  There is the primary concern manufacturing at Castlebellingham, which makes catgut, and the firm which carries out the process of sterilisation.  The latter has a capital to the order of £100, but the company manufacturing at Castlebellingham is more substantial.  At the same time, I feel myself that it is a matter that will have to be looked into.  I shall ask my Department to examine and see whether we cannot create a more satisfactory position so far as the capitalisation of the undertaking goes.</P>
    <P>Now, it is not correct to say that no members of the profession were consulted before this Order was made. The Department of Local Government and Public Health was consulted at, I think, every stage in the preliminary investigations and, naturally, we have to assume that the medical staff of that Department is competent to advise us in regard to this matter.  As well as that, I understand that arrangements were being made to receive a deputation from the Irish Medical Union.  They asked to be received in regard to this matter, but, for some reason or another of which we are unaware, the Union did not proceed with its request.  In fact, the reception of the deputation fell through.  That would seem to indicate that the matter was not felt to be such a very important one as the Senator has represented it to be here.</P>
    <P>On the question of price, perhaps I did not hear the Senator quite correctly, but, as I understood it, prior to the imposition of the duty the price of a dozen tubes of British manufacture was 11/2, and of materials of American manufacture, 9/7.  Between the date of the imposition of the duty and June, the price of the British manufactured article was increased to 16/8 per dozen tubes, and the price of the United States manufacture to 14/5.</P>
    <P>From June to October, when the Irish manufacture came on the market, it was priced at 9/7 for a dozen tubes, <Col N="184" /> so that the position then was that the Irish manufacture was procurable at a lower price than the British tubes would previously have been.  It is quite true that the price of the foreign manufactured articles was artificially raised, but at the same time the surgeon had a choice.  He was not precluded from using this if he felt the Irish manufactured article was so much inferior to the British or American manufacture as to warrant his paying the difference in the case of any operation.</P>
    <P>Personally, speaking as a layman, I cannot see that any great hardship was imposed on the surgeon.  It may be that I underestimate the quantities of the material which would be used in any critical operation, and that perhaps these figures will impose a much heavier monetary burden upon the surgeon than, on the face of them, they would appear to do.  As I say, that is a matter on which I am not competent to speak, but on the figures the Senator has put before me I do not think, if the matter were a really serious one, that the element of compulsion on the surgeon is a very great one.  I may be quite wrong in that regard, and I speak subject to what the Senator will have to say in relation to it.</P>
    <P>After the 1st November there was apparently an increase in the price of the Irish goods.  I wonder if there has not been a commensurate increase in the price of the foreign manufactured article as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking of that.  It may be that the raw materials of which these articles are made have been subsidised in Great Britain, or it may be that heavy stocks of them were held in Great Britain, and that some sort of stand-still order operates there.  I gather, at any rate, that while the price of these materials was increased on the 1st November last, the price of the British materials has been increased since the 1st December, so that apparently the same cause has been operating in both countries to increase price, the only thing being that there was a lag of one month in Great Britain as compared with this country.  I am prepared to agree with the Senator that there is something unsatisfactory in entering into arrangements of this sort without consulting the people who will be most closely affected by it, but yet if such consultation had taken place, I think that perhaps the result might have been the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid so, too, because the position that we would be put in would be this: that we would have to allow one, two, or maybe ten dozen surgeons simply to veto a product of this sort.  As the Senator can see, that would be rather a difficult position for us to find ourselves in, because we either had to make up our minds that it was feasible to establish a manufacture of this sort and apply the same sort of inducements to surgeons as have had to be applied to consumers in this country in regard to a considerable number of manufactures, and that have had to be applied to consumers in other countries, including Great Britain, in regard to certain manufactures there, to induce them to take our products, or else we have to abandon these projects altogether.  I think, perhaps, in regard to projects <Col N="186" /> of this kind, where only certain vital considerations enter, it might be possible for us to make an emergency order, and then before the actual moment has been reached to continue that order as a duty during a period of manufacture, and have consultation with professional societies.  I will look into it to see if it will be possible to do that.  I would not like to hold out hope that it would be done with the idea that these professional organisations would have a veto on the project. It would be necessary to listen to their representations to see if anything could be done to meet them, before the manufacturers had entered into commitments for sites, plant, or matters of that sort.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, and as Senator Rowlette said very emphatically, I do not think the quality of these products can be impugned.  I gather that they are generally acceptable, that great care is exercised in their manufacture, and that as close supervision as is regarded as being normal is exercised over them.  With regard to the question of price I suppose that is the root of the whole policy.  If we make the price the determinant I am afraid we will have to abandon the policy of industrial development altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the assurance he gave at the end of his speech that he will give consideration to the question of consulting suitable organisations in advance in future.  He referred to reports made by the Medical Union and to correspondence with his predecessor.  The Order was not issued by the present Minister.  I understand the position was that the Order was in force, and was carried out by the trade for three or four months before it came to the notice of medical men.  They cannot read all these Orders.  Some of us do not understand them when we do read them.  There was talk of raising the question, but when they found that the Order was in force they took the view that the Minister takes, that it would be useless to meet the Minister or his staff, as it would be hopeless to expect them to reverse an Order that they had made. The point I want to impress upon the <Col N="187" /> Minister is that consultation should take place in advance and before the Order is issued.  He suggested that they could not meet a deputation with a view to accepting its views.  No deputation would be so foolish as to expect that.  What they hope for is that their views would be considered by the responsible Minister, or by the Department, before a definite decision was taken, not that a decision that had been taken should be altered, unless it was something very unusual.</P>
      <P>The suggestion was that the opinion of expert advisers should be considered in advance and should carry weight.  I have had to meet a good many Ministers through the years, and sometimes they accepted the views put before them and sometimes not.  I do not think anyone goes on a deputation expecting a Minister to accept everything suggested.  It was stated that advice had been taken on this matter from the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  What in the world would they know about it?  There is no surgeon on their staff.  There is probably not a medical man on their staffs who has touched a ligature for 25 years.  I am saying nothing against the officials.  They are not experts in this matter and could not be.  It shows a gross misunderstanding of the position by the Department of Industry and Commerce that they should think these people experts on such matters.  They are experts in regard to other matters, such as inspections and ensuring that regulations are carried out.  I interrupted the Minister rather precipitately when I said that the supervision is occasional.  I was thinking of actual inspections of factories and the taking of samples in the city.  As far as that goes it is all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my previous remarks I made no suggestion that there was anything wrong in the course of manufacture.  I emphasised that, as far as was known, everything was going well.  In regard to the prices quoted, what I was emphasising was the relative prices of the home produced article and the foreign article.  It is quite likely that this article will make its reputation and get trade on the merits.  I would be glad of that.  At the beginning it was <Col N="188" /> getting trade on the degree of compulsion exercised by a Department which really had no expert knowledge on the question.  I am grateful to the Minister for the consideration that he has promised to give the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be no harm to bring Senators' minds back to how this legislation with regard to pigs and bacon was first brought in.  I am sure every Senator read the report of the Pig Industry Tribunal that was issued about 1933. It was a very fine document, and gave a very good review of the whole pig and bacon situation.  It made certain recommendations which were afterwards more or less implemented by legislation.  That legislation was brought in in 1935 and set up two boards.  The big idea in the recommendation was to have a fixed price for pigs, because we had the situation for some years before that where prices fluctuated very rapidly and, in fact, fluctuated geographically.  Even on the same day the price of pigs was very different in one district from the price in another.  The fixed price was what we wanted to get at, and, in order to fix a price for pigs, many other things were necessary.  Under that Bill two boards were set up, and their composition was such that we had representatives of bacon curers on the Bacon Board and representatives of producers and bacon curers on the Pigs Board. At the same time we had been compelled before that to regulate exports, because the British Government had regulated imports in such a way that they were prepared to give a quota to the Government of any country trading in bacon by negotiation or agreement. The export quota was estimated <Col N="189" /> roughly at the amount of bacon we thought we could afford to export as being surplus requirements for home consumption.</P>
      <P>We were asked by the British Government to give them that estimate about the end of November each year for the following year. That was a thing apart. The boards had no control over it, but, of course, they knew what the amount of export for the year would be, and they had to take that export into account when dealing with the various matters that came before them.</P>
      <P>The first thing the Bacon Board had to deal with was the production quota. They dealt with that monthly, and the production quota was really a calculation by the board of the number of pigs that might be available in the country for the month to come.  It was varied from time to time, and it never varied downwards, but sometimes upwards; in other words, the Bacon Board at times under-estimated the number of pigs that might come on the market, and had to bring in a supplementary production quota.  The second thing the Bacon Board had to deal with was the matter of home sales.  The home sales were fixed by the Bacon Board and, again it was an estimate of the amount of bacon that might be absorbed on the home market at the price which bacon might fetch having regard to the price of pigs.  These are the two matters the Bacon Board had to deal with, and, as Senators will see, they were merely estimates, firstly, of the number of pigs available for absorption by the factories and, secondly, of the amount of bacon that might be required on the home market for the following month. The production quota was not, as some people have thought, the sum of the amount of bacon to be exported for the month, plus the amount to be consumed for the month at home, because sometimes there might be a carry-over of bacon from one month to another, and, at other times, there might be no carry-over, but, in fact, some absorption of the stocks carried over from the previous month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bacon Board had to go further. Having fixed their total production <Col N="190" /> quota for the whole country, and their total home sales for the whole country, they had to fix the sub-allocation of production and of home sales.  The sub-allocation of production was fixed as the sum of the export quota which the particular factory had got, plus its proportion of home sales.  As I have already said, the board had no control over the export quota.  They had to take that figure from the Department, and, in fixing their sub-allocation, they fixed the amount of production on the export quota, plus the proportion which the factory was entitled to on the home sales of the same month in the previous year.  The home sales then were divided in the same way as between one factory and another.  They were divided on the percentage basis that held as between one factory and another, which was the established practice, as the business was done by the factories before this control came in.</P>
    <P>There was another consideration. The board fixed a certain price for pigs.  They had no control over the export price of bacon.  They had fixed home sales with a view to keeping the price of bacon in relation to the price of pigs, and they were in the position, therefore, that if the price of bacon exported were to fall below what would be a fair price, relative to the price of pigs, they had to pay something to the exporter of bacon to enable him to get the same price as if he had sold his bacon at home, and there was a hypothetical fund created for that purpose. They could collect a certain amount from each curer on production, and pay a certain amount out of that fund in respect of the bacon exported to bring it up to the level of the value of bacon sold at home.  It might have worked in the reverse way, but it never did. One may have said, four or five years ago, when the Bill was coming in, that it was possible that, at times, the export price of bacon would be even better than would pay the curers, relative to the price of pigs, and, in that case, the levy under the hypothetical arrangement would be taken from those who exported, and something out of the fund given to those who were selling their bacon at home in order to bring the home-sold bacon <Col N="191" /> up to the value of the export bacon. I quite admit that all this is rather involved and more like a lecture on mathematics than on pigs and bacon, but I give this outline in order to refresh the memories of Senators on the old system before going on to what we intend to do in future.</P>
    <P>It has been said in another place that this Bill was brought in because I was dissatisfied with the boards which were in existence.  That is not true. The boards which were in existence did their work well, as well as any body of men could be expected to do it, within the legislation and within the regulations which followed the legislation, and the fact that I am bringing in this Bill does not in the least mean that I am dissatisfied with the personnel of these boards.  I will explain the reason for the change later.  I should like to say also that the boards themselves evidently share the opinion that I am dissatisfied with them, and they actually asked me to set up an inquiry so as to establish whether they had acted within the law and whether they had acted wisely, or not. I do not think I should do so, because I am afraid that everybody would take it as <i>prima facie</i> evidence that I was dissatisfied with the work of these men, if I were to set up a public inquiry. People would take it as an indication that I had some doubt as to the <i>bona fides</i> of the men who acted on these boards, and I have no doubt whatever.  I am quite satisfied with the way they carried out their business, and it is for other reasons that this change is being made.</P>
    <P>About three months ago, when the present war started, the British Government asked us to regulate, even more rigidly than before, the export of bacon from this country.  In fact, they said in the beginning that they wanted all the bacon to go through one seller; in other words, they asked if we could possibly set up a government, or trade, organisation through which all the bacon would go, as it was being received on the other side by one buyer, namely, the food controller.  I set up an export committee, composed of the <Col N="192" /> chairman of the two boards and two civil servants, one of whom had been dealing with all these questions of pigs and bacon on the administrative side, and the other with matters on the technical side.  These three men took over all the questions relating to the export of bacon and pigs, the negotiations as to prices, the negotiations with the British Government as to conditions of export, conditions of payment and many other questions which arose.  In fact, they had quite a number of matters to deal with when they were first set up.  It entailed their going across to the officials in the Food Ministry on at least three or four occasions to get all these details settled up and it will, I am quite sure, necessitate their going frequently to keep matters right.  That export committee is there.  I think that for some time to come and, in fact, quite possibly for the duration of this war, the price of pigs here will have to be related to the price that we get for our bacon exported.  If that is a fact, and I think that any Senator here who considers the matter very fully will come to the conclusion that that is going to be the fact, there is practically no necessity for the Pigs Board because the big function of the Pigs Board was to fix prices for pigs.  They took many things into consideration.  These are laid down in the Act.  They had to consider the supply of pigs, the supply of bacon on the market, the export quotas we might be able to get from time to time, and also the cost of feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>I think that there is only one consideration now and that is the price that we can get for our bacon when we export it, and the price of pigs will be related to that.  I do not see how it can be otherwise.  I do not see that we could possibly, during this time of war, pay more for the pigs than they would be worth, having the value of exported bacon in mind.  If we paid more for our pigs it would mean that the home consumer here or somebody else would have to subsidise the export of pigs to Great Britain.  I do not think that I or anybody else could defend that at the present time.  For that reason, amongst others, I think <Col N="193" /> that the price of pigs will have to be related to the price of bacon exported. Therefore, as I say, there appears to be no necessity for a Pigs Board because it is only a matter of calculation and this export committee could do it just as well as any other body of people.  That is one point.</P>
    <P>I think also that no matter how many pigs we have in this country and no matter how much bacon we manufacture, there is no danger about our finding a market for that bacon.  I hope we will be able to consume as much bacon at home as ever we did, but whatever surplus we would have I do not anticipate that we would have any great trouble in getting the British Government to take it during this time of war.  Again, for that and other reasons, I do not think that there will be any necessity to have production quotas.  We can loosen up on these production quotas and let the factories take pigs as they come to them.  If the production quota goes, and certainly the home-sales quota will go&mdash;I have no doubt about that&mdash;then the Bacon Marketing Board has nothing to do. So again we find that the Bacon Marketing Board has very little function to perform and this export committee can carry on the function of the Bacon Board quite easily.</P>
    <P>The question will be asked, I am sure, as it was asked in the Dáil, the question that I certainly asked myself: If all that can be done, is there any necessity at all for a board or anyone to control things during this war?  I think we can drop practically all control, but it is well, perhaps, to stick to the fixed price for pigs at any rate. If you examine the position during the Great War of 1914 to 1918, I think you will find that there were fluctuations even at that time as between one fair and another on the same day.  That sort of thing would lead to dissatisfaction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We arranged the fixed price to stop it as far as we can.  I believe, therefore, that it is useful to <Col N="194" /> continue the fixed price.  This new commission will do that.  By the way, in this Bill we are providing for the withdrawal of the production quota, but it can be reimposed if we find we have acted hastily or made a mistake.  I will come to that point in a few minutes, and indicate where I think we might make a mistake in doing it.  If the production quota is gone, the home sales quota is gone, and we are only fixing price; control is practically gone; there is no great control there, but I am very anxious that this commission should go in and take over the functions of the two boards, and be there to reimpose a certain amount of control if it is found necessary.  They will have to control export, of course, on account of the arrangements on the British side for taking that bacon. They may have to use control to a certain extent in other directions.  It is well they should be there, and especially, I think, they should be there to get all the information they can on this great subject of the production of pigs and bacon.  I put it this way: if we were only looking as far as the duration of this war, I would not hesitate to agree with the Dáil or Seanad, if they asked me, to withdraw all control. But we must look beyond the war.  I think every Senator will agree that when this war is over we are going to have a very difficult situation with regard to the export of bacon, and, I suppose, the export of other things, too, but I am dealing with bacon now.  We are going to be competing in a market which may not be as good as it was in the past.  We are going to be competing against countries which are very well organised for the production and export of bacon, and unless we are organised just as well as they are organised, and unless we are careful about every penny from the time the farmer starts to breed his pig up to the time the bacon leaves the country, we will not be able to compete.  I am hopeful that, if we have this commission, we may in the course of 12 months or so, be able to get a report from that commission on the best system that could be adopted as a permanent system, which would come into operation, I hope, before the war <Col N="195" /> is over, and be there to deal with the situation when the war is at an end. That is my big reason, I can say quite candidly, for this commission, that they may be able to help me, or whoever is there when the time comes; that they may be able to help the Oireachtas in general in putting up the best possible scheme for consideration as a permanent scheme and, especially, as a scheme that will be ready to take over control of everything when the war is over.</P>
      <P>I want also to impress upon the Seanad this point, because I think some of the speeches made in the Dáil would not perhaps have taken the lines they did if it were not that certain Deputies there were under the impression that this was a permanent scheme.  I am not finding any fault with the speeches in the Dáil because they were all very helpful, but I think that some of them would not have taken the lines they did were it not for that reason.  This is quite a temporary scheme for dealing with things for the time being and is in preparation for a permanent scheme which I hope we may be able to evolve in time.</P>
      <P>I will just mention in detail a few matters that are in this Bill.  First of all, as I have explained, the two boards go, both the Pigs Board and the Bacon Board, and all their functions are taken over by a commission.  It is laid down in the Bill that the commission will consist of three people, and it is laid down in the Bill also that the two ordinary members will be civil servants of certain standing and that they will carry on all these functions of the Bacon Board and the Pigs Board.  It is not laid down in the Bill, of course, that the present export committee would be the commission, but that is the intention, that those who are dealing with these exports of bacon and pigs would be the same people who would take over the commission and deal with all the matters relating to pigs for the time being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said already, the production quota can be suspended and can be reimposed if we do not find that it is to the best advantage.  One danger I see in suspending the production <Col N="196" /> quota is this: Before control came in, we had 27 or 30 factories and they were getting a certain number of pigs. They were going on with the business. When control came in, the production was based on the production in the year before the Act was passed.  I mean, the percentage was based on that.  If pigs go down, of course, all the production is smaller in the same proportion; if pigs go up, the production is greater in the same proportion.  It is fixed on a percentage basis as between one and the other.  There might be a change in the distribution of pigs. I do not know.  There might be, and it might be difficult for factories to get pigs now which could easily get pigs before this control came in, and there might be a temptation, especially for the bigger factories, if they find it difficult to get the pigs, to use some method or other of getting pigs as against a smaller one.  Now, we may pass Bills here and make regulations as we like inflicting dire penalties, but whatever we do there are ways that pig factories can get pigs and in which we cannot stop them, and they can even get them above the fixed price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>And they will regulate the prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will do it, anyhow. The one fear I have in dropping this production quota is that the big men may do considerable damage to the small men under this system, and it is for that reason that power has been taken to reimpose the production quota if it is thought necessary.  I hope it will not be necessary, but under this, we can reimpose it if it is.  We may adopt some other system that will deal with the difficulties we are trying to get over by dropping the production quota.  I do not intend to deal with the difficulties which arose out of the production quota as I think Senators are fully aware of them.  In Monaghan, for instance, there were many more pigs than local farmers could take, and again farmers found it hard to get rid of pigs and it may be that they are rather disgruntled and inclined to go out of pig production.  To get over that difficulty we thought of dropping the quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> The home sales quota is definitely abolished and cannot be reimposed.  I think we can take a risk in that, at any rate.  There is again a danger there, but we are taking a chance on that.  There is the danger that the factories might be tempted during the flush months of November and December into selling all the bacon produced during those months and, if they do, there will be a shortage in the months of February, March and April; since under this system of control there was a good carry-over from say October to November, again from that month to December, and again to January.  This carry-over went right through until we came to the scarce spring months and then it got less and less until it was exhausted about May or June.</P>
    <P>If we drop the home sales quota we may not be able to regulate that carry-over so well, but there are provisions in the Bill under which we can resort if necessary to the commission for authority necessary to give effect to the cold storing of bacon.  I do not know if it will be necessary to resort to that, and I know it has its own disadvantages.</P>
    <P>We are replacing the hypothetical scheme that was in operation by a stabilisation scheme.  There is no change in that, except that it is a simpler scheme to work.  Under the hypothetical scheme the board collected a levy from every curer on production and brought the money in and paid it out again on exports or on home sales as the case may be. In this way the curer pays a levy on exports alone, or on exports to a certain country.  We have had cases where hams exported to America or exports for some short time to another country may have been profitable, and it would have been possible to have collected a levy on that export of bacon to that particular market and paid it into a fund.  For example, there could have been exports to Great Britain, for a while, of bacon and ham and that levy could have been paid into a fund.  In the same way, they can put it on for any period for bacon sold for export to Great Britain or for export to a particular country or for consumption at home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> Another point dealt with in this Bill is the insurance find.  Under the old arrangement up to this every curer was entitled to levy 9d. on every pig to cover insurance.  Before this scheme a curer could make an agreement with the producer that after killing a pig, if he found he had to reject part of it he could deduct that from the cheque before sending it to the producer.  Now he is not entitled to do that under the insurance scheme brought in, in 1935.  Instead of that, every farmer contributed 9d. per pig towards an insurance fund in the factory and each factory was working its own insurance fund.  If a factory made money they got it and if they lost it they had to pay up.  The fact is that a number of factories have lost money on this insurance scheme while a number of others have gained.  In order to equalise things the insurance fund is being made a general fund so that the factories will send up to the central fund or rather pay the commission 9d. per pig.  It is 9d. to commence with, but that can be varied if necessary. They are paid out of the general funds on any condemnations afterwards.</P>
    <P>Another point in reference to this Bill is with regard to the costings in the factories.  We thought in 1935 that we had covered that point.  It became doubtful after some time.  It was considered by the lawyers in 1937.  The point had not arisen in 1937 but it was in doubt; but subsequent to that it became established and accepted that the board could not demand the figures they required with regard to costings. It has been put beyond doubt into this Bill that the commission can ask for any figures they want in order to help them to get costings and so on from various factories.</P>
    <P>Another point, which I think is the only one of any magnitude in this Bill, is with regard to arbitration.  In 1937 we set up a scheme for compensating the smaller factories which were going out of production.  It was composed of three members including the chairman of the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board.  The arbitration board sat and considered certain cases but evidently each of the three men had a mind of his own and no two <Col N="199" /> could agree.  Even if two did agree, it is doubtful if that would have been sufficient. Now a clause has been put in to say that, if a majority of this arbitration board agrees on a figure, that figure will be paid.  If we cannot get a majority decision then the Minister appoints one of them&mdash;not the chairman, however&mdash;to be the arbitrator, and that disposes of the matter.</P>
    <P>I believe I have dealt with the bigger matters which arise in this Bill.  The smaller matters will arise on the Committee Stage, and the only thing I ask for is the co-operation of the Senators in getting the Bill through in a reasonable time, as we would be in a rather awkward position if this legislation were not passed before the 1st January.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill with reservations.  I support it because I believe it is a great improvement on the 1935 and 1937 Acts, but I have grave doubts that it will accomplish what I believe the Minister is honestly trying to do.  I am a very strong believer in open markets and free trade, and in leaving the law of supply and demand to regulate prices.  Since 1935, when the Pigs and Bacon Board came into operation, the prices of bacon and pork have been steadily rising, and a good price has been maintained the whole time in the British markets.  That was not due in any way to the operations of the Pigs Marketing Board.  I am sure&mdash;and I believe every sensible man who has any experience of the trade will agree&mdash;that the producers of pigs would have got much better prices if there were none of the restrictions which have been imposed by the Pigs and Bacon Boards on the sale of pigs.  My object in rising is not to discuss the provisions in the Bill, but to plead with the Minister to withdraw the export licences on pigs, and give the producers of pigs and the pig traders a free market, and let the bacon curers look after themselves.  If he does that, it will mean a very much higher price for the pig producer than he is getting at present.  We can get a quota from Great Britain for all the supply of pigs that the Minister is able to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> If the Minister strives to create competition, which does not exist at present, in the fairs and markets, the pig producer will get a very much better price.  In the Dublin market to-day there were some representatives of the Pigs Marketing Board buying pigs there.  I do not know whether that was for the purpose of a test or for the purpose of trying to work up the price of pigs in the market, but I know that they could not succeed in either of these two objects.  It could not be for the purpose of a test, because the representatives of the Pigs Marketing Board would not be able to buy pigs at the price at which the dealer would buy them, and they would not be able to market pigs with the same facilities as the pig dealer or exporter.  If it was for the purpose of trading, I strongly protest against the Government's interference with the ordinary trade of the country.  I think it is an objectionable practice, and it is very much to be deprecated.  I think that the Minister could obtain all the licences that he wants for exports to England, but, at least for the period of the war, he should allow a free market and let the pig producers get the highest price they can in that free market.  I have been told in the Dublin market to-day that licences for the export of pigs are worth from £1 to 30/- per pig.  That £1 or 30/- for the licence comes directly out of the producer's pocket.  If a buyer who has not a licence is prepared to pay that price for one, he must buy a pig 25/- or 30/- less than he would otherwise pay.  That is the reason there is very little competition.  You find one exporter with 1,700 or 1,800 licences for the month, while another exporter has only 30 licences.</P>
    <P>I understand that export licences are given on the basis of the number exporters shipped for the corresponding month in 1938.  There might be good reasons why a pig exporter did not ship any pigs in a particular month last year.  He might have been ill, or there might be some other reason which prevented him exporting during that month, although the export of pigs was his normal occupation.  However, if he shipped none in one particular month, he got no licence for the corresponding <Col N="201" /> month.  In that way a big percentage of licences might be assigned to one man.  Senators need not have a great experience of business to know that if you give a monopoly of licences, and they are all in the hands of one or two people, that tends to destroy competition.  The man who enjoys the monopoly can sit down until the two or three men with a small number of licences are satisfied, and then he can get all he requires at his own price.  For that reason, I strongly urge the Minister to withdraw the export licence system for the period of the war, and give pig producers an opportunity of getting a fair price for their produce.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the enormous profits made by bacon merchants and factories under the Bacon Marketing Board scheme.  I think that Senators might like to have a little more evidence on that point.  For that reason, I should like to give a personal experience as to what happened in connection with a bacon factory in which I have a small interest.  This was a co-operative bacon factory started by a number of farmers.  It was established about 20 years ago.  For the most of that time it paid no dividends and it was practically wiped out in about ten years.  A London merchant then came along and subsidised the factory, but even then it paid no dividend.  When the Pigs and Bacon Act came into force, since 1935, it is paying 20 per cent.  I have received 20 per cent. on my shares.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on ordinary shares in a bacon factory.  I can name the factory if the Minister wishes.  It is the Castlebar Bacon Factory.  I have got 20 per cent. on the ordinary shares since that time.  That shows that the bacon factories' profits have been exorbitant.  I do not blame them for profiteering.  I would profiteer myself if I had the opportunity.  I, however, blame the Minister for providing them with the opportunity to profiteer.  That is the reason I advocate a free market and the free export of pigs for the period of the war, and let the bacon <Col N="202" /> curers look after themselves.  If he does that he will be conferring a great boon on pig producers and he will go a long way towards encouraging increased production.  I hope the Minister will seriously consider that appeal.</P>

      <P>It is said sometimes that we never learn, but I think that if we could only hear the Minister in confidence for a few moments, he would tell us that he has learned a lot.  He has learned from all the derelicts he has had to carry&mdash;the calf-slaughtering scheme, the intense cattle slaughter, the attempt to regulate the price that would be paid for cattle, the maize mixture scheme and other such schemes. Whether from conviction, or force of circumstances, they are now happily all on the scrap heap.  I feel that we are fortunate in this respect, that the Minister dealing with the industry has had to deal with fluid conditions.  He has been able to do all that in very striking contrast to the difficulties of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who has got himself tied up with a number of factories that have to be carried and cannot be scrapped because they are mixed up with Party prestige. They are a millstone around the country's neck.  Let us be at least thankful that we are able, largely because this is a productive industry with an export trade, to get away in spite of all our mistakes from all this control and get back to more or less free dealing.  The minute you begin to control anything, you entrench vested interests and capital.  Although I am an unabashed capitalist, I have never ceased to protest against a system which enables capital to entrench itself and secure privileges and advantages of which the factories controlled always take advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no good expecting a public spirit from business men.  That is not the way it works.  Under a free system of competition prices settle themselves, and supply and demand ensure that there shall be no extortion of the public.  But, when you try to cut across those laws, as we have been doing, then we see that capital unduly enriches itself at the expense of the consumer.  The Minister has had a <Col N="203" /> lamentable experience of control, and I would ask him to cut away from it. I understand that there is no restriction of this kind on sheep, mutton or beef.  What is the difference in essence? What is the need of the control of bacon when apparently we are not going to control beef, or any other animal products?  I hope the Minister will answer that when replying.  The Minister gave one reason for this measure: that we are going, in some mysterious way, to get experience which will enable the trade to adjust itself to post-war conditions.  He then went on to refer to other countries being so much better organised than we are.  Is not the reason why they are better organised this, that there is free competition and no control?  The whole history of the bacon trade in Denmark is due to this, that the farmers have the power to organise themselves, so that all the profits in the business go automatically to them.  The farmer sends in his pigs to the factory which cures them with the highest possible efficiency.  There are no restrictions. The bacon is then marketed by a central marketing board.  All the money that is available, over and above the overheads and the interest on capital, where there is any, goes back to the primary producer.  That is the lesson that we have got to learn.</P>
    <P>As long as you have the capitalist system, it should be allowed to operate freely.  The only alternative to it is the co-operative system which they have in Denmark, where it has been such a success.  The less control we have the better.  I have no faith even in the little that remains.  The Minister said that he did not believe he could ever stop business people taking advantage of the position which control gives them.  I hope he will go further than he proposes in this measure, and put an end to whatever control remains, because experience shows that it operates to the disadvantage of consumers and producers, and gives to those who have entrenched themselves with capital an undue advantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is really not very much to be said about this Bill. <Col N="204" /> Neither of the Senators who preceded me has said much about it.  The Minister admits that it is going to be a temporary measure.  If it were not for that admission, Senators might have a good deal to say about it.  I do not know if the Minister recollects the attitude of some of us when the original measure was introduced in 1935.  I recollect that a very distinguished member of the House at that time&mdash;he is no longer with us, but he sat on the opposite side&mdash;seemed to be very enthusiastic about it.</P>
      <P>I would like to be able to be as optimistic about the effects of this legislation as he was of the other.  I did my best to make the Principal Act as workable as possible.  It has since been generally recognised, I think, that it was not a very workable scheme.  I do not think Senator Counihan was correct when he said that at the time these boards came into operation prices were going up, and that the market was there for our products.  It was unfortunate, I think, that when the scheme was put into operation we were in the middle of the economic war, and that what may be described as chaotic conditions prevailed. To that extent, the legislation of that period got a very bad start and left a very bad taste in the mouths of a great many of our farmers who were not able to dispose of their pigs because of all the control that was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept the Minister's point of view with regard to the way these boards discharged their obligations. What Senator Sir John Keane has pointed out is quite true, that the net result of that legislation was that capital increased its power, prestige and control over the industry, to an extent that it never was able to exercise before.  The view generally held is that the producers' representatives on the Pigs and Bacon Board were not able and did not face up to the curers' representatives. The net result was that they let the curers' representatives get away with too much.  If it were the policy of the curers to force the price of bacon up on the home market to the highest point which, in their opinion, the market would stand, the producers' <Col N="205" /> representatives ought to have forced the price of pigs up to the highest point which the curers could stand.  If they had done that, there would not have been all this talk about the immense profits which the curers made, because, in the situation which I have visualised, they would not have been able to make them.  I think that it was there that the principal failure was.  It was in that respect that the Pigs Board did fail.</P>
    <P>This business of the Minister and the Minister's representatives interfering with trade was adverted to both by Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Counihan.  The trouble, of course, there is that once you begin to control you never seem to be able to stop. The war has presented us with a different situation.  I agree that you can now get out of control for the time being, but if the war had not come along I cannot see how you would have been able to relax control or what conditions would operate for producers and manufacturers of bacon if control were removed.  A great deal of fire has been heaped on the Minister's head because of the operations of the boards set up under the Principal Act. These sections in the Act are now being repealed.  It is true to say that these boards were outside his control, and that in so far as they failed, to a great extent, at any rate, he could not be said to be directly responsible.  In directly, perhaps, he was.  He is now going to be in a different position.</P>
    <P>What I do not like about his scheme is this&mdash;and I accept it only because it is a temporary measure&mdash;that he is going to put two civil servants, and apparently the chairman of the old boards, in control of this industry.  I am not saying a word against the eminent gentlemen who are going to compose this commission.  I am sure that if a selection were to be made by the Minister that, probably, according to his judgment, he would find it difficult to make a better selection, but it appals me to think that the control of a big industry like this, for the duration of the war, is going to be put into the hands of any three civil servants, I do not mind who they are.  That, I think, is the most dangerous aspect of <Col N="206" /> the case from the Minister's point of view.  The control of an industry in which several million pounds are turned over every year is a very great responsibility.  As the head of a Department of State the Minister is shouldering heavy enough responsibilities at the moment.  He has responsibility for the political consequences, if you like, of certain acts, and surely that is enough for any one man to carry.  But when you are going into trade, and sponsoring a scheme, and when your own servants are handling that trade, and if everything does not go right the Minister has to take the consequences.  I think that is wrong. It is bad and dangerous for a Government. That is the aspect of the measure that I like least.</P>
    <P>I know a great many civil servants and, as individuals, they are very competent men who work very hard.  But it is one thing to have a man discharging obligations day by day in an office, and quite a different thing when he is taken out of that position and put in charge of a big business, without taking him away from his responsibilities as a civil servant.  If this were to be something permanent, or if he were acting as an ordinary business man, it would be rather different.  He seems to be two beings at the same time, a civil servant and a business man.  I do not think he can be both.  A civil servant can be a good citizen, but he is a most cautious man, and must never say or do anything with which the head of his Department would disagree.  While I wish the best of luck to the man who is going to operate the scheme, it would be better if the Minister had devised something else.  I realise the difficulty he was up against.  In so far as this measure is only going to be temporary, I accept the Minister's statement.  I would prefer if he had said, that while it was temporary he would carry it over, until there was something else. He said he was going to get something better.  I would not like to be the head of a Department which had under it a big trading organisation like this.</P>
    <P>The Minister has got a report from the Commission on Agriculture.  I do not know if he has had the opportunity of studying it.  I urge that the scheme should only be operated for the shortest <Col N="207" /> period necessary to deal with this business. In so far as the measure is temporary I do not think there will be any difference of opinion in the House about accepting it.  We realise that the Minister has to have something operating before the end of the year, and I take it that the House will not hinder him getting the Bill through.  Nevertheless, we want time to look into the sections, as we have only got the Bill now from the other House.  Perhaps the Minister could give some indication of his thoughts on the interim report.  From what Senator Sir John Keane said, it is clear that other countries found a better way of dealing with this business than we did.  The Minister has now got the bones of a better way from the Agricultural Commission, and it is his function to set about clothing those bones as quickly as he can, in the form of a better machine.  The sooner he gets away from this contact with trade, that is inevitable under the Bill, the better it will be eventually.</P>

      <P>Is maith liom an seans seo fháil le rá go bhfuil áthas orm gur tugadh an Bille seo isteach, mar creidim gur Bille é a dhéanfas a lán le feabhas a chur ar an tionnscál muc agus bágúin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid what I have to say will be in English, and for that reason I may not be able to express myself as readily as I would if I were speaking in Irish, so I must ask the House to be somewhat patient with me.  I welcome this Bill, and I think the country will welcome it, and for two reasons. Firstly, because, to a great extent, it implements the recommendations of the Agricultural Commission, which has for such a long time been considering this whole question of the pig and bacon industry.  I welcome it also because it is further evidence, if such evidence is needed, of the desire of the Minister to do everything that he possibly can in the interest of all classes of the community, and particularly in the interest of the agricultural community.  I gather the Bill has become a necessity because it has been discovered that, however careful we were in the past in framing legislation, in regard to the <Col N="208" /> pig and bacon industry, that circumstances and conditions have developed which have operated to interfere with the smooth working of that legislation, and because of the failure of that legislation to secure, fully at any rate, the interest of those mainly concerned, namely, consumers and producers.</P>
    <P>Reading the discussions that took place in the other House about this Bill, and in discussing the question with members of this House, I find that criticism has been levelled at the Minister because he introduced the Bill, which, it has been pointed out, is the third Bill he introduced for the purpose of promoting the pig and bacon industry.  I am very pleased that he has introduced this third Bill, and I congratulate him on that action.  As the House knows, I have not very much experience in regard to legislation, but I should like to say this, that I believe when legislation is found to be unworkable or for any reason has become obsolete, it ought to be withdrawn or amended or replaced.  I think that is the natural and the proper way to look at such matters.  There is very often no accounting for the actions of men, and particularly in the economic sphere. That is the view generally of economists. We find that our most careful plans and our most carefully thought out prognostications very often fail to work out.  Why that is so is perhaps another question.  We believe it is because of that inherent feature in man, free will, that there is no accounting for what he will do.</P>
    <P>Even this third Bill in the interests of the bacon industry may not work but as a result of my going through the records of the speeches made in the other House, I believe that the agricultural community and consumers generally will agree that it is a very honest effort to secure the welfare of the pig and bacon industry; and that it will secure the interests of both producers and consumers.</P>
    <P>There are two matters in connection with the Bill to which I wish to refer. The first has to do with Section 56, which gives to the new board power to ascertain the gross and net costings of bacon production.  This, I believe, in spite of all the criticisms that have been levelled at the Bill, will certainly <Col N="209" /> prove a very effective check on any tendency on the part of the curers, or trader interests, to profit unduly at the expense of the producers or the consumers. I think that is a very useful section and that it will have a very good effect.  Section 14, too, I think is a very effective section, especially from the point of view of securing the interests of producers and consumers. I should like to say that, in the ordinary course, I should not be in favour of Ministers or others having power to probe, as they think fit, into the affairs of business, or that they should have power to get any information they think they need as to the ordinary private business affairs of people, but this fact remains, that, in the case of this particular industry, undoubtedly an atmosphere of distrust has been engendered, and I think it is essential that that distrust should be allayed. The community in general will, I think, be very grateful for the provision of the safeguards which, in my belief, are contained in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 14.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another point which is not concerned so much with the provisions of the Bill, but with a certain propaganda which is being carried on in regard to the pig industry. Generally, the assertion is made that the pig industry has suffered severely, and that the pig population has declined severely because of Government policy.  I think that any impartial student of the industry will agree that that is not so.  On the contrary, were it not for Government policy, the industry would now be dead.  It is continually asserted, for example, that the pig population has seriously declined. We have had that repeated time and again before our commission and elsewhere, but, viewed over the long term, it will have to be admitted that the pig population in Ireland has always been a somewhat fluctuating one.  Even during the years of the Great War, when the prices of pigs soared, the numbers of pigs were considerably smaller than they were in 1938.  For instance, if we take the year 1918, when pig production should have been at its peak, the numbers then were considerably lower&mdash;by just 100,000&mdash;than last year.  In 1929, during the régime of <Col N="210" /> the last Government, which, by all accounts, did so much to help the live-stock industry, the number of pigs was some 945,000, and, in 1938, notwithstanding all the propaganda that is being carried on, the figure returned is 959,000.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer in passing to the references made by Senator Sir John Keane, and particularly to his remark on the law of supply and demand. This is a principle in economics which is of considerable interest to students, whether in their first year or in their 20th year.  I am sorry the Senator is not here now, because I should like to ask him just what would have been the position of the pig and bacon industry if the Minister had allowed that industry to take its course in accordance with the law of supply and demand.  As a matter of fact, I should like to ask him, or anybody else, just what would be the position of this country in any conceivable branch of industry, with, perhaps, the possible exception of Guinness' stout and Jacob's biscuits, if it had not been for the policy of protecting the industry against this terrible law of supply and demand.  Again, in passing, I should like to say that some people seem to have taken to themselves the right to speak for economists.  I do not know whether I would be described as an economist or not, but that, in fact, is my profession, whether people like it or not, and I certainly am not a free trader.  I take my economics for what they are.  Text books are merely guides; they give us an insight, when we start to study a subject, into certain principles, and they help us; but there comes a time, and very soon, in one's study of economics, when one must leave the standard text books aside and face the facts of life.  I am not a free trader. In passing, too, I should like to ask where is there a free-trade country in the world to-day?</P>
    <P>It would be all very well if all countries were prepared&mdash;if I may put it this way&mdash;to don the habit of the friars and vow themselves to poverty, rigid discipline, and to do nothing but good to their neighbours; to do by their neighbours as they would have others do by themselves.  Free trade <Col N="211" /> might work then, but nations do not seem to be willing to act in that way, and certainly, so long as the world is not willing to submit to rule like that, I advise the Minister and the Government to stick to the policy of protection.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane also referred to Denmark and spoke of the success of the industry there.  The outstanding thing about Denmark is that the co-operative spirit exists there, and that fact accounts for the high efficiency of the pig and bacon industry in Denmark.  I am glad the Minister has entrusted this board with the duty of investigating and finding out how best eventually this industry may be run and controlled.  I believe that eventually the co-operative organisation will be the most suitable. I am not quite sure at the moment when we could bring it in in Ireland, because though I am myself a co-operator&mdash;I believe in the economics of co-operation and I believe that in co-operation lies the salvation of this country&mdash;I am not sure whether our people are just yet ready for co-operation. In that regard, we have to face facts.  I do not like to pontificate on the matter of co-operation&mdash;I have to sit, like some other members of this House, as a kind of judge, later on, on this particular question&mdash;but I am not sure at all that co-operation has so far been a success in this country.  Why that is, if it is so, is something we have to find out later on; but it is because of co-operation that the pig industry has been such a success in Denmark.  When I hear all this talk about free trade and control, I wonder what condition this country would be in if our Government had allowed it to follow the fortunes that would have come to it as a result of free trade. Particularly in regard to the bacon industry, when one considers the conditions obtaining for a long time in the world markets and the intensity of the competition on the part of producers in other countries, and in Denmark particularly, and when we recall the extraordinary strides made in other countries&mdash;Denmark again, for example&mdash;in the efficiency of pig and <Col N="212" /> bacon production as compared with the state of the industry at home, I must say, in all sincerity, that the Government is entitled to every possible praise for its work for the pig industry in this country.</P>
    <P>The outstanding fact about the pig and bacon industry, as I mentioned a minute ago, is that it has not expanded, If you take the long view, it has remained more or less static for the last 90 years.  That is worth while recalling in view of all that has been said in favour of free trade.  Some people tell us that the only thing that can be worked to success in this country is the live-stock industry.  We have to remember that that particular industry has been allowed to work, and has been encouraged under the most ideal free trade conditions over a period of roughly 130 years, in other words, from the passing of the Act of Union until the advent of the Fianna Fáil Government. In view of the fact that it is claimed that stock raising is the ideal, the natural industry for this country, in view of the fact that Britain went out of her way in every possible direction and on every possible occasion to encourage that industry, it is a most extraordinary thing that no branch of the live-stock industry has expanded.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as I take it, and viewing it from the point of view of the recommendations of the Agricultural Commission, is intended not alone to save the pig and bacon industry.  After all it is in danger.  The war has interfered and has slightly altered facts but the war will not last for ever.  As I say, this Bill is intended to secure the industry but it is also intended to secure the expansion of the industry, and I for one believe that it will.  For that reason, I welcome the Bill and I am convinced that the country will welcome the Bill.  The pig producers and the consumers will welcome it whatever about the bacon curers.  I think the Minister has seen to it that the bacon curers will not get away with it as readily as they did in the past.</P>
    <P>I take it from the attitude of Senator Baxter and from the attitude of Senator Counihan that they have not very much fault to find with the Bill and, as the Minister has explained that he would like to get the Bill as soon as <Col N="213" /> possible, I suggest that we ought to do all we can to give him the Bill with the least possible delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also to support the Bill.  In view of all the criticism that has been recently directed against the Pigs Board, the Bacon Board and the whole system of control, I think it is only fair to give credit for what these boards have done.  They have at least brought order out of chaos and they have stabilised prices at a time when the very uncertainty of the prices made it impossible to carry on the business.  Before these boards were established there was no attempt at all to relate price to the cost of production. The farmer who bought store pigs when bacon was 70/- a cwt. might have to sell when the price was only 30/- to 40/-.  Not only that, but the price at the bacon stores and fairs&mdash; especially at the bacon stores&mdash;fluctuated from day to day.</P>
      <P>In fact, in the old days, when the farmer sent out a load of pigs to a fair in the morning, he had to wait until the car returned in the evening to learn the price operating that day.  Looking back, I am convinced that it was that uncertainty in regard to price, that want of stabilisation, that was responsible for the great drop in the pig population.  I firmly believe, and as a producer I have some knowledge, that if that system of control had not been introduced, if prices had not been stabilised and some effort made to provide a margin between the cost of production and the price, there would scarcely be any bacon produced in the country to-day.  In view of the effects of free trade on the bacon industry, especially in the very old days before the bacon factories were established, and even since the establishment of the bacon factories, I would not be very enthusiastic about a return to free trade completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point that I would ask the Minister not to overlook, that is the position of the consumer.  It is only fair to say that during those years of the economic war and the great slump in prices, the consumer here had to subsidise the production of bacon and butter and other agricultural products, <Col N="214" /> and it is only fair now if there is before us&mdash;as perhaps there is&mdash;a great period of prosperity, that the consumer should reap some benefit from these things which he had to keep alive in the bad times.  I would say that in the event of the price of bacon soaring in the world market that would be no reason why we should allow prices to soar here.  I think it would be only fair to keep them within reasonable limits and that the consumer should reap some advantage from the sacrifices which he was called upon to make during other years.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear that this measure is only a temporary one, because I am quite convinced that the final solution of this question must be to make the whole bacon industry co-operative in every branch, just as the dairying industry has been made co-operative. Senator Sir John Keane cited the case of Denmark and the success of the co-operative bacon industry there. There is no need to go outside Ireland to see what co-operation will do.  We have a clear example in the dairying industry to-day.  The dairying industry is almost completely in the hands of co-operative societies.  Groups of farmers in various parishes have formed themselves into societies and have set up creameries and carry on the business of manufacturing and selling dairy products.  Some doubt has been expressed as to whether the people would be capable of carrying on the bacon industry on the same lines, but I do not see what justification there is for any such doubt when we consider the example of the co-operative creameries. Some of the co-operative creameries have a turnover of £1,000,000, and they carry on very many industries in addition to the actual work of the creameries.  Some of them have already gone into the bacon industry.  I see no reason to doubt why the bacon trade could not be carried on as successfully as the creamery industry.</P>
    <P>There is another advantage in co-operative societies from the Government's point of view.  During the period of the economic war, whenever the Government found it necessary to provide a subsidy they knew that no <Col N="215" /> matter how small that subsidy was it was always distributed evenly down to the smallest supplier or to the smallest man who had a cow.  It has not been the same in any other business where the Government had to deal with individual concerns.  There was no means of having the subsidies distributed and in the long run reaching the consumer.</P>

      <P>I would like to re-emphasise that the ultimate solution of the question must be on co-operative lines.  Without that there can be no full development of the pig industry here.  Private concerns will not be able to gain the confidence which would be necessary in order to provide for the development of the industry.  It is only co-operative concerns that could improve the quota and could help the primary producer.  They alone could provide proper control of the product and the means whereby the producer could produce a better article.  I am sure if the Minister inquires he will find that it is the almost unanimous opinion of the people who are acquainted with the situation that the ultimate solution of this question must be to make the whole bacon industry co-operative in every branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing very much has been raised on the Bill that requires to be specifically dealt with.  It appears to be the general consensus of opinion amongst nearly all the speakers that the final and the proper remedy for any cvils there are is co-operation.  I think that practically every speaker came to that point.  I was rather interested to here Senator Counihan say he still believed in free trade.  I do not know that he would get anybody to agree with him nowadays, and I do not know if even Senator Counihan would be an out and out free trader for all countries.  It might suit us to be free traders in certain respects and not in others, but I think even if we were to throw open the doors here for certain things Senator Counihan would probably object.  For instance, if there <Col N="216" /> were no war, if we were to allow bacon in from everywhere the price of pigs would go down to half what it was. The same thing would happen if we were to adapt a free trade idea in the same way to any other live stock.  For instance, we have had here for some time a tariff of 6d. a lb. on mutton and lamb.</P>
      <P>In spite of that tariff at one time of the year for the last three or four years a certain amount of lamb was imported into this country.  If there is no tariff at all, imagine what the prices of sheep and lambs will be like for the greater part of the year.  It is all right being a free trader in certain respects, but I am afraid it is hard to live in the country at the present time by being a free trader.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Counihan at all when he says that the producers would have been better off if this control had not been imposed.  I think that the majority of pig producers are quite aware of the fact that this stabilised price was a good thing for them. For a greater part of the year for the last two years&mdash;I am not sure about going back further than that&mdash;the price of pigs was higher here than it was in the North of Ireland.  That position could not have arisen unless we had control.  We could not possibly export bacon or pigs and pay more for them here than in the export market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that was all due to control.  The producer had no objection to our subsidising them, and for that reason the producers were quite pleased with the control scheme.  They objected to certain parts of the scheme and wished to have certain things made right&mdash;one of them being the production quota&mdash;but I think no producer of pigs would like to see control removed in this country.  To remove it for the period of the war would not make any difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think no producer of pigs would object to Departmental <Col N="217" /> control.  It is not true to say that we can do absolutely whatever we like in regard to the quotas to Great Britain.  I am sure that if we were to say to Great Britain that we would be able to send them three times as much as we have been sending them up to this, they would be pleased to accept it; but they will try to get a constant proportion of live pigs and bacon pigs, as otherwise it upsets them very much.  A country which is at war must regulate things very finely and must try to regulate the amount of bacon and pigs which comes into the country in order to get the factories working properly in production of bacon, and they do not want us to say that we will send them in 50,000 pigs in the month of December and no pigs in March and April.  For that reason the British Government is rather anxious that we should say that, whatever we have to send them, there should be a certain and constant proportion between live pigs and bacon. I am sure that Senator Counihan understands that it would not do to say that we will send half and half. I would not say that to the British Government, at the same time being sure that we could not send live pigs in March and April.</P>
      <P>It has never been the practice in this country to send out live pigs from March to August.  For that reason, we must keep down the proportion of live pigs to something reasonable&mdash;15 per cent. or 25 per cent., but we cannot exceed that very easily.  We might agree with the British Government and say we would make this 15 per cent. of the total.  I quite agree; however, that if I were to go to the British Government this month or last month and say that we could give an additional 25,000 they would be glad indeed to get them.  That is what we have done in November and it is what we hope to do this month again, and the only thing to do in that way is to make certain monthly agreements with them about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot withdraw control entirely as far as the British Government are concerned.  They have only withdrawn control until the 5th, or the 15th some say, of January.  The control will come <Col N="218" /> back then and exports will have to go through our export committee.  There is no use in asking about withdrawing control for the period of the war because the British will go back to control during the month of January.  We therefore could not possibly withdraw the licences for the period of the war.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the question of what profits were made by bacon factories.  The Prices Commission reported that they made too much, and I accept that.  I accept also that the Prices Commission have been watching them since, and I assume that since that report the profits have not been extraordinary.  I cannot say whether a 20 per cent. dividend is unreasonable or not in a certain factory.  For example, if a certain factory cost £50,000 to erect and equip and it is doing badly and is bought for £4,000 or £5,000, the new people who get it would probably be entitled to 20 per cent. on that new capital.  That would be nothing extraordinary.  Something like that may be the position in Castlebar.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that Senator Sir John Keane is not here just now, as he congratulated me on learning through mistakes. I know that I have made many mistakes, but I do not agree that the calf slaughter scheme was a mistake and I will never admit it.  I thought that it would have been a good thing if the population would consume veal instead of beef, but that did not succeed, I admit.  We never compelled any man to slaughter calves.  I said at the time that we were encouraging veal consumption, and the only way we could do that was to give the butcher a special price for the skin of the calf. I am surprised that a man like Senator Sir John Keane should adopt such a catch-cry in regard to the slaughter of <Col N="219" /> calves.  It is ridiculous to go back to that matter.  If the same position existed to-morrow I would advocate the same thing, and if Senator Counihan were in my position he would advocate it and he would not have had as much pity as I have.</P>
    <P>With regard to the maize meal mixture, I would say to Senator Sir John Keane that, since it was withdrawn, for every hundred protests that came in I have received only one note of approval.  In all of the counties of Leinster and in a good many of the Munster counties, where they are doing tillage work, they are afraid that there is going to be suffering by reason of the withdrawal of the maize meal mixture scheme.  I do not think that will be so, however, as prices are going up for barley and oats and, therefore, there is no necessity for it.  I am sure that at the time it was operating it did a great deal of good for the tillage farmers of this country.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane says he is thankful to get away from this control. I do not wish to be a prophet but I am doubtful if we can get away from the system of control.  It is like the question of free trade.  If every country withdrew control it might be all right but, when we are trading with many other countries who are adopting control, we must exercise control here. Before we started in 1933, the British made us adopt a system of control as they said that we must inform them at the beginning of each year how many pigs and how much bacon we would have for export and then we had to send them out under licence.  When we were trading with Germany we had to do the same thing; in fact, we actually had to buy the cattle which we were exporting to Germany.  A similar thing happened in the case of the eggs for Spain.  Control must take place nowadays before we can export to any countries where control is in operation and there is no use in trying to get away from that. It is all right for Senator Sir John Keane to talk in a theoretical way about free trade and no control, but when you come down to practical politics, you see that you cannot get away <Col N="220" /> from control.  He talks about it as a long record of lamentable experience but I do not agree that it is any such thing.  I think that since we brought in this control, to deal with the pig and bacon situation, it has been anything but a lamentable experience.  I know half-a-dozen farmers who keep accounts in regard to pig production, and every single one of them says that he has been able to make a profit since control was introduced.</P>

      <P>I cannot say that.  I have had deputations from towns in connection with that matter, and I have said to these people: &ldquo;Is it not to your interest to see that farmers get the highest price possible for their pigs, no matter how they dispose of them?  Will they not have more money to spend in your shops than if they were to dispose of their pigs in the old way?&rdquo;  They have admitted that that is true.</P>

      <P>I do not think that competition in this matter has been very healthy.  When competition had free play, one farmer got 58/-, another 56/- and another 54/- per cwt.  Now, competition has been abolished, and everybody gets 60/- per cwt.</P>

      <P>Before I was very old, I often sold pigs myself at the fair.  I was told the price that I should get for the pigs.  I was not allowed to take anything I was offered.  When I reached the fair I often saw a number of buyers having a consultation.  Then they would come along, and when one of them <Col N="221" /> made an offer you would feel quite ashamed of your pigs, it was so low. If you managed to sell them, you might read in the paper the next day that pigs at a fair 60 miles away fetched 5/- per cwt. more.  How could the buyers afford to give 5/- or 6/- more per cwt. 60 miles away on the same day?</P>

      <P>No, there is a fixed price now.  I cannot see the point of Senator Baxter's criticism.  He spoke of civil servants being on this board.  This is a board which will negotiate with the British Government with regard to prices and with regard to conditions under which bacon will be exported. When conducting these negotiations, as a rule they have people with them who have a practical knowledge of the trade.  They generally bring a curer with them if it is a curer's business that is involved or a dealer if it is a dealer's business.  They bring somebody like that to advise them on any point that may arise during the discussion. Apart from that, the authorities in Britain will fix a price for bacon and they will say &ldquo;if the price of bacon is so-and-so, the price of pigs must be so-and-so.&rdquo; The price will be fixed on a mathematical basis.  These are all matters with which a civil servant, if he is a better scholar than the farmer, can deal more capably than a farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the interim report, I was asked if I had studied it. I did study it and we have adopted some of the recommendations in it. We have not adopted the big recommendation with regard to rationalisation. Senators will remember that there was an unanimous report for some form of rationalisation.  Half of the commission recommended that it should be on co-operative lines.  Everybody appears to think that the co-operative basis is the proper one, but I have not made up my mind on that. We shall have to get further information before we make up our minds on that matter.  It does appear to be accepted by every member of the Agricultural Commission&mdash;and on that commission there were farmers, economists, business men and labour <Col N="222" /> representatives, so that you had practically every interest in the country represented on the commission&mdash;that something should be done to rationalise the industry.  When they were asked on what lines it should be rationalised, half of them said on co-operative lines, but the other half said that they had not made up their minds as to what direction it should take.</P>
    <P>Senator O Buachalla drew the attention of the Seanad to the costings and the returns to be made by the factories, which he thought would be extremely useful.  I think so, too.  I think the publication of these matters may give a certain assurance to farmers and others that they are getting fair treatment.  I should like to say that it is a pity that a number of free trade members of the Seanad were not present to listen to Senator O Buachalla, because I think his remarks would have done them a lot of good. I do not think there is any other point with which it is necessary to deal. There does not appear to be any great objection to the main principles of the Bill, and the details will come up for consideration on the next stage.</P>
