      <P>This Bill proposes to extend the powers which the Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934, confers on planning authorities for planning the orderly and progressive development of their areas.  In some minor respects it also amends the provisions of that Act.  The changes proposed in the existing law will facilitate the preparation of planning schemes.  They will simplify the procedure connected with the control and development of land by the erection of buildings, the division of land into land units for the purpose of regulating the density of buildings, and the determination of the frontage line of buildings on new or improved roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A planning scheme is intended to control not only development that is imminent but also development that is likely to take place during a number of years.  As circumstances must be constantly changing, it would be difficult during the preparation of a <Col N="1334" /> scheme to provide for every form of future development.  It is, therefore, proposed that a planning scheme should settle the main lines of development and confer upon one or more responsible authorities designated by the planning scheme the power of enforcing the provisions of the scheme and of regulating subsidiary development in conformity with the main provisions thereof.  By this means, it should be possible to secure the development of an area in an orderly manner and at the same time enable the responsible authority to meet conditions as they arise without resort to an amendment of the provisions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The adoption of a more flexible procedure in connection with the control of future development will not lessen in any way the important safeguards imposed by the Act of 1934 and the regulations made thereunder in connection with the preparation of planning schemes.  Appropriate provisions could be inserted in a planning scheme dealing with the improvement of existing roads and the construction of new main roads but it would be difficult to prescribe conditions in regard to roads of lesser importance or lay down the future road system for particular portions of the area planned in which development may not be permitted for a specified period.  To meet the position more fully the procedure laid down in Part III of the Bill is proposed.  When a planning scheme allocates or reserves particular lands for specified purposes, a provision may be included in the scheme, in the Bill referred to as a restricted development provision, prohibiting the development of such lands, or any part of such lands until a road plan regulating the development thereof has come into force. This procedure will ensure that the internal development of a building site is fully controlled by the responsible authority in conformity with the scheme.</P>
    <P>A road plan will be prepared by the developing owner and submitted by him to the responsible authority who may approve with amendments or refuse to approve.  The decision of the responsible authority is subject to an <Col N="1335" /> appeal to the Minister.  Provision may be made in the road plan for the construction of roads, public or private, by the road authority and for the payment of the whole or a part of the cost by the developing owner.  Provision may be made by a road plan for the payment by the developing owner of the whole or part of the cost of any construction or improvement of roads between the coming into operation of the planning scheme and the coming into force of the road plan, which has facilitated or rendered less costly the development of land to which the road plan relates.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision dealing with the division of land into land units for the purpose of regulating the density of buildings, a planning scheme may include provisions dealing with the spacing of buildings and other structures, but it is doubtful if under the existing law a planning scheme could empower a responsible authority to divide land into building units. Section 8 of the Bill is intended to remedy the position.  This power of controlling density will only apply to dwellings and other residential buildings and will be in addition to the power of prescribing a minimum area for the curtilage of such buildings. Every planning scheme will contain a provision enabling owners of land that is divided into land units to appeal to the Minister if they are dissatisfied with the decision of the responsible authority.  The Minister's determination on any such appeal will be final.</P>
    <P>The other change in the law to which I referred relates to the determination of the frontage line of buildings on new or improved roads.  Under Section 13 of the Bill provision may be made in a planning scheme enabling the responsible authority to determine the frontage line of buildings and other structures adjoining any road for which a frontage line is not determined by the planning scheme.  Appropriate provisions would usually be included in a planning scheme imposing restrictions on development in the immediate neighbourhood of roads specified in the scheme by prescribing the distance <Col N="1336" /> from the centre line of such roads for the erection of structures.  Such provisions would relate mainly to trunk roads along which very little development has already taken place and which it is desirable to protect against sporadic development.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill is mainly intended to give power to fix the frontage line of structures on new or improved roads for which a frontage line is not determined by the scheme or on new or improved roads not specifically referred to in the scheme.  This power is to be exercised by the responsible authority, subject to appeal by any person aggrieved to the Minister.  This procedure will enable the necessary control to be exercised under proper safeguards at a time when the conditions are better known than during the making of the planning scheme.</P>
    <P>The power to fix the frontage line of structures on any roads not dealt with in the planning scheme is very necessary in view of the provisions contained in Part III of the Bill for regulating the development of lands in respect of which a restricted development provision is included in the scheme. Secondary roads and owners' roads constructed on such lands will be regulated by the responsible authority and the frontage lines fixed for structures, subject to appeal to the Minister.  The Minister's determination of an appeal is final, and any contravention of a frontage line so determined by a responsible authority or by the Minister on appeal will be a contravention of the planning scheme.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the minor amendments to the Act of 1934 I would like to refer to Section 14 of the Bill dealing with compensation.  This section was introduced in response to representations made during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil. Under the Act of 1934 compensation may be claimed after a planning scheme has come into force in respect of a reduction in value of property, damage, or loss, arising out of the coming into operation of a provision in a planning scheme, subject, however, to any declaration contained in <Col N="1337" /> the scheme that no compensation is to be payable on account of or arising from the coming into operation of any specified provision reserving or allocating lands for specified purposes; or limiting the density of dwellings, or regulating the size or curtilage of dwellings; or controlling the design, colour and materials of buildings and other structures; or providing for the preservation of amenities, excepting a provision reserving lands for public parks, open spaces or other particular purposes whether public or private.</P>
    <P>It might be held that restrictions of this kind should not be imposed without compensation, but the basic principle underlying town planning is the regulation of development in the public interest, and where such regulation is necessary for the orderly development of an area the community should not be required to pay compensation. The evils resulting from unregulated development in the past have proved very costly to rectify.  If little attention is given to securing a proper environment for the homes of the people, there would likely be a recurrence of those conditions which are associated with slum dwellings.  The health of the people is paramount and town planning lays down the basis upon which good housing can be secured for them.  It was upon consideration of all the issues involved that the Act of 1934 enacted that claims for the assessment and payment of compensation were to be determined only after the provisions of the scheme had been brought into operation.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill will enable claims for compensation to be dealt with before the scheme is brought into force subject to the provisions in the Act of 1934 as to the exclusion of compensation in certain circumstances. The procedure in Section 14 is as follows: Where during the interim period, that is, the period between the passing by the planning authority of a resolution for the making of the relevant planning scheme and the coming into operation of such scheme, any person applies under the Act of 1934 to the planning authority for permission for the carrying out of a <Col N="1338" /> particular work, the planning authority can direct either that permission be refused; or that permission for the carrying out of such work be granted subject to conditions to be specified in the permission; or, in case the work is one that has already been begun, whether before or after the passing of the resolution for the making of the scheme, prohibit the further proceeding with it.</P>
    <P>It will then be open to any person to whom such a direction is given by the planning authority during the interim period to apply to the Minister for an order declaring that compensation shall be payable by the planning authority in respect of such interim direction.  An investigation of the circumstances of each case will have to be made by the Minister.  Firstly he will have to investigate whether compensation would be payable under the provisions of the Act of 1934, if such interim direction were a provision in the relevant planning scheme and that scheme had come into force.  Secondly, he will have to investigate whether undue hardship would result to such person from compliance with the interim direction of the planning authority during the interim period. If satisfied that compensation would be so payable and that undue hardship would result the Minister may then make an Order declaring that compensation shall be payable.  It is proposed to allow a period of six months to elapse from the making of such an Order before it shall take effect so that the planning authority if they do not desire to incur compensation may have an opportunity of revoking the interim direction in respect of which the Order applies.</P>
    <P>If the interim direction is revoked by the planning authority within the period of six months or if the interim direction has not been complied with during that period, the Order declaring compensation to be payable will become void and of no effect.  If on the expiration of six months an Order of the Minister under this section comes into force any person affected may apply for compensation to the planning authority by whom the <Col N="1339" /> interim direction was given.  Such an application must be made within two months from the date when the Order comes into force.  The provisions in the Town and Regional Planning Act of 1934 are made applicable to the assessment and recovery of compensation in such cases.</P>
    <P>It should be understood that an interim direction (with some exceptions) is not like a statutory provision or a provision in a planning scheme which must be obeyed under penalty. A person who receives an interim direction need not obey it, but if he does not do so he must take the risk of its inclusion in a planning scheme in which case it can be enforced against him without compensation. Where an Order of the Minister declaring compensation to be payable in respect of an interim direction comes into force, it would obviously be wrong to allow the provision of that interim direction to be ignored, and to safeguard the position as far as possible it is proposed to enforce the provisions of such an interim direction under penalty, as if they were provisions in a planning scheme.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in Section 4 of the Bill to give an urban planning authority powers of entry on lands for the purpose of examining an area adjoining their district before deciding whether the area should be planned as a contiguous area.  To prevent any uncertainty in regard to the validity of a resolution passed by a planning authority deciding to make a planning scheme it is proposed by Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to provide retrospectively that it will be sufficient for notice to be given of such a resolution to all the persons who are members of the planning authority at the time when the notice is given and not at the time the resolution is passed;</P>
    <P>(b)  to require the planning authority, as soon as may be after the passing of the Bill and, in future cases, as soon as may be after the passing of the resolution to publish a statutory notice of the passing of the resolution;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> (c)  to allow persons who own land in the area to apply to the High Court for the annulment of the resolution;</P>
    <P>(d)  to provide that where a resolution is not annulled on an application brought to the High Court the resolution shall be deemed to have been validly passed.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill enables a responsible authority with the consent of the Minister to grant a total or a partial exemption from one or more of the obligations imposed by a particular provision in a planning scheme, where there is specific provision included in the scheme for the adoption of that course.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to extend the powers of a planning authority to make special prohibitions.  Section 57 of the Act of 1934 only enables a planning authority to prohibit the further proceeding with the construction, demolition, alteration, extension, repair or renewal of any particular structure in the area to be planned. Section 10 of this Bill will enable the planning authority to prohibit the execution of any specified work, including the cutting down of any specified forest, wood or tree, and the provisions of Section 58 of the Act of 1934 in regard to the enforcement of special prohibitions as extended by Section 11 of the Bill will apply.</P>
    <P>Where a planning authority passes a resolution deciding to make a planning scheme for a named area and later finds that the area might be extended with advantage, the present position is that the planning authority must pass a new resolution for the added area and must make two planning schemes&mdash;one for the original area and one for the added area.  This will prove inconvenient, especially where a contiguous area is added to a planning district after a planning resolution has been passed for that district.  It is proposed in Section 7 of this Bill to empower a planning authority, which has passed two or more resolutions relating to separate but adjoining areas, to make one planning scheme <Col N="1341" /> for the whole area.  The relevant date in any part of the whole area will depend on the resolution relating to that part.</P>
    <P>It is proposed by Section 15 of the Bill to give the Minister power to dispense with the giving of any notice or the publication of any advertisement where he is satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for such dispensation.  A similar provision exists in the housing code.  Section 16 of the Bill provides that in deciding appeals the Minister may direct the planning authority or the responsible authority, from whose decision the appeal is made, to pay to the appellant a reasonable sum in respect of the expense occasioned in relation to the appeal.</P>

      <P>During the discussion on this Bill in the Dáil, a Deputy raised a point which, so far as I could see, failed to arouse the slightest interest, but about which certain paragraphs have since then appeared in the newspapers which encourages me to refer to it.  It is the condition of our villages.  As probably every Senator knows, innumerable houses in all our villages in County Dublin and County Wicklow are in a state of slow decomposition. I think the plan is that when a house is condemned, that is, finally condemned, because, as we all know, until the housing schemes got under way, people continued to live in houses for ten and 12 years after they had been condemned as unfit for human habitation, the house is evacuated and a hole torn in the roof so that nobody else can go into it and it is left to stay there as long as weather and time will permit it to remain.  The occupant is provided with a house some distance out in the country and, notwithstanding the fact that the Department has always expressed a desire that houses should not be built along main roads, they continue to be built there.  There is one case I know of where there is a very narrow road on which there is enormous traffic of large lorries and hundreds of motor cars over the weekend and on which there is no footpath. Motors have difficulty in passing the lorries and houses have been built so <Col N="1342" /> close to the road on one side, which is a high side, the other side being a precipice, that when eventually the road will have to be widened to save life and to make the increasing traffic possible, the bank will have to be cut away and the people will only be able to get into their houses by going up ladders.  That is a positive fact.</P>
      <P>The other thing I object to is that houses are sometimes built on beauty spots.  The houses may not be so bad, though I think a great many of them could be vastly improved&mdash;I see a big difference between some houses on the Navan Road and in our district&mdash;but, at the same time, they are not so bad.  Quite frequently, however, the occupant immediately proceeds to build a tin shack in which to house a goat, a donkey or fowl.  If he is lucky and has a bit of money, he buys new corrugated iron, which is hideous enough; but if he has not got money, he collects remains and scraps of rusty corrugated iron and if he is lucky enough to have road work in the neighbourhood, he reinforces that with black tar.  In a great beauty spot on the road between Roundwood and Annamoe there is a labourer's cottage. The occupant, who I do not think is actually the person entitled to live in it was a woman who married a farmer in the immediate neighbourhood, who had 30 acres almost beside this nice cottage.  He moved into the cottage and demolished his farm buildings in so far as they were roofed with corrugated iron and built himself a very large tin shack stretching about ten yards from the road and another ten yards in length.  Lest that beauty spot should not have been sufficiently destroyed, our local board of health has sanctioned two more cottages so that there may be a nice row of houses along the road to destroy utterly this beauty spot.  No doubt, they will also build shacks in time and complete the destruction.  It is a place which is very largely patronised by people from all over the world, but mostly from Dublin, who visit that neighbourhood and have picnics there.  There is a long bend in the river with a great bank of trees rising up where people fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> The scheme was sanctioned two years ago, and one year ago I went to the board of health and protested against houses being built there.  One of my reasons for protesting was that this farm was very small and already had two houses on it, and it seemed unfair that four houses should be built on the one farm.  I protested principally, however, because it was a beauty spot. I understood that my protest was of some avail but, to my astonishment, three weeks ago, the foundations were dug.  I made another protest to the Department hoping that they might be able to do something at once, and in the belief that if they gave people any chance the walls would be up in no time, and then nothing could be done. I pointed out that the people for whom the houses were built had been already supplied with houses, and that so keen is the Government on housing, that at least two of the people, one of whom lives there and the other of whom they intend to put in, have had the satisfaction of having their housing arrangements made for them both by the Department of Local Government and the Department of Justice.  One gentleman has had his housing provided for him by the Department of Justice on two occasions, and another gentleman on one occasion.  I do not think they are very suitable people.</P>
    <P>Where a scheme has been sanctioned so far back as two years ago, there should be some way of looking into the matter with a view to ascertaining whether the houses are really needed after a delay of two years, or whether they have been provided for elsewhere. I know that the Department objects strongly to the building of houses in rows along main roads and always tries to stop it.  I am quite sure they object to the spoiling of beauty spots, but I understand that by the Labourers Acts, nothing can be done about it, that the local authority can take land anywhere it likes, except demesne land.  With regard to the villages, the population decreases, the social amenities decline and the shopkeepers lose their business, and the village is left, as Robert Service would say, &ldquo;deserted, damned and despairful.&rdquo;<Col N="1344" /> Village life, as such, seems to me to be coming to an end.  Houses are being scattered all over the countryside.  I do not know if there is any Act under which a Department of State has any power to force people who own sites in villages either to remove the debris of their cottages or to rebuild, but if there is not, it would be a great help if one were introduced. I do not know whether the new tourist committee will do something about it, but at the present time the worst thing that could happen to the tourist industry would be a decree by the State for a reduction of the speed of motor cars passing through a rural built-up area.  Our only hope is that they will dash through at break-neck speed without looking about them.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point spoken of by Senator Robinson in reference to what is called ribbon building, I personally like as little Government butting in as possible in the life of the people, but it does seem to me&mdash;and I speak subject to correction because it is a matter with which I am not very conversant&mdash;that this ribbon building which we see around Dublin is definitely almost imposed by law.  If one is going to develop a new area, if one builds a house within a certain distance of the road, the public authority is bound by law to provide water, sewerage arrangements and so on.  As long as that law is that way, if it is that way, and I am not too sure of my ground here; if it is a fact that if you build your house directly on the road, a method which is universally recognised as undesirable, you impose on the corporation or local governing body the duty, under law, of providing water and sanitary supplies, you can hardly wonder that the builders do it that way instead of moving 100 yards or 200 yards off the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> I am not too sure of my facts, but if it is true that building within a certain distance of a road saves a builder a great deal of expense, and puts certain duties on the corporation, then it seems to me, if the Minister is anxious, as I know he is, to improve conditions, and to direct building operations in the path that will be most desirable, before you get on you must change the law, if such be the law, which, in effect, directs builders to build in the ribbon way along the sides of roads.  I would go further into the matter only that I am on uncertain ground.  I have seen ribbon building around Dublin which has destroyed the amenities of this beautiful county, both for the inhabitants of the county and the city, and the explanation I got was that builders work alongside the roads, because that imposes by law a duty on the public authorities, which would not be imposed if they built further off the roads.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong there.</P>

      <P>According to the Regional Town Planning Act of 1934 urban areas, where the boundaries are jagged, could include in the map of a regional planning scheme an area the size of the urban area.  I should like to be informed whether it is intended to have an area outside the urban area included so that it might be used for the purposes of a plan for the added area to build houses or roads in the county.  As far as I know the matter has not been made clear.  There are urban areas, such as the one I live in, which are very small with jagged boundaries sticking out all over the place, and in order to make anything like a decent planning scheme, and to straighten out the boundaries, they would require to take in odd fields. There is a provision dealing with the matter in the Act of 1934, but I want to know if the added boundaries can be used for the building of houses, roads and sewers.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cupla focal a rá i dtaobh rudaí a dubhairt Seanadóirí a labhair romhaim.  I do not think some of the previous speakers are aware of the fact that a town planning scheme for Dublin has not yet been prepared.  It is in <Col N="1346" /> course of preparation.  I can assure Senator Fitzgerald that every effort is made by the town planning committee to deal with any undesirable type of building.  The plans for building have to be submitted, and the town planning committee goes carefully into them.  In that way no undesirable class of building is allowed at present.  With reference to derelict sites, I have been arguing that steps should be taken to deal with them.  In my opinion these sites give an appearance of decay to the city.  We have certain powers to deal with them in Dublin under what is called the Derelict Sites Order, provided that they have been unoccupied for a certain length of time.  I was impressed with the point made by the Minister, that during the interim period an owner might develop a site, but if that development is contrary to future plans, the owner may be compelled to take down a building without compensation.  While I am sure that the Minister has given the matter close consideration, in my opinion it would be better to prohibit an owner undergoing expense in the first instance, rather than have to make him go and pull down a building afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinConlon" hpid="Mr. Conlon Mr. Conlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this would be an appropriate occasion to ask the Minister what areas within the country have drawn up planning schemes.  I know that by passing a resolution under the Act of 1934, the local authorities get power, but if they merely pass a resolution, parties concerned may not be aware that there is a planning scheme.  In certain areas some parties are a bit frightened and are awaiting the publication of schemes.  I am not aware that any planning scheme has yet been put into operation.  I should like to deal with the power of appeal in particular instances.  It is not easy for a layman to deal with an amendment to an Act made up of eight parts and 57 sections, but I should like the Minister to explain the position of a person who may be notified by the responsible authority to refrain from altering some building or prevented from erecting one.  In that case there is an appeal to the Minister if a person is aggrieved by the decision. <Col N="1347" /> I should like the Minister to accept an amendment so that a person with a grievance could go before the district justice.  The Minister, I expect, will have a report from his inspector or from some responsible person, but he will not have an opportunity of going into the pros and cons of the case, and the individual concerned may not be satisfied, because the decision was arrived at in camera.  He has no opportunity of knowing the grounds on which the decision was arrived at. If an amendment to the effect I suggest was inserted in the Bill it would not interfere with the principles enshrined in it.  Section 45 of the original Act allows an appeal by any person aggrieved where the responsible authority served notice in connection with the colours or the materials used. In a case like that the matter can go before the district justice, and I submit that a similar procedure should be allowed here under Section 59.  Under Section 52 of the original Act an application may be made to the District Court to quash a notice that has been served.  I ask the Minister to satisfy people in local areas by allowing cases to be brought and decided by a district justice.  If he is capable of deciding on colours and on materials, I submit he would be a suitable authority to act where a person was served with a notice to refrain from constructing a building.  I understand that in Dublin no planning scheme has been approved or completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Senator Robinson has called attention to the conditions in many of the smaller towns.  The approaches to some of these towns are really appalling. A demolition order can be obtained against the owner of house property if it has been condemned by the sanitary authorities, but in the majority of urban towns some houses were deserted years ago and these wretched places have been left there. The result is that the impression created on tourists must be very unfavourable. It would be well if some effort could be made to have these sites cleared.  The local authorities will not do it as they say it is not their <Col N="1348" /> business.  The Board of Health say that they have enough to do to deal with the houses condemned under Acts in which they are concerned, without encroaching on private property.  I do not want the Department to get away on this occasion, and I want to point out that there are derelict public buildings here and there throughout the country, some of them being convenient to some of the nicest towns in Ireland.  I refer to abandoned workhouses and abandoned hospitals that have been in a ruinous condition for the past ten years, and that are getting worse and that are now dangerous.  I have in mind one building at the entrance to one of the prettiest little towns in Ireland.  People coming from the railway station have to pass the ruins and they are most unsightly.</P>
      <P>There are many deserted public buildings which are, I believe, in the possession of public health authorities, that are in the same condition as some of the wretched shacks at the entrance to some towns.  An effort was made some time ago to get some of these buildings cleared away under minor relief schemes by the Board of Works, but apparently they could not encroach as the property belongs to the public health authorities, who will not take them down.  The Board of Works say that they would do so if allowed. Between the two parties these buildings are left in a ruinous and disgraceful condition.  I wish the Department would look into the matter and endeavour to have these unsightly buildings cleared away.</P>

      <P>I feel it my duty as a member of a public board, and a board of health, to say that if there is one Minister in the Government who, whenever he retires, will leave behind him work that has won the esteem and appreciation of public bodies, and particularly of the poorer classes, for the amount of initiative, energy and success that has crowned his efforts on the question of housing, it is the present Minister.</P>

    <P>I trust that the Minister will not be impressed by some of the remarks made by Senator <Col N="1349" /> Robinson.  In my county, my board of health, I believe, are almost unique in what they have achieved with the co-operation of the Minister's Department. In the short space of a couple of years, we have built nearly 1,000 cottages for rural workers.  Senator Robinson says that we are destroying the amenities and beauty spots of our country in placing these cottages unreasonably and uncomfortably near the roadside.  I respectfully disagree with him.  I think the whole country is a beauty spot and that we are adding to the amenities of the beauty spots by putting these lovely, cheerful, bright homes in them and by taking our rustic peasantry, which is the nation's pride, out of the conditions in which foreign governmental control placed them&mdash; unhygienic, antediluvian and appalling conditions, conditions which would not be suitable for pigs.  The Minister has changed all that.  I disagree with the Senator again when he says that when the tenants leave these houses there are holes through the roof and the houses are as festering sores to the civic eye.  In the case of all the hovels which were cleared away in our county, under an order by the Minister, all the debris had to be removed and a certificate had to be obtained from the Department's engineering inspector bearing testimony to that before the county council got the grants which are given as an encouragement to our housing activities.  In my county, we have the same conditions that obtain in other villages but, with the encouragement and inspiration of the Department and, particularly, of the Minister, who did us the honour of coming down to look at what we were doing, we have made an inspection of every town and village in the county. As a result of that inspection we are inviting tenders for the building, in addition to the 1,000 rural houses to which I have referred, of 500 houses in these villages and towns to meet the necessities of the poor and the working classes who previously had to exist in these hovels.</P>
    <P>While I am on my feet, I take the opportunity of making a point to the Minister which I made previously at my own board.  I understand it was the result of very considerable discussion <Col N="1350" /> between the Department and my board.  While I praise him for the great work he has done, I ask him to remember one thing.  In the towns and villages of rural Ireland, the work of the unskilled men who have occupied these bad houses is irregular and their payment is scant.  Many of those living under these conditions have to depend largely for subsistence on what they get by way of home help from the board of health.  One might consider that the rents are really economic.  They do not look high but, in the case of one scheme which the Minister opened in my town about 12 months ago, the rent and rates amount to 3/10 per week.  That would appear to be a reasonably economic rent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking advantage of the opportunity to put before the Minister a point that affects our workers.  We are considering a scheme of houses and the rent might be regarded as reasonably economic at 3/10, but many of these unskilled workers have to subsist on 4/- a week home help.  If you have a family receiving 4/- and they have to pay 3/10 for one of these houses, there is not much left for maintenance afterwards. I did put the matter before the Minister and he has provided for a smaller type of house&mdash;a three-room house, on the ground floor, the rent of which will be about 2/6 per week.  I may have been guilty of digression but I wanted to put that point before the Minister because, if it is overcome, he will have done a great deal to brighten the homes and cheer the hearts of the working classes, in addition to what he has already successfully achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a matter on the Central Fund Bill which the Minister for Finance was kind enough to inform me I should more appropriately have raised on this measure. That is: whether there is any means of getting these plans advised upon by recognised authorities on design and æsthetics and people with a knowledge of and taste in architecture.  It does seem strange that when we are putting <Col N="1351" /> up a new building we allow a local authority to act on the design of a local engineer.  I know in some cases that the design is by the county surveyor. It may be quite suitable to prosaic needs but, as an ornament to the countryside, it leaves much to be desired.  Senator Robinson, in one of his somewhat rare but very welcome speeches in this House, referred to this important matter of preserving the amenities of our countryside.  It is a terrible problem. In England, where they had a great deal to preserve, it has been a matter of great difficulty.  Oxford, with its almost sacred buildings, as one might describe them, has been practically spoiled in its surroundings by the speculative builder.  A society has been started for the preservation of rural England and it has done a certain amount of work but, here, there never has been any high standard of architecture in the country villages.  I do not know whose fault it has been. In England, the conditions in these villages are largely due to the taste of individual proprietors who have spent a very large portion of their income in preserving the amenities of the countryside.  The very fine buildings in the Cotswolds and elsewhere are still preserved but it is a matter of increasing difficulty to secure the preservation of many buildings.  I do not know what can be done here short of setting up some body to advise local authorities and the Minister on the question of new buildings.  It may be slow work but we should at least make a beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A building is to be put up in Kildare Street by the Board of Works. I am not making any suggestion that the Board of Works would not put up a good building, but I should have much more confidence in the project if there were a body of architects and artists of repute whose duty it would be to advise on the design of all new buildings, especially public buildings.  I am sometimes a bit depressed about the official attitude on this matter.  I had occasion once to criticise a housing scheme for one of those migrant colonies in Meath &mdash;people brought in from the Gaeltacht. <Col N="1352" /> I commented on the fact that there was such a variety of material and colour in these new cottages.  I suggested that there was a unique opportunity of striking a new note in domestic architecture and trying to preserve what was very fine in the old domestic architecture of the country&mdash; the low whitewashed cottage with thatched roof.  You could not expect a thatched roof now but you could preserve the other characteristics.  The only place you see these cottages now is in a seaside village and the only villages which are attractive are the seaside villages.  The Minister in charge of that Department at the time took the trouble to convey to me that he was very much hurt by my remarks because he had taken a lot of trouble in connection with this scheme and had aimed at a great variety and contrast of colour.  That violates the whole canon&mdash;I believe the recognised canon&mdash;of country architecture.  There should be uniformity, not of design, but of material and colour.  In practice, uniformity of material means uniformity of colour.  It is an offence against all accepted canons to mix up concrete-block houses with brick houses and to have one house slated and another tiled, as was done on this occasion.  I hope the Minister will tell us that, if he has not already sufficient powers, he will seek powers to obtain the very best advice on this question of domestic architecture.  We can only make a very small beginning because we have not much to work upon at present, but we should do what we can for the future.  The local authorities are not the worst offenders. The corporation schemes and some of the county council schemes do, at least, have uniformity of material, but these speculative builders and private owners come along and have their houses covered by tiles, in some cases, and by slates in others.  They use concrete in some instances and they pebble-dash the houses in other cases, with indiscriminate confusion, thus spoiling the whole of our countryside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with most of what Senator Sir John Keane has said, I cannot agree with his remarks about the possibility of disaster coming to the various building <Col N="1353" /> schemes as a result of the assistance of what he described as local engineers and county surveyors.  I have seen a good many houses built all over the country with the assistance of such people and I find that, so far as my opinion goes, they are fully capable of planning and building houses, especially in the rural areas.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind Senator Sir John Keane that many, and in fact most, of the people who hold positions as county surveyors have qualified also as architects, and that it is not at all right to class them all as&mdash;well, under the category of what one might call handymen.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that they are all first-class men and that their services should be availed of as far as possible.  Senator Sir John Keane says that there never has been any high standard of architecture in this country as far as the building of houses is concerned, but I suggest that more architectural beauty has been displayed in some of the very old thatched houses than in most of the modern houses that we have standing by the roadsides in the country.  I particularly remember a house somewhere between here and Naas&mdash;a very old thatched house, that was built probably 200 or 300 years ago&mdash;in which there was more architecture and artistry displayed in the building of that house than you will find in the erection of many of the new houses that we see all over the country.  Of course, the same would apply to every other area, but I just happen to remember the case of that particular house.  Even in the mountainy districts we find that those old thatched houses were built with obvious thought as to their appearance, their comfort and everything else&mdash;much more thought, in my opinion, than has been devoted to the building of the new houses that we see being run up all over the country under a sort of mass production. I would advocate rather a departure from the new style of building and a return to the old <Col N="1354" /> system, and that instead of drifting away from the old system and drifting on to something that was imported from Oxford, or whatever place Senator Sir John Keane referred to, or from California or anywhere else, we should get back to the style of house we built in this country a good many years ago.  From an æsthetic point of view, or taking into consideration the appearance of the countryside as a finished article, so to speak, I would even recommend going back to the thatched house.  Some time ago I advocated that&mdash;I think it was here in this House, but, if not, it was in some other public place&mdash;and the people thought I was losing my mind.  Now, I do not suggest that we should go back to thatched houses in the streets of Dublin or in the larger provincial towns, but I suggest that in connection with building sites outside the provincial towns or in local villages the thatched house has a good deal to recommend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when the question of self-sufficiency is being stressed so much, and rightly so, I believe that that also should be taken into account.  In connection with the building of most of the modern houses practically everything which goes into the house is an imported article.  Of course, I realise that we have to import certain commodities, because we probably cannot manufacture everything here, but in the building of these modern houses, whether they are to be roofed with tiles, slates or anything else, it means the importation of an enormous amount of foreign timber.  If we were to get back to the thatched house, a lot of that importation could be eliminated, and that would mean the elimination of the export of capital out of this country.  With regard to the thatched house the same necessity does not arise, as I am sure Senators know, for elaborate requirements in the shape of timber.  The rafters and everything else could be got locally, and fresh timber, in my opinion, would do for the holding up of a thatched house, which I suggest is not the case in connection with the other type of houses.  Arguments have been put up, <Col N="1355" /> and I am sure will be put up, that the thatched house is dangerous, and that it is not safe to live in.  Well, I have gone to the trouble of inquiring from various insurance agents with regard to that matter, and they tell me that the number of thatched houses that have been burned over a number of years is not any larger than the number of the other types of houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they charge higher premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>They may, and if they can get them I do not blame them, but I am not talking from the point of view of insurance at all; I am only giving that case as one example of the sort of argument that will be put up. Another argument is that if one thatched house catches fire the next one does, and so on.  I grant that that is so in the case of a town or a street in the city, although in fact in certain towns we have streets of practically all thatched houses, and I must say they look very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am not in favour of streets of thatched houses, but in connection with the new schemes there is no argument, so far as that is concerned, against the introduction of thatched houses.  Secondly, we have the argument against them that they are unhealthy, that they make room for microbes and the Lord knows what else.  That might be argued if we say that we will go back and have nothing under the thatch but just rushes and straw, but in all modern houses a regular ceiling is put up&mdash;perhaps not as elaborate as the ceiling in this House, but an ordinary ceiling of lath and plaster and so on.  As far as I can make out, that should eliminate the danger of the holding of germs and so on.  I believe that an effort should be made to get back to the ancient architecture of this country and, thereby, to the use of the native product, and I would suggest to the Minister that he should go as far as he can to make it more&mdash;I cannot think of the exact word, but let us say more enticing, if you like, for people to build thatched houses.  I do not say that there should be any legislation to insist that houses <Col N="1356" /> should be thatched, but I do say that in connection with the giving of these grants, preference should be given to the building of thatched houses, and that would give an impetus to the policy of the Government in increasing tillage here, because it would create a market for the farmers' straw and give employment to a number of people in one of the oldest crafts in the country, the thatchers.  We will be told, of course, that we have not any thatchers here.  I believe that there is any number of them, or at least that there is a sufficient number to teach the young men now growing up what practically all their fathers knew how to do not so many years ago.</P>
    <P>As I say, I welcome the Bill because I believe it will go a long way to make the life in provincial towns and rural villages more attractive than it has been in the past, and I believe that anything that can be done in that way will add to the drive which is being made, and which is approved by everybody, to prevent the drift from the rural areas to the cities.</P>
    <P>If we intend to stop that drift, I believe that further steps should be taken and I say that the only way it can be successfully stopped will be by moving out, if you like, or extending to the provincial towns and rural villages the amenities of the city.  In a previous debate here I advocated the extension of electricity.  I believe that if electric light could be supplied to the rural villages all over the country it would brighten up the life of these villages very considerably.  Any of us who has had experience of going into a rural village on a winter's evening at about 7 o'clock, say, in November or December, will recollect that you could not see your hand in the place, and I am sure you have often asked yourselves how do the people there stick that night after night, week after week, and year after year.  The supply of electricity in these places would go a considerable way towards brightening up life in these towns and would also add to the possibility of future developments in such places.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest, in connection with any planning scheme, the further development of telephone communications. <Col N="1357" /> I believe that that would also go a long way towards solving the problem. I do not know whether it is in order to discuss it under this Bill, but I think that something should be done with regard to derelict sites, not so much in the towns and villages, but along the country roads.  Anybody who has been travelling the country roads, will remember that anywhere a camp of gipsies has been, if you go along the road on the following day you will find rags, old shoes, bottles, tin cans and so on, scattered all around.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that is an offence here or not, but it certainly is an offence in other countries, and I believe that it is something to which immediate attention should be given in this country.  I myself noticed, particularly in the last couple of weeks, now that the season is coming along and people are camping out, that all kinds of rubbish and scrap are thrown around the roads.  I do not know whether or not anything can be done under this Bill in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer, although I am quite sure that it is completely out of place for me to refer to it rather than anybody else, and that is in connection with the City of Dublin.  Great progress has been made all over the country, in the towns and villages and on the country roads, with regard to facilitating traffic, but one thing that strikes me, with regard to the City of Dublin, is that drastic action is necessary with regard to traffic facilities at College Green.  Anybody who comes up along there once in a while must realise that the traffic is held up there more than in any part of the city.  It is held up as far as Grafton Street and also as far as O'Connell Bridge.  The particular place I refer to is around the railings outside Trinity College.  If it were possible to remove the footpath around that bend and allow the traffic to have more of a straight run, I believe that would solve a very serious traffic problem in the city here.  Now, the question of what to do with the pedestrians immediately arises on that. I am not an architect or an engineer, but having thought over it very seriously on my way up here to-day, it <Col N="1358" /> struck me that at the present time anybody is quite free to walk in on the front gate of Trinity College and it is not regarded as interfering with the amenities of the place to do so.  If that is so, I do not see why a passageway, by means of a turnstile or something else, could not be arranged for, to let the people pass through at the front of the College there and out at the other end.  I do not know how the Governors of Trinity College would receive such a suggestion, and neither do I know how the Minister would receive it, but I am merely putting it forward.</P>

      <P>I join with the plea made by Senator Sir John Keane for the establishment of some advisory board of artists and architects with a view to preserving the amenities of certain country towns.  I have specially in mind the City of Galway, which is a city of a very particular character, but unfortunately the building around Galway is an example of unlimited individualism and, as a result, we find all sorts of horrible excrescences springing up around the beautiful old streets while the houses of 16th and 17th century architecture are being allowed to go into decay.  If there were such an advisory board I am perfectly certain that the Corporation would be glad to consult with them.  We can see already what can <Col N="1359" /> be done by an enlightened body such as that when we look at what has been done in connection with the restoration of Lynch's Castle by the Munster and Leinster Bank.</P>
      <P>That is a case of reconstruction being done with perfect taste and perfect knowledge of contemporary architecture, and it has made it one of the most beautiful Irish buildings that could be imagined, of beautiful old Irish domestic architecture and with a fine display of the beautiful marbles for which Galway is famous.  What has been done there could be done in other cases.  For instances, instead of building some of the new houses there, many of the old buildings could have been turned into flats, and then, of course, a women should be put in charge to see that they are well looked after, and women should be represented on the proposed advisory board.  I think that is an idea for the Minister.  The Minister knows Galway very well and knows what a beautiful city it was and what a beautiful city it still is, and I am sure he will realise what a dreadful city it may become if we make no change in our plans at the present time.  I had not intended to intervene, but Senator Sir John Keane's remarks put that idea in my mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended intervening in this debate but for the fact that Senator Quirke raised two points in one of which I am extremely interested.  When the original Town Planning Bill was before the House I put the point to Senator Johnson, who was responsible for its introduction, that some attention should be paid to derelict sites and buildings all over the country.  Senator Johnson assured me that such provision was made in the original Bill.  We find, however, many years after that the number of buildings which have been deserted and left without roofs is just as great as the number that was there before that measure was introduced. I want to support Senator Quirke's appeal to the Minister to take power in this Bill to make it mandatory on county councils or urban <Col N="1360" /> bodies to order the removal of these things in the interests of the tidiness and decency in the country which these town-planning measures are attempting to promote.</P>
      <P>The other point that Senator Quirke raised had relation to the thatched house.  There is no doubt but that these thatched houses are the most attractive things you can see in the country.  You see them in great numbers in other countries where you have wheat-growing areas.  The moment you get outside a wheat-growing area, the question of the provision of straw for making the thatch is a very difficult matter.  I agree with Senator Quirke that, in the case of the thatched house, you can use very light material.  In fact, in the County Kerry they can thatch houses as long as they have a supply of straw and scollops.  There is this point to be remembered, that nowadays the wheat crop is cut with a reaper and binder, and in the process of tying the straw it very frequently gets broken.  When you come to do thatching with straw of that kind, even the most skilful thatcher will throw it away and say that it is not fit for use.  In the part of the country that I come from, in order to overcome that difficulty, they still grow patches of wheat and cut it with a scythe in order to make sure that there is no breakage in the straw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt very much whether we have in the country the number of thatchers that Senator Quirke says we have.  I think we have very few of them.  I have heard again and again around my home place that the number of people able to do thatching is gradually growing less and less.  There is a further reason which, I think, operates against the thatched house.  It is that when a man builds a house he gets a grant, and he hopes that the house is going to last him during his lifetime, and during his son's lifetime, and will not cost anything for repairs.  In the case of thatching, no matter how well done it is or how good the straw may be, it will require constant replacement, particularly in the more rainy districts, and that is a charge that always falls on the occupier.  Much as I would like to see a great many more thatched <Col N="1361" /> houses, in actual fact I do not think that to increase the number would be of advantage to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the roofing of houses, I would like to have some information from the Minister as regards the supply of slates.  It may be that this is a question which should be addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce rather than to the Minister for Local Government, but at any rate I am seeking some information. It is well known that the geological surveys show that there are large areas of slate in the country. You have one in the South of Ireland stretching for almost 60 miles over slate hills from Dunmanway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attempts have been made at development in patches.  They have been carried out on a small scale for the reason that the individuals concerned had not sufficient capital to undertake big development work in Dunmanway and other districts.  There appears to be a magnificent slate hill at Court-macsherry in the County Cork.  It is almost beside the railway line, but apparently there is no one to develop the production of slates there.  People in the country who require supplies of slates find it difficult to get them.  The slates they are getting are of a very small size.  The quality is all right.  I understand that, up to a few years ago, some of the best slates produced here were shipped to Glasgow for use there, while the people at home had to be content with a slate of inferior quality, or with manufactured tiles.  It is a matter of grave concern to people engaged in the building of houses that the life of these tiles is an uncertain quantity.  It is certain at any rate that the tiles used on houses some years ago, while they may have passed whatever tests they were subjected to, after a short time in use were found to be porous. They admitted the rain and the roofs had to be repaired.  One thing at any rate is certain, that a good slate roof is practically everlasting.  I have known English and Bangor slates to be taken down after being in use for 100 years, and to be put up again after they had been redressed.  The <Col N="1362" /> same can be said of the quality of the old Irish slate.  I hope the Minister will be able to give me some information on this matter, bearing in mind the amount of large scale building that is going on throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">

      <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that it is about time the Government erected a model village, or created what in their opinion would represent one, so as to give a headline to the local authorities throughout the country.  It is regrettable, I think, that that has not been done already. If a model, a well-thought-out plan was created by the Government it would be an example for the authorities, and we would be spared the chaotic conditions that prevail in the matter of building throughout the country.  The point raised by Senator Robinson could be applied to many areas around the County Dublin.  I am sure the Minister knows the situation that exists at Portmarnock.  There appears to be a tendency to allow things to go on in that haphazard irregular way that undoubtedly will create trouble in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with all that has been said about the thatched cottage.  It is very ornamental and suits the atmosphere of the country.  But for various reasons we may not be able to undertake the erection of any more thatched cottages.  I am asking for a model village.  Would the Minister tell me if there is any central authority for dealing with town planning.  So far as I know, there is not, but I think there ought to be.  Town planning should not be left to the individual whim of county surveyors or city architects.  I know one city architect&mdash;I think the Minister knows him too&mdash;who has rather crude ideas on architecture, and he occupies a very important position in a city in this country.  There, again, the thing is allowed to go on without any directing or central authority to intervene.  The Minister is going to a <Col N="1363" /> lot of trouble about town planning.  I think this Bill is rather late, and that the time is past when we are going to have any development in town planning or in any other class of building work in the country.  The matter that I am going to refer to has a direct bearing on town planning.  The Dublin Corporation made an appeal for a large loan, but notwithstanding the interest of the Minister and of everybody else the conditions imposed on the corporation will make it impossible for any development in building to take place in the future.  Therefore, I think we have got to make the best use of what we have.  It is rather late, I think, to come forward with this Bill. Certain powers in the original Act were not put into operation.  I hope the Minister, when replying, will deal with the points I have raised.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Senator Foran reminded the House that there was a Bill before it, because up to that point I think Senators had been discussing almost every problem that could be said to have any relation to house building.  Senator Quirke occupied a good deal of time in putting up arguments against the case which he said Senator Sir John Keane had made, but which, I think, everyone will agree, the Senator did not make.</P>

      <P>Senator Quirke did not seem to get the point that Senator Sir John Keane was driving at, but what he did say, when taken in conjunction with what Senator Sir John Keane said, was, in my opinion, the strongest argument that could be made for Senator Sir John Keane's point, namely, the establishment of some body which could be looked upon as a directing authority in the matter of housing in the country.  I am largely in agreement with what Senator Foran said, that this Bill has probably been brought forward at too late a date.  In a short time we ought to have enough houses for all the people.  I agree that whatever planning remains to be done ought to have some relation to, and be in harmony with, surrounding conditions as far as possible.  Senator Sir <Col N="1364" /> John Keane drew attention to the conditions in what he termed a Gaeltacht village.  Senator Quirke apparently had no fault to find with the conditions there.  They did not offend his eye, but yet his plea that the old style of architecture should be perpetuated as much as possible was, I think, an indication that he is not satisfied with what we are doing in the matter of building.  I agree with Senator The McGillycuddy that to put Senator Quirke's idea into operation would not be just as simple as it looks.</P>
      <P>I think the main trouble in getting back to the thatched roof and so satisfying our æsthetic sense, is that not alone is there difficulty in getting reapers and binders and in getting thatchers, who are becoming fewer, but the fact that we have no men to wield flails in the country so that to get material for thatched roofs is a practical impossibility.  If it were possible to return to the thatched roof certainly it would be a very great improvement on some of the roofs that we see on new structures in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bare structures that one sees dotting the landscape as one passes along the roads of our country are all the greater offence to the eye because they are new.  It is because these structures are visible to everybody who travels through the country that I think there is some substance in the point made by Senator Sir John Keane.  I cannot see how you are going to have a scheme each part of which will contribute towards a harmonious whole, unless you have one directing mind able to look over the country as a whole, directing all your housing plans.  If you have the Land Commission segregated from local government, doing its planning for a scheme of houses on a new estate, which is a mile or so outside a country town where an entirely different scheme has been adopted, there is something in the result that is not pleasing, something that is not giving the picture of the country, that would be produced it all our schemes were treated as of a piece.  Apart from what the Land Commission may do, or apart from the housing schemes carried out in country towns by the local authorities, you have houses erected by <Col N="1365" /> individuals who obtained grants under the housing policy at present operated by the Department, which are most unsightly. If you contrast many of the new buildings with the older thatched houses which they are supposed to replace, from the æsthetic point of view all the advantage lies with the older structure.</P>
    <P>It does seem as if we were looking the stable after the steed has been stolen.  Notwithstanding the energy that the Minister has put into the housing drive, for which he was paid such high tributes by Senator Madden and others, it is doubtful if this Bill means anything more than that you are going to plan after all your houses have been built.  You may go on building more houses in your cities and towns and throughout the countryside, but you are not improving the picture in the countryside, whoever is responsible for the housing schemes. If you are going to have any harmony in building schemes in cities and towns it can only be achieved by having one group of people who will look at the problem as a whole in the country and who will have the same architect or the same artist to plan for the country as a whole.  The country is small, and the number of new houses we shall require for the future will not run into many hundreds of thousands, judging by the drift in population.  The solution of our housing problem, from that point of view, is not going to be so terrifying as it is sometimes made out to be; but whatever we are going to do about it, there should be some attempt at a common plan.  I do not think that Senator Quirke's desire is possible of achievement in the conditions of to-day.  If it were the old style of architecture and the old method of roofing houses would be a great improvement on the systems adopted in housing to-day.  It is mainly with a view to making the appearance of our housing schemes less displeasing that I urge there is some substance in the point made by Senator Sir John Keane.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very interesting discussion on this Bill, a very wide and all-embracing debate. I am interested in everything that has <Col N="1366" /> been said and the suggestions that have been made for improvement.  With regard to the operation of town-planning legislation, there was practically no town-planning legislation, as such, in existence until I introduced the 1934 Act, which we are now proposing to amend.  There was power given to local authorities under various Acts, Public Health Acts and Housing Acts, to control in certain limited ways, development of roads, streets and housing but, <i>qua</i> town planning, there was no power in legislation in this country enabling local authorities to make plans for cities and towns and to control development. As I say, the first effort was made in the legislation introduced by me in 1934.</P>
      <P>Senator Conlon asked what plans had been adopted by local authorities since 1934.  The answer is none.  No plans have been actually adopted by any local authority.  Of course, one should not leave the answer in that way because a plan takes a considerable time to formulate.  The time depends on the size of the area to be planned. The Dublin Corporation have had, for some years now, a number of town-planning experts drawing up a plan for the City of Dublin.  It will be some years more before that plan is completed. I do not know, nor do I think anybody knows, how long that plan will take but it is generally expected that it will take some years to complete it.  One of the reasons for the legislation we are dealing with to-day is to give to the local authority, the Dublin Corporation, certain additional powers to control developments in the interim, powers which they had not had, even under the 1934 Act.  Experience of the working of the 1934 Act has shown that certain additional powers are necessary for the interim period and these powers are being dealt with in the Act now before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like members of local authorities, and particularly members of the Dáil and Seanad, to discuss the Town Planning Act, more particularly at meetings of the local authorities to which they belong.  There are members of the Dáil and members of the Seanad of all Parties who, so far as I know, have not suggested at meetings of their local authorities&mdash;county <Col N="1367" /> councils, corporations and boards of health&mdash;that these local authorities ought to make use of the powers provided by the Dáil and the Seanad to control developments.  They have not urged on these authorities, I say with all respect, as much as they should, the necessity for using the powers that are in existence.  Many of the evils that were complained of, rightly complained of, with regard to unsightly buildings and other matters, could be dealt with under the legislation that exists if local authorities would avail of that legislation.</P>
    <P>With regard to certain types of derelict sites and derelict buildings, there is no power even under the Town Planning Act to deal with them at present.  There is a gap there that needs to be filled, and that gap I hope will be filled in the next few months. We have a Bill, which deals with that amongst other matters, in the draftsman's hands at present, and when it is introduced, I hope we shall be able to provide local authorities with all the power that is necessary and that they will have sufficient power to enable them to deal with all the problems that were raised by Senators with regard to derelict sites in town and country.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane suggested a central authority to control development. I have heard that idea put forward by others besides Senator Keane in regard to matters other than town planning.  Senator Baxter, Senator The McGillycuddy and others, backed up that idea.  I do not know if I was right in interpreting Senator Foran as supporting the same idea.  I doubt if he would, though I have a suspicion he did, because I think what these Senators urged the Minister to adopt is a totalitarian idea.  What, then, is to become of democratic control of our local authorities?  What is to happen if the Minister gets mandatory power and writes down to a local authority saying: &ldquo;You must to-morrow abolish all the derelict buildings within your district&rdquo;?  Imagine the noise that would be made if the Minister were to send such an order down to our local authorities.</P>
    <P>We very seldom issue orders.  We <Col N="1368" /> issue advice and recommendations and, no matter how mild the language in which the advice is termed, it is usually described as a &ldquo;ukase&rdquo; or by some other foreign word, half-understood by the person who uses it.  That is the description that is applied to advice or to recommendations sent down by the Minister.  If that type of legislation is required, we shall have completely to alter the system of democratic control that has existed in this country and adopt a system that I do not think Senator Foran would welcome very warmly.</P>

      <P>Local authorities, as a rule, object very strongly to advice from the Minister.  In any case, there is nothing in the world to prevent local authorities at present employing professional men such as architects and town planners to give them advice. Of course, they will have to pay for them.  In a number of cases, not as many as I would like, they have employed architects who are experts in town planning to advise them.  Every local authority is empowered under the Act to operate town planning and has the same power and the same right to seek technical advice, where it is available, provided they pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another subject which was developed at length was the type of roofing used in our houses.  That has a bearing on town planning, on the æsthetic appearance of the country and the improvement of our housing.  Thatching was strongly recommended by several of the Senators, led by Senator Quirke.  I understand that the Senator recently went into a new home and I expect that the next time I visit that area he will have half-a-dozen thatchers engaged in replacing whatever may be on <Col N="1369" /> the roof with thatch.  If he does not do that after his speech to-day, he is very inconsistent.  Senator Sir John Keane was not so anxious for it, as far as I recollect, but Senator McGillycuddy will have to follow the example of Senator Quirke if he is to keep the æsthetic conditions which he knows in the country.</P>
    <P>As I say, it is only in recent years that anything like town planning has been possible because the legislation did not exist.  We were late when we started our Town Planning Bill, because it was only passed in 1934. What Senator Baxter says is quite correct&mdash;we were late, but better late than never.  There is still development going to go on, and this country, with God's help, is going to grow and build more houses&mdash;as many houses as have been built.  There have been a good many built since 1923.  The last Government started, and we continued at a much greater rate.  Thousands have been built, and there will be as many more required before the housing situation is as it should be.  There will be a necessity, if we are to develop on proper lines, for the use, and not in the sparing fashion the powers of the town planning legislation have been used up to the present, but to the fullest extent, by the local authorities of the future, if they are allowed to continue to exist and to control development in their own areas, despite what some of our Senators recommend in the way of totalitarian ideas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is right to a large extent, in this way, that a local authority is bound to provide water and sewerage arrangements. <Col N="1370" /> The person who builds a house, or a row of houses, has to connect them with the water and sewerage schemes if there is such.  If there is not, the local authority can be made by law to supply water and sewerage arrangements.  The cheapest way for the builder is to build his houses in a row.  He is not obliged to build them in a row, and the town planning authority in the area can refuse permission to build in a straight row and can compel a builder to build whatever way they decide, but the most economical way is to build in a row. It saves so much per house if the houses are side by side in the attaching of the house to the water and sewerage services.  The Senator is quite right there.  They are not compelled by law to do it, but it amounts to practically the same thing.  The local planning authority, however, has power to make them build otherwise, if it so decides.</P>

      <P>What I feel is that while the local governing bodies have that power, it is very hard to use it and to say to people who own a certain amount of land: &ldquo;You are not to build in such a way as will make you eligible to receive these amenities provided by the local governing body and we are going to insist on your adding enormously to your cost by building otherwise.&rdquo;  It seems to me that so long as that law exists that way, you are necessarily directing towards ribbon-building. I am in this difficulty, that the amendment I should like to propose in this regard would be the changing of a totally different law, or maybe, bye-law.  It seems to me that I have to appeal to the Minister to try to change the law in such a way that that inducement to an undesirable action, ribbon-building, will be removed.</P>

      <P>You have, but they have imposed very heavy additional <Col N="1371" /> costs on private builders in and around the City of Dublin in the last two or three years in order to provide against ribbon-building.  Senator Honan referred to urban authorities and the necessity for controlling development in their neighbourhood.  They have a certain amount of power under the Town Planning Act to control development in their neighbourhood.  It would be better still if the urban council could induce the county council to adopt the Act and to work in concert with them in the drafting of a scheme for the whole area, rather than to have limited schemes drafted for urban areas, no matter how big, without reference to the other and greater local authority which controls the whole area.  It would be well in all cases if we could get local authorities to act together&mdash;Dublin City and County in conjunction with Kildare and Meath, say.  If they could, and would, act together, it would be for the benefit of all, but, so far, these local authorities have not arrived at that stage of understanding of town planning as to show themselves willing to act in that way in all cases.</P>
      <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon spoke of Galway.  Galway is a city I know since my childhood, when I used to go there to learn Irish.  I have watched it grow and develop, and there could not be a greater example of ugly development anywhere than is to be seen in the City of Galway.  It is a disgrace to everybody concerned&mdash;to the last urban council and the officials, all of whom were responsible in part. It is shocking to see the way that city has been allowed to grow higgledy-piggledy, with any kind of old house built anywhere, without any relation to the city, to its neighbour, or to the surrounding amenities.  I hope to God the new local authority and its officials will show greater respect for themselves, for their city, and for their country than that late local authority and its officials showed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill <Col N="1372" /> be now read a Second Time.  I expect members of the Seanad will have already seen the reports of the discussion on this Bill in the Dáil, and are already acquainted with its terms.  It is not a very long Bill, and its provisions are relatively simple.  The preamble explains the reason of the Bill. It explains that treason is defined in the Constitution in a certain definite way, and that there is need for providing by statute for the punishment of this crime.  Treason in the Constitution is limited to consist only in levying war against the State or assisting any State or person, or inciting or conspiring with any person to levy war against the State, or attempting by force of arms or other violent means to overthrow the organs of government established by the Constitution, or taking part or being concerned in or inciting or conspiring with any person to make or to take part or be concerned in any such attempt.  I have been a pretty long time in political life, and during the whole of that period I have never seen anything like the public confusion in regard to this Bill.  There is hostility to it in certain parts and I want to know why.  Do we desire that levying war against the State here should go unpunished?  Do any of us say for a moment that it is not a crime for which punishment ought to be provided, or do we hold the view that this State, alone of all States, should have no power to defend itself?  Levying war against the State, or assisting any State or person, or inciting or conspiring with any person to levy war against the State, or attempting by force of arms&mdash;and I will deal with that later&mdash;violently to overthrow the Constitution&mdash;do the people who attack the Government for bringing in this Bill say that that is not a crime which ought to be punished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am wondering what people are dreaming of who attack the Government for bringing in this Bill.  I do not understand it, at any rate.  The State we have here is a sovereign independent State, established in its present form through the Constitution which the people themselves have <Col N="1373" /> accepted.  Do the people who attack the Government for bringing in this Bill want to suggest that it is not a crime, which ought to be punished, to conspire with another State or with other people in levying war against the State?  I have been for some time in political life, and I cannot understand for one moment what is the basis of the hostility to this Bill.  I will not say any more about it at this stage.  It may be necessary if we hear some criticism, along the lines I have suggested that are abroad, to answer them.</P>
    <P>The Preamble gives the reason for the introduction of the Bill.  Treason before 1922 was governed, by British statutes.  Perhaps there was a question whether it was included in the Common Law or not.  These statutes were carried over, not merely by the Dáil that was established in 1922 but by an earlier Dáil.  We carried over bodies of English statutes to the extent that they were not inconsistent with the Constitution.  After 1922, to the extent that they were not inconsistent with the 1922 Constitution, treason might be regarded as being governed by that body of law which we took over with special application to the State here.  In 1925 that was regulated by a special statute which was then passed, but the Constitution, to make sure that there was not any question as to what was treason, and so that there might be no confusion of any kind, limited treason to these specific crimes against the State.  It consisted of nothing else but these crimes.  After the passing of the Constitution, treason was a crime definitely directed against the Irish people, against the State which they, in the Constitution, had accepted, and for which they had provided organs, consisted in attacking by violent means or seeking to overthrow these particular organs.</P>
    <P>Why should any person try to overthrow them by violent means?  By the Constitution, any section of the community is entitled to organise itself, and, if it gets a majority, to become the Government, and, if it has a majority in the country, it can change the Constitution.  It can get its majority <Col N="1374" /> in Parliament, and with its majority, it can pass any Act necessary to implement any form of policy that that body stands for.  Why, then, should it be necessary to resort to violent means?  If the State is defending the interests of the Irish people, it has at its disposal all the resources of the community.  It is not as if the State had no means to protect itself. It has, and the majority party, once they become a majority party, can use all the resources of the State to support whatever may be the policy of the State.  I say that at the present time there is no barrier of any kind to any section, and there is no shadow of excuse for any group or any party trying by violent means to make their will effective.  They will only do that if they despair of getting the support of the majority of the people.  No state can exist if any group, no matter what its purpose, can resort, without punishment, to violent means to get control of the resources of the State or to get control of the community.  That is what democracy means.  We are a democratic State, as well as being a sovereign, independent State.  The people have sanctioned it.  It is against democracy for any group or section, where they have a clear way open to them to get their will if they obtain a majority, to resort to force.  If one group resorts to force to drive the community in a certain way, another group will equally resort to force to prevent their doing so.  Consequently, you have between the different groups an obvious conflict, which would bring any State, and not our State alone, into chaos.  The introduction of this Bill followed naturally from the introduction of the Constitution.  It is an implementation of the Constitution which would come in the natural order of events.  Other Bills will have to be introduced to implement the Constitution. Clearly, if the State is to exist at all, one of the first Acts it should pass is an Act to protect itself.  That is what this Bill is doing.</P>
    <P>It is a Bill to protect the State and to protect it by providing legal punishment and method of trial for grave offences against the State which are referred to here.  If Senators look at the first section they will see that it <Col N="1375" /> provides the penalty, which is death, for anybody who is guilty of treason as defined in the Constitution whether the crime against the State is committed within the State or, in the case of an Irish citizen or a person ordinarily resident within the State&mdash; is committed outside.  A person could conspire to levy war against the State from outside as well as within it and could be party to levying war from outside as well as within.</P>
    <P>The next sub-section has to deal with the method of trial, the method of indictment, arraignment and conviction of a person charged with treason, which is to be the same as that provided for murder.  The next section deals with those who encourage, harbour, or comfort any person engaged in committing treason, that is, the offence of felony, and punishment is provided. The punishment is a fine not exceeding £500 or penal servitude for a period not exceeding 20 years or imprisonment for two years or both a fine and imprisonment or a fine and penal servitude at the discretion of the court. Then you have the offence of misprision of treason or concealment.  There the offence is a felony for which the punishment provided is five years penal servitude or a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years.  The Bill is a simple one.  It carries its necessity in every line and as every Senator has read it I do not think it is necessary to go through it section by section.  I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidRobinson" hpid="Mr. Robinson Mr. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was the Minister for Justice who during the debate in the Dáil commented on the fact that when the Constitution was going through the Houses of the Oireachtas there was little criticism of Article 39, which defines treason.  Probably, if Senators or Deputies had really thought or realised what the punishment was to be there might have been more criticism of it.  In the conditions that existed, probably, any discussion would have been of a rather academic nature, as to what was a suitable definition for treason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The moment the punishment was decided upon, by a strange sort of <Col N="1376" /> reversal of the ordinary procedure, the death sentence galvanised the dead bones of the definition into life.  Personally, I am opposed to the death sentence in all these matters.  I think it is revolting and barbarous.  I am not at all impressed by the fact that in foreign countries the punishment for treason practically always is death.  I am more impressed by the fact that in this country certain people who used these provisions to punish persons for treason without even the authority of the people behind them and who are now loudly protesting against the Treason Bill maintained a masterly silence at the time these things happened. They did so I have no doubt through caution, common sense and cowardice combined.</P>
    <P>Some people argue that there are different ways for carrying out the death penalty.  They think possibly that for what might be regarded as political or semi-political offences the death sentence might be carried out in a way that seems to attach a certain glamour to itself, a way that is not in any way, perhaps, degrading. To me they are all alike. Decapitation and the giving of the <i>coup de grace</i> by shooting or by execution are all revolting.  As to hanging, there is probably more than appears on the surface of the sentence which says that &ldquo;you be hanged by the neck until you are dead.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I notice in the margin of the Bill the words &ldquo;punishment of treason.&rdquo;  Death is not punishment at all as I understand it.  There is no doubt the victim as a general rule, unless he is very hard boiled, experiences considerable mental anguish prior to death.  That is not visualised in the Bill.  From the moment he loses consciousness and before death intervenes the prospect of inflicting punishment on him is gone and he exchanges Mountjoy or Maryborough or wherever it is for, at the worst oblivion and, at best, eternal bliss.  I think the general answer to all I am saying is that it is said to be a deterrent.  I think that is totally untrue.  We know many countries, perhaps not in this continent, where <Col N="1377" /> efforts to overthrow the Government are as regular as sweepstakes, and in every case with orgies of shooting and killing.  However, I am only speaking against the death penalty which, perhaps, I am not really entitled to do under this Bill.  As long as the death penalty exists in our criminal code as the maximum of what is called punishment, then I think it is perfectly right it should be applied to the maximum crime against the State.  You cannot get away from that.  What I object to is the death penalty in any circumstances and, of course, feeling as I do, I shall naturally support the Bill.</P>

      <P>In introducing this Bill the Taoiseach expressed a certain amount of surprise&mdash;I think that was the word he used&mdash;at the misrepresentation and misunderstanding which had arisen in connection with the measure, and also at the misinformed opposition to it.  There has been a great deal of opposition which does not seem to be prepared to face the facts deeply.  It seems to me that we must all admit that the State has a right to protect itself, and that, of necessity, there must be some method of punishing crimes against the State. Looking around this House, one realises that a very large number of its present members would have been, at some point or other, guilty of the crime of treason.  Personally, I confess that I did not think it wrong to assist those who were planning to upset the position of the British Government here.  Others felt that it was not wrong to do what seemed to me completely and absolutely wrong&mdash;to use violence to upset an Irish Government because the position of that Irish Government was not fully acceptable. The Taoiseach has set out certain principles which, generally, I accept. To my mind the sooner these principles are accepted by all Parties and by all the people of the country, the better.  The only question, to my mind, which arises is:  Will you get these principles accepted best by insisting upon the death penalty for the complete set of crimes described in the Preamble to this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that I must vote for the principle of punishment <Col N="1378" /> of treason.  I am not a lawyer, and I have no reason to quarrel, even if it were now possible&mdash;which it is not, because it is part of the Constitution&mdash;with the definition of treason as it stands.  However, I have the gravest doubts as to the wisdom of insisting on the death penalty for all the crimes that may come within that category.  I was very much interested to hear the views expressed by Senator Robinson.  I expressed these views in 1925.  I was one of a few who voted against the death penalty in the Bill of 1925.  One thing I am convinced of is that part of our political bitterness and some of our difficulties over a long period have been due to the too frequent, and not to the too infrequent, exercise of the death penalty.  I accept everything the Taoiseach said, so far as I remember, with regard to the duty of the State and the duty of the individual to accept the State, but I do not think that we are now acting wisely in insisting that the only penalty for all the crimes in this category &mdash;which include not only the levying of war against the State but attempting or taking part in, or being concerned with or inspiring other persons to attempt to overthrow the Government by force&mdash;should be the death penalty. I am afraid that our past history makes us minimise the wrong of the crime.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, many people who would consider it quite wrong to sympathise with any sort of violence against another Government would be prepared to sympathise with the use of some form of violence against a Government which they did not like in order to get it out of power.  Everybody knows that we have in Ireland to-day people who want, by a short cut, to get their particular form of government established and who are not willing to wait until they get a majority of the people to support them.  That is not peculiar to Ireland.  New forms of government introduced in the same way have obtained power in other countries and we have the same mentality here. A democratic State must protect itself against that but I believe that such is our mentality, as a result of historical circumstances, that you cause misunderstanding, <Col N="1379" /> create a certain amount of sympathy with the offenders and lessen the effectiveness of your legislation by insisting on the death penalty as the only punishment for any crime that comes within the category in the Preamble.</P>
    <P>I confess that I am opposed altogether to the death penalty.  I do not think that this is the time to give all my reasons.  I have confined myself to consideration of the death penalty specifically in relation to treason.  I am not so much impressed by the horror, because to take up arms against the State, to be willing to risk other people's lives by acts of violence, to attempt to overthrow the Government with any quantity of damage to life and property, is in itself a horrible thing.  I am not filled with sympathy for persons who are wantonly prepared to take that responsibility, but I am not convinced that the State, having caught those persons and having them in their power, is acting wisely or rightly in taking their lives when they could be condemned to penal servitude or held for such lesser period as might be necessary.  I am also convinced that in this way you create sympathy with those who rebel against the State. When a stand was being made for principles that seemed nationally worthy of the sympathy and support of the people, it was possibly a good thing for this country that some of those concerned lost their lives and awakened a certain amount of sympathy amongst people who might not otherwise have sympathised.  Is it wise, when we are standing here for a democratic State, that we should create sympathy with persons many of whom are as honest as we were when we possibly could have been found guilty of treason?  Is it wise to treat these people&mdash;many of whom, I repeat, are as honest and sincere as we were but completely wrongheaded&mdash;as martyrs?</P>
    <P>This is not, I think, in any sense a Party question, but, whether it is or not, I ask the Government seriously to consider whether they should be adamant in their refusal to change the provision of the death penalty.  In my strong objection to the death penalty, <Col N="1380" /> I am in a very small minority, but, if the Government feel that it must be retained, then I would urge strongly that it should be removed in the form in which it appears in the Bill and that penal servitude or a lesser penalty should be prescribed for forms of treason which manifest themselves in a particular manner.  This is a matter on which I have thought a good deal and on which I feel strongly, and I respectfully put my views before the House and the Government.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the last two speakers for a different reason from the reasons put forward by them.  The history of our country in the last 100 years has been such that, by bringing in this Bill in its present form, we are following in the footsteps of the English and making the mistakes which the English made in the various periods when the people rose against English administration.  It seems to me a most undesirable thing to have an absolutely cut-and-dried sentence in the case of these various offences.  There is an additional point in connection with Section 2, which deals with persons who encourage, harbour or comfort persons guilty of treason.  It will be found that the man who encourages and harbours is really the &ldquo;hidden hand&rdquo;.  Whereas the man who actually commits an act of minor treason, as part of the big scheme, will suffer the death penalty, the man behind the scenes who encourages the commission of the offence will escape with a fine of £500.  Unless there is some very strong reason, I think that that person should receive as severe punishment as the man who actually commits the offence.</P>

      <P>As I do not wish to give a silent vote on this Bill, I ask permission to say a few words. &ldquo;Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom&rdquo; and the freedom which we enjoy in this part of Ireland&mdash;as full and unhedged as that in any nation in the world&mdash;has been paid for in such a heavy cost of blood and anguish that it behoves us to guard it well.  It would be a criminal neglect of duty on the part of our Legislature to fail to bulwark it by the provision of such a <Col N="1381" /> defensive measure as that bodied forth in the present Bill.</P>
      <P>It would be as foolishly, blindly and childishly irresponsible as to leave our boundaries undefended in a world where opposing nations are arraying themselves for a tremendous conflict and where the strategic significance of our position has received an unwelcome amount of attention in quarters where drastic action has a disconcerting habit of following closely on the deliberation.  For this reason, I propose to vote for the Second Reading of this Bill and I feel that I committed myself already to an acceptance of the principle underlying it when I voted &mdash;as I did proudly and gladly&mdash;for the Constitution of which this Bill seeks to implement the 39th Article.</P>
      <P>Ours is a sovereign, independent, democratic State and this declaration of its status, made by our people in one of the most significant moments of our history, carries with it the deliberate acceptance of responsibility for defending the sovereignty, the independence and the democracy thus solemnly proclaimed. The treason against which this Bill sets forth penalties is treason against our own people; the State which it seeks to protect is the sovereign, independent, democratic State they themselves set up; the organs of Government around which it throws its shield are those which derive their powers&mdash;legislative, executive and judicial&mdash;under God, from the people.  It is because I cherish passionately the ideals of freedom and democracy, and the independence and democracy of my own people, that I propose to vote for this Bill which is designed to protect them and that is the sole reason for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two points have arisen in connection with it.  One is whether or not it is the proper time to introduce the Bill. I am one of those people who believe that it would have been better to have introduced it immediately after passing of the Constitution, but I am prepared to admit that this may not be an inopportune moment.  Recent events in the world have brought home to us the danger to freedom and democracy and to such States as ours as a result of the rise of totalitarian systems of <Col N="1382" /> Government and dictatorships, and recent developments, not so far from home, have brought home to us that the danger to our State is not so far away as some people might think Therefore, it behoves us and it makes it more peremptorily our duty to protect our rights and liberties and it is the sole design of the present Bill to do so.</P>
    <P>As to the question of the death penalty, I am one of those who abhor the very thought of it&mdash;not perhaps from reason, but from instinct, but instinct is not to be disregarded; it comes to us charged with racial and ancestral vibrations from the deepest part of our being, and it is a thing that we cannot with prudence ignore.  I had hoped that the Seanad one day would have more usefully considered the whole question of the death penalty in this country in a calmer atmosphere, but perhaps this would not be an inopportune moment to do so.  I must say that I was not exactly impressed by the argument made by the Taoiseach in the other House that the penalty for murder in the State is death and that the same penalty for treason should also be there.  It seems to me that the two things are on a different plane, and I think that at all events there is a considerable amount of reason to make us hesitate as to that.  However, if it is for the common good of the people and if their protection necessitates the inclusion of the death penalty in this Bill, then I am not prepared to oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious obligation for which every member of this House, by his individual action, has to accept responsibility.  The council of which I happen to be a member discussed the question of this Bill and unanimously rejected it.  In any democratic country the will of the majority must or ought to prevail. Real freedom confers on every citizen the right to select the Government or policy to which he is prepared to subject himself, and it also imposes on him acceptance of that policy or Government, whether to him it is personally distasteful or not.  That is the essence and spirit of democracy, and any challenge to that spirit must be met <Col N="1383" /> resolutely by all the forces of the State.  No man&mdash;no body of men, no matter what high-sounding motives they may claim for a monopoly, of patriotism or political wisdom&mdash;is entitled to impose by force his will on the other sections of the community.  It is no justification to say that such a man or such a body of men may previously have held, by virtue of the will of the people, certain rights, privileges and prerogatives, if, in the interim, the majority of the people, using the ballot machine, have invested another Party with full authority and legislative power.</P>
      <P>It is an extraordinary instance of confused thinking that men impelled, as I believe, by sincere and passionate love of freedom, should undertake desperate deeds to deny freedom to their fellow-citizens.  That is tyranny to which no one but a slave must submit, no matter even though it was applauded, up to 1932, by the Ministers who now condemn it.  The acceptance of office by members of a political Party imposes on them obligations to carry into effect the basic policies and principles which they enunciated to the people and which brought for them election into office and into power.  There are bilateral obligations, and just as a Government is entitled to require obedience from the citizens to their measures, so the citizens are entitled to demand from the Government the fulfilment of their basic, definite promises, which extracted from the electorate that authority and election to power and government; and if the Government are unable or unwilling to discharge these basic principles or policies, then I say that it is the duty of the Government to surrender these rights and authority to the people.  If they fail to give effect to their fundamental pre-election policy, and still retain office, they are guilty in my opinion of treachery to the electorate who, in my submission, ought to be absolved of fealty to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Senator here on my left-I think it was Senator Douglas&mdash; on the question of capital punishment. There is a strong concensus of opinion <Col N="1384" /> through the whole country against this Bill.  There is an old proverb to the effect that we ought to learn from our mistakes.  I oppose this Bill, therefore, because the Government have broken faith by failing to carry out their pre-election policy and promises and thus have forfeited the loyalty of the electorate.  I oppose it on the further ground that he who seeks justice ought to have clean hands, and the members of the Government flouted consistently majority rule when they themselves were in the minority. I oppose it because I feel that the power of life and death for undefined offences cannot safely be entrusted to this Government. If Satan, the father of lies, were to introduce a Bill to punish perjury it would provide the only parallel that I can imagine to the effrontery of this measure being introduced by the members of the present Government who were sympathetic to treason in the past.  They have the audacity to come to the Oireachtas for power to execute the very men whom, up to the day they were elected to power, they had incited to flout the authority of this Oireachtas.  Do I exaggerate?</P>

      <P>Listen to Mr. de Valera on 10th November, 1927:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am here, recognising this House because of its personnel and for nothing more, as an Irish Assembly and I am prepared as a rule of order and for no other reason to accept majority rule as defining national policy for the time being.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again on the 14th March, 1929, he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I still hold that our right to be regarded as the legitimate government of this country is faulty; that this House itself is faulty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Those who continued on in that Organisation...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>that is Sinn Féin&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...which we have left can claim <Col N="1385" /> exactly the same continuity that we claimed up to 1925.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Public Safety Act, on November 10th, 1927, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The young men in whom I and members opposite should have a special interest were enrolled originally in the Army of the Irish Republic, and they were sworn publicly, so far as it was possible to do it, in the most solemn manner to uphold the State against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and what we are trying to do is to interpose between those men, whose crime is that they have been faithful to the ideal with which we all started&mdash; whatever we may have come to now &mdash;and save them from being driven to despair.  I think that to pass Public Safety Acts like this is turning your back upon them and throwing them out when you have used them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Precisely, I submit, what the Taoiseach and his Ministers propose to do in the Bill before this House. Again, on the same day, Mr. de Valera said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They ask us what is treason?... What is this treachery against the community as a whole?  The difficulty is that we here and some men outside do not understand that word in the same sense.  They think that they are the loyal people and that we are the traitors.  They think that they are loyal to the State which they swore to defend and for which their brothers died.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I invite the Taoiseach to explain to us the difference between the treason which in 1927, after the murder of Kevin O'Higgins, and in 1931, after the murders of Curtin, Ryan and Armstrong, was excused, condoned and almost applauded by An Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It has gone like the snows of yesteryear. The word has gone forth to all loyal Fianna Fáil clubs, &ldquo;Oh, breathe not its name, let it rest in the shade where cold and unhonoured its relics are laid.&rdquo;  It has served its purpose in electing to high and profitable office the playactors who want to execute those men now who believe that it still lives.

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I was astonished to hear the speech made by Senator Madden.  He talked about confused thinking.  If one were to look for an example of confused thinking, one could not find a clearer one than the Senator's speech.  Surely we must make a start somewhere on this question of constitutional order. It is not a bit of use having this mischievous raking up; this drawing of parallels between now and what happened ten or 15 years ago.  We all know that the standard of treason in times of civil war and disorder, and the behaviour of people in those times, cannot be applied to settled times when circumstances have totally changed.  The starting point of this whole thing.  I understand, was the Constitution.  That Constitution was made by the free Parliament of this country.  In that Constitution there had to be, and there was, a definition of treason.  I do not know if the Senator was a member of the Parliament in those days, but, if not, I have yet to learn that he made any protest as a citizen, or in his public capacity, when the Constitution was being passed. He comes along now and, in a most mischievous statement, stirs up a lot of mud and rakes up a lot of confused <Col N="1387" /> thought about what was said in the past.  No State could possibly exist unless it had some means for its self-protection: some law for dealing with those who rise in arms against the State.  I am really astonished that the Senator, bearing in mind his responsibilities as a Senator, should make a speech of the kind that he has made: a speech that was not unpremeditated, but one that was carefully prepared and largely read from manuscript.</P>
      <P>We all must feel that this is not a Party question at all.  Everyone must realise that the State must be protected.  Where we differ is only on points of detail.  Personally, I am in favour of the Bill.  I may be old fashioned in saying that those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.  You have got to regard this as a practical question of administration: of what is likely to be a deterrent to crimes of this kind.  I cannot help feeling that the death penalty, for crimes of this kind, is a wholesome deterrent.  Furthermore, I feel that if the people who commit those crimes are only kept in prison there is a constant agitation for their release, a constant state of ferment which should be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument that the death penalty is not a Christian method is, of course, a discredited one because all down the ages Christian Governments have had the death penalty as part of their legal system.  There is a difficulty with regard to having the death penalty alone.  You have different degrees of complicity in outrages.  You have different penalties provided. Different punishments are awarded to people adjudged guilty in law of various offences.  You have, for instance, one penalty for murder, and a different one for manslaughter.  There is the death penalty for murder, and a lesser penalty for manslaughter.  Surely parallels must arise in the matter of treason, in the case of leaders who are primarily responsible, and of their tools who may be equally guilty of treason but not deserving of the full death penalty.  Would it not be possible to introduce an amendment providing for the death penalty or for <Col N="1388" /> a term of penal servitude as the court might determine.  I am sure the Government must have given consideration to that matter: whether there should not be different degrees of treason and graded penalties in consequence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnLynch" hpid="Mr. E. Lynch Mr. E. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>One has an extreme difficulty in approaching this question. An Taoiseach, in speaking, said that every State had to have some law or laws to defend itself: that every State was entitled to have laws for the defence of itself and to provide against treasonable acts on the part of its citizens.  Everybody can agree with that general principle.  States more democratic than this have had to have repressive legislation of that character, but, in this particular case that we are viewing in this country, I think we must have some regard to the historical reasons for certain happenings and things that took place here in the past.</P>
      <P>The Party that I am associated with has decided to oppose this Bill.  We believe it is not necessary and we shall attempt to give reasons for so thinking. We believe that the Bill itself intrinsically is a bad and undesirable Bill.  The Taoiseach, in introducing it, said that it was necessary that the Constitution should be implemented. It was mainly on that ground, I think, that he built a case for this legislation. It seems to us that the implementation of the Constitution could remain in abeyance in regard to Article 39.  We think that there are adequate powers in the possession of the Government to deal with anything that might be considered to be of a treasonable character.  The Taoiseach, I think, made some reference to this State taking over a body of law from Great Britain.  In that body of law there would undoubtedly be found all the powers necessary to deal with any treasonable act, or anything approaching treason, without further legislation being introduced and passed by this Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The status of this country is unquestionably a peculiar one.  It is difficult to know what status the country occupies at all before anything in the <Col N="1389" /> nature of a world court.  Difficulties arise from that.  Probably it is not desirable that we should discuss that aspect of the case in relation to treason, although in discussing treason one has to have regard to the political status of the country and its relation to what was known, or is known, as the Commonwealth of Nations: as to whether it is inside or outside that comity, and hence its relation to the King as head of that organisation. Treason is intimately related to the King, and if there is confusion of thought in regard to this matter, as the Taoiseach says there is, it is due very largely to the peculiar relationship of this country to that organisation, and to what was, and as far as some of us know still is, the headship of that organisation, known at one time as the British Empire, and subsequently as the Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>Leaving that rather involved aspect of the subject aside, and coming to the more ordinary aspect of it, the country at the present time, as far as we can see, is perfectly normal.  In recent times two Circuit Court judges in the South of Ireland were presented with white gloves.  That would seem to indicate that there was no activity of a character which had any complexion of treason attached to it.  If these are the prevailing circumstances, with peace in the country, why is it necessary to introduce legislation of this character?  No matter what may be said about countries requiring to have legislation of this character at the same time, having regard to the history of this country, one can only look upon legislation of this kind as provocative and, to some extent, disturbing, especially having regard to certain international relations in Europe.  In consequence, we think it might be well to postpone it.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this question of treason.  Perhaps it is one which may be peculiar to the ideological standpoint of a Labour Party or a democratic Party, a democratic Party or a Labour Party just as national, just as republican and just as desirous of seeing this country attain as full and complete a political status in the <Col N="1390" /> comity of nations as any other Party in this country.  Our Party believes that if this country was so organised, as we believe any Irish Ireland Party would have it organised, there would be no necessity for legislation of this character or any other form of repressive legislation.  Very largely subversive forces which arise in a country have their origin and are dependent upon certain economic circumstances.  We believed, with all those who believed in an Irish Ireland, that as soon as we were in control of the economic, as well as the political destinies of this country, the resources of this country would be so organised that there would be no destitution, which is the basic cause of these subversive forces.  We, therefore, say that if the present Government were to use the powers in their possession so to organise the country, there would have been no necessity to introduce legislation of this character or legislation even approaching it because no citizen of Ireland&mdash;and it is only citizens that can be held to be in treason&mdash;would be found in treason against any Constitution in this country.  Therefore, we suggest that instead of introducing legislation of this character, the Government should proceed so to order and arrange the economic life of this country that there will not be people hungry and destitute in it.  Neither will there be that terrific exodus which takes place annually from the country and causes our citizens to go abroad to seek in other countries the livelihood which they are denied at home. If that is done, then the annoyance which apparently is caused to the Government by certain activities elsewhere will die down and will possibly disappear.  In our opinion, the solution lies along those lines, along the lines of the creation of an economic order in this country suitable and satisfactory to the people of the country and suitable and satisfactory to every decent State which labels itself essentially democratic.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Bill itself, perhaps, what I am going to say might be more appropriate on another stage of the Bill, but I do suggest that the term &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; is a very wide term <Col N="1391" /> There are so many things which may be comprehended in the term &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; that, even as has been said elsewhere, the pulling down of synagogues could be interpreted as levying war. Surely when the legislation was being framed, it should have been possible to use some phrase rather than that archaic phrase borrowed from the Feudalistic laws of Great Britain, to narrow down the term in such a way that it would not be so wide and all embracing as to make it possible for small insignificant acts of a riotous character, which take place from time to time in every country, from being comprehended within the legislation with which we are now dealing.  However, that is probably an argument that would be more appropriate when we come to consider this Bill in Committee as I presume it will not be rejected here this evening.</P>
    <P>Speaking for this Party it may seem extravagant, but I would say that this is not the time to introduce the Bill, that there is no necessity whatsoever for the Bill.  No fundamental case has been made for it.  There is adequate legislation in the possession of the Government at the present time to deal with anything which arises or which is likely to arise.  In that connection, let me say that there are many things happening in another country which, if they were happening here, and if this Bill were law, would be treated in such a manner as might cause a very serious outery in this country.  Great Britain has not found it necessary to introduce any legislation of this character, and in those circumstances it seems to me unnecessary to introduce legislation of this character at this time, having regard to the peaceful condition of this country. Why then is the Bill introduced? In these circumstances we intend to oppose the Bill.  We trust that the Government will see their way to withdraw the Bill and not to create the very situation which they desire to avoid, by persevering in the passing, and the enactment subsequently, of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to vote for the Second Reading of the Bill for two <Col N="1392" /> reasons.  In the first place, I am in favour of what I regard as the principle of the Bill.  The Constitution defines treason and the Bill proceeds to define the punishment for treason. I am entirely in favour of the principle that there should be punishment for treason.  We can subsequently proceed to deal with certain defects in the Bill, with regard to the form of the punishment and the particular types of crime for which punishments are set out.  In so far as the Bill sets out to define punishment for treason, I am in favour of the principle and I intend to vote for it.  In the second place, I want to suggest to Senator Lynch and to others that, in all the circumstances, and having regard to the small powers enjoyed by this House, it would be very foolish proceeding for this House to defeat the Bill on its Second Stage, even if it could get a majority to do so.  That would entirely prevent the House from having any influence on the character of the legislation.  If the Bill is read a Second Time, we may perhaps be able to convince the Minister in charge, the Taoiseach in this instance, that certain amendments should be inserted in the Bill.  I am, therefore, going to vote for the Second Reading of the Bill, without prejudice to my right to put down amendments and to make my decision on the Final Stage of the Bill subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the confusion of thought, of which there seems to be a very considerable amount on this matter, I was rather surprised at the way in which the Taoiseach began his speech on this stage of the Bill.  He seemed to be rather vexed about something or other.  I thought, coming in after he had said a few sentences, that somebody had interrupted him or criticised him at the opening of his speech, but I gathered subsequently that he was vexed at some interruption or at something somebody had said somewhere else.  A considerable part of the criticism on this Bill is due, in my view, to confusion of mind, but I think it is also right to say that no person made a greater contribution than the Taoiseach himself over a long period of years to that particular confusion of mind of which we have now so many <Col N="1393" /> examples.  Even to-day I thought I detected some of the old style of utterance of which Senator Madden gave us a few quotations.  He spoke of there being no shadow of excuse now for treason in this sovereign independent State, and said that we had a Constitution which the people had accepted. In all that, there seemed to be an implication that acts may be such that they are treason against one Constitution but not treason against another. That, Sir, is a very bad doctrine, a doctrine which would lead certainly to anarchy or to perpetual revolution in this or any other country.</P>
    <P>I seemed to find in that statement a loophole.  For example, if the Constitution be altered as the previous Constitution was altered, does treason alter its complexion, its gravity, or its evil? Are we to have a different kind of punishment for treason and are people to look upon acts in a different way if you have a different Constitution? For example, if we could agree upon a definition of treason, if we could agree that any attempt in arms, apart from this archaic phrase of &ldquo;levying war,&rdquo; any attempt to accomplish a political aim by force of arms, is treasonable and that no responsible politician in the State or no responsible person should give any comfort or assistance to persons who are endeavouring to accomplish their political aims by force of arms; if we could agree upon that and if we could further agree that no one should attempt by force of arms to upset an elected Government, then we would have made very great progress and we would have cleared away a great deal of the confusion of thought about which the Taoiseach complains.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson occasionally appeared to suffer from the same kind of confusion of thought in his otherwise clear statement.  This House has exactly the same title as its predecessor, no more.  This Minister has the same title as his predecessor, and no more, and the crime of treason against him is as heinous as, and no more heinous than, it was against his predecessors or our predecessors.  I am in entire agreement with the principle that those who take up arms against the State should be punished. <Col N="1394" /> For that reason I am supporting the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before I pass on to deal with certain points in the Bill itself.  I should like to say that I do not agree with Senator Lynch that the body of British law taken over was sufficient for our purposes.  It was because it was found that it was not sufficient or that it was not suitable in many directions that the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925, presumably, was brought in.  I think that when we are defining treason here, it does not matter twopence halfpenny whether we are inside the British Commonwealth of Nations or outside it.  I do not think any man should be allowed to use a gun in Kildare Street against a Deputy simply because of the fact that he is going to enter a Parliament that has some connection with the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I think that it is very much to be deplored that anybody should preach a doctrine, either impliedly or explicitly, that would give any encouragement or comfort to a person who wants to use a gun in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch appears to think that there is no necessity for this measure because the country is normal.  I do not think the country is normal, for one thing.  I believe some people were blown up on the Border, but whether the country is normal or not, I do not think it a valid argument that you should not bring in a Bill of this kind because the country is normal.  It is while the country is normal, and while we are in a position to discuss the matter calmly, that a Bill of this character should be brought in and passed.  I think Senator Lynch subscribed on behalf of the Labour Party to a doctrine which I find most hateful, namely, that economic causes were behind the rising of 1916 and that economic causes are always behind unrest in this country.  That I think is not so.  I think the Senator is living in a fool's paradise and he has very little grasp of realities if he thinks that a Labour Government with a majority, or any other Government, could bring about by organisation of the country's economic activities such a state of affairs that there would be no such <Col N="1395" /> thing as treason and no necessity for this kind of legislation.  Any experience we have had of such organisation, even in Russia, would imply that when Labour Governments get into power they are well able to use this kind of weapon and they do not find an improvement of economic conditions sufficient to make this kind of weapon unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Treason in this country, while it may be assisted by certain economic circumstances, by no means has its roots in economic circumstances.  I think that destitution is not the basis of armed activity against the State in this country, and I do not think it ever was.  I know a number of people here who were engaged in armed activity against the British State, and the Taoiseach was engaged in armed activity against an Irish State, and none of those people were destitute when they were engaged in these activities.  I think that Senator Lynch and the Labour Party are labouring under a delusion if they think that all you have to do to have everything beautiful and to abolish this kind of crime is to make economic conditions better, or indeed, to try to make them better.  In this country, activity calling itself nationalist, whether it was really nationalist or not, never had an economic basis at all, and much more has been done to create unrest in this State by a certain type of speech than by any economic conditions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself, it appears to me that it is very difficult to understand why the penalty of death is prescribed for every degree of the offence of levying war against the State.  We must have some account of our own history and of our own immediate and remote past.  I am not a lawyer, and I do not pretend to go into all these arguments about constructive levying of war, but I do know that quite decent young fellows and quite decent young women might be induced to join an organisation which had for its object the overthrow of the State by arms, and perhaps the Taoiseach would tell us whether mere membership, mere <Col N="1396" /> attending of a meeting, mere active membership without the carrying of arms, of an organisation which had clearly for its object the overthrow of the State by arms, could be regarded as making a person guilty of the offence of opposing the State by force of arms.  If so, I think the punishment of death for that particular offence is entirely too great, and I should like to suggest that one of the evil consequences that would flow from a prosecution before a jury, where the punishment was death, would be that the jury would go against the weight of the evidence and find the person innocent&mdash;a remedy which juries always have, but to which special tribunals might not resort.  But if you do indict a person before a jury for an offence, the punishment for which may be death, the reaction certainly in this country would be that the jury would go against the weight of the evidence, and not find the person guilty, and that, I think, would be a very bad thing for the administration of justice and for the State.</P>
    <P>I do not want to enter into the arguments with regard to the death penalty.  I think it is perhaps a matter which might be discussed generally in some other connection, but I do certainly agree that only for a very small number of defined offences should there be the death penalty.  One of the difficulties in this country, as Senators will realise, of other penalties than the death penalty is that two generations at least have been reared to believe that no other sentence will ever be carried out.  We have been reared to believe that 20 years' penal servitude may be only 18 months, or only 18 days, with a bit of luck, so that one of the things contributed by our history is that the only penalty which acts as a deterrent at all may very well be the death penalty.  But be that as it may, it is certainly true that this Bill contemplates a great variety of offences, some very grave and some not so grave, for which the death penalty may be inflicted, and that, I think, is something which ought to be altered.  I hope we will have an opportunity of putting down amendments and that we will have favourable and sympathetic consideration <Col N="1397" /> for some type of amendment which would remedy that very obvious defect in the Bill.  If that were remedied, I should be entirely in favour of it, but I feel that the Bill should get a Second Reading so that amendments may be put in.  If it does not get a Second Reading, the Bill will become law without any further action by the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Senator who has just spoken, that even in a normal and happy State legislation such as this, dealing with treason, is probably a necessity.  I cannot think of any State arriving at such a degree of contentment among all its citizens, contentment not only with their lot in life, but with the manner in which they are governed, that they will not be discontented from time to time with the Government and will not be willing to take up arms in order to change that Government.  I find no initial difficulty in accepting the principle of the Bill which the Taoiseach has brought before us.  Moreover, I think it is the duty of the Government of the day to warn the legislature when such measures are necessary, and, therefore, even if one is not convinced that this is the most suitable occasion on which such a Bill should be introduced, I think one has to take the word of the responsible Government of the day, as the responsibility lies with them, and carry out their wishes in principle, at any rate, if not in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that point also, I have no difficulty in accepting the principle the Taoiseach has put forward.  I admit that I should like to have had something more from him as to the reasons for the introduction of this legislation now.  It appears to me, from a comparison of the very brief Bill before us with the Act already in existence, that it does not carry the legislation against treason any further than the existing legislation carries it, and the mere fact that the Constitution has been changed does not appear to me to give adequate justification for the introduction of a fresh Bill; but at the same time, I am quite willing to accept the Government's opinion that such <Col N="1398" /> legislation is necessary.  I notice that the Bill, while it is almost entirely, if not entirely, made up of clauses and phrases which are in the existing legislation, does not propose to repeal any previous legislation, and I assume that this Bill is something in addition to the existing statutes and does not replace any of them, or any part of them.  I do not think the Taoiseach drew our attention to any such intention or effect of this Bill and I should be glad if he would explain the situation in that respect.</P>
    <P>While I accept the view that the Legislature should accept the advice of the responsible Government of the day as to the passage of such a Bill, I think it is the duty of every member of the Oireachtas to give the clauses of the Bill particular and critical attention, to consider them carefully and to offer any comments or criticisms that appear to be proper and necessary, and from that point of view, there are several matters in the Bill which I think require consideration. For instance, we have the first words after the preamble:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every person who commits treason within the State shall be liable on conviction thereof to suffer death.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I join in the general objection to the death penalty expressed by Senators Robinson, Douglas and The McGillycuddy. I think we ought not, in passing fresh legislation for any purpose, to include the death penalty.  I should like to see it removed from the existing penal code altogether.  I think it is a barbarous survival.  I know no justification for it, either on humanitarian or practical grounds.  One remembers the saying of a witty French journalist.  In discussing the abolition of the death penalty, he suggested that the assassins should begin.  Quite unconsciously, he was accepting the ethics of the assassin instead of the ethics of civilised society.  I think it is a degrading attitude to take, and by punishing the crime of treason with the penalty of death, we are, I think, accepting the ethics of the barbarous, the assassin, <Col N="1399" /> and the criminal, and not those of a Christian or moral society.</P>
    <P>When one comes to consider the question from the humanitarian point of view&mdash;we may or may not agree with the death penalty, but I think there is little to be said for it in the case of murder and everything to be said against it in the case of treason.  It may be defended by arguments put forward from two points of view, that it is a proper and just punishment, fitting the crime.  What I have said already gives the answer I would make to that, but when it is further said that it is a deterrent, I do not think there is any justification for the argument in the case of murder and still less in the case of treason. In the case of a serious crime like murder, what is a deterrent is the certainty of detection and not the nature of the punishment.  That is the opinion of those who have studied the matter most thoroughly, that the death penalty does not deter many people and that the certainty of detection is a much stronger deterrent.  I join with the other Senators who have objected to the retention of the death penalty as punishment for any crime against life or the State.</P>
    <P>To come to the present offence we are considering, treason, does anybody suppose that imposing the death penalty on a man whose devotion to what he regards as an ideal&mdash;a political ideal, if you like&mdash;is strong enough to lead him to his death, for which he willingly sacrifices his life, deters others from following the same course? The whole history of our country shows that the deaths of the martyrs, as they come to be regarded even by those who would not approve of their actions, or think that they were right in their decision, does not deter others from following in their steps.  It encourages others to follow in their steps, and, if under this Bill, when it becomes a law, any Irishmen are put to death, with every justice from the point of view of law and with fair trial, I believe it will encourage rebellion and discontent in the country rather than establish firm government.  So <Col N="1400" /> far from the death penalty being a deterrent of this particular form of offence, I suggest, although it seems almost absurd to say so, that it will be attractive to others to follow the same course.</P>
    <P>When one comes to examine the terms of the Bill further down, there are some points on which I should like to get some explanation from the Taoiseach.  In introducing the measure, the Taoiseach stated to-day that the form of trial would be the same as for murder.  There is nothing in the Bill before us to show that trial in the case of treason shall be the same as for murder.  There is a statement in the sub-section to the effect that &ldquo;whenever a person charged with treason is indicted therefor before the Central Criminal Court he shall be so indicted in the same manner in all respects as a person charged with murder,&rdquo; but it does not state that in every case trial for treason will be the same as for murder.  It states that before the Central Criminal Court the procedure will be the same.  That does not prevent the Government of the day utilising any other machinery that may be in existence or that may be introduced in the future.  When the Taoiseach said that the procedure would be the same as for murder I cannot see that that has been made clear on the face of the Bill we are now dealing with.  There is nothing in the Bill to show that it should be dealt with before the Central Criminal Court.  Coming to a further clause, which is a very comprehensive one, and deals with encouraging, harbouring or comforting persons guilty of treason, I draw attention to the fact that the offence is not for encouraging any person to commit treason but for encouraging, harbouring or comforting persons engaged in committing treason.  That is made a very grave offence, subject to 20 years' penal servitude, or with a fine of £500, for performing an act which ordinary humanity and Christianity might impose on any citizen.</P>
    <P>It is in the knowledge of everyone in this House that, in the past, people who were engaged in what was <Col N="1401" /> regarded by the law of the time as treason, were harboured and comforted by those who had no sympathy with them, but who did harbour and comfort them out of common humanity and Christian charity.  It is well within the knowledge of all of us that persons wounded in quarrels or battles between different forces in this country were treated in the hospitals, and that medical men were in that way &ldquo;harbouring or comforting&rdquo; such people.  I have no doubt if similar conditions occurred in the future the same thing would happen, and that those who perform that humane duty would put themselves within the reach of this section, if the Bill becomes law. This matter was discussed fully elsewhere, and I think it is disappointing that the Government has not thought fit to introduce some clause to make it clear that the performance of a mere act of charity does not bring anyone within the reach of being charged with a criminal offence.  Senators will notice that the prosecution is not bound to prove that the person so charged was aware that the person encouraged, harboured or comforted was engaged in committing treason.  The weight lies on the person charged to prove that he had no such knowledge.  The person so charged would not be in a different position from any other person charged with an offence before any court.  He has to prove his innocence and if unable to do so he is assumed to have guilty knowledge.  That is a very serious condition to bring into such a measure.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the law will be administered with discretion, and that prosecutions will not be undertaken against those who give the kind of help I referred to.  If the Bill is not to be carried out, better not have it on the Statute Book at all.  There seems little justification for putting a Bill on the Statute Book and at the same time saying: &ldquo;Never mind; it will never be used.&rdquo;  That brings the law into contempt.  The law should be defined to make clear in ordinary language what is an offence.  I am not concerned in arguing that encouraging the commission of treason should not be an <Col N="1402" /> offence that should be punished, but that should be strictly defined, and acts performed simply as acts of charity should not be set down in the criminal code amongst grave offences against the State that are punishable by heavy penalties.  I believe the Government to be within its right in putting proposals of this sort before us, but I cannot but think that they have missed the opportunity to humanise and modernise the law.  The Bill before the House is practically identical with existing law though less complicated, and it appears to me to be far more unfortunate in that it includes possibilities which I feel unhappy about, if they are passed.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.45 p.m., and resumed at 7.15 p.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This being the Second Reading of the Bill, we are dealing with only the principle and I want to say, at the outset, that I entirely approve of the principle of the Bill.  The Taoiseach, in beginning his statement, referred to the fact that there was unexplainable opposition to the Bill in certain quarters.  What he said was, I think, exemplified, to some extent, by the discussion which took place here.  The principle of this Bill is operated against, to some degree, by the very defence that is put up for it. There is a sort of suggestion on two lines&mdash;(1) that treason was all right up to the last amendment of the Constitution and (2) that treason would be eminently justifiable if we had not had a vote on the Constitution.  That is part of this remnant of a previous condition from which we are trying to get away.  It must be recognised that, when you have a legitimate Government, irrespective of its form, to wage war against it is eminently criminal. Once you go into these details and urge that you can rebel against a government under such conditions and not under such other conditions, relating to the form of the government, then you are opening the door to a general subversive tone amongst the people&mdash;the very thing that exists at the moment and that we are trying to get away from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> One Senator said that the country was perfectly normal, that white gloves had recently been given to two judges. If the country were perfectly normal, it would be but right that the law should advert to the possibility that it might not always be so.  Criminal tendencies can manifest themselves in any community at any time and, therefore, the law should be so framed as to provide an adequate means of dealing with any such things as may turn up from time to time.  The funny thing is that we are told the country is normal, and two minutes later it is pointed out that it is abnormal and we have references to past history.  We certainly must recognise that past history overflows into the present and that one of the things that make the principle of this Bill an immediate necessity is the remnant of past times.  I shall not go back over past history; I shall just deal with the present.  I saw in to-day's paper a report of a case which seemed to me to be justified.  The man concerned was discharged and, as far as I could judge from the newspaper report&mdash;I admit that a newspaper report is very inadequate&mdash;the case should have gone the other way.  This was one of these political cases.</P>
    <P>One of the weaknesses I see in connection with this Bill is that there is no provision for trial otherwise than by the ordinary courts.  In adverting to the peculiar circumstances of this country, issuing from the past, one must recognise that one of these peculiar circumstances is that you cannot at the present moment expect an ordinary jury or, apparently, an ordinary judge to disregard the organisations of this country and to act rigidly according to law and according to justice.  You cannot expect, in view of past history, that a juryman will fulfil the conditions of his oath and bring in a verdict according to the evidence when he knows that, as a result of that, his ordinary civil life may be interfered with even to the extent of necessitating police protection.</P>
    <P>There has been opposition here to <Col N="1404" /> the death penalty.  Personally, I approve of the death penalty.  I might, if this were Committee Stage, suggest certain changes in Section 1 but, so far as the death penalty is concerned, I cannot sit here and hear it said that for the State to maintain the death penalty for such crimes as treason or murder is not accepting Christian standards, from a moral point of view.  The State has eminently the right to punish with death.  We must recognise that.  When we recognise that, we must also recognise that, that being so, it has the right to punish the crime of treason with death.  I admit I might make certain modifications with regard to Section 1. An argument is advanced about the love of martyrdom in the country and it is said that the death penalty will tend to make this type of crime more general.  I do not believe that for an instant.  I believe that one of our troubles at the moment is that it has been possible to carry on this type of crime without cause for any real fear. It is not so long ago&mdash;I think it is only about two years ago&mdash;since a man found guilty by the court of murder and sentenced to death had his sentence commuted by the Government to imprisonment for life.  I am speaking from memory, but I think that it was only a matter of a few months until, when the Constitution was amended, the man was released.  If you look at the history of the past ten or 15 years, you will find that there are these sporadic outbreaks of disorder hiding behind the veil of idealism, as the word is used here.  But so far from seeking martyrdom, before any activity takes place, every precaution is taken to secure that those who are guilty will never have guilt brought home to them.  When the people concerned were arrested and brought to trial, there was a constant attempt to suborn juries and terrify witnesses.  If the man concerned were found guilty and sentenced to a life-term of imprisonment, it did not upset him in the least because he knew&mdash;this was the case up to 1931 and I am not trying to be a Party politician here&mdash;he would have the second largest Party in the State using all its power in Parliament and out of Parliament to see <Col N="1405" /> that he did not serve the sentence. When a man at a later stage is found guilty of murder, relating to subversive operations in the country, and sentenced to death, the sentence is not carried out.  It is commuted to a sentence for life, and he serves a few months.  One of the things that have perpetuated this old attitude of mind has been the fact that, during all this period, anybody embarking on one or other form of treason has felt he was doing it safely, that even if he were finally captured, evidence was forthcoming and the jury had the courage to find according to that evidence, nevertheless, some racket would be started to see that he did not suffer unduly.  I think that will continue as long as we have the sort of speeches that have gone on in this country.</P>
    <P>I am not going to argue between the State as it is now and as it was three or four years ago, but we must face up to the fact that the Irish people have a right to live in ordered conditions under a legitimate Government that will enforce its laws.  So long as we have this sort of talk, that these men are only moved by idealism, we shall have a continuance of this state of affairs.  A man is guilty in having his conscience in opposition to eternal truth and, if he goes out against the State, it does not matter how blind or ignorant he may be, his ignorance is culpable and he must take the consequences. So long as you have this sentimentalism, you are only encouraging a continuance of that condition.  I think that some of the speeches made here to-day have been of a type that tends to encourage that.</P>
    <P>I do not believe for an instant that there is this passionate idealism that men talk about, that men are so anxious to shed their blood for some incommunicable difference between external and internal association&mdash;some microscopic difference which they are unable to define.  I do not believe that anybody wants to die for that.  For years past, there has been a grand opportunity here to be a hero on the cheap.  You could join the I.R.A., stick out your chest and say you were a patriot.  You could do that with a guarantee of safety all through.  We <Col N="1406" /> must, at some time, recognise that the Irish people have the right to live as an ordered community in which the laws are enforced and their disobedience punished.  The idea is wrong that you will punish people for every sort of minor crime but that, if people organised together for murder, in order to overthrow ordered conditions then, instead of applying the ordinary punishment, you will weep over them, sentimentalise over them and call them idealists and all the rest. These men are public enemies of this State and of the people of this State, and the duty of the Government is to protect this State and the people of this State.  My complaint against the Government in the past has been that it has failed to do its duty to the people.  Now I realise that, at last, we have a Bill brought in by the present Government to enforce the authority of the Government.  Time and again, when I was a member of the Government here, I got up and preached the doctrine of governmental authority.  I did not do that because of the mere accident that I was a Minister at the time.  I did it because I felt that it was vital in this country that the people should ultimately overcome the deforming defects of our history for centuries before and that, overcoming them, we should settle down to ordered conditions in which any legitimate Government in this country would claim and demand appropriate respect and obedience from the people and punish if it did not get that respect and obedience.  If, as I have said, you are going to sentimentalise about these people, then you are only encouraging a continuance of that misery and are not allowing the Irish nation to come into existence&mdash; and, in fact, we can say that it hardly is in existence at this moment because, although a majority of the people voted for that Government, the truth is that when the Government is in power, for which the people voted, you will still have practically a majority of the people ready to get up and sympathise with those who are trying to overthrow that Government by subversive means.  Now, when you have such things or such speeches as we <Col N="1407" /> have had coming from my friend, the Senator behind me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnLynch" hpid="Mr. E. Lynch Mr. E. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps we may be permitted to use the expression as a form of words.  When we have people getting up, as I was going to say, and suggesting that the people have a right to rebel until the Government has taken over all the economic resources of the country and utilised them in such a way as each individual approves of, you will never get anywhere with that.  Some other Senator has suggested that there is a sort of contract between the Government and the people, and that the Government's right to govern only comes by virtue of that contract and exists only so long as the Government maintains or observes the terms of that contract. I quite agree&mdash;I do not expect the Taoiseach to agree with me on this&mdash; with some people who say that the Government got into power by promises which they have not fulfilled, but what I say is that they are still the Government and that they still have authority, and if the promises that they made before election are such as their present policy shows would be against the common good, then the Government as a Government is bound morally to break those promises.  All we can ask the Government to do is to use prudence and wisdom in governing and to promote the common good of the people of this country.  That is what the Government exists for, not for fulfilling promises that were made before the election, if these promises should subsequently prove to be contrary to the common good.  Therefore, I absolutely and entirely affirm and submit myself to the authority of the Government as it now is, and I <Col N="1408" /> believe that I have no right, just because I happen to be in opposition to the Government, to wage war against it.  I believe further that if I attempted to do so, they must punish me&mdash;and I think I am just as much an idealist as a lot of other people in the country&mdash;and that it is the duty of the Government to use all the power they possess to see that such activities do not take place.  Of course, there might be different conditions, such as in times of absolute peace and absolute normality, where you might have somebody trying to foment treason in this country, and the Government, in those circumstances, might impose a minor sentence, but until this country has reached the position that the people's minds have come to the stage where they automatically recognise the sanctity of the Government in this country, such powers must be retained.</P>
      <P>If we pass this Bill, as I presume we will, the Government which have the right to punish have also the right to pardon, and in relation to both punishment and pardon their judgment must be guided by what they think the common good demands.  My own view&mdash;and I have had responsibility for government&mdash;is that during the past years they have failed on the ground of not exercising their power for punishment sufficiently, and I think that we now have, and for some time to come will have, to pay the price of that in the fact that we have these sporadic scenes of disorder still operating in this country, which should have died out in 1922 and have failed to die out then or at any later stage since; but to suggest, on that basis, that we should have to remain in that position, to my mind, does not bear any examination whatever. It would have been better if these things had been done earlier but the fact that they were not does not exonerate us from the duty of doing them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish people have a right to have a government endowed with authority, exercising power, maintaining order, putting down everybody who creates disorder, and using the appropriate amount of strength and power against everybody who seeks to overthrow that <Col N="1409" /> order.  Consequently, for treason in this country I agree that there should be the punishment of death, always assuming that the Government, judging the whole circumstances of the case, may exercise the prerogative of mercy, and, therefore, I agree with this Bill in principle.  There are two things, however, that strike me, and one is the first part of the first clause, which, it seems to me, might very well be modified.  I agree with Senator Rowlette that in regard to this matter of the doctors some thought of modification must take place, but I also would agree with the Government in saying that that modification must be such as not to make it too easy for doctors to connive at treason.  During the pre-Truce times we all know how splendidly and nobly the doctors behaved, and I should not like to say that the splendid and noble services they gave to wounded and dying men at that time must discontinue.  At the same time I have known of cases where doctors, apart from what the claims of humanitarianism demanded&mdash;and I am glad to say it&mdash;at that time had actual participation.  However, I do not think that people, because they are following a certain profession, should be exempted from obeying the law.  At the moment, I cannot suggest a form of words to modify the clause in such a way as would allow a doctor to give his ordinary humanitarian services and at the same time limit or restrict him from participation in treason, but I think that the Government should necessarily bring in some amendment with regard to that.</P>
    <P>I think that this matter of the death penalty, for every possible thing that might come under Article 1, also requires modification.  I also think that, in bringing in such a Bill as this, which, on the face of it, implies that you declare the death penalty for all these varieties of treason, and the courts function in the ordinary way and juries and judges sit, it is rather futile because we have not yet reached that state of order in this country in which we can assume that any body of citizens that are picked as a jury will automatically &ldquo;find&rdquo; properly when they may feel, as in the past, that by <Col N="1410" /> doing their duty as jurymen they will injure themselves, injure their livelihood and the position of their families in the community and their own possibility of supporting their families.  To suggest that that can be done now, as things are at the present time, is quite absurd.  And, therefore, I assume that the Government, in bringing in this Bill, have in mind that, when they have to apply the legislation that is in it, they will have to take some special steps to see that, when there is evidence forthcoming on which it may be presumed that a person will be found guilty, it will be possible to find him guilty without jeopardising the lives or the livings of the ordinary citizens who may be called upon to act as jurymen.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief in my examination of this measure.  I should like to say at the outset that my sympathy goes out very sincerely to the Taoiseach after the testimonial his Bill has received from Senator Fitzgerald. The Bill has been canvassed from many directions, but there are two main points upon which I think the Government rely in putting forward this measure for acceptance.  The two main arguments are: First, the necessity for the measure, and, secondly, that this is legislation ordinarily implementing an Article of the Constitution &mdash;that, treason being defined by Article 39 of the Constitution, it is necessary that we should have a punishment definitely set out for an offence defined in the Constitution. Now, I think we have had no facts adduced to show that there is any real necessity for the Bill at the moment. I do not think the Taoiseach has advanced any substantial arguments to show that there is any immediate necessity, or any necessity in the near future, that we need to implement this Article of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I remember rightly, members of the Party supporting the Government advanced, during the last two general elections, the argument that they had succeeded in producing conditions of order in the country without any very drastic legislation; that they had succeeded because of certain things they said they would do, and some of the <Col N="1411" /> things they did, and that there was order prevailing in the country as a result during the last seven or eight years.  They advanced that as an argument as to why they should be returned.  They said that they had done these things by carrying out the will of the people in respect of the national aspirations, and that they had done it without attempting to curb the people as other people had curbed them, and they said that that was one of the reasons why the people should elect them in order to continue that state of affairs in this country.  That was one of their arguments and I do not see that anything has happened since to counter that argument.  The State is perfectly orderly.  There is no disorder of any kind within the State.</P>
    <P>If the only thing that matters is the necessity for implementing an Article of the Constitution because that Article happens to be there, let me put this consideration to the Taoiseach. There are other Articles of the Constitution and there is a very immediate necessity for implementing them by legislation, by action, or by administration. I suggest that Article 39 is not the Article in the Constitution demanding the most immediate action on the part of the Government.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that if he will turn to Article 45 of the Constitution he will find embodied there certain principles that everybody, I think, would support in asking him to carry legislation through in their regard. Sub-paragraph (2) of Article 45 sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing (i) that the citizens (all of whom, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood) may through their occupations find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to ask any reasonably-minded Senator here: Is there not more need for implementing that Article of the Constitution than there is at the present time for implementing Article <Col N="1412" /> 39 of the Constitution?  Until quite recently I saw or heard&mdash;I do not know which&mdash;that there are 107,500 people who had not the means of living&mdash;who are unemployed.  We have embodied here in this Constitution Article 45 which sets out that: &ldquo;The State shall, in particular&rdquo;&mdash;I do not think there is anything in particular in Article 39 of the Constitution&mdash;&ldquo;direct its policy towards securing:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  That the citizens (all of whom, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood) may through their occupations find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One hundred and seven thousand five hundred in this State have not at the present time, to quote the very expressive and very eloquent words of the Constitution, &ldquo;the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.&rdquo;  Now, is that not more urgent than the bringing in of legislation and the setting up of means for dealing with something that does not exist?  There are no facts whatever to show that there are people engaged in any disorder within the State, but here you have the argument that there are 107,500 people unemployed, and here is a provision in the Constitution proposing to deal with them.  Why is that provision not implemented?  Why is no attempt made to implement it?  Would not one imagine that that would be the first thing that the Government would take into account&mdash;the needs of the people in the State?</P>

      <P>Having some knowledge of what is irrelevant, I would not like to follow on the track of the learned Senator who preceded me: who gave the House a disquisition on theology instead of speaking to the legislation before it.  I have said quite clearly what I intended to say: that there are Articles in this Constitution more urgently in need of implementation than Article 39.  In conclusion, I would refer to a statement made by the Taoiseach himself when a similar measure was being introduced in the Dáil.  The quotation I am about to give is from the Dáil Debates for the 14th October, 1931, col. 58.  The Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is a social and economic situation which calls for immediate attention, and we ought to approach it in the same way as in the case of the political one, and recognise that if men are hungry they will not be too particular about the ultimate principles of the organisation they would join, if that organisation promises to give them bread.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put these few considerations to the Taoiseach and to suggest to him that there is no immediate necessity for this measure: for the implementation <Col N="1414" /> of Article 39 of the Constitution, but that there is an Article in the Constitution&mdash;the Article that I have quoted from&mdash;in need of immediate implementation, and that his Ministers and himself ought to direct their energies in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is to be a vote on this measure I should like to state my reasons for supporting it.  Like a great many others who have come into public life I became a member of the Oireachtas when I was a very innocent man: at a time when I thought human nature was a very perfect thing.  I knew very little about the vanity, the jealousies, the spites and all the other vices, great and small, that you come to realise compose human nature when you come to see it close up under the microscope.  In those days&mdash;in 1922, 1923 or indeed in 1925&mdash;I would have argued much on the lines that Senator Hogan has argued. As well as I remember I was loudly declaiming at that time against the keeping of quite a number of people on that side of the House in prison.  I believed that it was better to be magnanimous: to open the jail gates and release them.  I thought that it would lead to peace and order.  I remember that my friend here, Senator Fitzgerald, told me on many occasions that I was behaving in quite an unconstitutional manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Well, we have learned a great deal since then.  Whatever might or might not have been accepted in those days it is admitted now that we have a State of our own.  We had it then, too, but some of us did not know that we had it.  Some seemed to think that we were in a sort of half-way house and that we did not know whether we had it or not, or that what we had was worth keeping.  A great many more people have given the State their allegiance since then&mdash;in fact the great bulk of the people.  It is true that we cannot have the State unless we are prepared to fight to keep it.  When we have it we have to fight against enemies, foreign and domestic according to the old phrase, if a fight has to be waged.  To a certain extent, I have some sympathy with people like <Col N="1415" /> Senators Hogan and Lynch.  We know that there are those in the country to whom it appears cruel and harsh to imprison people and to sentence them to death.  On the whole, I suppose the Irishman is kindly.  He is inclined to be generous.  Perhaps it is that we are not even disposed to give offenders the full rigour of the law even when they are entitled to it.  I feel that to a certain extent that is the frame of mind in which Senator Hogan and Senator Lynch approached this Bill.  I have seen Senator Hogan in that frame of mind when he was a Deputy.</P>
    <P>It may be that, superficially, there is no necessity for the passing of this Bill.  I agree with those who take the view that it is better to pass a Bill of this kind in a calm, tranquil atmosphere than in a period of disturbed conditions that might be created later if the instrument was not there.  The trouble in this State and in every State is, that if democracy has failed in certain countries, possibly its failure is due to its own weakness: that it waited too long.  We know that extreme people everywhere, whether they be idealists or something different, are always prepared to adopt measures more vigorous, more extreme and, possibly, more unjust than the ordinary quiet citizens of a State.  The State will only do what the bulk of the citizens demand.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of good citizens do not believe in this measure.  They believe, with Senator Hogan, that there is no necessity for this measure. The people who are the more extreme, if that line were adopted, will do things that the citizens as a whole, through the Government, will not attempt to do even if there was a necessity for doing them.  Consequently, the State could very well be caught unawares by not possessing the instrument essential to enable it to defend its life in a crisis.  No Government in the world, in the conditions in which we live to-day, should leave itself in a defenceless position.  My view is that the people whom the Labour Party represent are the people everywhere who suffer most when <Col N="1416" /> dictators come to the top.  In any country in which democracy has failed: where they have been robbed of their rights by the others, that has happened through this internal struggle of forces.  With the exception of Russia, which bears no relation to the condition of this country, everywhere else they seem to have been beaten.</P>
    <P>All who want to see peaceful and orderly development, under which all our citizens will have the opportunity of freely expressing their views, must stand for the maintenance of ordered government.  It would be better, of course, if we were all such perfect beings that we could trust one another: that we could be satisfied that no man would take up arms against his brother.  We know, unfortunately, that human nature is not just like that.  Nothing that Senators can say is going to alter human nature.  We may have fewer of those desperate people here than they have elsewhere. I am not going to get into a discussion as to whether they are more ideally-minded here than they are in other countries.  The truth is that it is only the majority that have the right to rule.  We here have fought against foreigners for that right.  Indeed, we have fought amongst ourselves about it.  We have reached the stage anyhow when we cannot concede that a minority must, or will, dominate the majority.  The majority has the right to defend itself, as Senator Fitzgerald says, with all the force at its command.</P>
    <P>If the Government of the day tell us that this measure is necessary, who are we to judge and say that it is not necessary?  Let us hope that its application in the physical sense will not be necessary: that we will not have people running up against the forces of the State and against what is good for the great majority of the citizens by making an effort to destroy the State and so bringing down on their heads the penalties set out.  Let us hope that every responsible citizen, no matter who he may be, will say to the people outside that it is better for us now to face up to the position that exists: that if they have a legitimate <Col N="1417" /> grievance, then let them try to get it remedied in a representative way by electing people to represent them: that if they are not able to get a majority then let them bide their time and have patience until they can win a majority to their side.  Let them understand, on the other hand, that, if they attempt other means to obtain their end, there are great dangers to themselves by following that course, with no benefit to the State either.  If all adopted that general policy I believe you would have very few people ever coming up against this measure or of having its provisions applied to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the first speech that I ever made in the Oireachtas was on the occasion of the Second Reading of the previous Treason Act.  I feel it would not be right for me to allow the opportunity that this measure gives to pass by without saying a few words in defence of my vote in regard to it.  The discussion of the Bill has proceeded so far on a line which to me seems to be a little askew, if I may so put it.  It is assumed that, in taking the powers that are implied in this Bill, the State is taking to itself powers which are in some degree or other questionable&mdash; powers about its right to exercise which there is some dispute.  Now, to me, at any rate, it would be more natural to approach this whole question from a different point of view altogether.  If I am not wrong, and I do not think I am although I do not claim any particular authority on the theology of the matter, the ordinary individual has the right to take human life if his own life is threatened.  The State, which incorporates the justice of the people, which represents the corporate life of the whole community, surely possesses the same elementary right that the ordinary individual possesses.  What we are dealing with here is not a case of the State taking the offensive against some body or other.  It is a case of the State defending itself against attack, whether from inside or outside its borders.  I should like to point out to the Labour Senators <Col N="1418" /> who spoke that it is not merely a question of attack from inside the borders of the State.  There is also involved in the Bill the question of treason committed against the authority of the State outside the borders of this State.  We are dealing here with defence of the State against attacks.</P>
      <P>To my mind, at any rate, without any Treason Bills at all, the corporate justice of the community has an elementary right to defend itself against mortal attack if mortal attack is offered to it.  There is no necessity, in justice, whatever, that the State should have to pass Treason Acts in order to give itself that elementary right.  If war is declared on a State, the State has a right to defend itself in that war and it has a right to use in its defence every means that its opponents use against it.  Perhaps that is going too far but, at any rate, it has the same right precisely that an individual has whose life is attacked. He has a right to ward off that attack and if necessary to inflict death upon his enemies when so attacked.  The only reason for bringing in Bills of this kind at all is that, as States have to act in a particular way or on a particular legal course, it is necessary to enshrine the rights that they possess in certain legal forms and to provide the State with certain machinery by which it can exercise the rights it already possesses.  That is the justification, it seems to me, for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a question of the particular state of the country at the present moment, although that could easily be debated.  It is not a question either of merely implementing one particular Article of the Constitution as against other Articles.  It is a question merely of the State doing a thing it has a perfect right to do, of giving it this machinery by which it can defend itself just as an ordinary individual is perfectly entitled to be ready, if he thinks there is any danger of his life being attacked.  That elementary right being such as I think it is, the only question that arises in the case of the State then is the prudence or otherwise of its action in certain eventualities.  It is not a matter of <Col N="1419" /> whether it is right or wrong to inflict the death penalty.  It is a matter, generally, of whether it is prudent or not in the case of a State to go to the extreme length in defending itself in all cases, and in that respect I do think, as other Senators have thought, that the Bill may be said, perhaps, to go too far, not to go to any unjust length, not to take any powers that it has not a right to take&mdash;by no means &mdash;but that it may be possible that in being too Draconian the Bill may ultimately, as other Senators have pointed out, perhaps defeat its own ends.</P>
    <P>There is only one alternative to death before the person who is found guilty of treason under the Bill and that is that the Government of the day may exercise its prerogative of mercy in his regard.  Otherwise, like a person who is found guilty of murder he has to pay the full penalty for murder.  The Draconian laws have got the name that they have because it was found that they were so severe that they could not be carried out in practice.  They were so severe that people in ordinary circumstances shrank from using them to the full and the result was that after a while they tended to fall into abeyance.  My only fear about the Bill is that, owing to its rigidity in that respect, there may be a danger that juries, for example, may attempt to exercise the prerogative of mercy themselves before it comes to a question of the Government's doing so and in that way, particularly in the peculiar circumstances of this country, the Bill may sometimes, indeed very often, defeat its own objects.</P>
    <P>I do think it might be possible to devise some means by which a judge or a court would be enabled to inflict less severe penalties in certain specific cases than the death penalty; although, indeed, in all these matters it should never be forgotten that the initiative has rested with the people who began to levy war against the State.  It is not that the State is conducting an offensive against them; it is they who are conducting an offensive against the State.  That applies even to the misguided <Col N="1420" /> people who join particular organisations and find themselves involved in a set of circumstances that they, perhaps, did not altogether foresee when they joined these organisations. Even in cases like that, where I do not think it might be possible for the court to exercise some discretion, such people have the duty to protect themselves. Joining organisations of that kind is a dangerous business and the sooner people realise and understand fully that it is a dangerous business, the better for everybody, both for themselves and for the community as a whole.  While I do think that it might, perhaps, be found possible to make the terms of the Bill less rigid in that regard, I should not like to do anything to weaken the powers of the State in any respect, by trying to do so.</P>
    <P>There is another point that arises in connection with Section 2 and to which I think Senator Rowlette drew attention. That is that a well-known and ancient legal principle seems to be set aside in that section, the principle that a citizen is presumed to be innocent until he is proved to be guilty.  The onus is put upon the citizen in that case to prove his innocence.  There, again, while admitting that it is a very serious matter and that in cases like this it is very important that the State should have full powers, I do not like the idea of that principle being enshrined in an Act of Parliament.  It seems to go farther, not than is right, but farther than is desirable or necessary. It might well be possible to achieve the result aimed at in that section without being quite so extreme about it and to preserve at the same time the very sound principle that the ordinary citizen has that much protection, that until proof is advanced that he is guilty he is presumed by the court and by the justice of the country to be innocent.  That is a very sound and a very satisfactory principle and I think that this discussion has shown it would be a pity for the Parliament of this country to depart from it.</P>
    <P>We all know, of course, that the circumstances of this country are very peculiar and that there have been things in our history which explain, if <Col N="1421" /> they do not justify, the peculiar circumstances that have led up to the introduction of these Bills.  At the same time these Bills go no further on the whole than every State in the world goes and to suggest, as I am afraid has been done this evening, that our State should enshrine in its Constitution and in its legal procedure a certain element of anarchy that is not tolerated in any other State in the world is to ask the people and the Parliament of this country to do more than they ought to do.  One can have a great deal of sympathy even perhaps with the unfortunate people who have found themselves, often from very high though misguided motives, involved in organisations such as are aimed at by this Bill.  One can have great sympathy with them but in that sympathy one should never forget the greater sympathy which is due to the ordinary innocent citizens of the country.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter that is worth drawing attention to.  We have many huge tasks before us in this country including the economic tasks to which Labour Senators drew attention. There are enormous things that have to be done by the Government and by the people of Ireland before we can say that Ireland has recovered or half recovered all that she has lost in the past, and in order to get these things done it is essential that the Government of the country from one decade to another, shall not be subject to all sorts of subterranean illegal attacks, whether within or without its own territory.  It is essential that we should have freedom for the people from such attacks, no matter what the ideals under the cover of which they are made.  It is essential that we should have unity amongst all our people at least on that one principle, that Irishmen will not take up arms for the future to take each others' lives no matter what the political pretext for doing so may be and no matter what the traditions or the so-called ideals that are used to induce people to do so.</P>
    <P>There is no use in trying to set up against the necessity for passing a measure like this, the sort of copybook Marxian arguments that have <Col N="1422" /> been put forward by Senator Lynch. To pretend that these movements which have threatened the State in this country, that have threatened it since it began to exist, have their roots in economic causes, is surely the limit of childishness.  They have their roots in causes which are far older than anything concerning the present economic position of this country.  They go back very deep into the past of this country.  As I say, we can all understand the sort of traditions and ideals that have tempted people into these dangerous courses.  We can understand them, but we should be on our guard always against sympathising with them, because to sympathise with them is not only dangerous for the people engaged in these conspiracies themselves, but it is dangerous for the innocent men, women and children all over Ireland who are looking to this State for protection of the very kind this Bill proposes to give.  We must consider these people as well as those who claim to be actuated by ideals.</P>
    <P>One of the most satisfactory features about the Bill to my mind is the fact that it does mark a step forward in our progress towards having an ordered state in this country.  We have advanced a long way since 1925. A great deal has been said and a great deal has been done in that period.  I am not going to say any more about it but, at any rate, I will say that I rejoice that we have advanced so far. At the same time, I see in this Bill only a foundation for positive things and for greater things.  I am prepared to vote for it and accept it, because I do firmly believe that until we set behind us forever these old evil, misguided traditions which accompanied us, not only when we were under foreign rule, but which threaten to become a curse to us under an independent Government, there is no hope at all that we will make any progress in any direction, economic, social or political.</P>

      <P>If one were to take seriously the speeches made in criticism of the measure, I would not blame any outsider who might happen to be listening for coming to the conclusion <Col N="1423" /> that this Bill was introduced by the Government for propaganda purposes, to get kudos or to make themselves more popular in the country.  Anybody knowing the facts must be aware that when the Government decided to introduce this legislation&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;this legislation,&rdquo; I mean this Bill and the other Bill that will come before us within the next week or two &mdash;the various members of the Government knew quite well that these measures would not be popular in certain quarters in the country, that they would be opposed by certain people and would be criticised in this and in the other House.  I suggest that the people who criticise this measure must also realise that before they introduced this legislation, the members of the Government thought seriously over the matter, that they did not rush in from a game of golf and say: &ldquo;We will introduce this Bill to-morrow.&rdquo; No; I am quite convinced that this legislation was introduced after very serious and deliberate consultation and consideration, and because the members of the Government who were in possession of all the facts decided that it was necessary to have this legislation to protect the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in his opening statement, referred to the public confusion in the country.  If anybody had any doubt as to the confusion in the country, he need only listen to the debate and hear the statements made by responsible Senators.  If I were to think as some Senators obviously think, if we are to take their speeches seriously, I would not be a member of this House for five minutes. Speeches made here will perhaps carry weight in the country, but I hope that any further statements that will be made on this matter and the speeches already made here will be considered very seriously by the people before they allow themselves to be carried still further away by irresponsible statements such as we have heard here to-day.  In my opinion, much of the public confusion, if you like to call it that, in the country is due to the fact that people have not considered <Col N="1424" /> seriously what treason really means.  If they do, and if they will only carry themselves back not only over the last ten, 15 or 20 years, but hundreds of years, they will find that in every period of Ireland's struggle, the crime of treason was dealt with in the severest possible manner.  I can understand certain members who never had any connection with the republican movement, the revolutionary movement, if you like to call it that, standing up here and opposing the death penalty for any crime whatever, but I cannot understand a man or a woman who has had any connection with the revolutionary movement in the past saying that we should treat murder with one penalty and treason with another.  If there is any serious crime in this, or in any other country, I say that crime is treason, and because I believe that treason is the most awful crime that can be committed by anybody, I see no reason why I should not support this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I say, even Senators who obviously have read the debates in the other House and have thought the matter over seriously are still confused, but I put it to them that the question we are asked to decide in voting for or against this Bill is: Who is to deal with treason?  Is it the Government of the country or is it somebody outside the Government?  Is it some organisation at present in existence or some other organisation which may spring into existence to-morrow, next month, next year, or at any time in the future? If anybody is to deal with treason it must be the Government of the State. Some people take the attitude that there is no difference between the situation now and the situation which existed prior to 1921.  Other people try to sidetrack the matter by suggesting that there is no difference between the present Constitution and the past Constitution. I can understand the attitude of certain people who believe that that is so, but I, for my part, look at it as a member of the Republican Army, or as an old I.R.A. man, if you like to call me such.  I, as well as several other people, and, in fact, the majority of the people in the House, I believe, was in the position in the past of <Col N="1425" /> having to deal with the people who were guilty of treason.  In that position, we had no hesitation in dealing with those people in a very severe manner. To say that no difference exists between the situation now and the situation at that time is to ignore positive facts.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill is the direct result or the direct outcome of the Constitution.  I believe the Constitution was founded largely, if not altogether, on the &ldquo;cease fire&rdquo; order, and I believe that, as an old I.R.A. man, because I accepted the &ldquo;cease fire&rdquo; order, I should accept the Constitution and because I accept the Constitution, I should accept the position as it exists to-day, that is, that the Government elected under that Constitution is the supreme authority, so far as these Twenty-Six Counties are concerned.  We have certain people&mdash;I find it difficult to talk on this matter without dragging in personalities, but I will avoid doing so&mdash; setting themselves up at present as the best judges of what happened then and now.  I remember the time quite well when the &ldquo;cease fire&rdquo; order was accepted, and I remember, previous to its acceptance, that it was opposed by a certain section in the I.R.A. at the time.  I happened to be a member of the Army Council at that time, and I am not in the least ashamed to say that I myself opposed it for the simple reason that I did not believe it would be accepted by a majority of the I.R.A. of the country at that time, but because of the capture of certain documents and because the position as it existed became known to the general public and to the I.R.A. who were in arms at the time, by degrees, one section after another became convinced that it was the only alternative, and when the &ldquo;cease fire&rdquo; order was finally accepted by the Army Council it was not opposed, so far as my knowledge goes, and I think I know as much about the position at that time as anybody else, by even one company or one section in the whole country.</P>
    <P>One cannot go over that history without going into what one would call <Col N="1426" /> details.  When the &ldquo;cease fire&rdquo; order was put forward, a statement was made on behalf of the Republican Army that if certain impediments to national freedom or independence were removed, the I.R.A. as such at that period were prepared to surrender their arms to the then Government. That statement was made on behalf of the I.R.A., and was not repudiated by anybody.  Because the then Government did not think it wise&mdash;we will give them credit for honesty&mdash;to accept that suggestion, the only course left to the I.R.A., was to dump arms.  That ought, in my opinion, to clear the situation so far as those who in the past were associated with the Irish Republican Army are concerned.  We have had statements here to suggest that there was no difference.  We have had a statement from a man who looks a responsible man&mdash;I do not know very much more about him &mdash; Senator Madden, that he objected to giving this authority to the present Government for various reasons.  The principal reason, so far as I could gather, was that it could only be given to men with clean hands.  I have a fairly good idea of what Senator Madden means when he refers to clean hands, and all I can say is that Senator Madden, or any man of his age who has lived in this country as many years as Senator Madden has lived here, and has lived through as many stages of the struggle, deserves no credit for having his hands clean.</P>
    <P>The principal argument against the Bill was that it was not necessary.  I am quite sure the same argument could be put forward in any other country in Europe, or, for that matter, in the world, but notwithstanding that, we find that in every country the Government is, in fact, armed with similar powers to deal with treason.  Another cause of the misunderstanding I believe, is that certain people assume that this Bill is definitely aimed at one organisation, and at one organisation only.  My idea is that such is not the case, that this legislation was necessary to deal with any organisation that might raise its head now or in time to come.  I believe that the present may not be the right time to introduce this <Col N="1427" /> legislation, but if any criticism should be levelled against the Government, it is because this accompanying legislation was not introduced immediately after acceptance of the Constitution by the majority of the people.  I believe if it was introduced at that time, there would not be a word from any section by way of protest, and there certainly would not be a word from any of the people who, if you like, now constitute themselves as critics.  Just as in every other legislation criticism comes from some extraordinary places. It is easy to expect criticism from certain quarters.  I suppose it is only reasonable to expect that the same things will happen here as happened in other countries, as human nature is the same here as every place else. What they do in other countries is none of our business, except in so far as we can learn from their experience, or from studying the tactics used there to avoid the pitfalls into which other people seem to have fallen in the past, and in the very recent past for that matter.</P>
    <P>Some people seem to be rather amazed and think they have something extraordinary to relate.  We were told within the last few days that it is not only the Labour Party, and not only the workers, and the people who are unemployed and, if you like, members of certain organisations who are opposed to this Bill.  In fact, we have some of the big industrialists proposing that a certain action should be taken.  I do not think it wise to mention names here, but I say that we do not have to go very far back to find disappointed capitalists in other countries taking up the same attitude. All I wish to say is that I hope the people of this country, before following the flags of any such will o' the wisps will, at least, examine the records of those that they may be tempted to follow; that they will look back over the public statements made by certain individuals when the independence and integrity of Ireland was involved, not so very long ago.  If they do that they will find that the sincerity of these potential leaders is not to be judged by statements they <Col N="1428" /> made when this country found itself in a very critical position.</P>
    <P>Most of the criticism was on the lines that this legislation was not necessary.  We were also told that it was not necessary, because there were perfectly normal conditions here.  The suggestion was not made by anybody here in so many words that we should wait until something happened, but it was made outside by responsible people that, at least, the Government should have waited until something happened.  All I want to know is what is that something that the Government should wait for before introducing this legislation?  Any reasonable person who thought over the matter might say: &ldquo;Supposing five or six Senators or Deputies got shot, that would be something to happen.&rdquo;  I wonder if Senators who oppose this measure would be prepared to make martyrs of themselves in order to justify the Bill. I for one would not be ready to do so. I believe the Government was open to criticism, not for bringing in this legislation at the present time, but because they did not bring it in long before now.  Now that the Bill has been introduced, and that the country is perfectly normal, it is a great thing that we can sit down calmly and deliberately discuss this legislation in an atmosphere of peace, and without any excitement going on around us view the situation in a normal atmosphere.</P>

      <P>As one who voted for the Constitution, and, in fact, did my best to influence the electorate to vote for it, I was quite satisfied to give a silent vote on this Bill but for the remarks of some Senators.  Some of the speakers are as confused about the meaning of treason as, apparently, some of the ordinary electorate outside. According to the speech of Senator Fitzgerald, the British Government was the legitimate Government here, and according to Senator Madden, a British-imposed Constitution was also the legitimate Constitution here.  I base my reply to the Senators on the fact that the people here have now adopted a free Constitution, which was dictated by <Col N="1429" /> no one except by the Irish people. Every Senator should oppose treason to that Constitution.  At one time the term &ldquo;treason&rdquo; was applied to the people of Ireland who fought against British rule and it was regarded as a holy term.  At that time &ldquo;a felon's cap was the noblest crown that an Irish head could wear.&rdquo;  Those who are guilty of treason to the Constitution now deserve any punishment that the Government metes out to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These remarks are necessary because of the fact that some people within this House and others outside it, deliberately made an effort to confuse the mind of the public with regard to the attitude of Republicans in 1925 and their attitude to-day.  As far as I am concerned, I believe the Republic is functioning in the Twenty-Six Counties of our national territory.  I suppose my voice will not have any great influence outside this House, but the sooner the British Government realise that the sooner the Constitution is extended over the Thirty-Two Counties the better it will be for England, for world peace, and not only the peace of this country.  The French is a republican government but we refer to it as the Government of France.  The Government of Eire is the government of the republic over Twenty-Six Counties and we refer to it as the Government of Eire.  That is my answer to Senator Madden and to the insidious references that were made, that we dare not speak of the Republic to-day.  Senators, as well as some of our own people, do not seem to realise the advances that we have made since the return of the Republican Government in 1932.  I do not think there is any country in the world in which a leader who was beaten 10 years previously was afterwards returned as head of the State and without bloodshed. That is a tribute to the Irish people as well as to those who led the republican movement at that time. The Fianna Fáil organisation in 1926 sought by peaceful means to take over the institutions that were established here by the Free State Government. Senator Madden suggested that the claim does not hold to-day as regards the different foundation of this Government <Col N="1430" /> and of the Oireachtas established by the people's will.</P>
    <P>Armed opposition by any Party to the Right or to the Left is treason to the Irish people, and treason to-day has changed its meaning since the time that &ldquo;a felon's cap was the noblest crown that an Irish head could wear&rdquo;. I am afraid there has been a deliberate attempt to misrepresent the facts to the people, and I am sorry to say that some of that misrepresentation which, I say, is deliberate, comes from the Labour Party.  I felt it my duty to vote for the Constitution, and I also consider it my duty to vote for this Bill.  I would not have intervened in the debate at all but for the remarks that were made, deliberately or otherwise, for the purpose of creating a wrong impression.  As far as this Bill is concerned, I deem it my duty to vote for it.</P>

      <P>I hope I will not overstay my welcome.  I have no complaint against the speeches I heard this evening.  On the whole, I think they are speeches that, if read in the country by all who try to put political Party prejudices aside, and think in the best interests of the country only, would do a great deal of good.  The statements made would, I think, be accepted as sound and true.  I sympathise even with Senators who stated that I should come here with clean hands.  I have not the slightest doubt in the world, that if this discussion was taking place when all of us <Col N="1431" /> who are here now were gone, the matter would be approached in the right manner.  We were engaged in a revolution, the main purpose of which, we believe, has been accomplished with regard to this part of the country.  It has been accomplished, so far as was necessary, by revolutionary means.  The vast majority of the people believe that, so far as this part of the country is concerned, we have succeeded in arriving at the object at which we aimed.  The fact that we have been actors in all this, and that some people who differed from us and left us still remember the arguments we put forward in other circumstances and are applying them to circumstances which are different to-day&mdash;that is the cause of all the confusion.  If it did happen that somebody was introducing this Bill with the present conditions continuing, save that there was a new generation, he would have no difficulty whatever.  He would say to his countrymen, &ldquo;All we are doing in this Bill is protecting the State.  We have a State which the majority of the Irish people have calmly and deliberately accepted. They have provided constitutional organs of their own free will.  Because that is so, any party which tries to attack the State itself, as a whole, or attack by violent means the organs instituted by the people and capable of being changed to meet any conditions, is guilty of the greatest crime against the community and should suffer the greatest penalty the community inflict for any crime.&rdquo;  The difficulty arises from the fact that there are living both we, who are trying to establish ordered conditions, and others who were with us in the past and who are not satisfied yet that the purpose for which we were working has been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me go a little bit into the past. We had this country governed by a foreign authority against the will of the majority of the Irish people.  That was a fact and it was that fact which we wanted&mdash;every one of us&mdash;to change. We wanted to change outside control to complete control by the Irish people. That was the reason for the fight, <Col N="1432" /> whether it was carried on by peaceful or by violent methods, which was made in this country up to the time of the acceptance of the Treaty.  After that, you had a new situation.  I hope nobody will take it that I am trying to make a case against other sections.  I admit that those who have spoken here and who took a different view from me in the past have spoken in a manner to which I can take no objection.  If I can possibly avoid doing so, I do not want to speak in a way which would give them any cause for feeling that I had not acted in this manner as they have acted.  We had at that time a State set up by the Irish people.  We were struggling to maintain it.  Some of us believed it to be our duty to try to maintain it.  We had a vote in the Dáil and there was a majority the other way.  The reason allegiance was not given to the State by a large number of us in the period following that was that we did not regard it as having been established with the will of the people.  I know that there is a difference of opinion on that.  A number of Senators who have spoken felt quite differently about it.  We tried to maintain the existing State&mdash;wrongly, those who disagree with us will say and, rightly, we say&mdash;in arms and we were defeated.  The moment we were defeated we tried to get an acceptance of this principle of order which every thinking person must admit is necessary if there is not to be continuous fighting&mdash;namely, that political matters should be decided by a majority vote. In order to bring about the conditions in which there would be general acceptance of that, we tried to remove barriers of every kind.  The majority of the people had to run very severe risks in order to do that.  It was not done without a great deal of risk and a great deal of trouble.  I am quite willing to admit that a certain amount of it had been done by our predecessors but, so far as we were concerned, we asked the community to run the risk in order that there might be no confusion whatever, that every person in the country might realise he was free to form any organisation he wanted for any legitimate political or economic purpose, to organise and to come into the national <Col N="1433" /> assembly without any previous commitment of any kind to any political principle except the principle that the representatives of the Irish people, freely elected without any barriers, should decide what the national policy was going to be.  As I have said, this was the purpose of Fianna Fáil since we came into office anyhow&mdash;the purpose of the Government elected through the efforts of the Fianna Fáil organisation.</P>
    <P>We have arrived at a certain stage. Those to whom we were opposed and who accepted the Free State Constitution say they had already arrived at that stage.  So far as we are concerned, we say we have arrived at it now and they will not, I think, controvert the assertion that if there has been no advance there has, at any rate, been no retrogression so far as making it possible for everybody to realise that the institutions which are established here now are established by the free-will of that section of the Irish people who reside within the Twenty-Six Counties.  A very curious thing happens when those who were opposed to us in the past talk about this thing from a more or less political angle.  We had one speech which was typical of that.  I admit that human nature being what it is, when people like ourselves happen to be the Government at the moment, it is a temptation to anybody who wants to make political capital to say: &ldquo;You should have said these things years ago.  If you have difficulties as a Government in getting acceptance of these principles now, it is because you and those who were with you previously did not say what you are saying now.&rdquo;  I have only one answer to make to that argument, and that answer is that, from my point of view anyhow&mdash;I think it is demonstrable, though others will not agree with me&mdash; conditions were not the same at that particular time.  We shall have to agree to differ so far as that is concerned. When people say I should have said these things years ago, they are asking me to say things which, at that particular time, I did not believe were true so far as the foundations <Col N="1434" /> of the State here were concerned.  You may think that I am wrong, but you will have to give me the right to hold that view.  It may be the cause, in your opinion, of the difficulty now.  I have nothing to say against that, except that my view is as I have stated it and that is the view of a large number of the people who supported us and who ultimately obtained such a public backing that we were able in a free election to secure a majority.</P>
    <P>If there is any sin, so to speak, which you hold me guilty of, I say: &ldquo;Very well; we went before the people and the people, knowing that as well as you know it, did not regard it as a sin and have put us into office to do certain work.&rdquo;  We are doing that work at present with no selfish motive.  Anybody can see that, because we can be hit in that particular way for doing this duty of ours, it would be a very good reason for our trying to avoid it. In arguing on this political basis because of the natural desire to hit us politically, people who thought we were wrong in our action in the past, seem now to hold that action up as a model to be copied by others.  They excuse the taking up of a certain attitude by other people now by saying to us: &ldquo;You did this.&rdquo;  If they think we were wrong at that particular time, why should our attitude then be held up as a model to-day?  They cannot have it both ways.  There should be no question of trying to excuse actions of the present time by referring to something we are supposed to have done in the past which they say was wrong.</P>
    <P>People seem to think that this legislation is being undertaken in the interest of the Government.  It is not a question of treason against the Government; it is a question of treason against the State.  It is a question of treason against the organs set up by the people and not against individuals. If I wanted to answer Senator Madden, I would say: &ldquo;Do not think of me in this matter.  It is not a question of whether my hands are clean or otherwise.  The question is whether the Bill introduced is, in fact, right or <Col N="1435" /> wrong.&rdquo;  This is a very important matter for the whole community.  No matter what Labour or anybody else wants, if you have not ordered conditions here, you will have nothing.  Like some people, I had hoped that when we took away the basis of discontent politically there would be no need to arm the State with any strong powers. I was very soon disillusioned.  I said in the Dáil, and I say here, that if we did not have, some years ago, immediately at our disposal that Article of the old Constitution, Article 2A, we would not have been able to have ordered government in this country at all.  We would have had here two sides arming against each other and, in my opinion anyhow, we would have had civil war in this country two or three years ago had we not had that Article 2A.  When the new Constitution was passed Article 2A disappeared.  I felt we were taking a very big risk, because if we found in the past that it was necessary, might it not be necessary in the future?  We felt we were justified in taking the risk, mainly because it should have been clear to everybody that a situation had been arrived at in which an Irish-made Constitution&mdash; made, clearly and obviously, by the Irish people themselves, voted on by themselves and enacted by themselves &mdash;should bring universal allegiance. We felt that such a Constitution anyhow, would bring universal allegiance. Unfortunately it has not.  Unfortunately, there are people who still arrogate to themselves the right&mdash; even though, in a series of elections in which it was open to them to go before the people and put forward their programme, they have not done so&mdash;at any time they choose, to use force and by means of force to break up this State and establish the State that they want whether the majority of the Irish people want it or not.  Clearly, that cannot continue.  It is obvious that it cannot continue.  There can be no progress in this country if it does continue; and, if it should continue, there can be only one end to it, and that is another violent struggle here, with all its consequences, and probably the <Col N="1436" /> end of the hopes that many of us have, and that is at last to see the completion of the work to obtain which we originally entered into political action.</P>
    <P>I ask the people of this country to take this matter seriously and not to play politics about it.  If the Labour Party want the support of the section of the people to whom, apparently, they are appealing at the moment in order to form an advanced social political Party, they are, of course, at liberty to seek it.  They can go out, and all they have got to say is: &ldquo;This must be done by peaceful methods.&rdquo;  They can go and ask for the support of the people for that programme, and if they get the support of a majority of the people, they become the majority party, and the day they become the majority party, if they want to do so, they can formally declare a republic for the Twenty-Six Counties here if that is their programme, and they can also formally declare a republic for the whole of the country, provided they are prepared to undertake the task of making it effective over the whole of the country.  If the Labour Party want to go out with that programme, they are, of course, at liberty to do so. They can ask the Irish people to declare for a republic for the whole of the Thirty-Two Counties and they can say: &ldquo;If we are elected as a majority we will declare that republic formally and we will put into operation the social programme which we attach with it.&rdquo;  There is nobody going to stand in the way, except by argument and by indicating to the people the necessity for showing, not merely the objective, but some idea of how it can be reached.  Nobody is going to oppose the Labour Party if they go and look for that support and go to the country and ask to be given a majority to form a Government on that programme; nobody is going to oppose them except, as I say, by political argument or social argument, and asking that the Irish people be shown exactly how the governmental authority they propose to establish can be effectively established for the <Col N="1437" /> whole country.  If they could do that, or if anybody could show me to-morrow how it could be done, the happiest day of my life would have been reached, and I assure you that I would not spend another moment talking to the Seanad or to anybody else about it, and I believe that the majority of the Irish people would be happy if that had been arrived at.</P>
    <P>The difference between us and others who are working in that direction is this: that we say we have established here, unquestionably, an independent, sovereign State for these Twenty-Six Counties and that we have here only the institutions which the majority of the Irish people are accepting at the moment, and that if there is any particular part of it to which they object they can get rid of it, by legislation, if they want to do so.  That being so, we say that from that basis we have a better chance of getting the whole of the Thirty-Two Counties than by any other programme, and because we see and believe that we are progressing and can progress in that direction we think that the Irish people ought not to be deprived of their hope of getting that, by action which, obviously&mdash;it seems to me at any rate&mdash;cannot be successful.</P>
    <P>Now, mention has been made about the time we are bringing in this Bill. I spoke a moment ago about the ease with which that Bill could be passed in an Irish Parliament of this sort if this generation had passed away.  It would be taken as a matter of course.  This is the sort of Bill which every State has.  Otherwise, the State would find it difficult to protect itself against those in the State who think that by getting guns they can get their way and that the majority would be helpless in face of them.  The State has to protect itself, and this is the sort of law which has been passed in every State for that purpose.  Now, as to the question of time.  When the Constitution was passed treason was limited by it.  It was narrowed down in it, and a new Treason Bill had to be brought in, like this, because treason, as it stood, might very well be interpreted as referring to the old State, that is, <Col N="1438" /> the Free State.  The Act of 1925 would have been held as covering treason against the State that then existed and not against the present State.  We want to make it clear that the Bill here covers treason against the State and the constitutional organs here set up by the new Constitution.  It, therefore, became necessary, from that point of view; and as far as time is concerned, if any of you look up the dates in connection with the Constitution of the United States I think you will find &mdash;as a matter of fact, in a short while they will be celebrating in America the 150th anniversary of the inauguration of George Washington as President, and his inauguration practically completed the steps by which the American Constitution came into full effect; I am not saying that that was the precise date, but it was the completion of the setting up of the constitutional organs &mdash;I think you will find that they brought in a Treason Bill the next year.  That is, there was a year from the completion of the constitutional organs, so to speak, and the passing of a Treason Bill to protect them. That was 150 years ago, and it is a curious coincidence that it took just about the same time here.  The President was inaugurated in June last year and, just about a year later, we are passing the Bill for the defence of the organs that were established.</P>
    <P>Now, that ought to clear up the ground and show that there was no special design in bringing in this Bill at this particular time.  This Bill was inevitable.  It is accompanied by another Bill which is not inevitable or, at least, which we had hoped would be avoided but which, we are satisfied, has to be brought in, the conditions being what they are, for the safety of the State.  This Bill, however, could have been brought in at any time and was necessary, in my opinion, from the moment in which the Constitution was passed.  Well, I do not know, but if we could have the whole Irish people here at the moment, I would work very hard to try to convince them; if we could have all sections here and, let us say, the whole Irish people in this room, I would try very hard to convince <Col N="1439" /> them that this is simply a protection of their rights, and nothing more.  In the past, as the State that then existed was not the State which the Irish people, by a majority, wanted, you had treason against the State.  You may have any State and claim that the taking of violent action against it is treason.  In the past, however, the British State here&mdash;the State called the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&mdash;regarded itself as the legitimate State and regarded the action of those who, here in this country, were trying to use violent methods to get rid of it, in one form or another, as treason, but the Irish people did not regard it as treason in the sense of infidelity to the community. In our Constitution you will notice that we put down as one of the duties of every citizen fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State&mdash;the nation and the State, the majority of the Irish people in other words&mdash;and there was a clash between them and the State that was then in existence. When the Free State Constitution came into being, to a certain extent, there was a large clash also, because the fact is that, as you know, in a very short time&mdash;and it could not have happened if there were not a very large section of the people on that side&mdash;we got a majority who held that particular view.  Now, I hold that the views of the majority, the vast majority&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;vast&rdquo; I mean a very high percentage of the people here&mdash; the views of these people coincide with the State and they are not against the State.  They do not regard the State as a hostile State or an imposed State or as an outside State, but as their own State.  They know that they can change the Constitution by their vote. They know that the Legislature can adopt any policy it pleases and that there is no shadow of outside control.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan was speaking here this evening, and I was hoping he might proceed along some of the lines of some letters he wrote recently.  I thought he might question here whether we were or were not a sovereign State.</P>

No person, lawyer or other, can deny the fact that this is a sovereign State, fully sovereign, satisfying every test that any international or constitutional lawyer has ever suggested as a test.  In our external and internal relations we are completely sovereign, without any control whatever.  Anything which we want to do, that we can do.  If it is suggested that we have an External Relations Act which enables the Government, in the exercise of its executive power and authority, to use a certain&mdash;shall I call it?&mdash;statutory officer to do certain work, it can change that if it wants to do so.  The Senator, I think, asked some questions.</P>

      <P>Because it is the policy: because we want, if possible, through that means, to do what the Senator has never indicated how he would do it: that is to get a united Ireland.  If we fail to do it, and if at any time the Irish people think it is no use for that purpose, then they can get rid of it.  That is a matter of external policy and nothing more.  Some people suggest that the King comes, somehow or other, into this Treason Bill.  It has nothing whatever to do with him.  The King is not a constitutional officer at all.  He is not in any way connected with the Constitution.</P>

      <P>And that if somebody is chosen by the majority of the people, then they can keep him as a constitutional officer if they want to. I am only saying at the moment that he is not, in fact, a constitutional officer here, and the reason is that I do not believe the Irish people want it.  When I say the Irish people, I mean the majority.  There is no use in forgetting that we have a situation here in this country in which there is a minority of the people who want a certain connection.  I have said, as far as I am concerned and in regard to Fianna Fáil and its work, &ldquo;let us keep that connection if that connection is going to bring in the rest of the people with us so as to have an united Ireland here.&rdquo;  When the island is united, then so long as it is possible for the Irish people at any time to change their mind, they can change that particular fact.  I am satisfied that they can do that just as, to-morrow, if we thought that the continuance of that particular Act did not serve the purpose which we have in mind, namely, to try to bring about the unity of this country, we could get rid of it.  If we had a majority in the Dáil and Seanad we could summon the two Houses and out it would go without any trouble whatever.  When I say trouble I mean, of course, any legal or constitutional barrier.</P>
      <P>If this particular Act is designed to enable us to meet, to a certain distance, the views of people who differ from us in regard to a relationship or a connection with certain States of the British Commonwealth, I say it is good national policy to retain that until such time, at any rate, as a united Irish nation can judge for itself as to whether it wants to continue it or not.  That is the basis, and that has been the basis, of our policy since we were elected.  Afterwards, when the country is united, and when that part of the work has been done, then it will be quite open to the people, if they want to go further, to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, a republican constitution.  Show me anywhere in it any organ which is not of a republican character.  Come along and show it!  It is easier to talk about it when you are not face to face with men who will argue with you and show you where you are wrong.  It is easier to go and talk to people who have not studied these things and to mislead them as is being done by a number of people.  I say this is a republican constitution, fully republican. We have for the purpose of national policy, for the direct reason that it gives us the hope of a united country and of bringing with us people who want a particular type of connection, this compromise.  It is a compromise to meet them.  That compromise was first thought of and first effected when we had a practical proposition in the days of the republic; when we had the practical proposition of trying to bring about an united Ireland. You can have in this part of Ireland any type you want.  You are fully constitutionally free to have anything you want, but if you want to have the Thirty-Two Counties in an united Ireland you have to remember that there is a section of the people to be considered&mdash;that is, if you want to bring them in without bringing them in by force.  When you say you want to bring them in by force you will have to have the force to do it. I say that we are keeping that as a matter of external policy, as national policy, as Governmental policy, if you like, for the single purpose of enabling us, within it, to satisfy the desires, the sentiments, if you like, of certain sections of our people.  Once the nation is united, then there is no barrier of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say of us in our programme as it was true of Parnell when he said that &ldquo;no man can put bounds to the onward march of a nation.&rdquo;  We certainly are not trying to set, by our policy, any such bounds. The majority of the people in Fianna Fáil know that it is absurd to say that we shouted &ldquo;up the republic&rdquo; and that we were going to establish a republic immediately.  We said that <Col N="1443" /> our aim was the unity and independence of Ireland under a republican form of government.  If Fianna Fáil were to continue after the formation of an united Ireland, I take it that the Fianna Fáil organisation, if it were capable of doing it, would try to get a republican form of government completely accepted, and would try to get the External Relations Act removed if it could.  But we would then have new conditions altogether.  A new set of considerations would come in immediately, not merely the fact that you would have a large section of the community then, a much larger section than now, who would be strongly in favour of continuing that.  But once you had the national sentiment clearly satisfied you would have perhaps other people who, from a merely practical point of view, might very well say: &ldquo;We prefer to have that kind of relationship than not to have it.&rdquo;  It is not altogether disadvantageous even to us who have not any such sentiments as the minority have.  I am not going to argue the question at this time.  I do not think there is any need to argue it at this time.</P>
    <P>I say that the first thing that is necessary from the national point of view is to get the whole of this country united as a single State.  If we can get that, and whilst we are getting it, do not put any barrier to the free choice of the Irish people afterwards either as to their form of government or any external relations they may have, then we will have done our work.  I hope that there is not any of this confusion genuinely felt here.  If there was I would like to meet it in argument. The road has been a complicated one and we have had to proceed slowly. Deputy Hogan, for instance, asked could we have in our Constitution an Article like that in the Polish Constitution. By the way, it was the old Polish Constitution he referred to, but that does not matter.  We could, of course.  We can change our Constitution in various ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

      <P>Well, even so it is perhaps just as well that we should inform the public when we have the opportunity of doing it here, as well as inform ourselves.  The Senator was the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in the Dáil at the time that the Constitution was going through, and he knows full well that we can change our Constitution by Referendum after a certain time, and within that time, with the consent of the President, change it even by legislation without Referendum. There is no limit whatever on us to do that.  Some other Senator asked, or put up the test: could we have a passport without the King's name being on it?  Will Senator Hogan say that we could not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is baiting me.  I do not think I interrupted him.  What I did say was that our passports at the frontier of any sovereign State would not be accepted if signed by the President of Éire at the present time.  I said that if the credentials of our Ministers accredited to any sovereign independent State were signed by the President of Éire that they would not get diplomatic consideration or diplomatic status.</P>

      <P>Is it not true that even if what Senator Hogan says were a fact, whether this is a republican constitution or Royalist constitution, that the people who attack this State and this Government in arms are guilty of treason?  Is not that the Taoiseach's point of view, and that to argue about the Constitution, whether it is a republican constitution or anything else, is quite irrelevant?  If the Government elected has a majority it has its authority and everything else is irrelevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that I felt that.  The Senator is going <Col N="1445" /> a little bit beyond it, but leaving out the hypothesis for the moment, and keeping to the fact, I say that if we in our Constitution did decide to-morrow to give the President extra powers&mdash;if we thought it was a good national policy to do that&mdash;in accordance with the Constitution, provided we did it in a certain way&mdash;giving him the power to sign these passports&mdash;they would be accepted.  Now, the Taoiseach is a lesser person than the President, and the Minister for External Affairs probably is a lesser person still, and yet the Minister for External Affairs can do it and his signature would, in fact, be recognised by foreign States.  Does the Senator doubt it?</P>

      <P>If it did not we would have a nice mix-up.  I say it would.  As a matter of fact, if it is information for the Senator, I may say it is already done.  I promised that when the Constitution went through <Col N="1446" /> certain things would be done in virtue of the position which we occupied through the Constitution.  These things take a certain amount of time. They are not done overnight.  There is in all this talk a great deal of misunderstanding. Perhaps that is the best word I could apply to it.  I say that people who try to belittle the State they have got should remember that in trying to do that they are making other States, and suggesting to other States, to belittle it.</P>

      <P>The Senator is a lawyer.  An ordinary layman might perhaps be excused, but it is a serious matter at the present time, both nationally and internationally, internally and externally, to belittle the powers which we have got.  By all means, indicate the things we have a right to get still which we have not got.  I have no complaint to make against anybody who, whilst recognising what we have got, sees what we are still to get and tries to unite the Irish people in order to get that further objective, but it is essential, if we are to unite the nation, that we should at least know the basis from which we are to start.  The basis from which you can start towards the new objective, the next immediate objective, is that of having a completely sovereign, independent and democratic State here in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Because it is sovereign, independent and democratic it has the right to demand the <Col N="1447" /> obedience and the discipline of every section within the community.  If we, all of us who are interested in the wellbeing of this nation, put aside for the moment other things and say&mdash;although we may differ politically as to the use we should make of the particular freedom we have or the particular form of economy we want to achieve&mdash;that we have a State here in which we can do anything we like&mdash;if we all unite on that basis, although the Bill is one which it is well that the State should have there, there is not any immediate likelihood of our having to use it.  If we do not do that, then we, at any rate, who are the Government and who recognise our responsibility to the majority of the people, even though we should be opposed and our task made more difficult by certain people who may misrepresent us, are going to do our duty as we conceive it.  We are going to protect this freedom which has been won, and on which is based all our hope for the freedom of the whole country.  We are going to see that it is not lost now through indiscipline, because that is what it is.  That is our attitude.  We ask all people in this country, who love the country and who do not want to see all our efforts frittered away, to help us by their moral support.  If they give moral support to the Government at present, nothing else is necessary, and if there should be any need to act on these Acts, after they are passed through, it will be mainly due to the fact that there are people who do deny us their moral support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Senator stated here that it is not we who are attacking anybody. No body of any kind will be affected, provided they recognise the fact that the majority of the Irish people have freely set up institutions which are to govern political conduct.  If they do that, nobody is going to interfere with them.  If any such body be guilty of conduct of that kind, then it is they <Col N="1448" /> who will be attacking, and if they do attack then we, in the name of the community, will defend the community. That is the position and the sooner everybody in the country recognises it the better.  It does not matter a pin what it may cost, I say we are going to see that this community is protected from foolish or insensate action.  No matter what may be the views behind them, every section not represented in the Oireachtas can organise.  The Labour Party if they want to help all those who are not satisfied with the present economic position, can go out, put their programme before the people and get their support, but I warn the Labour Party if they try other means, and if they were to secure a majority in this Oireachtas afterwards, there would be a lot of people in this country who also might think of methods other than peaceful methods to defeat them.  They, as well as we, would require to defend their position, because if they did not have the organisation of the State to help them, there might be sections in this community who might not be quite pleased with their programme and policies, and might try the short cut.  I suggest that it is not in the general interest, certainly not in the interest of the Labour Party, to suggest that these short cuts should be taken.  These short cuts are not short cuts.  They are long cuts&mdash;very long.  I suggest that, whatever may be suggested by some people for petty political purposes, it is very bad national policy to encourage anything of the kind.  I am afraid that I have detained the House much longer than I expected, but I hope some plain speaking may be of use.</P>
