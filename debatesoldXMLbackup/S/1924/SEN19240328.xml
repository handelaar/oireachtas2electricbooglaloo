      <P>As a matter of convenience to the Government I propose to ask the Seanad to take as first business No. 5 on the Orders of the Day, the Central Fund Bill, 1924.  I wish to say that under ordinary normal conditions I think the Seanad would have a very good reason to complain that they have received such short notice with regard to this particular Bill, and also that we are compelled, under the circumstances, to put this Bill through all the Stages to-day. I know, however, that the Government realise that they are making a strong demand on the indulgence of the Seanad, but they are doing it under very exceptional circumstances, as we know that their time and attention have been occupied in very important and critical matters for some days past. Under the circumstances, I think the Seanad will be prepared to yield to the request of the Government.  It will be necessary for this purpose that the Standing Orders should be suspended, if this Bill is to be put through the different Stages to-day.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Finance whether he has considered the motion that the Seanad passed unanimously on the question of a revised form of accountancy and whether he proposes to take any action on it.</P>

      <P>I have had the motion that was passed by the Seanad before me.  I intend as soon as practicable to have an investigation carried out in regard to the revision of the form of accounts. I have had certain memoranda prepared with regard to the subject matter of the Resolution, but I have not had time to have the matter fully considered. Another cause for the delay is that the Comptroller and Auditor-General, whose opinion in this matter will, I think, be of considerable importance, has been busily occupied on his first year's work.  He has now completed that, and his first report has been presented to the Oireachtas.  Now that the pressure on the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General has eased off I hope it will be possible for him to consult with representatives of the Ministry of Finance with a view to seeing what are the best steps to be taken to look into the matter that was brought forward by Senator Sir John Keane.</P>

      <P>I would like to express satisfaction with the statement of the Minister.  While we all agree that this was a wise course to take, the Seanad would desire to have an opportunity such as this, without detailed criticism, which is hardly desirable, to express its opinion on the general policy of the Government with regard to finance. This could be done on a Bill of this kind.  That is the reason I welcome the statement.</P>

      <P>The Minister will understand that he is discharged with a caution! Before we pass to the Orders of the Day, I <Col N="1263" /> might mention that I have received a report from the Examiner of Private Bills to the effect that the Standing Orders have been complied with in regard to three Bills&mdash;the East Leinster Electricity Supply Bill, the Dublin Electricity Supply Bill, and the Sligo Lighting and Electric Power Bill.  The effect of that report is to put these Bills on the road to becoming legislation. That is to say, to put them on the way to the First Stage.  It is important, therefore, that the Seanad, which may have to consider these Bills in Committee later, should appreciate the procedure applicable to them, as, of course, it is novel to most of the Senators.  I understand that Senator Douglas&mdash;who in his capacity as Vice-Chairman of the Seanad has charge practically of these Bills when passing through the Seanad&mdash;has prepared a statement explaining in a small, but very clear, way the gradual stages in the progress of Private Bills.  As I think it is a matter of importance to every member of the Seanad, I shall now ask Senator Douglas to be good enough to read that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Some little consideration was given to the Standing Orders relating to Private Business in this Seanad, but it has been suggested to me by several Senators that it is difficult in reading these Standing Orders fully to visualise the Stages through which a Private Bill, as distinct from a Public Bill, has to pass before it can become law.  It has been suggested that it would be for the convenience of Senators if I were to make a brief statement with regard to the present position of the Standing Orders relating to Private Business, giving in detail the various Stages through which a Private Bill has to pass.  It was suggested that this occasion on which the Examiner's report has been received, to the effect that in his opinion three Private Bills have complied with the Standing Orders, would be a suitable occasion on which I could make a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been decided by the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach, in accordance with Private Bill Standing Order No. 6, to delegate to the Deputy-Chairman <Col N="1264" /> of each House the charge of Private Bills, and in addition I, as Deputy-Chairman of the Seanad, have been nominated by them to act as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Standing Orders relative to Private Business, appointed under Standing Order No. 7.  The delegation of matters relating to Private Bills to the Vice-Chairman, is usual in other Parliaments, and I would like to take this opportunity of emphasising the fact that the Deputy-Chairman, in moving the various stages of Private Bills, does so as an official of the House without expressing any opinion as to the merits or otherwise of the Bill so moved.  It is not usual for the Deputy Chairman in other places to vote on any stage of any Private Bill, and I do not propose to do so in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>A Private Bill is described in the Standing Orders as a Bill promoted for the particular interest or benefit of any person, or that interferes with the private property of any person, otherwise than in the interests of the public generally, and as a measure of public policy.  It is important that members of the Seanad should distinguish clearly in their minds between a Private Bill, as so described, and a Private Members Bill, which is a Public Bill, which has not been introduced by the Government.  Any person, or group of persons, desiring to introduce a Private Bill, must lodge an application for leave to introduce such Bill in the Private Bill Office in accordance with such conditions as are provided in the Standing Orders.  After a period of one month has elapsed, the Examiner of Private Bills publicly examines the Bill to see if the promoters have complied with the Standing Orders both in regard to the Bill itself and in regard to the payment of fees, deposits, etc., which may be required.  The Examiner will then report to both Houses either that the Bills have or have not complied with the Standing Orders.  The Examiner's Report stands referred by both Houses to the Joint Committee on Standing Orders, and opportunity is given for an appeal to be lodged against the Examiner's decision within five clear days from the last day on which it was so referred <Col N="1265" /> by either House.  Should no appeal be received, the Bill is then deemed to have been read a First Time in the Seanad.  Should an appeal be lodged the Joint Committee, after hearing the appeal, reports its decision to both Houses, and the Bill is not deemed to have been read a First Time in the Seanad until the Committee has decided that the Standing Orders have been complied with, or until both Houses have approved a Report of the Committee that although the Orders have not been complied with compliance should not be insisted on.  The Second Stage takes place in the Seanad on a date suggested by the promoters not earlier than the 7th or later than the 14th day after the Bill has been deemed to have passed its First Stage, provided that, if the Seanad be not sitting on the 14th day, the period shall be extended until the next day on which the Seanad shall sit.</P>
    <P>Each stage of the Bill, as I have already pointed out, is moved by the Deputy-Chairman of the Seanad or by some other member whom he may request to act on his behalf.  The Bill, having been read a Second Time in the Seanad, is then referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses, unless the Seanad shall order otherwise.  A message is then sent from the Seanad to the Dáil that the Bill has been so referred, and a notice may then be given of a motion that the Dáil concurs with the Seanad in the reference of the Bill to a Joint Committee.  The personnel of the Joint Committee for the consideration of the Bill, consisting of three members of the Dáil and three members of the Seanad, not locally or otherwise interested in such Bill, is then nominated by the Joint Standing Orders Committee, with a Chairman appointed jointly by the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach.  If the Dáil do not concur in the reference of the Bill to a Joint Committee, the Seanad's order referring the Bill to a Joint Committee is discharged, and the Seanad may then, if it desires, refer it to a Special Committee of the Seanad.  Should the Second Reading of any Private Bill be rejected in the Seanad, the promoters may request that a motion be made in the Dáil <Col N="1266" /> for Second Reading, in which case the Bill, if passed there, would be referred to a Special Committee of the Dáil.  After the Joint Committee has considered the Bill it returns the Bill with or without amendments to both Houses&mdash;this constituting the Third Stage.  The Fourth or Report Stage is then taken in the Seanad, when amendments may be proposed by any member of the Seanad.  This is followed by the Fifth Stage in the Seanad, and the Bill, when passed in the Seanad, is sent to the Dáil, where it is received for final consideration. The First, Second, and Third Stages of the Bill in the Dáil, being deemed by order to have been passed, on receiving the Bill for final consideration, the Dáil may amend the Bill, or may re-commit it to the Joint Committee, or may refer it to a Special Committee of the Dáil.  If any amendment proposed during the Fourth Stage, in either the Dáil or the Seanad, is one of substance or introduces new matter into the Bill, the amendment is referred to the Committee which considered the Bill, the proceedings standing adjourned until the report of the Committee shall have been received. All amendments having been agreed to by both the Dáil and Seanad, the Bill is finally passed and sent to the Governor-General in the same manner as a Public Bill.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to draw the attention of members of the Seanad to Standing Order 100, which provides that Private Business shall be taken at the beginning of each sitting prior to Public Business, and also provides that when any stage of a Private Bill is first taken, no discussion shall be allowed, and if the Bill is opposed it shall not be proceeded with on that occasion, but shall be placed on the Orders of the Day for the next sitting of the House.  If the Bill be then again opposed, its consideration shall again be postponed, without discussion, and the Cathaoirleach or the Ceann Comhairle, as the case may be, shall fix a time for its further consideration.  This means that at any stage of a Private Bill any opposition will secure its being postponed until a time fixed by the <Col N="1267" /> Chairman when it can be discussed, and a division taken.  There are 116 Standing Orders relative to Private Bills, and I do not pretend that this statement is exhaustive.  I hope, however, I have succeeded in explaining in as simple a manner as possible to members of the Seanad, the stages through which a Private Bill must pass.</P>

      <P>The next matter on the agenda is the Ministers and Secretaries Bill, 1923.  The President, being otherwise busily engaged, will not, I understand, be in attendance in connection with this Bill, but the Attorney-General is here, and if it is the wish of the House I shall ask him to take his place for the purpose of attending to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I beg to propose the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (4) to delete the sub-section and to substitute the following new sub-section therefor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The expenses of each of the Departments of State established under this Act shall be as set out in the Estimates approved by Dáil Eireann and shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> I am sorry to see that the amendment is not marked with an asterisk which would indicate that it was accepted by the Government.  I argued the matter before at some length, and I do not wish to take up the time of the House further.</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment stood over from the Committee Stage in order that it might be considered. The Government having considered it, cannot see their way to accept it, I am sorry to say, but on the promise that the Minister has made in regard to accounts and so forth, perhaps Sir John Keane may achieve his object ultimately. As it stands it could hardly work, and for this reason.  The estimates under the Constitution must be presented immediately before the end of the year in respect of which they are prepared. Under the Constitution they are debated during the year to which they apply, and under the Standing Orders of the Dáil that debate must be concluded by August.  If Sir John Keane would look at the amendment he would find that it would be impossible to carry on the Departments in view of the Articles of the Constitution if this amendment were inserted. I think he will be satisfied to know that his object has received every consideration from the Ministry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>The next amendment is a Government one.  It is as follows:&mdash;Section 8, Sub-section 5. Immediately after the word &ldquo;Defence&rdquo; in line 57, to insert the words, &ldquo;but in no case for a longer period continuously than 3 years.&rdquo;  This amendment is an amendment in the Section which deals with the Council for Defence.  The actual words of this amendment were in the original draft of the Bill, but in some way came to be dropped out.  The position of the military members of the Council for Defence has, perhaps, been emphasised, and made intelligible generally by recent events.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme of the Council of Defence, of course, is this.  There are the three great divisions of Army administration, and the idea is that capable and promising officers are withdrawn from the purely military side and put in, for a period of experience, as the principal officials in charge of these respective departments, and during that period they become part of the civil machine. As was asserted elsewhere, it is important that no one should regard himself as having any position of proprietorship of any of these Departments.  Consequently the intention is to keep a movement so that a considerable number of officers will have had experience of work in what we might call the War Office, the civil side of Army administration. The object of the amendment, which was, as I say, intended to be in the draft originally, is that no one can be in charge of any of these Departments for a longer period than three years.  At the termination of three years he simply reverts to his position in the Army as a military man.</P>

      <P>On this stage no amendment is possible without the suspension of the Standing Orders of the House.  It will be observed that the Government are anxious to have an amendment, not a very serious one, inserted.  It seems to provide for a matter that was overlooked. It will be necessary that the Standing Orders of the House be suspended for this purpose.</P>

      <P>The Government amendment is:&mdash;In Section 69.  To add at the end of the new Section 69 the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that in the case of a Justice of the District Court who shall have been a District Justice under the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, and at the date of his appointment to the last-mentioned office was over 55 years of age and under 60 years of age, the Chief Justice may, if he thinks fit, extend the age of retirement of such Justice to such date as will enable him to complete a period of service sufficient to qualify him for a pension.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>You were good enough to say on the Report Stage that if we found anything worth mentioning you would ask leave of the Seanad to have it brought up on the Fifth Stage.  In the draft as originally presented special provision was made to deal with the cases of certain of the District Justices who at the time of their appointment were of a much more mature age than the rest of that body, and who, owing to the fact that it was the Superannuation Act which applied to their pension, were of an age that they could not qualify for a pension unless special provision was made. When the amendment was inserted in the Bill subsequently giving power to the Executive Council to extend the age, that became necessary.  I think it will be realised that those gentlemen who undertook at a time of peril and uncertainty the office of District Justice, and who were not in the first blush of youth, persons who were of an age when one might feel less inclined to face dangers, should have special provision given to them here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision is that where such a man was appointed at an age over 55 years and under 60 the Chief Justice may, if he thinks fit, extend the age of retirement of such Justice to such date as will enable him to complete a period of service sufficient to qualify him for a pension.  I believe the cases that are in mind are between the ages of 55 and 60, and service for a less period than 10 years would deprive them of all pension under the Superannuation Act, <Col N="1274" /> and the intention is to enable that period to be extended by the Chief Justice to 10 years at least, in order to qualify them for a pension.</P>

      <P>It is limited to a completed period of service on such date as will enable him to complete a period of service sufficient to qualify him for the pension.  The intention is so much of a period of 10 years as would be necessary, but if once he has more than that it becomes complicated.  One may have to deal with particular cases and inquire into particular ages.</P>

      <P>By accepting my motion.  I happened to find a document of some value, in more senses than one. This is a General Order entitled &ldquo;The County Boards of Health Accounts Order, 1924,&rdquo; and its price is 15/-.  There was value to the extent of £3 on the Table.  I think some of it is in the hands of Senators, and I have been puzzled about this document.  I think the value is high, or rather that the price is high.  That is a better way to put it. I do not know whether they wanted to deter interested parties from purchasing it, or whether it is hoped that by placing a high value on it people will try to find out what it covers and what it contains.  But I have really come to the conclusion that the reason for such a high value is that the value is commensurate with the work involved in compiling it, and those who have a technical knowledge of printing will appreciate the amount of labour involved in preparing all these forms.  I think the cost involved would be reflected on all the public Boards which provided the forms and information laid down in this Order.  My object in bringing forward this is part of my campaign to try to get the Government to reform the accounting system of the Free State.  If you examine these forms you will see how extraordinarily complicated they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who have technical knowledge of accounting methods will, I think, agree how singularly unsuitable they are <Col N="1276" /> for the purpose of controlling public accounts, which is the only form of control that is of much value in the hands of lay members of these committees and public boards.  I do not propose to go into detail on these forms.  I do say, generally, from an accounting point of view, they belong to the stone age, and they are utterly unscientific.  They overlap; they are exceedingly complicated and involved; they fail to give ready information as to costs, which is an essential point.  A Board should have prompt information, monthly or weekly, as to how costs are moving, and generally they do not serve their purpose. I realise that it is quite impossible to alter them in a hurry.  My object in bringing this forward was to ask the Minister for Local Government to institute an inquiry into all forms of accounts within his province.  I do not suggest anything elaborate&mdash;three experts, one of whom is an official of the Local Government Department, one of whom is, I should suggest, an independent private accountant, and the other is some person who has had experience in the new form of public accounts which has recently received approval from a very authoritative Committee in the case of the War Office in England. As the Minister is not here I will not press the point further.  I shall be satisfied with having raised it, and I will not ask the House to pass the motion, for I realise that it would not be effective or suitable under the circumstances.</P>
