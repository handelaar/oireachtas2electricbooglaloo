      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to inform the House that I have received a letter from Colonel Sir Hutcheson Poë resigning his position on the Seanad, a letter which I think I ought to read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Lord Glenavy,&mdash;It will, no doubt, be within your recollection that in the early part of this year, when I thought of tendering my resignation I was persuaded by the kindly expressed wish of yourself and some other members of the Senate, to defer taking any immediate action.</P>
      <P>Having, however, now entered on my 77th year, and finding it quite impossible, at such an age to uproot the home which circumstances obliged me to establish here, and to return to `Heywood,' I feel I am no longer justified in retaining a position, the duties of which I am unable to properly discharge.</P>
      <P>Apart from the difficulties (in my case somewhat exceptional by reason of my age and physical disability) of giving regular attendance to the Senate, I feel I am placing myself in a false position, and one that is justly open to criticism, if I continue to occupy a seat when by so doing I exclude the services of some younger, and perhaps better qualified man, and who would probably welcome the opportunity of taking part in its administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances, I have no alternative but to place my resignation <Col N="1290" /> in your hands, and to ask you to bring it before the Senate on the first opportunity.</P>
    <P>In severing my connection with the Senate, it is no mere figure of speech to say that I do so with sincere and genuine regret, and with a warm and grateful appreciation of the invariable courtesy which has been extended to me, by you, sir, as Chairman, and by all the members of the Senate.</P>
    <P>I shall always esteem it a privilege to have been permitted to take part, for however short a period, in the deliberations of the first constituted Senate of our country, and to have been associated in some small degree with a Ministry which, by its high ideals of policy, its courage, and its fearless determination to uphold the interests of all classes, has succeeded in re-establishing law and order, in the face of almost insuperable difficulties, and in restoring the country to a condition of peace and quietude, happily very different to that in which it found itself when it was first called upon to function.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours very sincerely,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Hutcheson Poë.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it I have the authority of the Seanad in writing to Sir Hutcheson Poe saying that we regretfully accept his resignation and part from him with the very greatest regret.  I should mention that it is my duty now to fix a date for an election to fill the vacancy.  I think, in view of the Christmas recess, the most convenient date I can fix would be the second Wednesday on which the House sits after the recess.  I would remind the House that the date for the handing in of the nominations to fill the vacancy runs for seven days after the new election has been fixed, so the date for sending in nominations for the vacancy will run for the next seven days from the present date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">

      <P>Surely we must obey our own Standing Orders. The Standing Order says that the moment I receive notice of a vacancy I must inform the House.  The next Standing Order says that, within seven days from the date of fixing the election, nominations have to be sent in. It is not my doing.  I am only carrying out the existing Standing Orders under the orders of this House.</P>

      <P>As far as regards the business of the Seanad that remains to be disposed of, Senators may recollect that a number of Bills were mentioned last week that would probably reach the Seanad for Second Reading this week.  I was over sanguine; none of them will reach this House before the Christmas Recess, with, I understand, the exception of two, the Unemployment Insurance Bill, 1924, and the Railways (Directorate) Bill, 1924.  The rest, I understand, are to remain over until after the Recess.</P>
      <P>These two Bills that I have mentioned, the Unemployment Insurance Bill, 1924, and the Railways (Directorate) Bill, 1924, are not yet through the Dáil, and there is a Motion pending suspending the Standing Orders so as to enable them to be put through their Final Stages to-day.  If that Motion is carried, and the Bills passed through their Final Stages to-day, they will be available for us in the course of this week.  I ought also to mention that there are three Bills in addition to the other two that I mentioned that may possibly be disposed of in the Dáil to-day or to-morrow.  The first of these is the Dublin Port and Docks Bill, 1924, the next is the Live Stock Breeding Bill, and the third is the Local Government Bill, 1924.</P>

      <P>With regard to Section 2, some suggestion came from myself with regard to the words &ldquo;in which the sale usually takes place,&rdquo; and the suggestion was made that it might be changed so as to make it apply &ldquo;to other than the part which is duly licensed for the sale and consumption of drink.&rdquo;  It may raise a great deal of litigation and criticism as to what is the meaning of &ldquo;a place in which the sale usually takes place.&rdquo;  Is that confined to the actual bar, or does it extend to the adjacent snuggeries, parlours and to the adjoining rooms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed that with an official of the Ministry who informed me that he had looked into the matter, and that he found that in many cases a sitting-room upstairs was actually part of the licensed premises, and that, therefore, it would make it impossible for a publican to entertain his friends in the sitting-room.  That is not intended and, therefore, I did not put down the amendment.  My opinion now is that the clause as it stands really achieves what we are endeavouring to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That, of course, would get rid of the suggestion of putting in the words &ldquo;Licensed premises.&rdquo;  I do think it would be very desirable to define those words, &ldquo;in which the sale usually takes place,&rdquo; a little more accurately.

      <P>The suggestion of an amendment on the Committee Stage was considered, and it was thought to be rather difficult to make a suitable change.  It would be a question of fact in each particular case as to where the sale usually takes place. The idea of the section is, of course, to ensure that it would remain possible for the publican to entertain a guest, say, in his drawing-room, or any place like that, but that he could not supply drink to him in a place that is ordinarily used in the ordinary custom of the shop.  I am afraid it would be simply a question of argument on fact in each case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was put down to meet a suggestion made by Senator Linehan.  On the Committee Stage of the Bill, Senator Linehan had an amendment to add at the end of Section 8 the words: &ldquo;Provided that when the intoxicating liquor is consumed before it is paid for without the consent of the licence-holder he shall not be guilty of an offence under this section.&rdquo;  I explained that the amendment could not be accepted, and it was withdrawn.  You, sir, suggested the insertion of some such words as &ldquo;provided that no licence-holder shall be convicted of any offence under the section if he satisfies the court that the supply on credit took place without his privity or consent.&rdquo;  I undertook to consider the matter and to see what amendment to the section could be made to deal with Senator Linehan's point.  I am afraid that the wording suggested by you, sir, would seem to give a form of defence to the licence-holder which in practice would render the section nugatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It certainly would be very difficult to get a conviction, even where an offence in fact had been committed. I am advised that the deletion of the words &ldquo;and before it is consumed&rdquo; in lines 47 and 48 will meet Senator Linehan's point sufficiently without making the section difficult of application in practice.  It will be observed that the section will then prescribe that the liquor must be paid for at the time at which it is supplied.  The time of supply is a sufficiently broad term to give the licence-holder a fair chance of complying with the section, and if his defence is that the consumer departed <Col N="1298" /> without paying, it will be for him to convince the court of that, and I have no doubt that in practice the court will be able to form a judgment whether the licence-holder was guilty of an offence or not.  Certainly, the amendment now suggested will prevent the hardship complained of by the Senator, that it will be necessary to demand payment before the consumer's glass is actually filled.</P>

The Intoxicating Liquor provides that the Act shall be permanent and it is certain now that the Expiring Laws Bill will be law before the Liquor Bill and, therefore, the amendment is necessary.</P>

      <P>I propose to substitute for the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the second last line of this clause, the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  I want to give some jurisdiction to the justices in this case, and I urge upon the Minister to change that.  We hear a great deal of conversation about the sanity of the justices, and as there are a great many local considerations to be taken into account, I think it ought to be left to the justices to decide whether they shall record a conviction upon the licence, or whether they may exercise their own judgment and decide upon the matter. That, to my mind, is a very simple thing.  I think it should be left to the consideration of the justices themselves and that they ought not to be compulsorily bound to record everything on the licence.</P>

      <P>The record of offences which, if the Bill is passed in its present form, must be recorded is set out in the First Schedule.  They are not minor or trivial offences.  They are five in number, and it is because I did advert to certain local circumstances which the Senator speaks of that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; appears in the Bill instead of &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  We are deciding to relieve the justices of that particular discretion which might prove an invidious discretion in the performance of his duties in his area.  It is a straighter and a fairer thing to say that in the abstract, that certain serious convictions <Col N="1300" /> in connection with the Licensing Laws shall be endorsed.  If in the application of that in any particular case owing to a technicality or otherwise the application presses harshly, there is an appeal provided to the High Court, and the High Court can say whether, in regard to the licence which has been endorsed and which has been ultimately cancelled as a result of the Act, there is anything improper or unfair, or whether the breach can be described as a minor one or a technicality.  But if you simply place upon the justice the discretion of saying whether a particular conviction shall be recorded on the licence, then you subject him to a great deal of unpleasant local pressure of one kind or another, which ought not to be the case.  We, surely in the Dáil and in the Seanad, ought to be able to make up our minds whether we regard an offence as a serious offence or not; whether we pass a law with a view to its being kept or to its being broken, and whether if it is broken it is not a proper thing that the fact should be recorded upon the licence of the licence-holder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEVOY</NameTxt>
      <P>When we want justices to adjudicate upon a certain thing we should not make iron-bound rules for them.  There are a lot of circumstances that they, in hearing the case, can take into account.  The appeal the Minister speaks of is only for the third conviction, when it is a matter of life and death for the man whose case is being considered; I say it is only reasonable to put in &ldquo;may&rdquo; and to give the justices a certain latitude.  Surely when we appoint our justices we have every confidence in them, and it should be left to them to decide whether they will record a conviction on the licence or not.  There are a great many extenuating circumstances in a great many cases, and I do not think that we should put compulsion upon the justices. We may as well have automatic machines as justices, if they are not allowed to discriminate and judge between one case and another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, sir, I have a short statement here about the business in the Dáil.  The Bills before the Dáil at present are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Live Stock Breeding Bill, 1924: the Report Stage of which is being resumed in the Dáil to-day.  It is an important measure, and its consideration by the Seanad is likely to take some time.  It is hoped to complete its Final Stage in the Dáil before the adjournment, but it is improbable that the Seanad will be able to do more than give it a Second Reading this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Government Bill, the Report Stage of which is to be taken in the Dáil to-morrow, will, it is hoped, be passed through all stages in the Dáil before the adjournment, and the Minister considers that it is important for the Seanad to undertake its consideration as soon as possible after the Christmas Recess.  The remaining Bills before the Dáil are all of a rather urgent nature, and we will have to ask the indulgence of the Seanad to get them passed before the adjournment. There is the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Bill, 1924, which will be completed in the Dáil to-day.  The objects of the Bill are to renew in the fourth benefit year the benefit which might have been exhausted in the third benefit year, and to put in benefit all ex-National Army soldiers, whether they were in insurable occupations at any period or not.  The Seanad is fully cognisant of the extreme seriousness of the unemployment problem, and the <Col N="1305" /> Bill is one of the measures which the Government are taking to relieve immediate distress.  In order that the full benefits of the Bill can be available it is necessary that it should become law at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>There is the Railways (Directorate) Bill, 1924, the object of which is to confer upon the London, Midland and Scottish Railway the right to nominate a director on the amalgamated company to be constituted under the Railways Act, 1924, in return for certain concessions amounting to about £20,000 per annum which are being granted by that railway to the amalgamated company. I am not in a position to say how speedily the Dáil will deal with this Bill.  It is down for Second Reading to-day, and we will endeavour to get it through all stages this week, so that it may reach the Seanad early next week.</P>
    <P>There is the Port and Docks Bill, which is tabled for Second Reading in the Dáil to-morrow, and which is in a similar position.</P>

      <P>I understood from the Order Paper of the Dáil which I received this morning that there is a motion in the Dáil to suspend Standing Orders with regard to these two Bills, the Unemployment Insurance Bill and the Railways (Directorate) Bill, in order to have them put through to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very serious and difficult matter, because this Local Government Bill is a highly-contentious Bill as far as one can judge from what has taken place in the other House.  I think it has been at least two months under discussion in the other House, and the Committee Stage has been a very long one and a very controversial and keenly-debated one.  I certainly think it would be most unreasonable to expect this House to meet immediately after the New Year for the purpose of taking this Bill, and then to propose to have it rushed through in order to enable the elections to be held at a fixed period.  I would suggest to the Minister that he would consider this view of it: to insert a provision in this Local Government Bill, one clause, postponing the elections until a certain date after this Bill has passed into law.  That would ensure that the elections would be held even though discussions on the Bill in <Col N="1308" /> this House and afterwards in the other House, kept it going beyond the period which would enable the elections to be held next year.  This one clause would simply state that the elections should not take place until a certain number of days after the date of the passing of this Bill into law.</P>

      <P>I will just mention a few points that should be put to the Minister responsible.  We are bound to have a number of elections for the Dáil coming on, and in all these elections I am sure there will be a number of Senators interested.  There is an election in my constituency, and I think the same might apply to a number of other Senators who will be interested in the Local Government Bill.  I certainly would appeal to the Minister responsible for the Bill, to keep it back to give this House and the members who are interested in local government, a chance of debating it.  I do not see that any injury can be done to anybody by postponing the local government elections. As a matter of fact, it would be better to have them in the long evenings of summer than having them in the winter.  That is the general view in the country.  I might also say that, if there is one thing people do not want at the present time, it is elections of any kind.</P>

      <P>I take it that the suggestion of Senator De Loughry is <Col N="1309" /> that we should shut up House in order to allow Senators to go electioneering. That has been done by the other House in its wisdom and they may have very good reasons for it.  But I should certainly be very sorry to let it go as the opinion of this House, that because of elections, referring entirely to the other House, we should postpone the consideration of this measure and tie up business in order to give certain Senators who want to take part in the elections an opportunity of doing so. We all, some time or other, are unfortunate enough to find ourselves taking part in the rough and tumble of an election, but certainly I should be very sorry, and I should think it very impertinent on my part if I were to come here and say: &ldquo;Will you kindly put off the consideration of this measure until I have done my electioneering. Then I will come back and consider it when the evenings are long.&rdquo; We will have to take our responsibilities a little more seriously than that, and I do hope that the opinion expressed by Senator De Loughry is not the opinion of the majority of this House.</P>

      <P>The suggestion I have in my mind is that, without any undue tax on Senators, we could meet probably in the middle of January, but I would not be prepared to pledge the House beforehand, to getting a Bill of this kind through all its stages in time to provide that interval required in order to enable the elections to be held.  It is very likely we will be able to do so, but I do not want to give any guarantee.  I think, therefore, the remedy is what I have suggested: that the elections should take place after the expiration of a certain interval from the date of the passing of this Bill into law.  If that date does not conflict with the existing date no harm is done.  If it does, it can be extended.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that it might be tacitly understood that after Christmas, as soon as we know the date of the re-assembly of the Dáil, we would be prepared to meet 10 days earlier in order to dispose of the Bills and have them ready for the Dáil. <Col N="1310" /> Until we know from the Government what they propose, it is rather premature to fix the date for our re-assembly.</P>

      <P>We have disposed of all the business available for us at present, and, therefore, I think, subject to what the Seanad may consider right, our best course would be to adjourn until Friday.  That, I think, would enable us to see what is going to happen with regard to the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  By that time we ought to have other Bills that are passing through the Dáil at present. Possibly we might be able to conclude our business on Friday.  If Senators think it desirable, perhaps we might meet at 11 or 11.30 a.m. on Friday.  I would like that as many Senators as possible would attend, as it would not do if we had not a sufficient attendance to go on with the business.  I am trying to make it as easy as possible for Senators, and I hope they will meet me by attending here on Friday.</P>

      <P>What I had in mind was that probably most of the Senators from the country would stay in Dublin, and I wanted to enable them to get away early on Friday afternoon. If they think that 2 o'clock would be more convenient, we would like to consult their convenience.</P>

      <P>What Senator Mrs. Costello had in mind was that, by reason of attendance at meetings of Private Bill Committees Senators would not be here, and we might have a difficulty in having a House.  I am afraid that difficulty will apply all this week and the greater part of next week.</P>

      <P>In connection with that I think there is a feeling that Private Bill Committees should not, as a general rule, sit at least more than half an hour after the time fixed for the <Col N="1312" /> sitting of either House.  It is intended that some such principle will be generally adopted.  The particular Bills this week are of an exceptional character and are of considerable importance&mdash; three Bills with a very large array of legal talent.  The members of the Committee felt that considerable expense and time would be saved by sitting late.  I do not think that should be assumed by members as a precedent. The reason I mention 12 o'clock is that if the Private Bill Committees sit on Friday, members of the other House will be in exactly the same position as this House.  I do not think they could sit very late in normal circumstances.</P>
      <P>Motion put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.15 p.m. until 12 o'clock on Friday, December the 12th.</P>
