    <P>Debate resumed on Fisheries Bill as returned from the Dáil, which disagreed with the following amendment thereto made by the Seanad:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 8.&mdash;To insert after this Section a new Section 9 as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;9.  No penalty inflicted under this Act shall be reduced or remitted save on the recommendation of the Judge or Justice who imposes such penalty, and any recommendation for such reduction or remission shall be made at the same time as the penalty is imposed.&rdquo;&mdash; (Adjourned from January 23rd.)</P>

      <P>The first business on the Orders of the Day is the resumption of the consideration of the Message from the Dáil in the matter of the disagreement with the amendment of the Seanad.  The matter stood over for the purpose of the Government considering the suggestion which was made of an addition to this amendment, the words of which will be within the recollection of the Seanad.  I see the Minister for Fisheries here, and perhaps he would tell us what the views of the Government are.</P>

    <P>I would like to say that I regret that <Col N="500" /> questions of such constitutional importance have been brought into what I consider, at any rate, a very simple Bill.  I am not learned in the law.  I am not competent to give an opinion as between one eminent lawyer and another on constitutional questions.  I introduced this Bill for the simple and straightforward motive of protecting fisheries, and I said when I was introducing this Bill here that it was chiefly devoted to fishing in the spawning season, and that it was very urgent then from my point of view.  I hold that there is still urgency about the Bill in the fact that there are some sections which deal with very important matters in connection with poaching of the very worst type, with dynamite and poison, notably Sections 6, 7, and 8.  My regret is probably all the greater that this constitutional question has been raised, in that the Seanad were, I think, unanimous as far as the real principles of the Bill were concerned: that is, the protection of fisheries generally, and especially the protection of spawning fish.  The modified amendment has been considered by the Government, and found unacceptable, probably again for constitutional reasons with which I do not claim to be competent to deal.  In bringing this message from the Dáil, perhaps I may be allowed to make a few remarks.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that this stood over for discussion on the suggestion from myself made to the President, of a possible way out, by adding certain words to the beginning of this amendment. The matter stood over for the purpose of ascertaining the views of the President and his colleagues upon that.  You have told us that they are not prepared to accept that.  Therefore, perhaps, you will find it more advantageous if you were to defer your remarks generally on the principle of the Bill and the amendment until you have heard the views of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Seanad now of the position in which we stand.  This was an amendment <Col N="501" /> that passed in the Seanad in Committee, and was reaffirmed on the Report Stage.  It was disagreed with in the Dáil and a message to that effect returned to us.  The position, therefore, now is that this Seanad has to determine whether it will adhere to this amendment, whether it will alter it in any shape or form, or whether it will acquiesce in its being turned down in the Dáil.  The motion that was before the Seanad when the debate was adjourned was one that had been partly introduced by Senator Jameson to amend the amendment by inserting in the front of it:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Save and except in any case in which the Minister for Fisheries certifies that it has been proved to his satisfaction that a miscarriage of justice has taken place.</P>
      <P>That, therefore, is now the motion before the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am responsible for that.  The view I took was that it was hardly fair to ask him to make a general statement before he had heard all the reasons that might be given by Senators.  If the Seanad would prefer to hear the Minister's reasons why he and his colleagues have not been able to agree to the suggested alteration of the amendment, I place myself entirely in the hands of the Seanad, subject to the views of the Minister himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>

      <P>I thought it would be more to his advantage and more convenient if those general observations were made when he had heard the views of Senators.  It is entirely a matter of form, and there is no substance in it.  If the Seanad would rather hear the views of the Minister, then it is entirely for them, if the Minister so chooses.</P>

      <P>The point I was anxious to make was that, as the Minister says, there is no difference amongst us as to the Bill, and as to the intentions of the Ministry in introducing it. The question of the merits of this amendment is another thing.  We did our best yesterday to try and meet the one point which, as far as we could judge, the Government had put up as an adequate and real objection to the amendment as it was drawn.  The Government may have other reasons for turning down that offer of ours to alter the amendment to meet what we believed to be the only cause of difference between us.  If there are other reasons why they consider the amendment injudicious I should think, before we begin discussing it, it would be wise for the Minister to let us hear his view of the case which, I need not tell him, will receive every consideration as far as we are concerned.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Jameson.  What occurred to me yesterday was, that the difference between us was so very small, it was a pity we could not come to some arrangement that would preserve the dignity of both sides.  I would certainly like to know why, for my own part, the Minister is unable to meet or accept the advance that we made yesterday. We are most anxious that this Bill should be passed.  We think it is a good Bill, and we said so over and over again.  We would not like the Bill to be lost.  If the Minister can make any suggestion as to how we might decently get out of this impasse, we would be glad to hear it.  Before we discuss the Bill any further, I would like to have further enlightenment.</P>

      <P>I believe that Senator Jameson's proposition has not been seconded, and I desire to do so. Personally I think that the thing has resolved itself into a Constitutional question between the two Houses.  Unless the Minister could throw some light on it, it would be waste of time to discuss it, and the sooner we make up our minds on that the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest a way out of the difficulty.  The Minister <Col N="503" /> told us on a former occasion that he would shortly introduce a larger Bill dealing with the whole question of Fisheries.  Would the Minister give an undertaking that when framing that Bill he would consider what has been put forward so strongly in the Seanad in regard to this particular point?  I think if we got an assurance from the Minister that he would carefully consider these points with a view to their possible adoption, it might meet the views of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that that would be, I am afraid, a complete abandonment by the Seanad of its position, because to say that we are to wait and see what consideration will be given to this amendment in a new and different Bill altogether, would be, I suggest, a very unsatisfactory solution.  Let us, if we can, arrive at some compromise with regard to this particular amendment, for the purpose of this particular Bill, that will not compromise either the rights or the dignities of the Seanad.  Let it be a compromise in reference to the situation that has arisen, and not of a situation that may never arise, and of which the Minister is not able to give us any pledge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>On the actual question now being put to me, I could scarcely give what might be an answer that would be satisfactory to the Senators who raised it.  This is a Constitutional matter, and not a fishery matter at all. It has been considered by the Government, and the arguments put forward <Col N="504" /> in the Seanad were carefully considered. The Government decided against these arguments, and decided that the amendment was still unacceptable for the reasons they had already put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot with very great respect, have been for the reasons that have already been put forward, as the only reason they put forward was that it prevented them from dealing with cases of miscarriage of justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The altered amendment provides for that, and gives the Government power to interfere in any case in which they believe there has been a miscarriage of justice.  Up to the present that is the only argument we heard against this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>You defined a miscarriage of justice yesterday, and of course, as far as I am concerned, I would accept that as the last word as a legal definition of miscarriage of justice. But I am not the Government's legal authority in this matter.  There may be other opinions as to what a miscarriage of justice is and, therefore, they may not be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, surely, if you put in the words &ldquo;miscarriage of justice,&rdquo; it will be for the Ministry to interpret them, and for them to say if the case is one of miscarriage of justice or not.  We did not cripple them in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>When you were giving your definition yesterday of miscarriage of justice, of course, as I said, that was the last word in the legal definition of miscarriage of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be misunderstood.  I did not propose to give an exhaustive definition. I was only enumerating certain cases which would be held to be a miscarriage of justice; such, for example, as if there was a case of mistaken identity, false evidence against a convicted man, or that the Judge had gone wrong in some section of the law.  These are well known illustrations.  I did not purport to say that they were exhaustive. <Col N="505" /> I was giving them as illustrations pointing out the distinction between them and an appeal <i>ad miseracordiam</i> which did not touch the merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the layman's conception, and that is my conception, of a miscarriage of justice goes a great deal further than your definition.</P>
      <P>The ordinary person would look on a case like this as a miscarriage of justice. We have a minimum penalty of £50 for certain offences.  Some person under some very particular circumstances commits this offence, but in the ordinary course of events, if the judge had a free hand he would not impose a fine of £50.  The £50 is, however, inflicted, and the ordinary person would call that a miscarriage of justice.  That may be wrong from a legal point of view, but it is the layman's point of view.  That is the whole thing behind it.  If a miscarriage of justice should be made to meet cases where there is inequitable administration of the law inasmuch as the minimum penalties will not be fair&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is some confusion here.  I am anxious that we should come to some understanding. The amendment the Seanad passed recognises the rights to remit penalties in cases where there are mitigating circumstances.  It only says that the mitigating circumstances are to be reviewed by the justice at the time.  It does not take it out of his power to make recommendations for remission nor does it take it out of the power of the Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to that extent that it must be made at the time.  Take a person who commits this offence and suppose he is a poor man.  I am not pleading for him, and I must not be taken as pleading for a poacher as I am all out against them&mdash;if I may use the expression.  This man goes into court and thinks for one reason or other that he will get off with something small, something which his purse may be able to meet.  He finds himself however up against a very stiff fine, say a minimum penalty.  He goes home wiser after the event, and for the first time consults <Col N="506" /> a solicitor.  He did not go to the expense of getting a solicitor on the first day as he could not pay for one.  Seeing however what is up against him he employs a solicitor.  The justice has no power to revise the decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATAOIRLEACH AN CATAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there is no such case for this reason. The solicitor who comes on the scene after the case is over would be of very little use, as the petition is not heard in court.  It is a paper petition sent to the Executive imploring them for reasons such as I have mentioned to remit portion of the penalty.  All the amendment suggests is that the men should be asked to do that in the presence of the justice.  If there is a case to be made for mitigation it should be made in court, and if the justice thinks that there are mitigating circumstances, he may be able to report accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose this happens on the very day this takes place, the case is decided, the judge goes on with another case, and the man goes outside the court and consults his solicitor, who comes back to court and asks leave to raise the case again, the judge has no power under this amendment to consider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there has been in the matter of this amendment of the Fisheries Bill a considerable amount of strong reference to the constitutional question which has somewhat clouded the issue.  As I understand the position the majority of the Seanad is of the opinion that a remission of fines should not take place under the Fisheries Act unless there has been a miscarriage of justice.  I take it that quite apart from this amendment if the person concerned is not able to pay the fine and finds himself in prison the Governor-General, on the advice of the Executive, would have power to exercise the prerogative of mercy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not accurate to say that this amendment is passed for the purpose of providing that only in cases of miscarriage of justice should there be a remission of the penalty.  The amendment as passed dealt with the remission by way of mitigation.  The additional matter, which the Seanad offered to introduce, gives a further power to the Executive, and that is power to intervene, apart from any recommendation from the justice, wherever they believe there is a miscarriage of justice.  The amendment recognises the right of the Executive to interfere to mitigate a penalty provided the justice at the hearing recommends it.  The further amendment suggests that apart from any recommendation of the justice, the Executive should have power to intervene and remit any case in which they believe there has been a miscarriage of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>What I wished to suggest was that the Seanad in having expressed its views was prepared to go further in the additional amendment proposed yesterday.  I also wish to suggest that nothing in this amendment, <Col N="508" /> whether in its first form or in the other form, could interfere with the prerogative of mercy exercised by the Governor-General on the advice of the Executive Council.  I am still of the opinion that the proper action for the Seanad to take is to make its suggestion towards leaving the difficulty and send it to the Dáil in the hope that if they cannot see their way to accept the amendment in the form in which it is passed here they will, at least, think the matter over and send it back perhaps in some changed form.  I think that we have now got to the stage at which talk is not going to bring us very much further.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from the various constitutional matters that have got mixed up, there is not very much difference between the position taken by the Minister and that taken by the Seanad. The Minister introduced a Bill for the purpose of getting at the poacher and the Seanad introduced an amendment to help the Minister.  It should not be beyond the power of the two Houses to find an amendment which would meet the case.  For that reason I am of opinion that the best thing to do is to send it back to the Dáil, and we will find that they in turn will make a suggestion which will meet the two points of view, which I suggest are not very far apart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel in the same role as Senator Douglas, and that is, that in order to shorten discussion and get to the point, I would like to ask the Minister if the objection still to our amendment rests on the constitutional point.  The constitutional point is set out by the Attorney-General, and I take his words as reported in the Official Record, in which he said: &ldquo;It is not an amendment to anything in the Bill, it is an attempt by the Seanad to affect the constitutional position outside the Bill as regards the remission and sentence.&rdquo;  If we take our stand on that point in the absence of any other consideration, I think this discussion had better end.  If they care to forego that point&mdash;I suppose the Executive would be entirely led by the Attorney-General in the matter&mdash;I think we will come to an arrangement on a form of words to meet their objections. <Col N="509" /> We can extend the terms of the amendment to cover possible cases of hardship that might arise, but which might be excluded by the amendment in its present form.  I can visualise cases of hardship which would not come under the category of miscarriage of justice.  For instance, a man accused of poaching, living far away from the Court, might meet with an accident on the morning of the trial which prevented him coming to it. His case is called, and evidence of the summons having been served is given, the State Solicitor stands up and makes his case.  The very fact of a man not having appeared in Court may be accepted that he has no defence. The Bench imposes a minimum penalty and the man is thereby debarred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>He has his right of appeal. At the time of the passing of the sentence there has been no recommendation given from the Bench, and that is the wording of our original amendment&mdash;that at the time of imposing the penalty there should be a recommendation, and in the absence of that recommendation a petition should be barred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not altogether correct, either.  If you look at the words and &ldquo;the recommendation of a Judge or Justice,&rdquo; they enable the Judge on appeal to make a recommendation. If there is an appeal the sentence has no effect until the appeal is decided, and the introduction of the word &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; points to the hearing of an appeal as well as the hearing of the case by the Justice.  Therefore it would be open to the Judge on appeal to recommend a remission.</P>

      <P>There are many cases which would occur to Senators who have had experience of certain parts of the country.  Take the case of summer time, when the season is extended during the period from Saturday to Monday.  In some parts the newspapers do not circulate, and men have not notice of the commencement of summer time, as they may be illiterate. <Col N="510" /> A man may be caught unwittingly breaking the law.  He comes before the Justice, and in his entire innocence, he pleads that it was not present to his mind that this alteration had taken place in the law.  He may have been an illiterate man.  The Justice, actuated by the frequency of poaching in his district, is determined to put it down, and this man, when he advances his plea, is told: &ldquo;If I give ear to that it would be every man's defence.  I am not going to take your ignorance of the law as a good defence.&rdquo;  He imposes a fine. There would arise a clear case of injustice.</P>
      <P>That man has no redress; the sentence will be confirmed.  He could not petition at the time because the Justice would refuse it.  He would say: &ldquo;I will not recommend.&rdquo;  There may be many more cases in which hardships may arise, and we know that instances have been known where the greatest consideration has been given to criminal cases.  Every aspect of the ease has been inquired into.  Ultimately, the Courts of Appeal have confirmed the sentence, and yet we know that though an unfortunate defendant has served years of penal servitude on the dying confession of some man who was guilty, he had to be released. Hence, this right of the subject in every case to appeal to the head of the State over and above the decision of all Courts, is inherent in our Constitution. I take it that is so.  At any rate it is handed down to us by statute.  Any transgression of that right may be properly resented, but where a right is given by statute or in the Constitution, and has given rise to great abuses, as we know this method under discussion now has, is it not competent for the Seanad to restrict or annul by statute that which has been made by statute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the case as we find it to-day, and these abuses under the old regime we might have understood, though my experience of petitions is that the consideration of them by the Executive or the Lord Lieutenant of the time was not on the merits of the case, but on the signatories to the petition.  We know these things, and unfortunately, we have it from the figures that were submitted in the Dáil that this abuse is <Col N="511" /> being perpetuated, and I regret that it is so.  It is a reflection on our administration, and if we, as a Seanad, are here for anything at all, it is to put our foot down upon abuses of that sort, whether perpetrated in the Courts, or by the Executive or by the Governor-General.</P>
    <P>We are here as a deliberative assembly, and we are here, if we have any function at all, to check hasty or ill-considered legislation.  I am sure if you refer to the Orders of the Day for to-day, which contains seven and a half pages of amendments to a Bill, you will realise that this is a very necessary Chamber, that Bills do come in a very immature and ill-considered way from the other House, possibly owing to urgency.  As Senator Douglas has said, our desire has been entirely to help in putting down poaching.  That is all we have in view, and surely, when the Constitutional question is not the crux, the two Houses being of the same mind, and having the same objective, surely we will be able to arrange and agree to a form of words that will meet any consideration or objection that may be raised.  I ask the Minister if the constitutional question is the crux, and if so.  I move that the discussion ceases.</P>

I think, in the circumstances <Col N="512" /> as we are now, that Senator Douglas is right in suggesting that we should go through the form of passing this amendment as it stands, and referring it back to the Dáil.  The Dáil has asked us to form a Joint Committee with them for the consideration of a particular matter, and no doubt, other matters will be submitted to it, too.  I suggest that we pass this amendment, as we believe it ought to be passed, that it go back to the Dáil, and the whole matter can be laid before the Joint Committee, and some form of words, or agreement, can be come to for the purpose of preventing a conflict, or disagreement, between the two Houses.

      <P>As regards the question raised by Senator Kenny, namely, that this amendment, apparently, makes no provision for the Judge, on appeal, to have power to make a recommendation for mitigation, I think as it stands at present it does do that, because it uses the words: &ldquo;Recommendation of the Judge or the Justice who imposes such penalty.&rdquo;  But in order to put the thing beyond doubt&mdash; and I think it ought to be put beyond doubt&mdash;I would suggest that the amendment be altered in this way:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No penalty inflicted under this Act shall be reduced or remitted, save on the recommendation of the Justice who imposes such penalty, or of the Circuit Judge, in the event of an appeal, and any recommendation for such reduction or remission shall be made at the same time as the penalty is imposed or the conviction affirmed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>You, Senator, with all respect, do not appreciate the amendment.  In order to enable the Government to relieve a case of miscarriage of justice no petition is required at all.  The Seanad amendment does not make that necessary at all.  It only speaks of petitions where they are sent forward with a view to relieve cases <i>ad misericordiam</i>, but it leaves untouched and out of the question of a petition all cases of miscarriage of justice, and the case you have put would be clearly a case of a miscarriage of justice.  The proposal now before the House is this:&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="514" />&ldquo;That the House having received the message from the Dáil, amend the amendment in the following particulars, so that it shall read as follows: &lsquo;Save and except in any case in which the Executive is satisfied that there has been a miscarriage of justice, no penalty under this Act shall be reduced or remitted, save on the recommendation of the Justice who imposes such penalty, or of the Circuit Judge in the event of an appeal, and any recommendation for such reduction or remission shall be made at the same time as the penalty is imposed or the conviction affirmed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As I said yesterday, Mr. O'Higgins, and as I repeat to-day, I am very anxious to oblige Ministers, more particularly the President, as I know what his engagements are, and as I have seen even when he gives us the honour of his presence, that he is perpetually worried by messages from outside, and, therefore. I realise his difficulty and his position.  But I do not think, having regard to the amount of opposition that this Public Safety Bill received yesterday on the Second Reading Stage, that it would be reasonable to ask the House to deal with it to-day, because I understand certain members of the House propose to put down amendments.  I think it would be to the advantage of the Minister that he should have the opportunity of seeing these so that he should not be taken, as another Minister was, by surprise. Therefore, I would be quite prepared to fall in with the suggestion were it not that I have received an intimation that several Senators are putting down amendments on the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons are obvious.  This is a very important Bill affecting the safety of freedom of the <Col N="516" /> citizens.  It was introduced in the Dáil on the 11th December, and it was introduced to this House on the 23rd of this month, and the Minister seeks to have it passed on the 24th.  Our own Standing Orders provide that amendments to Bills shall be handed in not later than 11 o'clock on the day preceding the day they shall be discussed. This Bill got a second reading yesterday, and there was no time to comply with the Standing Orders.  To suggest that we should right away proceed to discuss it in Committee is absolutely unreasonable.  I think it is another case of the &ldquo;taking for granted&rdquo; policy of Ministers as far as this House is concerned.  If it took so many days to pass through the Dáil there is no reason for taking it for granted that it should pass through the Seanad without opposition or discussion.  There are amendments to it, and it is desirable that the Minister should see these amendments and that the House should have an opportunity of considering them.  For that reason I should object to it coming up to-day, and even if it came up to-morrow it does not give us time to consider amendments to such an important measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Seanad should bear in mind with regard to this important Bill that the intention is that it should come into operation on the 1st February.  If the Bill is to come into operation on that date that does not leave much time for the House to discuss the amendments.</P>
      <P>Perhaps under the circumstances Senator O'Farrell would see his way to agree that the Committee Stage should be taken to-morrow.  That, I think, is putting an unreasonable pressure on the House, and I think the House has reason to complain that this Bill has been brought in so late if it is to be put in force on the 1st February. At the same time, recognising the importance of the Bill, I do not think we would be going much out of the way if we were to agree that it should be taken first thing to-morrow, and if the House would agree to that I would arrange accordingly.</P>

      <P>This matter has occurred to me, that the Seanad would be very glad to welcome the presence here, during the discussion of the Bill, of the Attorney-General.  Personally. I think he would be a very great assistance to us.  At the same time, I understand that there is some constitutional question which prevents him from being described as a Minister, although I should have thought he was, for all intents and purposes, a Minister. <Col N="518" /> On the other hand, if he is not entitled to be here as a Minister&mdash;gladly though we would welcome him&mdash;I do not know that we have any power under the Constitution or under our Standing Orders to give the right of audience to anyone else.  I would hesitate about making a precedent.  That is my difficulty.  There is a provision that a Minister has the right of audience.  I know of no provision enabling anyone else to have the right of audience.  Therefore, it would seem to me, unless we have a Standing Order providing for this, that as we stand at present, having regard to the Constitution, we have no power to give the right of audience to anyone but a Minister.  I should be very glad if the Attorney-General would assume that he is both in fact and in law a Minister, and then we could gladly welcome his presence in our midst.  He is behind the Bar at present, and cannot deal with this matter.  Perhaps, if he had an opportunity of having a word with the President, and if they were satisfied that he comes within the definition of a Minister within the Constitution, and is entitled to an audience in the Seanad, we will all gladly welcome him.</P>

It can do no harm, and it is there if it is wanted.</P>

      <P>The age of retirement of all judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court shall be 70 years, but the Executive Council may, after consultation with the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General, extend the age of retirement in the case of any judge to 75 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move in Section 12, line 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete the figures 70 and substitute therefor the figures 75.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment and the next amendment&mdash;in Section 12, line 2, to delete &ldquo;all&rdquo; from the words &ldquo;but the Executive&rdquo; to the end of the Section &mdash;relate to the one thing.  The object is to make the retirement of a Judge of the High Court of Justice, or of the Supreme Court of Justice, take place automatically at a certain age.  The Section as it is in the Bill fixes the age of retirement at 70, and gives power to the Government &ldquo;after consultation with the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General, to extend the age of retirement in the case of any Judge to 75 years.&rdquo;  Now, the Section, as it stands, puts the Judge in a most invidious position when he arrives at the age, say, of 69.  For twelve months he is at the mercy of the Government.  He does not know what is going to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not a position in which a <Col N="524" /> judicial person should be put.  I do not suppose it would affect his mind at all during that twelve months in deciding a case in which the Government was involved, but if he did happen during that 12 months to give a strong decision in favour of the Government a number of people would at once criticise that decision and say: &ldquo;He is deciding in favour of the Government because he is 69.  He will, therefore, try next year to be kept on until he is 75.&rdquo;  That is not a fair position, nor an honourable position to put a man in.  I am anxious that this Section should be amended in such a way that whatever age is put in it should automatically work, and that there should be no possibility of a judge being for a moment at the mercy of the Executive. I am suggesting the age of 75, as I know from experience at the Bar that it is an extremely rare ease in which a healthy judge has not been able to perform his functions perfectly well up to that age.  I am, however, quite willing to recognise that others may not be of that opinion, and if the Seanad is of opinion that the age of 75 is a little too old, I am perfectly willing that the amendment should be altered to say 73.  I would insist, however, that whatever age a judge is to retire at he should retire at that age, and that there should not be any period of extension at the mercy of the Executive.  It really in a way affects the question of the independence of the Judiciary, and that is a thing that should not be interfered with.  I therefore move that the figures 70 in line 2 be deleted, and that the figures 75 be substituted.  The second amendment proposes to delete the rest of the Section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the spirit underlying the amendment, but I could not support a proposition that every judge might remain a judge up to the age of 75. After all, three-quarters of a century is a very long time, and I think it is desirable that 70 should be the maximum and absolute limit up to which judges should have the right to stay on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, the experience of the ordinary layman is that Judges over 70 <Col N="525" /> years of age, with of course a few exceptions, generally get out of touch with modern developments, and even with the law itself, and are coloured by the outlook and prejudice of past generations, and find it extremely hard to keep in touch with the legal developments of later days.  They have, I think, often caused a great deal of anxiety to lawyers themselves, who find it impossible to convince an old addle-headed man in regard to laws recently enacted.  In these circumstances, I think it would be extremely undesirable to raise the limit to 75 years all round.  There is a good deal in the argument of Senator Brown as to the right of the Government or officials to extend the age, although I can see it may be a loss to lose a judge because he is 70 years old.  I think, however, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, and for that reason I would vote against the amendment, but I do not think it would be wise to press it to a division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if we get rid of the alternative, the case would be met, because the position explained by Senator Brown is caused by the anxiety of the judge to know what is to happen to him at the age of 70.  As regards the independence of the judge being interfered with by this clause, it is not to be suggested that all the senility of the country is to be monopolised by the Bar.  It is almost anti-Scriptural to carry on after 70 years of age.  I heard a case of an excellent Judge in India who frequently condemned the advocate to death, and sometimes addressed the criminal in equal terms.  Seventy years is five years in excess of the usual Civil Service limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Gogarty, in dealing with the senility of the Bench, has not called on his own experience.  I think he must admit that many of our great judges, well over the age of 70, could not be called senile.  Quite apart from the question of the Judges, I think that probably the Government in putting in this clause, as they did, were taking care of <Col N="526" /> the public purse.  It is an expensive thing to retire a man five years before he need be retired, and pay a successor. In the balance of years it will come to a good deal of money, and I doubt if it is wise for us to turn out our judges at 70 years of age, on the presumption that all persons at 70 are becoming senile.  That is against the experience of all those who have known the judges of Ireland in the past twenty-five years, which has been the length of my experience of them.  I should have thought that the Government would be quite right in exercising its right to continue them for five years, so long as the office continued to be filled with efficiency.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Brown is absolutely right when he said that it puts the judge in an extremely unpleasant position and is one which the Seanad, if it is wise, will relieve him from.  The mere implication that a man in the position of a judge can be actuated by any feelings.  such as those regarding his own future in regard to the Executive under which he acts, ought at any cost be kept out of any Judiciary Bill which the Seanad may pass.  I hold that you should follow Senator Brown's suggestion, though Senator Gogarty and Senator O'Farrell believe that it ought to be the age of seventy. So far as economy and common sense are concerned as well as knowledge of the past, I believe that it would be right to go up to the full age of 75.  As I am approaching rapidly the age at which we are all supposed to retire I do not like to say much more, but the leaders of the Government are youthful, and I hope they will give us their opinions.  I would ask the Seanad to make a definite period for the retirement of the judge.</P>

So far as I have noticed, the members of the Bar promoted to the Bench have been promoted when advanced in years for the most part, and where some men appear to be quite old in the early sixties, others appear to be young even when long past the period of three score years and ten.  It should be remembered that some of the greatest speeches made by statesmen here or in <Col N="527" /> Great Britain were made by men like Gladstone, who had reached four score of years.</P>

      <P>I wish to speak in support of this amendment.  I do not know as much about the Judiciary as many members of the Seanad, but I have had a very wide experience of this question of retirement at a certain age limit.  I have considered hundreds of cases, and have given them my personal attention.  My experience is that I have been far more impressed by the waste of good talent caused by enforced retirement than by the continuance at work of men who had passed their period of efficiency.  It seems to me that in the case of judges you are considering positions in which wisdom and experience are the qualities particularly needed.  They are the essential qualifications of a mature age, and I think if the age is fixed at seventy a great deal of judicial talent will be lost to the detriment of the public purse.  I strongly support the alteration of the retiring age from seventy to seventy-five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps before the President speaks I may say a word on this subject without leaving the Chair.  I have the strongest sympathy and support for the suggestion that, whatever the age limit is to be, it should be a definite one, applicable all round, and that there should be no power in the Executive, or anybody else, to prolong that period, because, as Senator Brown has pointed out, a judge under this Section would, from the time he reaches the age of 70, be dependent for five years upon the discretion of the Crown, whether he was to continue or not.  I think that that is not a proper position in which to put a judge.  It is obvious it will give occasion for suspicion, probably unfounded, but the public mind is so anxious and particular about the independence of the judges it would give ground for suggestions that he was influenced for or against the Government, as they determined to retain or get rid of him.  I urge on the Government most respectfully that whatever age they agree to adopt it should be definite <Col N="528" /> and applicable all round, with no power of extension or remission. When we come to the question of what that age should be, I should remind the Seanad of what, apparently, has been overlooked so far.  Under the old British Constitutional practice, under which our judges up to now hold office, they held it during good behaviour.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there was at no time any power to remove a judge who had manifestly become either physically or mentally incapable unless he was willing to recognise the fact himself and retire.  Speaking almost universally, the Judge did recognise the fact for this obvious reason.  He lives and does his work in the eyes of the public and of the profession, and no self-respecting Judge, once he realises that either through physical or mental infirmity, he has become incapable of discharging his duties has, in my long experience, ever held out against public opinion in that respect.  On the contrary, I have known some of our most eminent judges, Chief Baron Pallas is a remarkable example, and there is another example of a judge still living, who remained a judge until he was eighty. Each of those two judges were probably the most brilliant members of the Bench in their day, and up to the day they retired.  We have on the Bench to-day a judge who is at least four score years.  It is the opinion of the profession and his colleagues, and certainly I share in it, that at no time has he shown a higher judicial capacity or greater knowledge of the law than in recent years.  If anyone wants an example of virility after the age of seventy, I would recommend him to go for five minutes to the Recorder's Court, and he will come back with his mind completely disabused.  The Constitution has altered the tenure of the Judges, because they no longer are entitled to hold office during good behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They can be removed, and I think this is a very important provision of the Constitution.  They can be removed for incapacity.  That is the first time that the principle has been asserted, as far as I know, under the British Constitution, in regard to Judges of the High Court.  I think it is a wise provision, because it will prevent the possibility <Col N="529" /> of a judge who, by mental or physical infirmity, has become unable to discharge his duty.  If he attempts to brave public opinion, and continue after time has warned him, that his faculties are no longer suitable for the position, it is in the power of the Oireachtas to compel him to resign his office.  The words are: &ldquo;The Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Court shall not be removed except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity.&rdquo; Those words &ldquo;or incapacity&rdquo; are in the provision, regulating the tenure of Judges of the High Court.  Therefore, it seems to me that people in the country have a complete safeguard in that new provision against the possibility of any judge attempting to continue to discharge his duties if he is unfitted, either physically or mentally.  I wish to mention that to show you how important the new provision is.  I remember well a case happening about twenty years ago of a judge who, unfortunately, became mentally deranged. Being mentally deranged, he was, naturally, incapable of signing his resignation, and the Government were perplexed to know how to deal with the situation.  For a whole year he remained in his office, although during that time he was shut up in an asylum, and the position was finally solved in a way of very doubtful constitutional practice by getting a member of his family to sign his name to the resignation paper.  That was the solution arrived at then, but no longer will that be necessary, because under this provision now made, and inserted in the Constitution, a High Court Judge for the first time may be removed for incapacity.  Therefore, I would respectfully suggest to the President and his colleagues to give favourable consideration to this amendment, and that whatever view they take as to the age, they should be firm in adopting the suggestion of this amendment, in so far as it determines there is to be a definite age, applicable all round, with no power to discriminate between them.  I merely throw this out for the consideration of the President.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In the report which was submitted from the Committee, <Col N="530" /> the only reference I can find on retirement, is that recommended in the case of Circuit Judges, and given as 70 years.  We took that to apply to the other cases.  We may have misinterpreted the views of the Committee. This matter was under consideration in the Dáil, and the original terminology in this particular clause was altered to read, that &ldquo;after consultation with the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General.&rdquo; If my recollection is correct, the idea was that in the case of the Chief Justice, the Attorney-General being also a candidate for office, the Executive Council might exercise a wise discretion whether it would get rid of the Attorney-General or the Chief Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is a growing inclination to canvass too much the ability of the Executive Council to exercise a wise discretion in those cases.  I think there has not been any case really put forward on substantial grounds showing our inability to deal fairly and impartially, without fear or favour, in connection with these cases.  I hesitate to think the time is coming, or likely to come, when any persons in the position of the Executive Council will lightly discharge their duty, or be influenced by causes other than that of the best interests of the country in deciding these matters.  You mentioned, Sir, one case in which there was a retirement. There was a common rumour in Dublin regarding another case in which the person would not have retired.  I do not know that there is likely to be any conflict of opinion between a Judge and the Executive Council.  I think if a Judge exercises the independence he is expected to exercise, and I hope will exercise, and that an Executive Council attempted to interfere with the holding of an office in which he had discharged his duties in the best interests of the country, they would not last very long. I do think it would not be wise to interfere with this section.  There was considerable criticism.  I think it was Deputy Bryan Cooper who raised the question first; and we met him on it in such a way that there were two persons external to the Executive Council, to advise them on the subject.  It is unlikely that there will be a dispute between the two.  Granted even that <Col N="531" /> there was, I certainly do not think that it is likely within the next ten, fifteen or twenty years, that you will have an Executive Council so weak and so corrupt, that it will not discharge its duties to the country just as independently as a judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the President that nothing could be further from my mind than to suggest that the Executive Council would not act with the utmost impartiality under the Section as it stands in the Bill.  My objection was not on that score at all.  It was entirely on the position in which this Section puts the Judge.  That, I do not think, has been in any way removed by what the President has said.  The only other remark I would like to make is this: that the Article of the Constitution to which you, Sir, referred, is one which I had forgotten, and it entirely removes the objection to the age of 75.  I respectfully suggest that the age at which a judge retires ought to be 75.  There is in the Constitution a power, if cases arise, which is very unlikely, of dealing with them. I think that the Seanad ought to accept the amendment as it stands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There shall be granted to each judge of the High Court and the Supreme Court who retires after 15 years' service or upwards in the said courts or either of them, a pension to be continued during his life of two-thirds of his salary at the time he ceases to act as judge.  There shall be granted to each judge of the High Court and the Supreme Court who vacates his office owing to age or permanent infirmity after having completed five or more years' service and less than fifteen years' service a pension calculated at the rate of one-sixth of his salary at the time he vacates his office, with the addition <Col N="532" /> of one-twentieth of his said salary for every completed year of service in excess of five such years, such pension to be continued during his life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the Section the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided always that there may be granted, if the Executive Council think fit, to any such Judge as aforesaid who vacates his office owing to permanent infirmity before having completed five years' service a pension not exceeding one-sixth of his salary at the time he vacates his office.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If Senators will look at Section 14 they will see that it is the pension section. After having completed five or more years service the judge is entitled to a pension, but he must serve his five years before he can be pensioned, and the words I propose to add would give power to deal with him if anything happened him in these first five years.  A judge is not appointed as a young man.  He has done a great part of his life's work before he becomes eminent enough to be appointed a judge.  You can see a man of great eminence at the Bar becoming a judge and his health breaking down altogether in the first five years.  He has been taken from his practice, and he is then entirely at the mercy of the country, and I do think that the Government of the day ought to have power if they think it right to give such a judge, if forced by ill-health to retire, one-sixth of his salary.  It is only discretionary, and to pass the Bill without such a clause might, in certain cases, inflict very great hardship which the Government would be powerless to relieve.  I should hope that this would appeal, both to the House and the Government, that they would not object to have power to confer what might be a great blessing, and at by no means a high price to the country at large.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would oppose the amendment because really the suggestion made that a judge at a certain age might take office and within a year or so become permanently disabled and <Col N="533" /> have to vacate that office, to my mind is putting the Executive in the position of having appointed a man who became permanently disabled within twelve months, and it is not a position in which I would like to be put if I were an Executive Minister.  I think the plea that a man becoming a judge at a certain age is dependent on the public for the remainder of his days, is hardly tenable, because if a man was worthy of becoming a judge at all I take it that after 50 or 60 years' service he would be in a position to be independent of any such consideration. Senator Jameson has pleaded on the ground of economy for one amendment: I suppose it is not wrong for me to make a plea for economy on another amendment.  I certainly do so.</P>

      <P>The possible effect of the clause, as it stands, would be that a man of eminence at the Bar on reaching a certain age would not be likely to risk the acceptance of a judgeship on the terms set out here.  None of us have a lease of life or good health. Men approaching that age are liable, possibly owing to their sedentary lives, to paralysis and apoplectic seizures and so forth, and a man foregoing practice at the Bar, even when he feels that he has reached an age when he can no longer sustain that practice, and certainly cannot increase it, says: &ldquo;I will leave this for a position that will bring me in much less revenue, although it may bring with it a certain amount of ease, but I take the chance.  If within a year or two any calamity occurs to me, I am left without any remedy, without the power even of earning a livelihood at the Bar as I do now, and without any compensation.&rdquo;  A man is appointed and he serves for four years.  Something happens to him, and he is rendered physically incapable of performing his duties in court.  He becomes permanently deaf, we will say, through a paralytic stroke, after four years, four and a half years, or four years and eleven months.  A month after, a colleague, who may have a similar unfortunate stroke, receives for that misfortune a retiring allowance of one-sixth of his salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there is a distinct case, but <Col N="534" /> apart from that, if a man did come forward to assist the administration of the country in this very high office, I do not think he ought to be subject to a fate such as that.  I think that every man reaching that time of life, with an eminent Bar practice, ought to have assured his position financially for the rest of his years.  That may not be always within his power.  His investments may have gone wrong, and with the very best intentions he may not find himself, even after a busy life, through various calls that are made on him in a good position, financially, and a pension would be a considerable consideration to him, particularly in keeping up the position and the prestige that is attached to him as a retired Judge of the High Court.</P>
    <P>We ought not to put ourselves in the position, or allow it to be said that the State should make such little provision and attach such little consideration to the services of these men in high offices, that when a calamity occurs, for which they have no control, they will be left derelict and in a state of penury, if not consigned to the workhouse.  I would be rather for the entire omission of that five years, so that when misfortune overtook a judge he would have at least one-sixth of his salary, £500, and the remaining period of his life would not be very long.  You may take it that that would not burden the State for many years, and it would enable him in some form to live in the condition of a man who occupied such a position.</P>

      <P>There is a very small question of economy involved in this. There are only eight Judges, five in the High Court and three in the Supreme Court, and the utmost pension any one of them could hope to get under this amendment, if it is carried, would be a sum of £500 a year, and as their numbers are very small it is very unlikely that you will have more than one or two of them drawing pensions at the same time.  If I am wrong the Attorney-General will be able to correct me, but I think I am right in saying that the section dealing with pensions for Circuit is similar to this amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Kenny, in support of this amendment, said that if a Judge's health broke down after one year's service he should be entitled to a pension.  I agree that every man or woman who gives useful service should, when their health breaks down, be entitled to a pension, but I object to any one particular class of the community receiving pensions when other people are debarred from receiving them.  On a former occasion, in this House, I called attention to a very glaring case of want of fair treatment to an employee of the Courts.  The Courts cannot be carried on without a competent Judge, but the other officials in the Court are equally necessary. A Judge's health would soon break down if there was not some woman to clean the Courts.  The case I called attention to was that of a woman who had been employed for 36 years continuously in the Courts and she was dismissed, at a fortnight's notice, with no pension.  I say if it is fair and just to pension one servant of the State it is equally fair and just to pension every servant of the State who gives good and faithful service. I have no objection in the world to the Judges receiving a fair pension on the completion of their service to the State, but there should be equity.  I have searched through this Bill, but not being a lawyer I cannot find any Section of this Bill to which I could move an amendment that would get in the point I want.  I am taking advantage of this opportunity to put my views before the House and I hope that the President, who I am satisfied has a sense of justice from my experience of him, and the Attorney-General, will be able to arrange that what is known as the unestablished staff should be treated in the same manner as those who are established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am arguing this case because of the fact that under this Bill Judges will be entitled to pensions.  Quite right.  If they give good and faithful service, by all means give them a fair pension when they have served the State well, but I say if it is just in one case it is equally just in another case. For that reason I hope that the President and the Attorney-General will take a note of this particular point and <Col N="536" /> see that the claim we are making on behalf of the people whose salaries during the time they are employed as servants of the State is not sufficient for them to provide for a rainy day is met.  People who are in the happy position of receiving a remuneration that allows them to put a little by for their old age are being pensioned and the people who are in the service at 24/- and 25/- a week cannot provide for the rainy day.  I am not in favour of the amendment as it is.  I suggest that if a Judge was not in the service of the State his health might break down just the same.  Five years service is provided in the Bill before a Judge is entitled to a pension, and I think that is fair and just, but the idea of saying that a Judge or any person with only twelve months' service is entitled to a pension is, I think, stretching it too far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. CUMMINS Mr. CUMMINS">

      <P>I have to oppose this amendment on the ground of equity and economy.  We hear much of economy nowadays.  I believe we are all disposed to put it into practice where we find it possible to do so, but it would appear that we are gone economy mad in some respects.  I am quite in agreement with the first speaker in saying that a judge under such conditions should be entitled to a generous reward, but I believe that that reward should not be confined to any class of public servants, and that a single class should not have the monopoly of it.  I belong to a class of public servants who can claim to have given excellent service to the State. We have hundreds of these men who, after twenty-five or thirty years' service, are either dying in workhouses or living on the charity of their friends. I believe that pensions, such as are proposed to be given to persons in high office, should, in the interest of justice and economy, be given to those who have an equal right in the matter.  I am loth to introduce this matter which is personal to a section of the community, but I think it is only fair that if this section is to be generously dealt with, other sections should be taken into consideration.  Again, this <Col N="537" /> leaves the Government open to the charge of doing things that would, perhaps, approach corruption.  For instance, a lawyer, perhaps, at a certain period of his life is known to be in ill-health. He is appointed a judge by the Executive Council, and in a year or two, not through any sudden change in his health, but in the ordinary course of events, he finds himself incapacitated, <Col N="538" /> and is given this pension after, perhaps, one year's service.  We can very easily conceive how the public in such circumstances would accuse the Government of doing something that was not right.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 22, line 63.  To delete the words &ldquo;including liability as to costs.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Section as it stands gives to the rule-making authority the power to make rules affecting the liability to costs.  The result of that might be, and probably would be, that the rule-making authority would make a hard and fast rule which would work injustice in certain circumstances.  It is better to have a statutory provision declaring a general rule as to the liability for costs, with a power to the judge who tries the case to rule otherwise.  The costs referred to are the costs between party and party which have to be paid by one side or the other at the end of the case.  As a general rule the costs of an action ought to follow the result. The spoils ought to go to the victor. But there are certain cases where that rule would work hardship, and does work hardship, in which the judge ought to have the power to deprive a successful litigant of his costs, owing, perhaps, to some conduct or hardship in the case or some equitable reason. The amendment takes the question as to liability for costs out of the jurisdiction of the rule-making authority, and by the Section which it is proposed to insert between Sections 91 and 92, <Col N="539" /> makes statutory provision as to the liability for costs.  That amendment is number 44, and reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Before Section 92.  To insert a new Section 92 as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding any rules of Court the costs of every civil action and every civil question and issue tried in the High Court or the Circuit Court shall follow the event unless the Judge at the trial shall otherwise order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is rather a technical matter, but speaking from my own experience of a very long number of years, it is better to have a rule of this kind definitely in the Statute, than to have it at the mercy of a rule-making authority, who might make a rule which would be so hard and fast that it would occasionally work injustice and hardship.</P>

      <P>I have been thinking very anxiously if the Seanad could meet the situation which has arisen.  I know it is the universal feeling in the Seanad that they would like to have the Attorney-General's views upon this question.  Therefore, I have been thinking over the matter and it occurred to me that we could very easily pass, as the first item in our business to-morrow, a new Standing Order conferring power upon the Seanad to invite any member of the Government, not necessarily a Minister, to attend and have audience with regard to any Bill he was interested in coming from his Department.  I do not pledge myself to the form of it, but I will undertake to draft it out this evening, and it can be moved to-morrow before we resume the consideration of this Bill in Committee.  If the Seanad sympathise with me in that it might, perhaps, be desirable to postpone the Committee Stage now and resume it again to-morrow after we have passed this Standing Order.</P>

I do not propose to go into the merits of any rival policy, because I am not competent to do so, but I do feel, that this being a matter not only of grave importance, but dealing with a totally new condition of affairs, owing to the advancement of science and the whole of the conditions being untried and to a certain extent problematical, it is extremely important that due deliberation should be exercised.  I have a feeling myself that the Government has taken the methods employed in England as a headline for future plans. I do not know that that would be altogether wise.  The matter should certainly be discussed so that due consideration should be given to this very important question.  Furthermore, in order that the two houses should exercise their sovereign powers in this matter, I should ask that an undertaking be given by the Government that no contractual liabilities should be incurred by the Government with any private citizen or corporation with respect to broadcasting operations without the consent of the Oireachtas.</P>

I know that has been debated in the other House, and that it has a bearing on the question of constitutional procedure, but on the facts indicated, it leaves one very uneasy that the door should be open, presumably to a subordinate Minister, to take action in a matter of this kind without consulting the Executive Council and to incur contractual obligations on behalf of the State, and deliberately adopt a policy.</P>
