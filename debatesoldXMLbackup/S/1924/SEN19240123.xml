      <P>The first matter upon the Orders of the Day is out of its order, and should be No. 2. You have to deal, in the first place, with the message from the Dáil intimating the fact that they had disagreed with the amendment made in the Seanad to the Fisheries Bill, 1923, Section 8, the amendment in question being on the Order Paper and reading as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert after this Section a new Section 9 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9. No penalty inflicted under this Act shall be reduced or remitted save on the recommendation of the Judge or Justice who imposes such penalty, and any recommendation for such reduction or remission shall be made at the same time as the penalty is imposed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The subject matter for the consideration of the Seanad is as to what action they will take in view of the rejection by the Dáil of this amendment.</P>

      <P>Before we enter upon the consideration of the action which the Seanad ought to take on this question of the disagreement of the Dáil with this amendment, I think, if I might make the suggestion without being out of order, that there is a very general feeling that a statement ought to be made by yourself from the Chair generally as to the relations between the two Houses under circumstances such as have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">

      <P>I had myself intended before the Seanad proceeded to discuss this matter to draw attention to certain statements made in the Dáil in reference to the action of <Col N="438" /> the Seanad, not with a view of discussing in any way the merits of the amendment itself, or for the purpose of in any way controlling or dictating or suggesting to the Seanad what course they should take with regard to it.  But I cannot, being here as the Chairman of this Seanad, and, consequently, entrusted with the maintenance, as far as it is in my power, of their privileges under the Constitution, allow to pass without reference a very exceptional and unusual charge that my good friend the Attorney-General made in the Dáil against members of this Seanad who supported this amendment. I will read now from the Official Report of the Dáil the statement to which I refer, and the Seanad will see that it amounts to this: that the Attorney-General charged this Seanad with having, for the indirect purpose of cutting in, as he described it, upon the constitutional prerogative of mercy of the Executive passed an amendment which they knew, or ought to have known, was foreign to the Bill, and which only could have been passed by them in order to enable them to carry out this indirect purpose that they had in view.</P>
      <P>When I read this charge first I came to the conclusion that my friend the Attorney-General had been playing a joke upon the Deputies of the Dáil, but, as I proceeded to read his further statements, it became perfectly plain that he was quite serious, and that he really meant to suggest that Senator Sir John Keane, with the assistance of other wild revolutionaries in this Seanad, like Senators Jameson, Barrington and Brown, was engaged in a conspiracy to destroy the Constitutional prerogative of mercy that is vested in the Executive.  Here is what he says, and I think there can be no doubt that I have correctly stated the matter.  I am reading now from the Official Report of the Dáil of the 11th January, 1924:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that this Bill does not contain any provision in regard to the appeals to the Executive, and that it does not contain any reference to any power, in any person, to remit, or vary, a sentence, and it is a remarkable fact, because this <Col N="439" /> amendment by the Seanad is not an amendment of anything in the Bill at all.  It is an attempt by the Seanad to effect a constitutional position outside the Bill as regards the remission of sentences and penalties. It is an attempt by the Seanad to cut in upon what is recognised, I think, in most countries, namely, that there must be some constitutional authority in the Executive to intervene where wrong is done or where a miscarriage of justice has taken place.</P>
    <P>He further develops that a little later on.  He says this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Now, this amendment of the Seanad is not properly an amendment of this Bill; it is an attempt by way of amendment to this Bill to amend the constitutional position as regards the over-riding authority to relief where a miscarriage may have occurred.</P>
    <P>Then he winds up with this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>.. The Dáil should realise that if it were to assent to that it would be assenting to an invasion of the Constitution and to a principle outside the Bill and to something that is not really an amendment of the Bill at all.</P>
    <P>That is a grave charge, and was supported by the Attorney-General by an ingenious and logical argument.  His argument shortly was this: These remissions under the Fisheries Acts, he says, have not been made by virtue of any Act of Parliament.  They have been made solely in the exercise of the constitutional prerogative that, under the British Constitution, enabled the Crown&mdash;he calls it the Executive, but it is the same thing&mdash;enabled the Executive to interfere whenever they were satisfied there was a miscarriage of justice.  Consequently, he says, and says quite logically, that you cannot correct or tamper with this prerogative by an amendment that does not touch anything that is in the Fisheries Acts, because the power of remission, not being conferred by the Fisheries Acts, but being part of the constitutional prerogative of the Crown, is not affected by the Bill, and, therefore, this amendment was not properly an amendment to the Bill at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> That is a purely logical position, and had the facts upon which he based it, been accurate and correct, I would have had no fault to find with it.  I shall show in a moment that he based it on a very amazing misconception of the law.  I wish, in the first place, to point out that he is dealing with what he calls remissions in the case of miscarriages of justice and with the constitutional privileges for the Executive to step in and correct these miscarriages of justice.</P>
    <P>I hardly think the Attorney-General, in view of the figures that have been published since this matter was before the Seanad, and since this amendment was passed&mdash;figures of a very startling character which show that out of 87 convictions the Executive interfered with 64&mdash;intended to represent that in these 64 cases there was a miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>Every individual, including every layman, knows what a miscarriage of justice is.  It is not of very frequent occurrence.  When such cases do occur they create great public comment&mdash;like the Beck case.  In the whole administration of the criminal law it is very seldom, indeed, that the prerogative of mercy has to be exercised by the Crown on the ground of a miscarriage of justice.  A miscarriage of justice means that the wrong man has been convicted, that there has been a case of mistaken identity, that there has been false evidence given, or that the Court has overlooked some Act of Parliament and has acted in violation of the law.  These are the familiar cases of miscarriage of justice.  Does anyone in the Seanad imagine that in any single instance in these 64 cases anything of that kind occurred?  I am speaking with large experience with regard to this matter, because during the years I was Lord Chancellor it was my duty to deal with these petitions. Hundreds of them passed through my hands, and when, in addition, in the absence of the Lord Lieutenant, I had to act as Lord Justice, I was compelled, as Lord Chancellor, to advise myself as Lord Justice, how I would deal with these petitions.  I venture to say this to the House, that never once in these hundreds of cases which have passed through my hands did a petition ever <Col N="441" /> come before me based on the allegation that there had been a miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>In all these fishery cases the men are caught red-handed.  They almost invariably plead guilty, and what happens then is that a petition, based on an appeal <i>ad misericordiam</i>, is sent up containing a number of representations, differing according to the character of the case.  In one case the petition asks for mercy on the ground of the extreme youth of the offender.  In another case it would be on the ground of his extreme old age.  Again, it would be on the ground that the offender is an unmarried man who has to support his sisters and mother.  The next case would be because he is married and with 15 or 16 children.  These are the sort of things that the Attorney-General describes as miscarriages of justice.  Certainly it is a very poor tribute to the District Justices that decided these 87 cases, to say that they so conducted 64 of them that they resulted in miscarriages of justice.  The thing is really ridiculous, because, as I have said, in no single case, except perhaps once in a lifetime, is a petition based on the allegation that there has been a miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>That, however, is a minor point, and I pass from it.</P>
    <P>I come to the gravamen of the charge made by the Attorney-General against the Seanad, namely, that they put forward a fictitious amendment which they knew was no amendment at all, in order to have a &ldquo;cut&rdquo; at the prerogative of mercy which is supposed to exist in the Executive.  What is the fact?  The Constitutional prerogative of mercy never at any time applied to penalties under the Fisheries Acts or similar Acts.  Never, at any time, and for this obvious reason.  These penalties under the Acts of Parliament are appropriated to parties other than the Crown.  The Crown does not get one penny out of them.  It is the duty of the magistrate when he imposes the penalty, under the Fisheries Acts, to distribute one-third of it to the informant, and the remaining two-thirds to the Conservators.  In the same way, under the elaborate licensing code we have, and under the smuggling code, <Col N="442" /> and in codes dealing with illicit distillation, the same thing happens.</P>
    <P>Penalties are earmarked for parties and persons other than the Crown.  For centuries it has been held that this prerogative of mercy, which the Attorney-General describes as the Constitutional authority for over-riding cases of miscarriage of justice, never extended to penalties of this class.  So much so, that in the fifth year of Queen Victoria's reign, when the Fisheries Act was passed, which applies to Ireland, an express provision was put in enabling the Lord Lieutenant for Ireland, and giving him statutory power, not to remit penalties, but to remit punishment that might be awarded in default of payment of the penalty.</P>
    <P>I would like to read that Section, because it brings clearly before your minds the point I am at.  These are the words of it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be lawful for the Lord Lieutenant to extend the right of mercy to any person imprisoned by virtue of this Act, although he shall be imprisoned for non-payment of money to some person other than the Crown.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You will observe that that Act did not extend to the penalties at all.  It gave no power to the Lord Lieutenant to remit penalties, but it did give him power to remit any period of imprisonment that was attached in default of payment of the penalties.  The next thing to notice about it is, that it is a power conferred by Parliament.  It is not a Constitutional prerogative.  It is a Parliamentary power conferred on the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland by Statute, and by Parliament, not by virtue of the prerogative.</P>
    <P>That was shortly after Queen Victoria came to the throne&mdash;five years afterwards&mdash;but a few years later the public mind became impressed by the fact that, notwithstanding that smuggling had become more or less a much rarer offence than it had been in the old days, the heavy penalties imposed by the Smuggling Act were still enforced, and no power was given to anybody to remit them, having regard to the fact that they were disposed of by Act of Parliament in favour of a third <Col N="443" /> party other than the Crown.  Parliamentary pressure was brought to bear, and in that year there was passed an Act called the Remission of Penalties Act.  I beg your special attention to this, because it is under this Act, and only under this Act, that all these 64 remissions could have been legally made.</P>
    <P>That Act consists of only one Section, which I will read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be lawful for His Majesty, or in Ireland for the Lord Lieutenant, to remit in whole or in part any sum of money which, under any Act now in force, or hereafter to be passed, may be imposed as a penalty or forfeiture, although such money may be payable in whole or in part to some party other than the Crown, and to extend the royal mercy to any person who may be imprisoned for non-payment of any such sum, although the sum may be payable to somebody other than the Crown.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, you notice how careful Parliament was.  When dealing with penalties it makes no reference to the royal prerogative, because it did not exist, but it gave statutory powers for the first time to the Lord Lieutenant, as representing the Crown in Ireland, to remit the penalties, so that the power under which these 64 remissions or reductions were made was not power under the prerogative, as the Attorney-General seemed to think, but was power under express statute conferred by Parliament.  The importance of that matter is this: It shows that the only legitimate or constitutional way in which the Seanad, if it wished to restrict that power, could possibly do it, would be by amendment of the law. Of course, it could not do it by seeking to control or restrict the prerogative, as it is preserved by the Constitution, but it being the power conferred by statute, and not by the prerogative, so far from this amendment being out of order and irrelevant, it was the only constitutional and legal way in which the Seanad could exercise its right to amend the law.  It is important that that should be made quite clear.  I am certain had the Attorney-General realised the true position, and that all <Col N="444" /> these remissions of penalties had their origin in an Act of Parliament giving statutory right, he would not have accused this Seanad of attempting to invade the prerogative of the Crown by passing this amendment.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I wish to refer.  I may be entirely wrong, and the matter will be, I am sure, cleared up in the course of the debate, but reading the statements of Ministers, the Minister of Fisheries and the Minister of Home Affairs in the Dáil, it seems to me, if I am correctly interpreting what they said, that these remissions have been made by the Minister for Home Affairs without reference to the Governor-General. I may be entirely wrong in that, and I hope I am, but if I read the statements of the Ministers correctly they undoubtedly conveyed such impressions, and if the impression is wrong, it is not my fault, but theirs. If I am right, and if I have gathered the right impression, and if these remissions had been made by the Minister for Home Affairs without reference to the Governor-General, then I respectfully say they have been improperly and illegally made, because the only person under the Statute who could make them is the Lord Lieutenant, and his constitutional powers have, under the Constitution as regards this particular matter, been transferred in express language to the Governor-General. Of course, had the Attorney-General been right, and had these remissions been made in the exercise of the prerogative of mercy, it is quite plain that nobody but the Governor-General could do it, just as nobody but the Governor-General could reprieve a prisoner from sentence of death.</P>
    <P>Had the Attorney-General's argument been right, it is clear that the only person in this country to-day who could exercise this power to remit, assuming it became a constitutional power of prerogative, is the Governor-General, but if I am right, and if it is a statutory power to be exercised wholly apart and independent of the prerogative of mercy, and without regard to it, even in that case, in my humble opinion, the only person in the country who could exercise it, of course, acting on the advice of the responsible <Col N="445" /> Minister, is the Governor-General, because the individual nominated by Parliament to do this work is the Lord Lieutenant, and, as I have said, the Constitution transfers these Executive powers of the Lord Lieutenant to the Governor-General.  All this, of course, may be purely a matter of speculation.  As I have said, I do not know what the exact facts are.  All I say is, that what was said by the Minister on the subject leaves the impression on my mind that the Minister for Home Affairs has been making these remissions without reference to the Governor-General.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down, may I say one other word?  It is no part of my province, and I have no right or desire to dictate to the Seanad in any way as to how they should deal with this position that has recently arisen by reason of the Dáil turning down their amendment. The Dáil were quite within their powers in turning it down on its merits, and I am not criticising their action in any way.  But if I may, perhaps, make a suggestion to the Seanad, I make it in the interests of maintaining the harmony and good relations that up to now have existed between the two Houses, because I should be very sorry, indeed, to see this issue precipitated between the two Houses, as to what is to happen when an amendment passed by the Seanad is turned down in the other House.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that perhaps the position might be met in this way.  I am glad to see the President is here.  While I have said that in one of those cases, except perhaps in a very unusual instance, one in a thousand, there has been no miscarriage of justice and no pretence of miscarriage of justice, at the same time it might not be desirable for the Seanad by any amendment to rule out the possibility of a miscarriage of justice. Therefore, I would suggest to the Seanad, as a reasonable way out, that they should preface the amendment they passed with those words, or words like them&mdash;&ldquo;Save and except in any case in which the Minister for Fisheries certifies that it has been proved to his satisfaction there has been a miscarriage of justice.&rdquo;  That is to say, I would preserve the power without limit of the <Col N="446" /> Executive, whether it be, as I suggest it ought to be, the Governor-General or anybody else, of intervening wherever there was clear proof that there had been a miscarriage of justice.  That, if added to the amendment, would enable, even though the magistrate made no recommendation when imposing the sentence, the Executive to interfere and remedy any case in which they came to the conclusion upon the facts that there had been a miscarriage of justice.  Of course, such a miscarriage would be one that arose at the trial and not dependent on facts, one that arose afterwards and communicated to the Executive behind the back of the prosecutor which are never decided in a Court and which are never the subject matter of cross-examination.  I mean facts that are urged in mitigation of the penalty.</P>

      <P>As the original mover of this amendment, I am gratified to find that in attempting to deal with what was generally recognised as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs, I did so in all ignorance, and yet in a constitutional manner.  There is another aspect of this case which appeals more especially to the lay mind, and on which I should like to comment. This issue, originated by me as a humble proposition, has assumed somewhat considerable importance, and I little thought when I first tabled this amendment that it would produce a startling discovery.  I refer more especially to the statement made in the other House since the amendment left this chamber.  This statement, on which I shall ask leave to comment, applies not only to the Fisheries Act, but to the administration of justice as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me go closer into it.  We start with the object of this Bill.  The object was, as the Minister said, to increase the penalties and to make the poachers pay for their fun.  We all agree with that, and my amendment was to make more certain that object. Poaching is a specially heinous crime in that it kills millions yet unborn&mdash;a valuable asset to the country.  It was an exceedingly hard case on which to sustain a prosecution.  The amendment was proposed by reason of the fact that <Col N="447" /> the Fisheries Acts had been imperfectly administered in the past.  The penalties were there, but such was the action of the Executive that a very large number of remissions took place to the discredit of the law and the advantage of the poacher.  The Minister for Fisheries, whose object was to make poachers pay, opposes this amendment. I should like to read his words from the journal of this Seanad of the 1st of December, page 184:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The present procedure is this: The magistrates inflicted the fine, and the recommendations of the Justices were sent to the Home Affairs Department, and that Department referred the matter to me.  I made inquiries from the local Board of Conservators, and I made my recommendations. You may take it that the recommendations of the Fisheries Department were usually against remission, except the circumstances were very exceptional.  We usually recommend that the law should take its course, and I think that for the future you will find that the recommendations of the Minister of Fisheries will be the last word as the governing authority for remission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  In the debate in the Dáil on the 11th January, page 116, the Minister for Fisheries gives us this information:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the year 1923 there were 87 convictions.  In 73, or 84 per cent. of these, the District Judge recommended the mitigation of the sentence. In 42 cases of these 87, that is 48 per cent. of them, the Minister for Fisheries supported the recommendation of the District Judge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And here is a curious thing:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In 64 of these cases, or 73 per cent. of them, the Minister for Home Affairs&rdquo;&mdash;presumably on the advice of the Governor-General&mdash;&ldquo;actually interfered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The District Judge revises his own judgment in 84 per cent. of the cases. You get the Minister for Fisheries disagreeing with the District Judge in 42 cases out of 73, and you get the Minister for Home Affairs disagreeing with the Minister for Fisheries in 22 cases, and with the District Judge in 9 <Col N="448" /> cases.  I never saw such an extraordinary conglomeration of contradictions. Mark the consequence.</P>
    <P>You have poaching, a scandal, admitted. You have the present measures alleged to be inadequate.  You have a Bill before you for the purpose of strengthening those measures, and yet 73 per cent. of the penalties are revised. While that state of affairs is at such a pass, what is the object of giving extended powers to the Executive? I would view the holding up of this Bill for nine months with the greatest equanimity.  All that is required is to enforce the present penalty.  The present minimum penalty is 10/-.  Let us make the best use of that before we seek extended powers which, if the same practice is to follow, will be imperfectly used.</P>
    <P>Now, we come to what the objections to this amendment are.  One objection is that it serves to make a judge a judge, and to prevent a judge from being an <i>alter ego</i> of himself able to revise his own decisions.  And it is also opposed in that it does not prevent a miscarriage of justice.  You, Sir, have dealt with that, and I shall not refer to it any further.  With regard to these objections, I should like to deal with an important statement made in the other House by the Minister for Home Affairs, and it is so important I shall ask that I may be allowed to read it in extenso.  It is the 11th of January, 1923, page 120.  The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a routine.  The petition or the representation that is made is invariably sent for comment to the Judge or Magistrate who tried the case, and this comment is invariably acted upon.  There is a factor that the Deputy quite definitely ignored&rdquo;&mdash;that is, referring to Deputy Figgis, who was the previous speaker&mdash;&ldquo;and it is this: it is by no means an uncommon thing for a Judge or Magistrate, hearing a case, to pass sentence, adverting rather to its effect upon the public mind than that the sentence would be fully served by the person upon whom it was passed.  A particular offence is committed and it may be rife in a particular area, and the Judge trying the case, adverting to that fact, would impose a particularly severe <Col N="449" /> and stringent penalty, being quite prepared to consider any petition or representation that would be made to him at a later date and to advise the Executive to remit, or partially remit, the fine or sentence of imprisonment as the case might be.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is quite a common thing, and judges and magistrates, in reply to petitions that have been forwarded them, have frequently stated to my Department&rdquo;&mdash;and mark these words&mdash;&ldquo;that they were glad the petitions had been sent, as they recognised at the time of the trial that there were mitigating circumstances, but having regard to the effect on the public mind, they considered it necessary to impose an exemplary sentence.  The Seanad amendment, which the Deputy eloquently supports, rules out the possibility of that; no sentence passed by a District Judge can be altered save on representations made by the District Justice at the time&rdquo;&mdash;I would like you to mark these words&mdash;&ldquo;It is always possible that new facts, facts that were not put in in evidence at the trial, will be brought forward and substantiated by special representations to the Executive.  When that happens these representations are sent to the judge or magistrate who tried the case.  He then takes cognisance of these fresh facts which were not before him at the trial, and he sends his advice to the Executive. Invariably the Executive acts on this advice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I would like very briefly to examine the portions of these words that I have stressed.  The first is that the recommendation of the Justice or Judge &ldquo;is invariably acted upon.&rdquo; According to the statement made by the Minister for Fisheries, the Judges have recommended mitigation in 84 per cent. of cases; the Minister for Home Affairs acted in 73 per cent of the cases.  &ldquo;The effect of the sentence on the public mind.&rdquo;  I hope, really, that the Minister for Home Affairs is not representing the true state of mind of the District Justice, for I do not think that is a fair representation of any man who has to act in a judicial capacity.  Examine that for one <Col N="450" /> moment.  A prisoner is brought forward who is a prominent man in his connection or in his political association, or the relation of a prominent man.  If a Judge is going to act, as is suggested, with regard to the effect on public opinion, where will he be?  I can quite conceive that a sentence of imprisonment, or a fine, on the relation, say, of a prominent member of this Government, or a prominent opponent of the Government may have a very serious effect on the public mind.</P>
    <P>Surely it is not suggested that any Judge allows things of that kind to influence him when he is trying a case or when he is considering his judgment, and the political effect of that sentence or any sentence may have an important effect on the public mind.  Is it seriously suggested that Judges should give any weight, or should be encouraged to give any weight, to considerations of that kind?  Then the power to revise: if a Judge is going to have power, as he had in 84 per cent of these cases last year, to revise a sentence, naturally what would we, as ordinary jurymen, say, regarding the effect on him when he is hearing it?  Surely it must make for laxity.  He would say: &ldquo;Well, I will not be careful about this case, because if I have scamped certain evidence or excluded certain evidence that is germane it does not matter when hearing the case, because I have power to revise it.&rdquo; I think it is deplorable to suggest that influences of that kind should affect the administration of justice.  Even admitting that it is confined to fisheries it is bad enough, but if you accept that spirit in the mind of a Judge how can you confine it in practice to fisheries?  It will become part and parcel of his mentality and the same attitude will guide him in all his actions on the bench.</P>
    <P>The next sentence I wish to refer to is: &ldquo;He is glad a petition has been sent.&rdquo;  The Minister for Home Affairs, the future Minister for Justice, said the Judges are glad, or expressed themselves in many cases as glad, that these petitions have been sent.  It is very unpopular to give judgments in many of the cases and it is surely highly undesirable that in any way a Justice should have the power of welcoming an opportunity, or that it <Col N="451" /> would be suggested that he welcomed an opportunity, to revise decisions which he should make with all deliberation. Then, further, the amendment of the Seanad rules out such possibility of the Judge's cultivating the mentality which I have described.  I am very glad that it does rule out such a possibility and for that reason I hope that this amendment, in its essence, will be preserved.</P>
    <P>Another objection to the amendment is that it excludes consideration of new facts.  Now, it strikes me that what is ignored in this whole matter is the fact that the public is a party to these cases.  There is the Crown, you might say, on one side, there is the litigant, and there is the public, and surely the public has the right that these people should be tried, so far as possible, in open court, and that no possibility of fresh evidence, without cross-examination, without any means of verifying its credibility and without subjecting it to the searching test of the laws of evidence, should weigh in the revision of sentences.</P>
    <P>I have been in courts as a layman and heard the most extraordinary astute discussions on the question of the admissibility of evidence, and surely that must serve a purpose.  I have been surprised at how evidence has been ruled out on what appears to a layman to be rather unreasonable grounds, but if the law has any purpose every effort should be made to prevent evidence which has not been tested in open court influencing legal decisions.  If the facts and the mentality of the impression of the judicial procedure are in any way connected it is a deplorable state of affairs.  We have always been taught to believe that justice is blind, and that the Judge cultivates the attitude by long training, to exclude from his mind all irrelevant matter when he tries a case, and I understand eminent judges do achieve that purpose.  It is a cultivated sense and it comes as a great shock to me to realise that that is not the ordinary practice and that all kinds of considerations of the general effect on the public mind are present in the Judge's mind.  Instead of justice being what is called blind it would appear from <Col N="452" /> this that it is cross-eyed.  It does seem that even to admit that any such mentality does pervade the judiciary is also to admit the prostitution of the great and solemn functions of the Judiciary. I should be perfectly prepared, as the mover of this amendment, to accept any qualifications such as you, sir, suggested that will ensure that a miscarriage of justice can be prevented.  In conclusion, I would say that the present measures, if enforced, are adequate if they are only administered, and I view with no concern any action of this House that would hold up the period of this Bill for nine months in order to vindicate the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EarlofMayo" hpid="The EARL of MAYO The EARL of MAYO">
      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with the greatest attention, sir, to your speech on the explanation of the whole of the Statutes on which this Bill was framed, and also to the way in which you explained to us how the Remission of Penalties Act came into force.  The first thing that I wish to ask and to make clear is: was the Remission of Penalties Act taken over with certain other English Laws by the Irish Executive and adopted by that Executive?  If so, that of course gave them the power of this Remission of Penalties.  This has been discussed at some length by you, sir, in the Seanad, and I have the amendment here before me.  I may be quite wrong, but I should like to ask also if this amendment is insisted upon by the Seanad, is this the only case in the existing laws of our country in which there is no appeal, because if that is the case that is a very serious position.  I have been told that if this amendment is insisted upon that that will be the case.  I do not know, reading it, if there is an appeal.  If there is an appeal I am wrong, and I should like to have pointed out to me how that appeal will work, and who will deal with it.  You pointed out, sir, that the prerogative of the Crown under the Remission of Penalties Act was guaranteed under those circumstances, and was brought about by the excessive penalties which existed under the smuggling laws.  Those who have read the history of that time can quite understand the reason for that, and, so to speak, hooked on to that were those other <Col N="453" /> penalties which were enforced with regard to the penalties inflicted by those who dealt with the fishery laws.  I said, I think, when speaking on this before, that I think personally that really in this domestic legislation this is not a serious enough matter for a contention of such a serious nature between the two Houses when we are commencing our new life under the present Government.  I do not wish to say anything more, but that is my personal experience, and when you come to a great question of policy, altering the whole life of a nation, then there could be disagreements between the two Houses, but surely not on a Fishery Bill where a man takes a salmon or a trout.  I deprecate such a division of opinion between the two Houses at the outset of our career.</P>

      <P>Before saying a few words on the general question I should like to clear up Senator Lord Mayo's mind on the question as to whether there is an appeal from a fine under the Section mentioned in our amendment in the Fisheries Act as there is in every other Act where cases are tried on summary jurisdiction before a Justice.  There is an appeal at present to the County Court Judge who is a trained lawyer used to considering questions of law and fact.  Under the Bill, which we will be considering later on, there is an appeal to the new Circuit Court, and a better Court of Appeal than the new Circuit Court, with the learned Judges who are to preside over that, I cannot conceive.  So that Lord Mayo can be quite satisfied that the unfortunate poacher who is fined £10 with the alternative of three months imprisonment, will have the absolute right of appeal to a perfectly competent tribunal.  But the sending back of this Bill from the Dáil with the intimation that they cannot agree with us in this amendment makes our duty a very serious one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to consider whether this amendment of ours is of sufficient importance, is sufficiently necessary, is so necessary, in fact, to the success of this Bill and the administration of justice under this Bill, that we ought to adhere to it.  The object of this amendment was to prevent the practice of the <Col N="454" /> remission of penalties under these Fisheries Acts, a remission of penalties which, as Sir John Keane has shown, has become a farce.  The figures which have been given in the Dáil, and given to you by the Chairman and Sir John Keane, are proof positive as to the necessity for this amendment.  It was a revelation to me to know that out of 87 cases of convictions under the Fisheries Acts there were as many as 64 cases in which the penalties were actually reduced.  I had no idea that the administration of the Fishery Laws in the Free State was conducted with that result, and, therefore, the necessity for that amendment is absolutely proved.  The only question, therefore, for the Seanad is whether there are any reasons sufficiently strong why an amendment, which is necessary for the due administration of this Act, should not be carried into effect.</P>
    <P>Three reasons were given to the Seanad, with two of which our Chairman has dealt&mdash;the question of prerogative and the question of a miscarriage of justice.  I do not think it is necessary for me to say another word about those.  I think, however, that Sir John Keane was, perhaps, not quite fair to the Minister as to the third argument he used&mdash;namely, as to the reason for the imposition of a higher penalty which was not intended to be ultimately exacted.  I really think he did not take the meaning correctly of what the Minister said.  I think what the Minister meant was that the Judge very often, when trying a case like this, wants to impress the public with the enormity of the crime, and he proceeds to make a victim of the prisoner, and inflicts a heavier sentence than he afterwards intends to be carried into effect, for the purpose of impressing the public mind with the heinousness of the crime.</P>
    <P>If that is what they are at, I cannot imagine any worse mode of administering justice.  I cannot imagine any worse impression being made on the public mind than by giving a sentence to a man for the purpose of impressing the public, with a knowledge which the public shares with the magistrate that it is going to be reduced.  Therefore, I <Col N="455" /> am perfectly satisfied that it would be the duty of this House to insist on this amendment.  It has been sent back to us with reasons, which&mdash;with the one exception of the necessity of giving the Executive power to set right an absolute miscarriage of justice&mdash;have no validity&mdash;reasons which, I think, ought not affect the mind of the Seanad.  At the same time, I realise, as Senator the Earl of Mayo does, the importance of having no conflict between the two Houses which we could avoid.  Perhaps I ought not use the word conflict in connection with an occasion such as this, because, in the true sense, there can be no conflicts between the two Houses.  All of us are doing our best to make legislation that comes before us as perfect as we can for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>We will differ from time to time as to the best means of doing that, and from time to time perhaps this Seanad will have to insist on the right which it has of dealing with legislation for the purpose of bettering, if we can.  Though we may differ, and do differ, still all the time we are co-operating for the good of the country.  I am as anxious as anybody, if possible, that the country should not lose the benefit of this important little piece of legislation, if it can be avoided.  I am as anxious as anyone that disagreement between the two Houses on this matter should be healed up, and I am of opinion it can be done by means of the amendment to our amendment, which has been suggested by the Chairman.  If the Dáil is willing to take this Bill with our amendment, as amended in that way, I would be strongly of opinion that the Seanad ought to consent to such amendment. It will not give away any principle that is of any use to the Seanad. At the same time, it will enable this Bill to be brought into force months before it would otherwise be brought in, and it would certainly be a great benefit to the country.</P>

      <P>I have listened with considerable interest to the argument brought forward by you.  I also feel that the great test which possibly may come between us one day ought not to <Col N="456" /> come now.  I feel with Senator the Earl of Mayo that this particular amendment is not of sufficient importance upon which to force an issue.  It seems to me that the method adopted by the Dáil which refers a particular amendment back to a Committee might meet the particular case before us now.  I am not sufficiently conversant with procedure to say whether we have power to refer this particular amendment back to a Committee.  The Dáil assumed we have, and acting on that assumption, I would suggest that this amendment would go back to the same Committee that is to consider a previous amendment. I mean, if it is legal for the Dáil to so recommend, it ought to be legal for us to so recommend.</P>

      <P>Let there be no ambiguity.  That message had no relation in any shape or form to this amendment.  That message is in connection with an amendment to the Franchise Act, which is next on the Order Paper.  It had no reference to this Bill, nor to this particular amendment. In the case of the other amendment the Dáil did not turn it down. They passed no resolution accepting or rejecting it, but sent us a message asking to have it referred to a Committee. That is the position.</P>

      <P>I thank you for the correction.  I thought this particular amendment was treated in the same manner as the first one.  I must then withdraw my suggestion, as apparently it is not tenable.  Apparently we have no power to commit this amendment to any particular Committee.  I would like if we had the power to do so, as the new facts of the situation that you have evolved in the course of your elaborate argument seem to me to have been misunderstood by the Dáil.  I feel that if the Dáil understood these particular <Col N="457" /> matters they would not have rejected our amendment but would have accepted it more particularly with the addition to which Senator Sir John Keane now agrees, to preserve the prerogative of mercy in cases where there is a miscarriage of justice. If that suggestion be made I would support it.  If not, it would be incumbent on me to support the amendment as it stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">

      <P>May I explain, as I think it is important, the Seanad should know what their position is as to the powers they have to deal with this amendment notwithstanding the fact that it has been rejected by the other House?  We have no provision precisely regulating our practice on an occasion of this kind under our Standing Orders.  Therefore, I am prepared to rule in the absence of anything in the Standing Orders that restricts us from doing it, that it is quite in the power of the Seanad to repeat their amendment, with any addition or alteration in it they think fit, and send that back to the Dáil, informing the Dáil, that on reconsideration of the amendment, they have altered it and submitted it in its altered form.  That is my view of the Constitutional position as it at present stands, and in the absence of anything in the Standing Orders controlling it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not for one moment saying that this is the Constitutional practice in another place.  I do hope that the Seanad will agree with me when I say that I think these references to Constitutional usage elsewhere are out of place in an assembly like ours where we are starting our new existence.  In my experience extending over very many years in another place I invariably found that these so-called Constitutional usages were always invasions of the private rights of private members. I should advise the Seanad to hesitate long and carefully before they ever allow themselves to be allured by the suggestion that in another place the Constitutional practice is so-and-so. Let us, if we are going to establish a practice of our own, see that it is on record, and put it in our Standing Orders so that it cannot be the subject <Col N="458" /> of controversy or dispute.  Up to the present there is nothing in my opinion in our Standing Orders which disentitles the Seanad, in the situation it is confronted with to-day, from adhering to their amendment with alterations, so that the amendment as altered may go back to the Dáil and the Dáil may possibly say: &ldquo;This is a reasonable alteration, it is getting rid of our difficulties, and we will now accept the amendment in its altered form.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no Standing Orders dealing with the situation, and we are in the fortunate position, therefore, of being able to do exactly as we please.  I am very anxious that this Bill should pass into law because I think it is a good Bill, well designed and calculated to improve Irish fisheries.  I think that you, sir, and Senator Brown have made it perfectly clear where this assembly stands on the constitutional point.  I do not think it is necessary for us to take up that line of argument, or to prove, as we know quite well, that we have no intention or desire in any shape or form to raise any issue whatever, constitutionally or otherwise, between the two Houses.  We took the Bill as it was sent to us.  We thought it a good Bill.  We gave it our blessing, but thought that perhaps we might improve it a little.  In our endeavours to do so, and to do away with what was unquestionably a very serious defect in the administration of the Fisheries Acts, it may be that we walked on some people's corns.  At all events we were not quite as successful as we desired to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that when we hear from the Government on the subject of the proposed amendment possibly we may find an easy way out of the difficulty. Obviously we are all at heart concerned in the same thing, both in this Seanad and in the Dáil: the wish to see this useful Bill carried into law as soon as possible.  It may be that the addition to our amendment which has been suggested might remove the difficulty that is in front of us.  What this assembly does not like, and no assembly would like, is to have a pistol put at its head and told it has got to do what other people think it ought to do.  If <Col N="459" /> one is asked in a polite way to do anything of course one does it to the limit of reason and even beyond reason.  It is quite another matter when you are found fault with for a crime that you certainly never intended to commit, especially when it is a question of such vast importance as this which has arisen.  We are waiting to hear from the President and if the President, as he very often does, comes amongst us with an olive branch, possibly our discussion will come to a speedy and satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LOVE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I said first. I will leave the law, sir.  All our trouble arose, if you do not mind my saying so, from a little law on the last occasion. Senator Brown gave his cradle song on that occasion and told us, amongst other things, that he thought one or two rivers opened in the North of Ireland. He is quite right in saying that two open there.  He went from that to the South-West and told us that the rivers he knew best there all open upon the 15th January.  He did not tell us how many there were or whether all the rivers in Kerry opened then or not; <Col N="460" /> whether they opened for angling or for net fishing.  That was the last speech before Senator Sir J. Keane wound up the debate.  Senator Sir J. Keane was evidently in a generous mood, and he was rather inclined to withdraw the amendment.  He said: &ldquo;I would feel disposed to withdraw the amendment, but Senator Brown has shown us there was no real validity in the argument, as the close season is nearly over.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Previously in the Debate I said that all the rivers in Ireland would be open upon February 1st, and I hold I was absolutely right in that, with the exception, perhaps, of one or two rivers he spoke of.  In other words, when we were debating this on December 20th there were at least six weeks of the season still to go.  It seemed to be in the mind of Senator Brown that those last six weeks were really of no importance. Anybody who understands the commercial side of salmon-fishing&mdash;and I have thirty years' experience of it&mdash; knows very well that that is the poachers' hey-day, because poached salmon have no value until they can be exposed on the market.  It is when the one or two rivers in the North of Ireland, and some in Scotland, open, that an enormous value is given to salmon, which fetches on the London market anything from 20s. to 25s. per lb. Naturally there would be an inducement to a man who would have a starving family or a vicious conscience to have a shot at some fish.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, most of the poaching that occurred on the Shannon was done by a gentleman who was described in Cork by the solicitor to the Board of Conservators as &ldquo;a bird of passage.&rdquo;  He first had a shot at it up at Athlone, came from that to the lower Shannon, and from that to the fair banks of the Lee.  He was eventually caught, as he deserved, and was fined in sums amounting to hundreds of pounds, and was put in gaol.  At the time this occurred Sir Hamar Greenwood had hold of the country and somehow or other, although it was hard to get out then, this man was allowed to get out.  He got away to the other side, but I hear he is paying us a visit at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to point out is that the <Col N="461" /> Senator was wrong in assuming that these last months in the year made no difference to the salmon fishing.  They are the most important time, when the inducement is there.  I am sorry that Senator Sir J. Keane did not continue in the generous mood in which he was and withdraw the amendment, because it really is a small thing for us to get into a conflict over with the Dáil.  It is not a vital matter as the close season is practically over now.  The Bill is important for the purpose of preserving spawning salmon, and I am in total agreement with it.  In Ireland we differ from England in this respect, that the English rivers have become poisoned by the deleterious matter coming from the factories.  That is the reason the English salmon fisheries have gone down so much.  At one time the river Tyne used to yield £200,000 worth of salmon yearly.  I saw in the &ldquo;Freeman's Journal&rdquo; some time ago that 1,400 fish were taken at a catch from one of our rivers&mdash;the Bann.  That catch was taken in the middle of the 18th century.  This salmon fishing of ours is very important, and the Bill is really a good one.  We are all agreed with that, even Senator Sir J. Keane. I would have agreed with his amendment if it were not for the fact that law is not always justice.  I instanced many cases where wrongs occurred.  I showed the enormity of what they endeavoured to impose upon the fishermen. I showed that they really created a state of affairs to which I am opposed as a layman.  I do not think that any Act of this Oireachtas should confuse the difference between right and wrong.</P>
    <P>They should not infringe the sanctions of religion and State by creating crimes which in themselves are not sins. These bye-laws were made at the time by people who had very little knowledge of them, as most of these Conservators know very little about fishing. I think the time has come when people interested in the matter should have some control over it.  I believe that we are different from England in as much as if we have not had the same industrial development in this country we have left one of our potential sources of income, and that is our salmon fishing. <Col N="462" /> If this Bill were passed it would help to accomplish all these things, and I say that we should not prevent anybody from doing what he has an undoubted right to do.  Even under Magna Charta the common rights of fishing were observed.</P>

There ought to be some motion before the Seanad to bring the matter to an issue, and perhaps Senator Jameson, before he concludes, will formally move a motion in one of those forms that occurs to him to be the proper one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what was in my mind.  Before we ask any Minister to reply, as Sir Thomas Esmonde seemed to wish, I think the Seanad should be clear what its opinion is.  I would propose now that we re-enact Senator Sir John Keane's amendment, with the addition which you have suggested, that is to say: &ldquo;Save and except in any case in which <Col N="463" /> the Minister for Fisheries certifies that it has been proved to his satisfaction that there has been a miscarriage of justice.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes: &ldquo;No penalty under the Fisheries (Ireland) Acts shall be reduced,&rdquo; etc.  I think the Seanad understands what the meaning of that would be.  I would suggest, both to the Seanad and to the Ministry, that that is a wise course to follow in dealing with this matter.  There is no question whatever as to what both this Seanad and the Dáil and, I believe, the Ministry are really endeavouring to accomplish by this Act. They do want undoubtedly to improve the fisheries and stop poaching.  That the Bill is a good one I have not the slightest doubt.  If it was applied, as the present Fisheries Acts have been applied during the year 1923, I doubt if the Bill will be much good, even if we pass it without our amendment. Undoubtedly the information that has been afforded both by the Minister for Fisheries and the Minister for Home Affairs shows that the fisheries were ruined before the Free State came into existence, and when under the control of the Lord Lieutenant, by the remission of fines, and that that still goes on.  We have done some good by drawing the attention of the Ministry to the fact that we are thoroughly persuaded that to name great penalties, to inflict them, and then to let off the poachers and criminals, is almost worse than inflicting no penalty at all.  I think that anybody who has had anything to do with the law, even in a small way, knows that if there is a current belief that sentences once inflicted will certainly have to be served and fines have to be paid, most undoubtedly the gentlemen who are going to test the validity of the law will be careful what they do.  If they believe that they can get off by petitions, as they have done up to now, we may pass all the Acts we like, and they will not have the slightest effect.  Holding that belief, I think the Seanad ought to re-enact their amendment, but I think they <Col N="464" /> ought to do their very best to meet what, so far as one is able to understand by the statements in An Dáil, are the real feelings of the Dáil.  It is being said that they would be called upon to see an injustice done without any means of remedying it, but I believe your amendment would undoubtedly meet that.  As the real accusation against anything the Seanad has done has been entirely based on the statement that our amendment will cause miscarriage of justice being done, and if that is the case against the amendment, undoubtedly the alterations which I am suggesting will meet it.  I cannot see how the Seanad can entirely withdraw this amendment, because it is vital, in our opinion.  We have ample proof of its necessity, and I think the Seanad would be stultifying itself if it withdrew from the position which it took up, and which it would have to do if the amendment were withdrawn altogether.  I am convinced that this is a good thing, because the Minister for Fisheries has told us that this is a temporary Bill, and that he was going to have the whole fishery law codified before the next close season, and that under these circumstances, this Bill, if not passed at once, is of little or no use.  I hope that the Minister will not go back on his promise to codify the fishery law, and that this Bill will be altered and that if another Bill is introduced it will be passed before the next close season.</P>

I am, however, concerned with the general position with regard to this particular Bill.  I did not think, listening to the case, that there is any substantial support for this particular amendment.  The facts as elicited here appear to me to be these.  There were, it is stated, 87 convictions.  There were more than 87 convictions.  In 87 cases there were appeals from the convictions made.  I think your Lordship said you wondered how the District Justices felt, when they saw their judgment had been modified in something like 64 cases out of those.  As a matter of fact, out of 87 cases in which appeals were lodged. <Col N="465" /> in 73 cases the District Justices recommended modification, and of those 64 were agreed to by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad you have corrected my misinterpretation. In considering any modification of the decision of the District Justices, one must remember how minimum penalties were enforced in the first instance.  I take it there were unpaid Magistrates who might be subject to local influences and who had to have something below which they could not go, and on account of which they might afterwards recommend reductions.  The same case for minimum penalties does not prevail when we have appointed paid District Justices of the State, who are independent of any of those influences. The fact is that that was our intention. Owing to the importance of putting down this matter of poaching, we have put in minimum penalties, and have reserved the right, sought to be taken from us, of reviewing certain cases. In all the cases there were more than 87 convictions.  There were 87 convictions from which appeals were made.</P>

      <P>The fact is then made clear that there were more than 87 convictions.  In any case, if there were only 87, and the District Justice had recommended reduction to 73 cases, it does not follow that there is so much importance in this amendment that it is considered necessary to hold up the operation of this Bill through the most important months of the year.  That is a regrettable fact, but it is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is with regard to the amendment.  Before we come to the amendment, I should say that your Lordship has made somewhat secure a position which would have been, perhaps, very insecure.  There are such cases.  I have known of one case, and I have heard of another.  I believe there are many more on record where persons occupying the exalted position of Judges on the Bench would make no departure from a decision they would give because in some cases they were not even in a mental position to give a decision.  There were some cases like that.  I know that there was in Dublin at least one case in which an absolutely unfair decision was given by a Judge. I do not think the Judge was competent to give a decision at that time in that case.  Were that decision to stand, I am certain that a man of unsound mind would not recommend the mitigation of his sentence.  Your Lordship's amendment deals with that case, but it has this infirmity, that the Minister for Fisheries, who is not the Minister for Justice, is to be the person who would advise as to whether there is a miscarriage of justice.  I do not think the Dáil would accept the amendment or the amended amendment.  I regret that occasions should arise in which a Bill of the importance of this Bill is lost in the most important and useful month of the <Col N="467" /> year and that then it should be held up for a long period.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest, in view of the circumstances that have arisen, and particularly in view of the possible precedent that may be created in the relationships between the two Houses that the more proper course would be by way of inserting an amendment which would meet with the approval of the Seanad.  That will then go for consideration to the Dáil, and it does not later preclude us from accepting or possibly inserting a further amendment which will meet the case.  I think there has been a tendency to assume that because the Dáil disagrees with an amendment we have accepted, there is a crisis between the two Houses, and to magnify a difference of opinion which it is quite possible in the case of a measure going from one House to another might possibly be adjusted after discussion.  I should like also to suggest that particularly in view of the fact that this is a Bill promoted by a Minister who is not a member of the Executive, that the Dáil will on party lines be able to vote on the matter, it is clearly a case in which it should be returned with the suggested amendment which we approve of, enabling it to come back almost immediately.</P>

I think there is an issue affecting the working of the Constitution in this matter, and I do not think that in the matter of the passing of amendments from one House to another it is either wise or, I think, fair, to ask the Minister to <Col N="469" /> come here and say he will accept it, when there will be a full opportunity of having it returned to us, particularly as this is a measure not promoted by the Executive.  It is a much better method for us to make our suggestion in the manner provided, and send it back to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested that the fishery laws are to be codified within the next twelve months. If that is the case, this is a mere temporary and passing Bill, and is not the whole question raised a storm in a teacup? The spawning season is half over. Anything we can do in regard to this particular Bill is as good as past, and I take it, whether we press our amendment, or the Dáil accepts some change in the amendment, very little real good will come from it.  There has been so much discussion on the subject that I imagine the Minister and the Dáil understand what is required from us here, is some ratification of this particular clause, and I think if the Bill is to be codified afterwards and the whole fishery question brought into a series, it would be quite time then to amend this particular clause, possibly, in the particular way that the Seanad is anxious that it should be done.</P>

      <P>There is one matter I would like to take out of the region of doubt.  It is in connection with the appeals for the remission of penalties under the Fisheries Acts in the year 1923.  There were 87 appeals for remission.  All of these were forwarded to the District Justices who tried the cases, for their recommendations.  In 73 of those cases the District Justices recommended the remission, and 64 out of those 73 recommendations for remission from the District Justices' decisions were actually granted by the Executive, so that so far from it being the case that remissions were granted in a greater number of cases than the District Justices recommended, in fact as there were nine less remissions of penalties than were recommended by the District Justices.</P>

      <P>The next matter, I regret to say, is a much more important one, and it arises in reference to the action of the Dáil in regard to an amendment that was inserted in this House in the Electors' Registration Bill of 1923.  The Dáil have not either accepted or rejected that amendment, but have sent a message to the effect that it is desirable that a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad be appointed to consider the procedure in regard to amendments made by the Seanad, and I regret that, before I ask the House to discuss or consider this, it is really absolutely essential for me to call attention to certain matters that occurred and to certain representations that were made, and claims put forward, in the Dáil, because these claims are now on record on the journal of the Dáil and, if not challenged or taken up in this House, will effectively destroy&mdash;I say this deliberately&mdash;will effectively destroy any useful power for amendment, by way of legislation or otherwise, <Col N="471" /> that this House possesses under the Constitution.  That is a strong statement to make but I propose to justify it by informing the House of the claims that were, in fact, put forward by responsible persons in the Dáil when this matter came up there for consideration.</P>
      <P>I regret to have, in the first instance, to deal with a complaint&mdash;in my humble judgment a very unfair and unreasonable complaint&mdash;that was made by the Minister for Local Government, in reference to what he called &ldquo;the way in which Ministers were treated in the Seanad.&rdquo;  Now, I have heard the President speak very often in terms of very gracious courtesy and thanks to the Seanad for the consideration that was invariably extended to him here.  I have heard other Ministers do the same, and I think we were not undeserving of that compliment, and for this reason, speaking for myself, I have gone out of my way to consult the convenience of Ministers on all occasions.  I have communicated with them privately to find at what particular stage of our meetings they would like particular business to be taken up.  I have arranged, or disarranged, our programme to meet them, and actually, on other occasions when they had been obliged to leave in the middle of a debate, I have induced the House, and they were willing to do so, to let matters stand over for a while to await the return of the Ministers.  So that on every occasion I think I am entitled to say that this House has gone out of its way to afford facilities and accommodation to Ministers, recognising that they are here very often under great difficulties and that their attendance is urgently required in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, they have to come in here in connection with Bills for which they are responsible, and, therefore, I think it is not only a matter of courtesy, but a matter of duty, to extend to them every facility in our power.  It is for that reason I greatly regret the Minister for Local Government should have made this statement in the Dáil on the 11th of January.  I will read it, and I will say in the first place that if he had any complaint to make he should <Col N="472" /> have made it here, where it would have been explained and dealt with, and not to have made it in the Dáil, where no Senators were present and no explanation was possible:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think it is scarcely fair the way Ministers are treated in regard to amendments in the Seanad.  We often have amendments thrust into our hands a few minutes before going there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then he proceeds to describe what happened in this particular case&mdash;that is in regard to this amendment to the Electors Registration Bill&mdash;and I am sorry to have to say that the statement he made in regard to what happened in this House when he was present when this Bill was passed was absolutely inaccurate from beginning to end.  I will read it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this particular case there were two amendments, A. and B. B. was struck out, and my arguments were mainly directed against B, and did apply not so much to A.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How he could have directed all his arguments to an amendment that was struck out is a matter that requires a little explanation.  I cannot follow it. I am reading exactly what he stated. In this particular case there were two amendments, A. and B.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;B. was struck out, and my arguments were mainly directed against B., and did not apply so much to A.  The two Sections&rdquo;&mdash;he means the two amendments&mdash;&ldquo;were separated at the time, and Senator Linehan withdrew Section B., and went ahead with Section A.  That is, perhaps, partly an explanation of why this has arisen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a ludicrous description of what actually happened.  First of all, with regard to the Minister being taken by surprise by this amendment, may I give the facts?  On the 12th December we suddenly found ourselves confronted with no less than eight Bills, I think, which were hurled at us on that date, with an intimation that they were all more or less non-controversial and all urgent, and a desire was intimated to me on the part of the Government that these Bills should be got through as speedily as possible.  Anxious to help them in that respect, I did get the Second Reading stage of those Bills <Col N="473" /> put through on the 12th December. After we had disposed of the Second Stage, I said in reference to this very particular Bill we are now dealing with that &ldquo;This appears to have been treated in the Dáil as a non-controversial Bill, and if the Seanad are going to treat it in the same way, perhaps they would suspend Standing Orders to allow it to get through to-day all its remaining stages.&rdquo;  Thereupon Senator Linehan got up and said: &ldquo;I object to that because I intend to put down amendments to this particular Bill to which you refer.&rdquo;  Senator Douglas made a very important observation in connection with which I would like to refer.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think a certain amount of the criticism of the Seanad is due to the fact that naturally, and I think wisely, members do not read Bills until they pass the Dáil.  We then come to what looks like a non-controversial Bill on the Second Reading, and we find that on a little more consideration it may require some amendment.  I personally strongly favour that in every Bill, unless there are very urgent circumstances, we should reach the Committee stage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Accordingly, Senator Linehan having intimated he desired to put down amendments to this Bill, I did not further press on the Seanad to proceed to pass it through its remaining stages, for I recognised the propriety of Senator Linehan's objection.  The House adjourned on that day, and did not meet for a week, but in the interval the agenda of the following week, the 19th December, was prepared, and sent out to every member of the House and Dáil.  On that agenda appeared Senator Linehan's two amendments in black and white, so that when this Bill was brought up on the Committee Stage on the 19th December, not only every member of the Seanad, but every member of the Dáil had, or might have had, the amendments in his possession.  When the amendments were reached, Senator Linehan moved the first of them, that is the particular one we are conversant with now, and that we afterwards received a message from the Dáil about, and on that discussion the Minister did speak, but he <Col N="474" /> only spoke for a few minutes.  All of what are called his arguments are found in half a column of the Journal of this House.  Then Senator Linehan moved his second amendment, and on that amendment the Minister never opened his lips, although he stated in the Dáil, when he was complaining of the unfair treatment he received here, that the bulk of his arguments were directed to the second amendment, which was withdrawn.  I think it is only fair to this House when they are charged with discourtesy, not merely to this particular Minister, but to all Ministers in general, that I should mention these facts for the justification of this House in the matter.  I pass from it.</P>
    <P>There is a much more important matter behind this particular amendment, and this particular Bill than this mere suggestion of the Minister, which is absolutely, as I have said, without foundation and fact.  The importance of it arises, and I do now invite the most careful and anxious consideration of the House to this, because I say without hesitation of any sort or kind that if they were acquiesced in, the claims put forward there by responsible Ministers and others, as to their powers and rights over the proceedings of this House, it might as well close for any effective good it could do in the matter of legislation, and as for myself, I should be perfectly worthless to you and of no assistance or use of any sort, kind or description. Now, what happened?  This House had inserted, on the motion of Senator Linehan, an amendment to this registration of Voters Bill, and the amendment, as you may recollect, was in effect this, that no person should be entitled to vote at the Local Government Elections unless within a certain period prior to the election he had paid the rates issuing out of his tenement.</P>
    <P>I am not going to discuss whether that was a wise or a foolish amendment, I am not concerned with it in any shape or form.  What I am concerned with is, what happened, first of all, in this House.  Nobody, when that amendment was moved, challenged <Col N="475" /> its propriety.  Nobody questioned that it was an amendment within our Standing Orders and one that could be legitimately moved.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government stated in the Dáil that all along he was under the impression it was not a proper amendment, because it was outside the scope of the Bill.  He so informed the Dáil.  He kept that important view of his when he was in the Seanad. He never suggested directly or indirectly that the amendment in question in any way travelled beyond or outside the scope of the Bill.  It did occur to myself, not on the suggestion of any Minister, and not on the suggestion of any member of the Seanad, that there might be some reason for the view that this amendment of Senator Linehan was not relevant to the exact subject matter of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Although the question was not raised I carefully considered it.  I stated to the Seanad, and gave it as my opinion, that the amendment was quite relevant by reason of the fact that the Bill itself contained a clause as introduced by the Government which did interfere with the qualification of voters.  That Clause in the Bill is Clause 3, and I will read it as it came to the Seanad:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So much of sub-section II of Section 44 of the Representation of the People Act of 1918, as enacts that the qualifying period shall be a period of six months ending on the 15th day of July is hereby repealed, and in lieu thereof it is hereby enacted that the qualifying period for Local Government Electors shall be a period of six months ending on the 15th day of November, and including that day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, giving the best judgment I could when this matter occurred to me in the course of the debate, I came to the conclusion that, inasmuch as the Bill itself contained a clause that interfered with the law determining the qualification of voters, the amendment proposed by Senator Linehan was consequently not outside the scope of the Bill or irrelevant to it.  I may have been entirely wrong in that opinion. I think still that I was entirely right, <Col N="476" /> but whether I was right or wrong I had to give my opinion, and I gave it to the best of my ability and judgment and it was adopted by the Seanad.  When it came back to the Dáil the very first thing that happened was this: the Speaker of the Dáil got up and said that in his opinion the amendment we had passed was out of order, that it was not relevant to the subject matter of the Bill.  The reason he gave was this, that the Bill did not touch the qualification for electors.  Now this is not a personal issue.  I hope the Seanad will bear in mind that the relations between the Speaker and myself have always been most friendly.  I have never received anything but the greatest courtesy and consideration from him, and I have endeavoured to return it.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of principle as between the two Houses, and as between the Constitutional rights and prerogatives of the Seanad.  I only wish to point out that if this power, apparently claimed at one stage in the Dáil by the Speaker&mdash;though I think from what I will read to you later that he subsequently abandoned it&mdash;to overrule the Seanad in their own domestic forum, and overrule the ruling and decision of their Chairman upon a question of law as to whether their own procedure is right exists in the Speaker, then a corresponding power must exist in me to overrule the rulings of the Speaker. Neither of us got it under the Constitution. It is, in my opinion, absolutely inconsistent with the Constitution, but if we were to allow the claim to pass unchallenged then nothing but chaos could ensue, because you will have the Speaker overruling me in regard to a particular matter, and then when it comes back to this House I overrule the Speaker.</P>
    <P>When this matter was being discussed in the Dáil on the 11th of this month Deputy Johnson, with that wonderful power he has of putting his finger on the spot, suggested that they ought to be very careful in the Dáil before they accepted any such idea, as that the Speaker in the Dáil could overrule the decision of the Chairman of the Seanad in regard to procedure that took place <Col N="477" /> here.  He made several references to it and warned the Dáil that they ought to be very slow in following this view of the Speaker, because he said it would amount to this: &ldquo;that the Dáil were deciding that the Seanad exceeded its authority.&rdquo;  I am giving his own words.  &ldquo;We are now ruling that the Seanad has exceeded its authority.&rdquo;  Thereupon the President at once interposed and said &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then the Speaker said this and it is from these words I assume he abandoned his original claim that he could overrule the action of the Seanad.  The Speaker said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would like to correct that. There is no question of the authority of the Seanad to pass legislation, and no question of our authority to introduce a Bill for certain purposes and amend it and afterwards make it serve a totally different purpose. We have authority to do that if we like.  We have decided that we will not do such things.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, I take it, amounts to this: that the Seanad had perfect power to do what it did; &ldquo;we in the Dáil, by our Standing Orders, are determined that we will not do it,&rdquo; but there is no doubt the Seanad were quite within their powers in doing what they did.  If so, it seems strange that he should have stated the action of the Seanad in putting in this amendment was entirely out of order.  Deputy Johnson puts the position then in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we disagree now with this amendment because it is outside the scope of the Bill we are in fact informing the Chairman of the Seanad that his judgment was wrong.  We are telling him that he must reconsider his judgment.  He may be a very easy-going gentleman and he may say: &lsquo;I do not mind; please yourselves.&rsquo; It may be the other way and he may say &lsquo;I stick to my right in this matter,&rsquo; and the Seanad may say &lsquo;We are going to stand by the amendment on its merits.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They seem to have been rendered a little uneasy about this claim on the part of the Speaker to rule out of order an amendment of the Seanad, passed in full regard to the Standing Orders of this House, and declared by <Col N="478" /> me to be in order, that that could be overruled by him and turned down in the Dáil on that ground.  So much for that particular claim.</P>
    <P>But the Government then proceeded to advance a still stronger and more remarkable claim.  You will find it in plain words as expressed by the President: that if the Government introduce what they choose to call a non-contentious Bill, label it as non-contentious, and induce the members of the Dáil to treat it as such, and then if it comes up to the Seanad and the Seanad interfere with it by putting in an amendment, they have exceeded their powers because they have turned the Bill into a wholly different Bill and have done what they had no right to do.  I confess that is a most startling proposition having regard to the Constitution, and let there be no mistake about it.  If I am challenged as to the accuracy of my interpretation I am prepared to read the passages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I had better read a few of them.  One of the passages in the speech of the President was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think the Seanad on reconsidering the matter will perceive that it is scarcely fair to characterise Bills differently from the form in which they left the Dáil considering that they have passed the Dáil in a non-contentious atmosphere and are for the purpose of providing machinery suitable for the special circumstances of the time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I correctly interpret language that means this: that if the Government and the Dáil choose to characterise a Bill as non-contentious then there is no option for the Seanad but to swallow it wholesale.  They have no power to amend it and, if they do amend it, they are turning it into something other than what the Government intended it to be.  In other words, the Government intended it to be a non-contentious Bill, but this troublesome Seanad have turned it into a contentious Bill by putting in an amendment; therefore its character has been wholly destroyed.  That, I say, is a position that we never could allow to pass unchallenged. <Col N="479" /> The only reason that I am raising these two matters is because if things of this kind are allowed to be said day after day and from time to time in the Dáil and placed on record upon its Official Report, they will be quoted hereafter as precedent for the proposition and as establishing some kind of constitutional usage. Therefore, I think it is vital for this Seanad, whenever an attempt of that kind to invade its constitutional privileges and rights is attempted&mdash;whatever course they may take with regard to the particular amendment&mdash;to put on record their assertion of their right to be masters in their own house; that whatever decision may be given an any questions of law or order raised, whatever the decision of the Chairman may be, right or wrong, there is an end to the matter, and that no power exists in any outside body, either the Dáil or any of its members, to overrule that. That is the vital principle at the very root of any independence that we have got under the Constitution.  It is not very great but the smaller it is the more incumbent it is upon us to preserve it for ourselves and for those who come after us.  I have always felt and always shall feel that it is my duty, so long as I have the honour to preside over this Seanad, to call the attention of the Seanad to matters of this kind so that they can be dealt with at the moment and not left to stand in any shape or form as a record against them in the future.</P>
    <P>I must express my regret that I have been compelled to deal with these topics, not only in regard to this Bill, but the one which has been already before the Seanad.  I felt the importance of them was so great that I could not allow to pass unchallenged a claim asserted to authority in the Dáil over the proceedings, debates, rules and Standing Orders of this Seanad which, if admitted and recognised, would, as I have said, paralyse all its effective powers of interference in legislation. The actual matter before the Seanad is the recommendation or message that a Joint Committee should be formed which would inquire into this question of disagreements between the two Houses and consider procedure that <Col N="480" /> might provide some convenient means for adjusting these differences or, possibly, preventing their recurrence.</P>
    <P>I should have mentioned, perhaps, that ultimately the Dáil agreed to do nothing with regard to this amendment, neither to reject it nor to pass it; but that they would simply send up a message, in the form I have read out, and which is in the Order Paper, to this Seanad.  I am quite sure that the Seanad will receive that message with great satisfaction, and that it will be only too delighted and pleased if, between it and the Dáil, they can arrive at some form of <i>modus vivendi.</i>  These causes of friction, without some modifying plan, inevitably must arise so long as the Seanad are allowed to exercise any views at all of their own. Therefore, I think, it is eminently desirable that some <i>modus vivendi</i>, some method of compromise, out of these difficulties should be devised.  Possibly the appointment of a Joint Committee to consider it is about the most sensible suggestion that could be made.</P>

I believe I said what was in my mind, what was in the mind of the Dáil, that in good faith a measure was introduced into that House.  It did not change the qualification of voters; it changed the date from which the qualification was to run&mdash;only a purely administrative matter&mdash;and an entirely different complexion was put on it by the introduction <Col N="481" /> of an amendment here which was certainly, in our opinion, foreign to the Bill, raising contentious matter, changing its entire character.  To what I stated in the Dáil I adhere.  With great respect to you, Sir, and the Seanad, I do not know that I said a single thing which could offend a single member of the Seanad.  As I said before, I have not the speech before me, and I have no immediate recollection of the exact words, but I stand by them in the spirit in which they were made and in the actual words in which they were made: that a Bill coming from the Lower House changing in essentials only the date from which the qualifications would run, which was merely an administrative matter, assumed an entirely different complexion when it came back to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the most redeeming feature of this <Col N="482" /> Bill is the fact that it is less ruthless than its predecessor, the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Act, which can hardly be said to have justified the departure from civilised methods which the enactment of some of its provisions involved.  I readily admit the necessity of special procedure to deal with an abnormal situation.  It is in regard to the nature and extent of the departure from normal constitutional practices that I do not agree.  It is true, unfortunately, that we are suffering from the aftermath of five or six years of strife.  The armed robber still plies his trade with a certain amount of impunity, and, strange to say, his performances are almost invariably described in the public Press as &ldquo;daring.&rdquo; Respect and reverence for the law are not so deeply rooted and widespread as one would desire.  It is too true that the assassin of private citizens for private vengeance from time to time announces his existence by deeds of blood and violence.  I suppose this is what might be expected as a result of the happenings of the last few years.</P>
      <P>One of the most disturbing features of the situation is the large number of serious crimes that are attributed to those who are supposed to be the guardians and custodians of our public order and safety.  It is only fair to say, in no single instance that I am aware of, has any member of the police forces been found wanting, and I only wish that the same could be said of the army.  It is in this respect that one views with a good deal of anxiety the powers that are sought to be conferred on soldiers by this Bill. Section 2 lays it down that it shall be lawful for a responsible officer to arrest and detain in custody for any period not exceding one week any person committing or attempting to commit or who is suspected of committing or about to commit such crimes as mentioned in the Schedule.  These are very serious powers to delegate to responsible officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 8 we find a responsible officer described as an officer of the military forces of Saorstat Eireann not being below the rank of Commandant who may be empowered in any particular case by the Minister for Defence to delegate his powers to any member of <Col N="483" /> a military force not below the rank of sergeant, etc.  Now, this will mean that practically every soldier is going to have the powers of a policeman and the Commandant is not compelled under the Bill to produce any written authority for any arrest he may make or any entrance he may enforce for such arrest.  In delegating his powers he is not compelled to do so in writing.  In Section 8 every soldier is, in certain circumstances given the full powers of a police constable without a warrant, and he is not forced to show any written authority for any action he may presume to take.  In these extraordinary circumstances how is the ordinary peaceful law-abiding citizen to say that a soldier is acting legally or is out on an expedition of his own?  It would be different if there were sufficient confidence in the disciplined traditions and character of a long well-trained army to place such terrible powers in their hands, but is it fair to the army that this great responsibility should be placed upon it, and, in fact, place the individual citizen at the mercy of a private soldier?  Even assuming that it had iron discipline behind it and that it had long years of training, and if we were in a country where social conditions are better than here, such powers as sought might not be safely entrusted to the army.</P>
    <P>We have had more than one terrible example of the danger of allowing a soldier to make arrests without warrant and the danger of turning the soldier into a policeman.  We have had cases of people taken from their homes by persons wearing uniforms and holding high rank and we were told by the friends of those people that they were not unduly anxious as they thought that the uniforms were a guarantee for the safety of the prisoners. Subsequent events showed how little faith could be placed on those on whom the integrity of the State so largely depends.  I think that the almost unlimited powers given to military officers, even to private soldiers, are a very serious menace and one which no legislature should lightly delegate, particularly to the private soldier.  We know that any amount of armed robberies have been traced <Col N="484" /> to men wearing military uniform, yet the Bill throws open the door of every citizen's house to any soldier who may state that he is carrying out his duty under this Bill.</P>
    <P>You need not ask him for his authority because the Bill does not provide any written authority.  I believe that in every case the soldier should be accompanied by members of the Civic Guard or Dublin Metropolitan Police, and I realise the necessity for reinforcing the police by a military force, especially in cases where persons to be arrested are supposed to be armed, but surely that emergency could be met without giving every soldier a policeman's power.</P>
    <P>Another serious point is that those arrests can be made on mere suspicion. It is not outside the wit of any officer to show that he has a reason to suspect a person of having committed some crime.  As far as I can gather, if the person arrested is released within a week, the officer is not compelled to offer any explanation for having arrested that person.  Certainly the Bill does not provide any redress for the person arrested in that way.  One can visualise the amount of petty spleen that can be paid off, if military officers are unscrupulous enough to take advantage under the powers of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 indicates the lack of any definite policy on the part of the Government in regard to political prisoners. Some months ago, many of us advocated the release of all political prisoners not put on trial.  Our suggestion was announced as criminal and impossible.  It was stated that the safety of the State depended on their continued detention.  I could understand that policy if it were acted upon, but it has not been acted upon.  The Government have released over nine-tenths of the prisoners, but they have done it in such a way as to neutralise any good results that might reasonably accrue from a general amnesty when the reign of violence had ceased, and when the military power of the irregulars had been definitely smashed, and their unpopularity was at its height.  What is the object of keeping the remaining prisoners any longer, unless it is to inflict some more suffering on their dependents, the majority of whom had no <Col N="485" /> responsibility for the misdeeds of the prisoners?  We had a public statement attributed to the President to the effect that within the next few weeks the whole of the prisoners will be released. If that is to be the policy a few weeks hence, is there any good reason why it should not be the policy now?  If there were any intention of placing these prisoners on trial, I could understand it.  Many of the chief offenders were released, while the nonentities were retained.</P>
    <P>If violence were to be resumed again, there are sufficient people at large, capable of creating trouble, who do not want any assistance from those detained. Those Appeal Councils can be rendered nugatory by the Minister on the plea of bringing out a new offence, and he could continue that process, if he so desired, <i>ad infinitum.</i>  Treatment of that kind would not be tolerated by Courts of Justice, and why should it be tried on an Appeal Council, whose functions are similar to those of Courts of Justice?  The result would be that those Appeal Councils would be a mockery unless their findings are in accordance with the feelings of the Minister in power.  It is an extraordinary suggestion also that even in cases where Appeal Councils decide that the prisoner is not guilty of the charges under which he is being detained, that he should nevertheless be asked to give recognizances to keep the peace.  It is equivalent to stating: &ldquo;Not guilty, but do not do it again.&rdquo;  If he gives bail in circumstances of that kind, he is deemed guilty, though the Appeal Council may have stated he is innocent. These are the principal remarks I desire to make in regard to this Bill.  I can only say, in conclusion, that during the trouble the Parliament virtually delegated the whole of its powers to a dictatorship.  That may have been wise in the circumstances, but it has created a peculiar mentality in Ministers, who now seem to be unable or unwilling to get away from the dictatorial pose.  The speeches delivered in the other House in connection with this Bill by some Ministers were quite understandable some time ago, but to-day, they are inexplicable.  Every good citizen deplores the happenings of the last eighteen months, but I would respectfully <Col N="486" /> submit that we are not going to continue to serve the State or to hasten peace by continually probing at, and opening those old wounds.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that a great many crimes, including robbery under arms, are still being committed in Ireland, and if this Bill aimed only at them there would not be so much to say against it, with the exception of certain things.</P>
      <P>The army is in existence for a considerable time but does not appear to be much more disciplined than before. It is smarter than before, but there are a number of things going on such as ill-treatment of prisoners, etc., that do not give confidence to entrust them with the powers sought for.  Under the circumstances I do not consider that very satisfactory.  Even trained soldiers commit grave outrages under such circumstances, and we have neither trained soldiers, and even less have we trained officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is described as Public Safety (Powers of Arrest and Detention) Temporary Bill, and in the preamble it is stated &ldquo;as an Act to make provision for the arrest and detention within a certain limited period of certain persons for other matters connected with the preservation of the public safety, and the protection of persons and property.&rdquo;  That preamble deals undoubtedly with the prevention of crime in the future and not with crime in the past.  It is preventative, not punitive, and if that were adhered to throughout it would not matter, but there are two or three words in Section 1 which nullify that.  The words are in line 22, Section 1, which extend the matter to such a person of being, or having been, engaged in or concerned with the commission of offences mentioned in the schedule.  That is, it includes people who have been guilty long ago in this matter, and in that way it ceases to be preventative.  It becomes a punishment for persons who are supposed to have committed certain offences long ago, whereas in all the other cases it refers to people who are supposed to be going to commit offences.  I presume this Bill is meant to arrest any person known to be a bad character.  This Bill is meant to <Col N="487" /> prevent that by putting and keeping a man in prison.</P>
    <P>Here again, however certain the Minister himself and everybody in the country may be, that the man is not going to commit any such crime and has no intention of doing so, nevertheless to keep arrested the men who in some past time&mdash;six months or two years ago&mdash;did commit such a crime, seems to me to be going entirely beyond the rest of the Bill and it ceases then to be a preventative measure and becomes a punitive one.  Coming to the question of these political prisoners, it could hardly be doubted that many of them have in the past committed, or helped to commit, some of these crimes, but here again some of these were committed in the past, long ago.  It is known perfectly well that about nine months ago the leaders in that association issued an order to down arms.  That, in itself, might not go very far in our opinion, but they have actually maintained that attitude and I think that it cannot be shown that during these nine months they have broken out or done any great damage in that matter.  It may be said that certain individuals have done so, just as certain individuals of the army have done a great deal more, but it cannot be said that there is any chance now of political prisoners breaking out into arms or making attacks on houses.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, what I say is true, that there is no chance of these people breaking out into arms or committing hostile acts on individuals, the object of this Bill is not prevention at all.  It is not an attempt to keep in prison ruffians who break into houses, but to keep a number of political prisoners in jail because they are political prisoners, and because they are opposed to the present Government and the present state of affairs.  When the previous Bill to this was before the Seanad I stated that I believed that one of its objects was to arrest and keep in prison opponents of the Minister, and not only of the Minister but of the present state of affairs, and the Minister indignantly denied that; not only that, but said that I knew perfectly well that it was not <Col N="488" /> true.  It turned out to be a fact, because numbers of people who are our political opponents have been arrested during that time.</P>
    <P>During the elections there were a great number of cases in which people were arrested, apparently for no reason except to influence it.  One of these, I may mention, was Mr. Donnelly, who was Director of Elections.  He was arrested just before the elections began, and let out immediately afterwards. There may have been a suspicion that he was going to do something desperate at the moment, but it was very curious that he should be arrested just before and liberated just after.  Under the circumstances I might suppose that he was arrested in order to influence the elections.  I do not think it did; I think it had a very opposite effect, and in many cases I believe that the elections would have gone very differently if these things did not happen, because they irritated a great number of people.</P>
    <P>Another reason why I object to this Bill is because it has an unconstitutional result.  If it is meant to detain political prisoners who are members of the Dáil I believe it is absolutely unconstitutional. The Constitution states, &ldquo;Every member of the Oireachtas shall, except in cases of treason, felony, and breaches of the peace be privileged from arrest in going to or returning from or while within the precincts of either House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems perfectly clear to me that that phrase prevents any member of the Oireachtas from being arrested unless he is charged with any of these acts.  Somebody may find some way of getting behind that.  I am unable to find any special way.  It seems to me as clear as daylight.  I do not want to quote what happened in other countries. If I were to do so, I could very well give reasons from other countries for maintaining that it is their practice, but our position is entirely different from theirs, because they are governed, not by a Constitution, but by the privileges of Parliament.  Ours is governed by the words of the Constitution, and our Constitution says that any member of the Oireachtas is free from the danger of arrest unless he be guilty or charged with treason, <Col N="489" /> felony, or breach of the peace.  None of these people have been charged with any of these acts.</P>
    <P>I do not deny for a moment that they have been guilty of these things.  Most of them have.  But they have not been charged, and I think unless they are charged their detention is an actual breach of the Constitution.  When the other Bill was before the Seanad, I made a similar statement.  I asked the Minister if he was proposing to override the Constitution, and he said very definitely and clearly that it did not do so, that it could not override the Constitution.  The Constitution was the touchstone of every Bill that could be brought before the House, and in that he was perfectly accurate.  But it is, as far as I can see, contrary to the Constitution to keep Mr. de Valera, or any member of the Dáil, in prison, as has been done, and is being done.</P>
    <P>There is one more reason that I have to give, and that is, that I heard a Senator say some time ago that the main thing with every person of good order and good desire in the country was to bring about peace in this country, to make friends with those whom we quarrelled with, and, as much as is possible, as much as is safe for the State, to bring everyone together in peace and good-will.  I maintain that as long as we keep these people in prison that cannot be done.  I believe practically every person in Ireland is in favour of the release of these people, with the exception, I presume, of the Ministers and a few others.  Practically everyone else whom I have met for the last few months has agreed with that, and it has been stated all over the country, and by all sorts of people, because we all recognise that we cannot have peace and good-will as long as these people are in prison.</P>

The clause is one &ldquo;Providing for the inspection of such prisons, camps and other places, and <Col N="490" /> the visiting of persons detained therein, by responsible persons, to be appointed by the Minister.&rdquo;  I have felt for some months considerable curiosity as to the fate of that clause, and I think our Labour Senators have also felt some curiosity.  I shall be very glad if that curiosity could be satisfied, to know whether these persons have been appointed, whether they have inspected the prisons; and if they have not been appointed, if they are going to be appointed, and when.</P>

      <P>When the last Public Safety Bill was before the Seanad I felt it my duty to vote against it, because I did not believe that the fundamental principles underlying it would really make for the speedy maintenance of good government.  I am very glad that this Bill goes in the right direction, and I should like to say that, while I am still of the same opinion, and while I do not think I could conscientiously vote for the Bill, I recognise the direction in which it goes as a fulfilment of the lines on which the responsible Minister promised he would act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all of us in complete agreement that it is the duty of the Government and the Oireachtas to take such measures as will lead to the establishment of law, of confidence, and of order in this country.  I do not mean law and order in the sense in which it is often referred to, but order in the sense by which men and women of all kinds, of all parties and of all sections will feel that the law exists for their protection, for the guarantee of their liberty, and will come to learn that the Constitution and the State, with all its faults, is none the less the guarantee of their liberty.  For my part, I am particularly desirous, and I think that we are not without signs, that though they refuse to admit it, that amongst those who have opposed, some constitutionally and many by methods which have no justification whatever, the creation of the State, that these persons should be forced by the very circumstances to find that this very thing is their protection and the guarantee of their liberty, in so far as they are prepared to respect the liberties of others and to act by methods, to put it plainly, which <Col N="491" /> are consistent with the ordinary recognised Christian practices and relationships betwen men.  I recognise that this Bill, or some such Bill, is now necessary to continue the policy of government which has been by means of abnormal measures and powers to try and establish a State in which the ordinary law would operate, and thereby to see its vindication.</P>
    <P>I recognise that in this Bill with the elimination of several Clauses, which many of us very much objected to on the previous occasion, they are going in that direction.  At the same time I am still of the opinion that though it might have been more troublesome and slower and not so spectacular, and perhaps might not have had the same kind of satisfaction that in the long run, once you had got to the state of an established peace, it would be better frankly to face the situation and try your prisoners or release them.  There has been a great deal talked from which I wish to dissociate myself.  It has been stated that this Government has been hard or brutal towards its political opponents.  I read in one place a reference to South Africa, and a suggestion that General Smuts pardoned all his prisoners, and that we are holding them in jail.  The facts are, I believe, that the South African Government introduced measures providing special penalties for the prisoners and before they pardoned the prisoners they insisted on the trial of every one of them.  I am not saying we should imitate them in that, but I do not want to associate myself with the suggestion that there has been any kind of harshness which is peculiar to this country, and that the Government here has been less reasonable in the treatment of their opponents than those of other countries who had to meet similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>I think there is one thing that those of us who are opposed to this measure must face.  The political prisoners in jail through those who are supposed to speak for them are still asserting that they, though a minority, are the only lawful Government of this country.  They may not be asserting it by means of force, for they <Col N="492" /> cannot do it, but it ought to be made perfectly clear by those who cannot, as I cannot, support their continued detention without trial, that we do not expect the Government to release unconditionally, and to give all facilities for persons who claim that they can act as the lawful Government of the country before they have got a majority.  I only mention this because there is sometimes a belief that those of us who have not always been able to agree with all the measures of the Government have any sympathy with that action.  I believe, with others here who take a similar position, and hold that view as strongly as I do&mdash;I do not propose to move amendments or do any more than simply register my vote on this occasion&mdash;that we are getting on, that people are discovering the genuineness of Saorstát Eireann, that they are discovering that they are governing themselves, and that they are discovering that the very blunders of the Government they are objecting to are their blunders and responsibilities, and that they are discovering we are learning to govern.  I do hope notwithstanding the powers that are given, that on every occasion where it is possible the Government will try in preference to holding without trial, even though they have this power, and that when the end of the twelve months comes that they get to the end of this Bill, that there will be no need for it, because they will gradually have evolved to a State in which ordinary law can operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal very briefly with the points raised by the various Senators who spoke.  Preliminary to that I should like to say just a few words on the general tenour and the underlying principles of this Bill.  It can really be reduced to two main proposals: (1) The proposal that for twelve months to come it shall be possible to arrest and detain persons on something short of legal proof.  (2) The proposal with regard to persons still in custody that it shall be lawful to retain them for a further period until we are of opinion that the public <Col N="493" /> safety permits of their release.  Practically everything else in the Bill is supplemetary or secondary to these two proposals.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first we quite admit that the principle of arrest and detention without trial is normally objectionable and that the principle of assuming innocence until guilt is proved is a very sound and admirable one for a country not situated just as we are.  There is still through the country in many counties, perhaps in six or seven counties, a degree of terrorism which puts an undue strain on the average citizen when it comes to a question of coming forward and giving evidence either with regard to his own particular complaints or grievance, or still harder when it is a question of giving evidence in the case of his neighbour's grievance.</P>
      <P>We recognise that, and recognise also that in the case of certain individuals brought to trial a very severe strain would be placed upon numbers of jurors.  I elaborated that aspect of the matter at some length in the Dáil, and I feel that it is probably unnecessary to stress it here to Senators coming from various parts of the country who have personal knowledge that what I say is true.  I think that it should be almost unnecessary for me to state that the Bill is not aimed at any particular section within the country. I believe that every Senator&mdash; with the possible exception of Senator Moore, who has rather a remarkable capacity for smelling rats&mdash;will accept that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will realise that the wish of the Government would be to see side by side in the one internment camp both the blackguard who professes to approve of our acceptance of the Treaty and the blackguard who professes to disapprove.  Personally, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see that interesting pair side by side discussing the merits and the demerits of the Treaty while the country recovered from the activities of both. In so far as the operation of this Bill will come directly within the scope of the Department to which I am responsible <Col N="494" /> it is that desirable consummation I will aim at.</P>
      <P>As to the prisoners still detained I have some figures which I will run through for the Seanad.  On the 1st June last there were in military custody 12,000 prisoners, on 1st July 11,500, on 1st August 11,000, on 1st September 10,500, on 1st October 9,700, on 1st November 8,000, on 1st December 5,500, on 1st January 1,850. There are at present, in round numbers, 1,500.  I submit that that is a programme of releases which might be described as generous to the point of rashness.  We could not have taken that course if we had not the confidence that both Houses of the Oireachtas would appreciate the necessity of arming the Executive throughout the next year with very special and very exceptional powers to deal with any situation that may arise, and to deal with the aftermath of the situation that, in fact, arose and prevailed for close on two years.</P>
      <P>There were comments by Senator O'Farrell with regard to the powers conferred on the military, and in particular the powers conferred by Section 2 on the &ldquo;responsible officer.&rdquo;  I do not propose to enter on the question of Senator O'Farrell's strictures on the military, on members of the army.  It is not primarily my responsibility, and, in any case, I hold that it is only remotely relevant to the Bill. The army, such as it is, is the only army you have to rely on to arrest the armed criminal.  That is the case for the powers conferred on the responsible military officer by this Bill; that you have no one else to whom you can entrust these duties and who is capable of performing them.  One cannot send a party of unarmed Civic Guards to deal with a gang of armed criminals. Senators are no doubt aware that there are gangs of armed criminals and very active gangs in quite a lot of areas in the country still.  In Cork, in East Galway, in portions of Tipperary, and portions of Offally there are men still passing their private legislation with their revolvers, and you have only the army to meet these men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;responsible officer&rdquo; has been taken exception to, <Col N="495" /> and, in particular, that portion of the definition which allows the Commandant to delegate.  That is necessary simply to meet a practical situation.  I gave an example in the Dáil of the situation we wished to meet.  A badly-wanted man, or half a dozen badly-wanted men, may be known to be in a particular town, in a fair or circus, amongst any assembly of people, and a party of military must be employed for the arrest.  If you say that the physical act of arrest can only be carried out by the responsible officer in person, then, in fact, you are legislating for the criminal, because the odds are one hundred to one against the responsible officer being able to effect the arrest in person.</P>
    <P>We were taunted with the lack of any definite policy with regard to the persons still in custody.  There may be just this in that charge, that one has to keep an open mind on the matter. One has just to go along judging the situation in the country and seeing, according to its development, what it was possible to do.  There has been a very generous scale of releases, particularly within the last two or three months.  We must see what it brings. and, watching the situation in the country like that, men can be gradually liberated until it will boil down perhaps to 200, 300, or 500 of those chiefly responsible for the situation of the last two years.  Then, when our responsibilities to the people for the safety of their persons, the safety of their property, the freedom of their lives, seems to permit it, those persons will be released.  I think that that is our function.  I think that is what the people of the country expect.</P>
    <P>I do not at all agree with Senator Moore when he says that everyone in the country desires the immediate release of these prisoners, except the Ministers and a few others.  I think that is an exaggeration.  The question of provisions with regard to recognisances was raised, and Senator O'Farrell seemed to consider that, inasmuch as the arrest and detention was on suspicion, or, at any rate, on something short of legal proof, that, therefore, there ought to be no question of recognisances. Every Senator knows that <Col N="496" /> in the past it was the commonest thing in the world before the Petty Sessions Court when a charge against a person was not proven for bail to be imposed. It was quite a common thing. Moreover, that particular section with regard to recognisances was inserted in the interests of those who are detained, and in the interests of those who will be detained under the operation of this Bill.  Take the case of agrarian disturbances, and there are, unfortunately, many such cases.  Take, one concrete example which I will give without mentioning the names of persons or places.</P>
    <P>I know at the moment of a farm held by two sisters, young girls, against whom a persecution is going on, with regard to the farm, conducted by people who have not a scrap of legal or equitable claim to the land, but who are simply inspired by a desire to take advantage of the apparently helpless position of the owners.  The identity of the persons responsible for that persecution is beyond all doubt, but there is no overt act which could be proved in a Court.  People do not do that kind of thing in the light of day or in the presence of witnesses. They skulk out at night with a matchbox and a tin of parafin oil and do their work under the cover of darkness. It might well be that this Bill would be used to meet cases of that kind, but no one wants more than this, that the persecution would cease.  If persons arrested under this Bill were prepared to give their own assurances to that effect, or prepared to give the bail of their friends or neighbours, there could be no objection to releasing them.  A person arrested on very reasonable suspicion of committing outrages, or a series of outrages of this kind, could secure that a friend or relative would come along and offer recognisances for him, and on these recognisances it might be possible in a particular case to issue a release order. The recognisances would not be estreated except on subsequent conviction.</P>
    <P>There could be no question of estreating bails on even what would seem to be reasonably grounded suspicion. If A.B. is interned, and his brother, uncle, or father comes along <Col N="497" /> and says, &ldquo;If you release him I will enter into bails for his good behaviour,&rdquo; then the father's or uncle's recognisances could only be estreated if there was a subsequent conviction of the released person.  I think it would be unwise to strike out from the Bill that provision.  If there is a substantial feeling here that it should be struck out, I would now ask the Seanad to reject that amendment.  I think myself it would be unwise, and that it would not be in the interests of persons who may be interned under this Bill, to strike it out.  Senator Colonel Moore dealt mainly with the question of persons still interned in connection with the events of the last two years, and drew a subtle distinction between ruffians who broke into houses and political prisoners.  It is an abuse of language to describe the persons still interned as political prisoners.</P>

      <P>Excuse me, I think the Minister slightly misunderstood me.  What I dealt with was those who committed these crimes, as the political prisoners, I admit did, six or nine months ago, and those who have been arrested for preventive purposes now. That was the distinction.  I quite admit they committed these crimes, and I have in no way whatever defended them.  There is the question of preventative and punitive.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the Senator's explanation.  We think it is necessary for the peace and security of the country to continue to detain certain persons now in custody, and to get power to arrest and detain persons who are not now in custody.  I do not propose to deal with Senator Colonel Moore's high Constitutional argument as to the legality of detaining persons who were elected to be members of the Dáil.  The Courts can decide <Col N="498" /> that, and, personally, I would be very glad, if it were possible, for Senator Colonel Moore in person to argue his case before the Courts.</P>

      <P>The next business on the Orders of the Day is the Courts of Justice Bill, 1923.  Probably the Seanad would prefer not to start upon that this evening, and there is good reason why they should not do so.  Amendments have come in in considerable numbers, but slowly.  We are very short-handed owing to our Clerk and first Assistant Clerk being laid aside with illness.  It has taken our junior Assistant Clerk all his time to have these amendments typed and ready, so far as he has been able to do it.  They are not even yet really in proper order, and an adjournment, I think, of the Committee Stage, to 3 o'clock to-morrow, would be an advantage to everyone, as you will then have the amendments set out in proper order and in convenient shape.  If that is the wish of the Seanad we will now adjourn, as the motion standing in the name of Senator the Earl of Mayo cannot be moved.  He was compelled to leave, but asked me to allow it stand over until to-morrow.  He asked me to ask the permission of the Seanad that it should stand over until to-morrow. If that is the wish of the Seanad will some member formally move the adjournment?</P>
