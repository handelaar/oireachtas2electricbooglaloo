      <P>I wish to say with regard to these two Bills that they raise a matter of very considerable importance, having regard to what the future practice and procedure is to be in regard to Bills of the kind.  Under the Standing Orders the Second Stage has to be formally moved, and, if objected to, the Second Stage stands over for another day.  When moved on the second day, if again it is objected to, it then becomes the duty of the Chairman to fix a day upon which the question of the Second Reading has to be and must be debated.  There is no limit of time imposed upon the Chairman as regards the date which he would fix, and, in view of the fact that from unavoidable reasons the promoters of these Bills have been unduly delayed in getting ahead with them, I have come to the conclusion that no time should be lost in fixing a definite and immediate date upon which the Second Stage is to be discussed.  As far as I can understand from the business available in the Dáil, there would be nothing for the Seanad to do next week.  Consequently, if I were to postpone the day for taking the Second Reading of these two Bills until the next meeting of the Seanad, I might be imposing upon the promoters a delay of another fortnight.  I am not prepared to do that.  Therefore, I shall ask the Seanad either to take the Second Reading of these two Bills before we conclude to-day or, as the only alternative, to ask the Seanad to meet to-morrow for that purpose and for that purpose only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to that course, I am in the hands of the Seanad, but I have made up my mind that these must be proceeded with either at the end of the business to-day or else that they must be proceeded with to-morrow.  May I just say this&mdash;I am not, of course, speaking in any way in reference to the merits of these Bills; I know nothing whatever about them, and I need hardly say I am in no way interested in them directly or indirectly&mdash;but I do think it is very important that we should be very careful as regards the way in which we are dealing with these, the very first of the Private Bills which come before us.  If the idea gets abroad that the Seanad is not prepared to give <Col N="63" /> facilities to promoters for having their Bills sent to Committees and properly discussed, it may cause a good deal of discontent and may interfere with the progress of such Bills in future.  I would just like to point out to Senators that they ought not to overlook this. It is not at all usual in other places to block the passage through the Second Stage of Private Bills unless for some grave inherent matter of principle.</P>
    <P>The reason of that is that the Bills are referred to Committees after they have passed the Second Stage, and everybody interested in opposing them has then a right to be heard and to attend either by himself or through Counsel and to state his objections in the fullest way before the Committee. They are, therefore, thrashed out in detail upon information, and upon evidence, and the fullest opportunity is given to everybody to ventilate any grievance or objection he may have.  I would suggest to Senators that they should be very slow in exercising their undoubted right to block these Bills at the Second Stage, because, as I have said, the effect may be to discourage promoters and to check the promotion of schemes, which may or may not be for the benefit of the community, but which will receive the fullest and fairest investigation before Committees upon evidence given in a formal way and after the whole matter has been thoroughly threshed out.  I am in the hands of the Seanad as to whether they will prefer to have these two Bills disposed of on the Second Stage at the conclusion of the business to-day or whether they should meet specially for that purpose to-morrow.</P>

    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;To add at the end of the section the words: &ldquo;This section shall not apply to persons who, by reason of disablement or infirmity are unable to contribute any service towards their support.&rdquo; The object of the amendment is to indicate that there is a difference in the description of old age pensioners.  Some old age pensioners are bedridden and incapable of performing any service whatever on their own behalf.  They have to obtain the assistance of a relative or of some other person to look after them.  Some of them are afflicted with severe illness, which makes it necessary that more money should be expended on their maintenance.  I commend the amendment to the favourable consideration of the Seanad and to the Minister in charge of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to exclude from the scope of the Bill as regards future rates, pensions granted on and after the first appointed date to persons who by reason of infirmity or disablement are unable to contribute any service towards their support.  Acceptance of the amendment would divide future claims into two classes&mdash;those within the scope of the amendment who would receive pensions at the old rate laid down in the Act of 1919, and those outside the scope of the amendment who would receive reduced pensions at the rate specified in this Bill.  This differentiation would cause a very considerable amount of trouble and delay in administering the Act.  It would make it necessary to establish medical boards, and it might result in quite a number of cases of alleged disablement or infirmity which previous to the passing of the Act did not exist.  In that way I think it would interfere very largely with the comfort of those old age pensioners who would be continually charging for their beds at the time the Pension Officer came in sight, and generally making their life an &ldquo;on the run&rdquo; sort of existence.  It appears to the Ministry, and in this matter I speak, of course, for the Minister for Finance&mdash;who in turn represents the views of the Executive Council&mdash;that enormous difficulties would arise if we were to accept this <Col N="67" /> amendment, and the number of persons affected would be impossible to estimate.</P>
      <P>It does appear to us that apart from the difficulties of setting up medical boards and the numerous complaints we would hear from reviews which would come before these medical boards, that anything of that sort or kind operates very much against the successful and smooth working of an Act such as this.  I have had a good deal of experience of the work of an Old Age Pensions Committee, as I was for a very considerable time a member of one.  Very few cases that I recollect came before us of persons who were unable to come before the Committee in any case where it was considered necessary for them to attend. Being unable to form any estimate of the number of persons affected, I am not in a position to say what the actual cost of this amendment would be.  I can only say, apart from the difficulties of administering it, there is the expense of the administration, and the benefits that would accrue would not be compensated for by the expense that the State would be put to in order that these persons would get any such benefit. I think it is a maxim in the administration of Government Departments that any extra expense should at least be compensated for by the advantages that would be derived by reason of that expense.  I have, therefore, to object to the amendment.</P>

      <Col N="68" /> SECTION 4, SUB-SECTION (3).</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any person who at the commencement of this Act is in receipt of a pension liable to be reviewed under this section and claims to be aggrieved by the review of that pension under this section, may appeal against such review to the local pension committee, who shall consider the matter and give their decision thereon in the same manner and subject to the like appeal to the central pension authority as if the review under this section was the report of a pension officer on a claim referred to him for report and inquiry under section 7 of the Act of 1908.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianORourke" hpid="Mr. O'ROURKE Mr. O'ROURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'ROURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To delete lines 24-27, inclusive, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;subject to appeal to the District Justice, the applicant to have the right to appear by friend, who need not be a member of the legal profession, and the pensions officer to represent the State at the appeal.  All appeals under previous Acts shall be dealt with in a similar manner.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a member of a Pension Committee since the Pensions Act was passed, and I find that there has been considerable objection to the system of appeal to the Local Government Department in Dublin.  Both the pensioners and the Committees object to it.  This arrangement would be much more unsatisfactory now as there are very few records of age available. At present the ordinary claimant has to satisfy the pensions officer by evidence, or by appearance.  The pensions officer says that he is not satisfied by appearance that the man is 70 years of age, the Committee appeal, and the case is sent up to Dublin.  The officials of the Local Government Department have nobody's word for it except the pensions officer, so that he is the sole arbitrator in the matter, and I think in all cases of doubt it would be much more convenient and much more satisfactory to have them tried by the District Justice.  There are many cases on the score of means where people would make statements before the pensions officer that they would not make in open court, and I think it would be the means of getting the pension for a <Col N="69" /> good many people who are entitled to it, and it would be the means of preventing a number of people from receiving pensions who are not entitled to them if this thing were done in open court.  I have put it in the amendment that the claimant should be allowed to be represented by a friend.  Most of them are very poor, and I think if they are unable to appear themselves, their son, nephew, niece, or a friend should be allowed to appear for them.  The pensions officer could look after the interests of the State, so that there would be no great costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is perhaps the most revolutionary proposal that has been put up.  It takes from the Minister for Local Government the right of deciding whether or not a person whose case is in dispute shall be entitled to a pension.  I put this to the Senator, that the pensions officers do exercise a generous discretion in dealing with these cases.  I should say that although I would not make that statement in public 10, 12, or 14 years ago, when I was in much the same position as the Senator, I did certainly make it in private.  My experience was that these officials were most exacting in seeing that an applicant for an old age pension got a fair deal, and his rights, and even more than that.  I knew an instance where one pensions officer, hearing of a case in the district of another officer, and knowing the circumstances of the person in question, went to the expense of having a search made in the Census Records in order to establish the case and my experience of the whole of them, with, I think, one exception in the city of Dublin, was that you could not honestly make a <Col N="70" /> good case against them.  You might make a platform case, but to make an honest case was quite another proposition. To turn that generously-minded person into the position of an objector to the pension, and to have the case discussed in open court, with all the information and all the resources of the State, would act to the disadvantage of an applicant for a pension, because the Minister for Finance is looking on and the officer must do his duty, and while he might have very generous consideration for the applicant behind closed doors he would be bound in the interests of the State to establish a case against the claim.  The position of the officers would be this, that while they are certainly hard-working and industrious in making up these cases&mdash;I speak from experience in that connection&mdash;they would be placed in the position of appearing in court and remaining there for some hours, the objects, I am sure, of very unwelcome attention and observations from the relatives and friends of the unfortunate applicant who would be appearing there to get justice.  It would, in my view, antagonise the public much more against the pensions officers than at present, and I am not satisfied, from my experience of these officials, that they do not exhaust every possible means to establish a case for the person in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my time I knew quite a number of persons not entitled by reason of age to the pension receiving it from the activities of a number of persons interested in doing what is called a good turn.  While there might have been some excuse for doing that when it did not actually fall on the tax-payers directly, there is certainly not the same excuse now, where we give statutory rights to people, and no more than statutory rights.  From all the information I can get from the Minister for Finance the expense of this change would be enormous; the number of cases that would come before the District Justices would be very much more numerous than those that at present come before the pensions officers. In the event of dissatisfaction, is there an appeal from the District Justices in cases of that sort, and what is to be the expense of an appeal in such an <Col N="71" /> event?  The Minister for Local Government can now be asked in the Dáil as to why he did not give favourable judgment in the case of a man who has a good case for an old age pension, and a list of cases put up there to the Minister places him in the position of having to justify any decision he gives. You are deprived of that if the cases are to go before the District Justices, and on the whole the Minister is not satisfied that the real interests of applicants for old age pensions would be served should this amendment pass, and consequently I have to oppose it.</P>

      <P>(1)  A person who is, or who, on the 1st day of January, 1924, was in receipt of a pension under Section 1 of the Blind Pensions Act, 1920, by virtue of a decision of the Central Authority based on evidence which included a certificate or other testimony of a medical practitioner certifying such person to be so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential (or in words being or accepted by the Central Authority as being of like effect) shall be deemed to have fulfilled and to continue to fulfil the statutory qualification of being so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential, unless the local pension committee or, on appeal, the Central Authority, are satisfied either</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  that the state of the pensioner's eyesight has substantially improved since the time of any <Col N="72" /> such medical certificate or other testimony as aforesaid and has become such as enables (or apart from personal circumstances other than eyesight would enable) the pensioner to perform a sufficient quantity of work for which eyesight is essential to constitute partial earning capacity in respect of such work, or</P>
    <P>(b)  that the said medical certificate or other testimony was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the pensioner, or</P>

      <P>The Blind Pensions Act of 1920 provided for the <Col N="73" /> grant of old-age pensions at the age of 50 years in the case of people who, in the words of the Act, are &ldquo;so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential.&rdquo; This means that people who are not actually stone-blind are in receipt of old age pensions at the age of 50.  It is true there are some people who are not stone-blind, but still are quite incapable of earning a livelihood by the work that they can perform.  Under the Blind Pensions Act wherever a pension was granted in such circumstances there was an appeal by the pensions officer to the central authority.  I am informed that no person who was not stone-blind has got the old age pension at the age of 50 unless by order of the central authority, except in the case of the inmates of institutions, where, I believe, the appeal was not enforced because the exact condition of the applicant was clearly defined.  I am now informed that these pensions are being reviewed all over the country, that the pensions officers are asking that the local committees shall review them with the object of withdrawing the pension, or, at all events, making the person concerned prove once more that he is entitled to it.  Of course, in the event of the Committee deciding in favour of the pensioner there is an appeal to the Minister or central authority. I fear that in view of the present hardened outlook of the Ministry in regard to all matters connected with finance that a less generous construction will be placed on the phrase, &ldquo;so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential&rdquo; than was previously the case, and the result will be that these afflicted people will be deprived of pensions which they have been enjoying for the last few years.  That, I think, would be a very deplorable state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Blind Pensions Act also gives the local authorities power to make arrangements to the satisfaction of the Minister for Health for promoting the welfare of blind persons ordinarily resident within the area.  That means that the local authorities have power to give facilities for training the blind and semi-blind, and also, as far as possible, for providing suitable work for <Col N="74" /> such persons.  It is well known that the Irish local authorities have not availed of that part of the Act, and consequently these people have not been given facilities for earning a livelihood that they would have had had these arrangements been made.  Cases have been mentioned to me of persons who are totally blind in one eye, and have a cataract on the other.  That is not at all an uncommon state of affairs. At certain periods the cataract subsides, and if that person were examined medically at that particular time he might be proved to be capable of work. Invariably, however, the cataract returns, and a condition almost equivalent to stone-blindness obtains.  If a person during the temporary recovery of the sight of one eye is driven to perform work which he was not doing previously it inevitably hastens the complete stone-blindness of both eyes.  I do not think that such a state of affairs should be encouraged.  As I stated already, any of the pensions now paid have been paid after very mature consideration, and with the knowledge and confirmation of the central authority.</P>
    <P>It would be deplorable, except in the circumstances mentioned in the amendment, if any of these pensions were withdrawn.  In case they have been withdrawn already, the amendment proposes that the finding shall not operate pending a re-hearing under the conditions laid down in this proposed new section, and that if the pension is eventually withdrawn it shall be stated why it was withdrawn, and whether it was under any of these conditions mentioned here.  I am afraid that there is a danger of putting a less humane construction on the conditions under which the pension may be given than was previously the case, and officials anxious to become noted for economies effected at the price of humanity may be disposed to go a little too far in cases of this kind.  If we can only balance our Budget by laying rude hands on the pensions enjoyed by these people who have been deprived by nature of, perhaps, one of her greatest and most beautiful gifts it will be an indication of a very sorry state of affairs indeed.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister will give consideration to this amendment, because it in no way hampers the activities <Col N="75" /> of the Department.  It merely ensures that there shall be a clear and definite statement as to why the pensions are withdrawn from any of those afflicted people, in the event of their being withdrawn as a result of the reviews now taking place.</P>

      <P>The Senator has made his appeal in a very able and moving manner, but I do not think he has laid before the House, naturally, from his point of view, the real facts of the case in relation to those blind pensioners.  So far as leniency and generosity should be observed in the administration of these pensions, I am altogether with him, but I have knowledge that a very large amount of misrepresentation has been indulged in in regard to these pensions, and that has been possible by virtue of the fact that the medical officers who have examined these applicants for blind pensions have not been equipped with the necessary appliances by which they can make a satisfactory and thorough examination. I am informed that certain special instruments are required.  They are not at present available, and medical officers are dependent, or almost entirely dependent, on the statements and the ability of the claimant to read certain letters.  Knowing that there has been a very large amount of misrepresentation, and that a number of people have obtained these pensions who are not entitled to them, I do not think that this House, in the interests of the taxpayer, should shut the door to a review of these cases.  That is another matter altogether, apart from generosity and giving the benefit of the doubt to bona fide applicants.  I heard of cases on good authority the other day where a re-examination was taking place, and it was found that a number of the persons to be re-examined were weeping. There was a peculiar discharge from their eyes, and the medical officer examined this discharge and found it was brought about by peat ash which had been inserted into the eyes for the purpose of the examination.  I would not mention that except I had every reason to believe it was the case.  If there is any possibility of misrepresentation of <Col N="76" /> that kind, I think it is very necessary for this State to have power to review all these cases.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the amendment.  As the Senator has pointed out, his amendment provides for dealing with cases where there has been abuse, misrepresentation, or want of skill on the part of the medical officer who gave the certificate. I think the lot of the person who is not stone-blind but so blind as to render him unable to earn his living is very hard.  The fact that there have been cases of abuse and misrepresentation should not debar deserving cases. The general feeling through the country is that the Local Government Department, or the Department responsible, is rather inclined to take a harsh view and to exclude all but those who are absolutely stone-blind.  If we had some assurance that that is not so it might alter our viewpoint, but in the absence of the assurance that pensioners who are not absolutely stone-blind but so blind as to debar them from earning their living will not be excluded, I will support this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes that where pensions were granted by the Ministry of Local Government on the certificates of local medical practitioners, they should not be withdrawn unless the pensioner's sight has improved since the date of the medical certificate or that the pensioner is now of partial earning capacity, or that the original certificate was fraudulently obtained or issued.  An inter-departmental committee considered in 1922 the whole administration of the Blind Pensions Act, and it reported that although many pensioners had obtained certificates from local medical men they did not fulfil the statutory conditions.  As a result of this report a general review of pensions under the Act was ordered, and is now in progress.  All doubtful cases are being examined by a medical inspector of the Ministry of Local Government, who, I understand, was <Col N="77" /> obliged to undergo a course in ophthalmic surgery, and he got the necessary instruments before he was dispatched on this work.  I am informed that in any case where there is a doubt the pensioner gets the benefit of it.  We all know that that particular examination ought to be complete.  The object of the amendment is, so far as I can judge, to take as a standard whatever certificate was given at the time the person applied for his pension, and I think you are not fulfilling the obligation of the statute by that.  That is not what is the law.  I do not know that it would improve matters to have special reasons given for withdrawing the pension. I think that the Pensions Committees or the Ministry of Local Government, when exercising their judgment on matters of this sort, ought to fulfil the statutory obligation, which is that the pensioner is so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential.  In this connection, as some harsh things have been said about the administration of this Act, I have had an examination made, and I find that no conditions of hardship exist which would render the amendment either useful or necessary. The inspection of cases on appeal, after questions are raised, is carried out by the medical inspector who has taken out this special course which I have mentioned.  I think it would be of advantage to describe how this Act operates in England and Wales, in Scotland, and in the Irish Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The population of the Irish Free State is 3,139,688.  The number of blind pensions payable on the 30th June was 3,282.  The proportion of pensions to the total population was one in 956, and the approximate cost £80,050.  It can be observed that it is not a service in which any economy, however great it may be, is a matter of very great importance.  In Scotland the population is 4,760,904.  The number of blind pensions payable on the 30th June was 1,436, or a proportion of one in 3,315, and the cost to Scotland was £35,900.  In England and Wales the population is 36,700,492.  The number of blind pensions payable on the 30th June was 9,333, and the proportion of pensions to the total population was one in 3,864, and the approximate cost <Col N="78" /> was £233,325.  These figures unquestionably establish the case that we are either suffering from a greater infirmity in the matter of eyesight than either England, Scotland or Wales, or that it has been much easier to establish a case for a pension in this country than in the others.  I think in the circumstances, the case for the amendment can scarcely be justified.  I would put this as a final shot, that recently some examination of emigrants to America was undertaken by some particular trust over there, and to Ireland was attributed the greatest number of cases of insanity and other infirmities.  I do not believe that that is the case.  But we do establish cases like that if items such as those I have given to you about eyesight are scattered broadcast.  We are not, in my firm belief and opinion, a less healthy race than any other race, and it is a mistake to make the case that we are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment does not prevent the Government seeking a review of these cases, and sub-section (c) makes it possible for a review if it can be proved that the said medical certificate was given with want of carefulness or professional skill. That meets the point made by Senator Sir John Keane and the President.  The President's speech quite unintentionally is an incitement to the officials who are reviewing those cases to deal somewhat ruthlessly with appeals, because he has quoted those statistics which might be presented in quite a different light if the real circumstances could be explored, but they will be taken at their face value, and naturally the officials will feel it is an authority to them to deal in a ruthless manner with this percentage of blind pensions granted in Ireland.  I think it has been established that Ireland has a greater proportion of insane among her population than any other country, and certainly it is not disputed that Ireland has a greater amount of tuberculosis than any other country except, perhaps, India.  The President might have quoted those figures to show that Ireland should only have the same proportion as obtained elsewhere.  I do not know whether there is any particular prevalency of <Col N="79" /> eye diseases here.  There may be a certain explanation of it, but at all events this particular amendment does not prevent a review, and all it asks is that there shall be stated the reason the pension is withdrawn.  It is possible that some people might do work even when blind if that work is available, but seeing that no such work is provided for <Col N="80" /> people so afflicted they might as well be blind.  A man might be blind and be a piano tuner.  We have heard of blind typists, and so on, but unless the work is convenient to their homes it is impossible for blind people to embark upon it, and it is to see that there will be no undue hardship on them that I have moved this amendment.</P>

      <P>The object of the amendments is, that where the Poor Law Valuation of a holding is £10 or less, if an applicant had other means, the holding should not be included in calculating his means.  All Governments have recognised that holdings in this country of a valuation of £10 or under are uneconomic and the valuations are in a great many cases erroneous.  They were fixed a long time ago, and evidently were based on the area.  In the west, north-west and south-west, there are patches of worthless land, composed of rocks and bog, which might comprise an area of ten, fifteen or twenty acres, in which there would not be one acre of arable land.  Such holdings being uneconomic, it is reasonable to ask that they should not be calculated as means.  I will ask the Seanad to pass the amendments, and I hope the President will accept them.</P>

At present these people are feeling the pinch of poverty very keenly; in fact, they are almost in a state of destitution owing to the failure of the fishing industry and the cottage industries.  Although economy and retrenchment are very necessary, I do not think they ought to be effected at the expense of these poor people, and I would appeal to the President to deal as generously and as sympathetically as he can with the amendments.</P>

      <P>That would seem to be a very great benefit to holders of very small portions of land, which of course may be uneconomic, but we know that plenty of people who have got small pensions or other small means will have every penny of it calculated in the £18.  Why should we take one section of the community merely because they have a piece of land and say they are to be treated better than all the rest of the people? I think that it would certainly be held to be a hardship if a man who has got a small pension is to have every penny of his pension calculated against him, while the man who holds a small piece of land has not that taken into calculation.</P>

      <P>I do not know exactly what the capital value of a holding with a valuation of £10 would be, but I presume it would be in or about £100. For argument's sake, say it is.  If the owner of such a holding sold for £100 in cash, for the purpose of calculating pension, under the Bill as it stands, the first £25 of that would be free.  The other £75 would be assessed at 10 per cent.  and he would be considered to have an income of £7 10s. from that £100.  I do not exactly see where the difference lies between that man and the man who has means in the form of land, why the man with land should get off scot-free and the man who had converted into cash would be looked upon as a person with means amounting to £7 10s.  There seems to be want of balance there.

      <P>This amendment is one which the Minister for Finance might give favourable consideration to, and I should say he would be inclined to do so in cases of this sort were the circumstances different from what they are.  I take it in the same way as holders of property having a larger valuation than £10, that we might divide the holders under £10 valuation into three classes&mdash;the uneconomic class, the class that is scarcely economic, and scarcely uneconomic, and a class that is economic. As regards the uneconomic class referred to by Senator MacLoughlin, they are not affected whether this amendment is passed or not.  If the holding be uneconomic obviously there have been no savings.  I do not exactly say that the individual occupying the holding, if his affairs be such that the yearly value, whatever the income, is negligible, is not affected by it.  In the same way, people in the second class, who are just able to live, are not affected by it.  We come to the third class, in which a person having a holding with a yearly valuation under £10 has got other means.  That person does not come within the circle mentioned by Senator MacLoughlin.  There is a sufficiency of means there to qualify him for having them entered up against him in considering his pension.  One could more easily weigh up the advantage or disadvantage of the amendment if we took two holdings side by side, in one of which there was poverty by reason of the owner having no other property except the holding, under £10 valuation, <Col N="84" /> and whatever little stock there is on it, while the person living alongside had other property which was bringing in an income independent of the holding altogether.  In that case what was in the mind of the Senator when he put down this amendment is not affected. That was, that the means of these people were so small as to qualify them for the maximum pension.</P>
      <P>In that case I think the Minister for Finance in years to come, when we hope the revenue of the State will bear a much more favourable proportion of the cost of this service than it does at the present moment, would be entitled to make a recommendation that would make these people a little better off than they are.  Just now I think it would be unfair to discriminate in favour of persons who really do not require the discrimination, the discrimination not being of any use to the class mentioned by the Senator, as that class will get the benefit of the full pension of nine shillings.  I do not think the purpose the Senator had in mind, which was to protect the poorer classes, would be effected.  That purpose would be only effected in the case of those who had means other than the holding.  The figures mentioned by Senator Kenny are correct substantially.  The yearly value of the holding is not sufficient to disqualify a person from the maximum payment under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusIrwin" hpid="Mr. IRWIN Mr. IRWIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. IRWIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the President does not see his way to accept the amendment.  Senator Jameson was arguing on the exception rather than on the rule.  All who are acquainted with the West and North-West of Ireland know what an uneconomic holding is.  Senator Kenny took too high a figure when he said that an uneconomic holding was worth ten times the Poor Law Valuation.  That is a fallacy.  It has no such value.  As I explained, the valuations are misleading. When valuers are sent down the country they must put some value on a holding, and to put a value on something that is not productive is misleading and wrong.  In no case did the valuer return and say that there were holdings in Galway, Mayo and <Col N="85" /> Donegal worth nothing.  The valuers value them, not on the merits of the land, but on the area.  The President made his case mainly on the exceptions that people with small holdings have other small means.  We are legislating then for the exceptions and to the detriment of the many.  I think in another section of the Bill the people I want to exclude by my amendment are excluded if they transfer a holding. Under Section 7, if the owners assign, convey or transfer holdings in a legal and <i>bona fide</i> way they escape having the valuation included in the calculation of means.  In effect, that is putting it into the people's heads to do something for the purpose of evading the Act.  That is one of the things that I am sure the President will amend, now that his attention has been drawn to it.  I hope he will undertake to look into the matter and amend it on the next Stage.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question that arises under Section 6, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  In calculating the income mentioned in paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Act of 1911, no account shall be taken of any amounts received during a period of not more than six months in any year by a person or by the husband or wife of a person (as the case may be) under a medical certificate as sickness benefit or disablement benefit from a Friendly Society or a Trade Union or under the National Insurance Act, 1911.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to know whether that covers superannuation benefit paid by trades unions to members unfit to follow their occupations when past the age of 70 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I am afraid that would be an income.  Superannuation is an income, and as such I do not see any way whereby you could exclude it and include other sums as superannuation.  The proposal, I take it, would be to exclude from means superannuation paid from trades unions.  I do not think that could be done.  Superannuation from a trades union, I take it, is equivalent to thrift, such as savings.  If a man has built up <Col N="86" /> this advantage I cannot see how you can exclude it from means.</P>

If my amendment is carried it will ensure that the under-sheriff or his assistants shall supply a copy of the warrant, even though it should not be demanded, and I think that that operation will not entail any great expense or inconvenience on the sheriff.  It will have this effect, that in the case of debtors who do not know the law and who do not know that they are entitled to a copy of the warrant if they ask <Col N="87" /> for it, will be supplied with it.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>An identical amendment to this was moved in the Dáil, and I opposed it as unnecessary and as possibly dangerous.  I took the view that no person acting in good faith is going to refrain from asking men who come to his house and proceed to remove furniture, who they are and what they are, and why they are removing property.  But if you write into the Bill that this warrant must in all circumstances be produced you possibly put into the hands of a fraudulent debtor a very formidable and very effective weapon.  If he simply avoids giving to the under-sheriff and his officers an opportunity of producing the warrant, they have to mark time until he gives them that opportunity. No further steps can be taken to execute the decree.  As I say, I regard the amendment as unnecessary.  The first and most natural thing for a person to do, when his house is entered by a stranger who proceeds to take away property, is to ask him who he is and why he is taking the property.  That is a demand within the meaning of the Section.  I cannot visualise anyone refraining from asking such a question except for the deliberate purpose of evading the law.  The words which the Senator seeks to delete were in the Act of last year, and I know of no case of hardship that occurred under the Act, which was in force for six months of last year.  If the Senator knows of any case I will be glad to hear it.  I think there is a possible consequence of the amendment to which the Senator did not advert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amendment is inserted, and if the debtor purposely refrains from asking, or purposely makes it impossible for the bailiff to show his authority, just as men succeed every day in evading the personal service of a writ, then under the amendment nothing more could be done to execute the judgment.  In that way the Senator, quite unconsciously, would put a very powerful and effective weapon into the <Col N="88" /> hands of a fraudulent debtor.  He would only have to refrain from making any demand for the authority of the bailiff, and then the bailiff or other officers would simply have to wait there in the hope that at some time the debtor might decide to ask the bailiff for his authority.</P>

      <P>I do not quite see the force of the argument used by the Minister, because even if the debtor is not present or if he does not make his appearance we have already in the Section the words &ldquo;(or other the person in apparent possession of the land and premises upon which he or they shall enter).&rdquo;  The absence of the debtor would not invalidate the action of the sheriff.  I cannot see any difference in a case where a debtor knows the law and demands from the sheriff a copy of the warrant and to be shown the original, and the other case of a poor, ignorant debtor who does not know anything about this.  It is not the custom for persons who are visited by parties to rely upon what they say as to whom they represent.  People visit houses and they do not tell who they really are; they represent themselves as being somebody else.  I do not think that the amendment would in any way interfere with the actions of the sheriff in recovering lawful debts, and, in any case, you will ensure that the sheriff will provide himself with a copy because he will anticipate that the demand will be made on him, and it will not be very much of an addition to his work if he supplies a copy whether it is asked for or not.  I am sorry that the Minister could not accept this simple amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>You have to legislate in the face of facts, and the Senator has drawn a picture of a poor, ignorant debtor and a presumably rascally under-sheriff.  The big fact when this Bill was being drafted was that throughout the country you had something in the nature of an organised campaign against the decrees of the courts.  You had a figure of £170,000 represented in outstanding decrees, in decrees in the hands of the under-sheriffs, and up to the present there has gone on something like an elaborate game between the under-sheriff and the judgment <Col N="89" /> debtor, with the dice heavily loaded against the under-sheriff, the officer of the courts.  He was hedged round with restrictions and conditions which, no doubt, were sound and excellent in a more normal situation, but which are utterly inapplicable to the existing situation.  The Senator's amendment simply means that a man whose house is situated in a good tactical position, commanding a view of two or three miles of road, who keeps a sharp look-out for the under-sheriff and his officers, and manages to be not at home when they call, is literally above the law, immune, because, unless he is at home to receive the service, as it were, of the warrant&mdash;to have the warrant produced to him&mdash;the decree could not be executed.  I wrote into the Bill a perfectly fair provision, that when challenged for their authority, when asked why they are removing the goods, on whose instigation they are acting, they shall produce the warrant on demand. It is a perfectly fair and perfectly sound provision, and it meets all the real necessities of the case.  The Senator's amendment, quite unconsciously, I am sure, puts a very real and very powerful weapon into the hands of a tricky, fraudulent debtor.  The simple device of being not at home to callers, when callers happen to be the officers of the courts, puts him absolutely above and clear of the law.  I opposed the amendment in the Dáil; I thought I had given very adequate reasons for that position.  I am prepared to take it that the Senator has not had time to read the proceedings of that Assembly, and consequently I am repeating at some length the arguments I used in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I hope it is not to be taken from the Minister's speech that we are expected to read the whole proceedings in the other House, for we have sufferings enough without having to do that, but I would suggest that the Minister's speech would be quite all right if we were merely debating metaphysics.  He has opposed the amendment merely on its technicalities. I quite appreciate his argument that if it were inserted as drafted it might place in the hands of a fraudulent debtor a formidable weapon, but surely <Col N="90" /> it is not outside the wit of the Minister if he wished to accept the spirit of the amendment to prevent any such weapon being placed in the hands of any debtor.  For instance, he might easily insert a provision whereby the proper authority would be produced to the debtor, or other persons in apparent possession, or to anybody present. I cannot suggest the words just now, but, at all events, it is not outside the mental powers of the Minister to prescribe a provision taking away this power of abuse.  The Minister seems to think that everybody who owes a debt, and possibly some who do not, know the whole law.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides that the residences of people who do not owe any debt at all may be entered.  Simply because the sub-sheriff has reason to suspect that they may be concealing the property of people who owe a debt and against whom there is a judgment made, he can break into their houses and seize the goods.  I do not think it is too much to request that in all these cases, whether requested or not, the authority shall be produced.  The section of the Bill provides for the employment of what may be termed free-booters, a number of men who may not require to have any particular qualifications, but simply at the whim of any under-sheriff a band of any type of men he may like are collected to carry out these duties, which undoubtedly are not pleasant ones, and for which the best type of men are not going to offer themselves.  They are an irregular band formed to deal with a somewhat irregular situation, and I think there should be some protection afforded to those who may come within their range of operations, even if they are debtors, or people who are not debtors, but are suspected of concealing property that may belong to somebody who owes a debt.  I suggest that the Minister should deal with this in the spirit rather than in the mere letter of the amendment.</P>

I do not know exactly whether one part of this contradicts the other, or whether you come to a deadlock there.  The bailiff goes in, and he apparently waits for a demand, but I would suggest that the Minister should leave out the words &ldquo;immediately upon entry and before seizure&rdquo; to produce his warrant to whoever is in apparent possession.  I think that is the ordinary procedure in any case where officers of the law, whether they be police or other officers, enter a man's house to do a certain thing. They may be men in disguise, disguised as policemen or others, and they may not be the persons they represent themselves to be at all.  I think it is entirely due to the protection of the citizen in his own house, that anyone coming in the guise or the name of the law should on entry into his house, forcibly or otherwise, show his authority without demand at all.</P>

      <P>We are talking about shadows, not substantial things. In practice what happens is that the officers of the sheriff on going into a house announce that they have come to take certain property.  The scene that takes place is not this, that the sheriff enters the house and says to the woman of the house: &ldquo;We have come to take your piano,&rdquo; and she says: &ldquo;Yes, that is all right.&rdquo;  That is not what happens; what she says is: &ldquo;Who are you, and why do you want my piano?  On whose instructions do you come?&rdquo;  In practice, in ninety-nine and nine-tenths of cases, the business that takes place immediately on entry is that the officers state their business and produce their authority.  These words are entered to meet a particular case of evasion of the law, and to meet the possibility of the court officers being deliberately and of malice aforethought denied the opportunity of producing their warrant of authority.  It is not that they would not have their warrant of authority with them, and that they would not normally, and, as a matter of course, produce it, but if you write into this that in all circumstances that warrant must be produced, then you make it in <Col N="92" /> the interests of the fraudulent or tricky judgment debtor to give no opportunity to have it produced.  It was because of that consideration we opposed the amendment in the Dáil, and it is because of that consideration I oppose the amendment here, not that, as a matter of course, automatically, the warrant will not be produced by the court officers on going to a place, but because if you write in that it must inevitably and invariably be produced, then some tricky judgment debtor will tumble to the fact that if only he can deny to the officers an opportunity of producing that warrant the execution cannot proceed.  I thought I had made that plain.  It is, in my opinion, at any rate, a perfectly reasonable position.  I want Senators to be quite clear in their minds that the practice invariably will be that the officers proceeding to make a seizure will produce their authority.</P>

The case I have in mind is this: the debtor, perfectly bona fide, is absent at the time the entry is actually made; he goes to his house after the seizure.  Why should he not be entitled then to insist on the warrant being produced?  He would not be entitled in your section, because the section says, &ldquo;immediately upon entry and before seizure.&rdquo;  I suggest that you strike out the words from &ldquo;seizure&rdquo; down to &ldquo;entry&rdquo; and put in the words &ldquo;at any time after entry and before removal.&rdquo;</P>

I think when the Bill was going through the Dáil no amendment was moved to alter the time limit to 48 hours.  The section provides that within 48 hours no sale is to take place. When you come to Section 7, however, you find a time limit of 24 hours.  In the Dáil, I believe, an amendment was moved to substitute 72 hours for 24 hours, but it was rejected.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The object underlying the sub-section is to ensure that the seized goods shall be sold under the most favourable circumstances in the interests of both the debtor and the creditor.  I find myself in much the same difficulty with regard to this amendment as in regard to the previous one.  The amendment, I submit, is drafted with insufficient advertence to reality.  Senator Linehan naively says that this notice should be given to the judgment debtor so that he may have an opportunity to see that his goods are sold to the best advantage.  I submit in practice, speaking for most areas, the result of such notice would be rather to secure to the judgment debtor an opportunity of seeing that his goods were not sold at all.  Senators know that I am speaking facts, that the arguments urged in favour of the amendment are excellent in theory and eminently sound in Plato's republic, but that in this country at this time they simply do not hold water, and that the result of the amendment which I suggest is more likely to be the more real result than the result which the Senator claims to desire.  The debtor, it should be remembered, will already have had more <Col N="95" /> than sufficient warning.  He will have been pressed by the creditor probably for a considerable time.  He will have been brought to court on a decree.  He will be pressed again by the creditor's solicitor to pay the decree, and finally the under-sheriff will probably ask him two or three times before he decides on seizure.  This question of an extra 24 hours gives an opportunity to defeat the law.  We are all familiar with the process.  When the local auction was obligatory, and the three days' notice had to be given, the judgment debtor and his friends took very practical measures to ensure that the man who would come to bid for the property would need to be a good man with his hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The net result of that was that people bidding at a sheriff's auction expected to get a very considerable reduction for the moral and physical courage which they showed in going to bid at all, and when the judgment debtor's goods were sold at an auction of that kind, they were sold to the worst possible advantage of the judgment debtor.  This other process cuts away from that arrangement.  It enables under-sheriffs to sell the seized property in the open market with no notification that the property sold is property seized by the under-sheriff, and in that way the real advantage lies with the judgment debtor whose property would be sold at a fair price. A buyer will not be looking for a discount because of any great moral or physical courage he will be required to show.  You remove all that advantage if Senator Linehan's amendment is accepted.  You give time to the debtor in a short-sighted way to organise opposition to the sale.  I suggest what would happen in seven cases out of ten is that some hardy person looking for a bargain would buy very cheaply because of the courage necessary.</P>

When the debtor allows a matter to come to this crisis where all his goods are being seized and where it is necessary to seize the property of his parent, wife, or child, I do not think he can be much of a mark as a man from whom any substantial sum can be recovered, and I think instead of the action being against the debtor it ought to be against the creditor who will take the risk of authorising the sheriff to seize this property, when it is proved by the action those persons will take in court, that the property is theirs.</P>

      <P>While I think there is a good deal to be said for the amendment of Senator Linehan as to the person who suffers from the seizure having only redress against the debtor or creditor, I think it would be preferable if the Minister could give some undertaking that in a case where under this Section substantial injustice was inflicted on a third party, the Government should do something better.  When this was being discussed in the Dáil a suggestion was made to that effect by Deputy Heffernan, and it was pointed out and not denied by the Minister that it was inevitable.  There were cases in which the sheriffs were seizing goods which they believed belonged to the debtor, but in some cases property was seized which did not belong to the debtor.  In that case the only redress under the Bill against a creditor or a debtor would be a bad remedy, and it was suggested that the Government should see their way, in some cases, to give compensation.  That was supported by a good many Deputies and, if I am right, I think the Minister gave an undertaking to consider why it would not be possible for the Government to meet those views in <Col N="98" /> some respects.  I think he also gave an undertaking that if he could bring forward an amendment to that effect, he would notify the Deputy who moved the amendment.  Subsequently I think the Minister said he did not see his way to accept an amendment giving expression to the views I represent.  He said he had notified the Deputy.  He telegraphed to the Deputy, but it appeared the only notice the Deputy had got was a letter, and so he was not in a position to move an amendment.  The Deputy was not satisfied with the Section as it stood.  It was pressed to a division, and the amendment was lost.  In view of the expression of opinion given here in support of the view taken in the Dáil, I would ask the Government to consider the possibility of awarding compensation.</P>

      <P>To deal adequately with the Senator's amendment I would need to say something on the section generally.  One of the best known methods of defeating Court judgments and the officers responsible for their execution in the past was the fraudulent third-party claim.  Every under-sheriff in the country knows that device intimately. The fraudulent third-party claim was particularly effective and particularly insidious, because, I might say, of the utter impossibility of disproving it.  You have a family living in a house.  The under-sheriff and his officers come along to make a seizure for debt incurred by the head of the family and he is told that the particular property is the absolute property of the wife, or possibly of the son or daughter, as the case may be.  That is a very difficult case to disprove legally. There may be in the mind of the under-sheriff a complete absence of credence. There generally would be, I imagine, but to disprove the claim is another thing.  I ask Senators to glance at one aspect of it, the equitable rather than the strictly legal aspect of it.  Debts for the most part would be incurred in respect of goods by which all the family benefited, and in fact the equities of the case lie rather with the judgment creditor than even with the third party making the claim.  The vast majority of decrees would be given in respect of debts incurred with local <Col N="99" /> traders for household necessities of one kind or another&mdash;groceries or requirements for the household generally&mdash; and all the members of the household would in fact have benefited by the purchase of the goods.</P>
      <P>When an under-sheriff comes along to execute his judgment in respect of that debt he is met by a claim that particular property in the house belongs absolutely to the wife or to the son, as the case may be.  That device was being practised to such an extent that it was necessary to meet it and meet it by a provision in law.  I could not say in response to the Deputy in the Dáil, any more than I can here now, that it is absolutely out of the question that under the provisions of this section as it stands a mistake would not be made and hardship would not be incurred. I can say this, that without making provision in the Bill for it, if I were satisfied that by the operations of the law, the <i>bona fide</i> operations of the law, hardship were inflicted on any individual I would be willing to consider that matter on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis, and to make my recommendation to the Minister for Finance.  But, if you attempt to insert in the Bill provision for such a case, then you simply invite fraud and to a large extent you nullify the objects of the section as it stands. Senator Linehan suggests that the action should lie against the creditor rather than the debtor.  Of course, if action is to lie against the judgment creditor, then in fact the under-sheriff will not seize goods to which a third party puts up a claim, however frivolous or however obviously false.  He will not bring into risk, as it were, his principal.  He will not put within the possibility of an action the judgment creditor on whose behalf he is executing the judgment.  He certainly will not do it without referring to the fact that such a claim is made to the judgment creditor and asking him what he thinks about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment will, in fact, perpetuate the fraud which is the main weapon in the armoury.  Out through the country when this Bill was being framed you had unexecuted decrees to the sum of £170,000, and that arrear <Col N="100" /> figure was on the increase.  We have got to ask where was it all tending.  I said on one occasion in the Dáil that the first symptom of a crumbling civilisation was the failure of the bailiff to function, and for that was taken rather severely to task.  But it is true.  We have got either to regulate our lives by the law, or by the stone axe, or on the physical plane that men will hold what they have by the strong hand or lose it by the weak hand.  We have to choose between the law or the stone axe. If we choose the law then the writ of the courts must run, and the judgments of the courts must be executed.  It must not lie with tricky or fraudulent people by various devices or a combination of devices to defeat the law.  We have arrived at a stage when brainy people discovered various little devices by which the law could be effectively held up and effectively defeated.  We simply have to meet those devices according to our best judgment, and according to the best advice we can get from our officials.  If the solution which this Bill purports to provide is not perfect&mdash;and being just the product of a human institution it is unlikely to be perfect&mdash;you have got to ask yourself whether it is not important, whether the balance of gain is not in favour of the provisions of the Bill, rather than in favour of a continuance of the state of affairs with which we were faced throughout the country; whether at any rate the Bill in its tendencies is not for good, whether it does not make to remove an evil which was serious intrinsically and serious in its tendency. I did admit in the Dáil the possibility of hardship and of mistake, and stated there that if definitely convinced that such hardship or mistake occurred I, as one Minister, would favourably consider that on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis.  I could not go beyond that.  I think it is a reasonable stand to take in the matter.</P>

      <P>I ask the leave of the Seanad to move an Amendment of which I have given private notice&mdash;Section 16, sub-section 2, to add at the end of the sub-section these words:&mdash;&ldquo;and shall be removed from that office on his refusal to execute any legal decree or warrant.&rdquo;  Hitherto the amendments proposed have been rather to soften the Act as against the judgment debtor. My experience&mdash;perhaps I am only open to representations from one quarter&mdash; is that the Act is not sufficiently stringent. I have information that there are a large number of decrees in parts of the country awaiting execution. For some reason or other&mdash;which perhaps the Minister might explain&mdash; they are not executed.  I have also had experience of a case where after great difficulty and almost by a system of insidious bribery an officer living some distance from the scene was induced or rather promised to execute a decree for ejectment. Later on pressure was brought to bear on him and he was prevailed on not to do so.  Of course if officers are allowed to exercise their own judgment and to introduce political or any other motives in reference to their actions it makes <Col N="102" /> the whole thing a perfect farce, and the crumbling of civilisation to which the Minister refers is a reality.  It is undoubtedly unpleasant to have to execute decrees in certain cases, but surely an officer when he accepts the appointment knows that he will have unpleasant duties to perform.  Any attempt to introduce a partisan spirit reduces the whole thing to a farce.  I would ask the Minister to consider this amendment or to give some assurance that dismissal would automatically follow refusal to execute a legal warrant.</P>

      <P>I received this amendment a few moments ago, and I have listened to the Senator's arguments in its favour.  Personally I am in the fullest agreement with the amendment, but I would be slow to agree that we ought to write into a Bill anything so obvious as that an officer of the courts shall be removed from his office on refusing to execute a decree or a judgment of the Courts.  That is what the amendment amounts to.  I think, on reflection, that the Senator will see that, while expressing an excellent and an essentially sound principle, that in fact the principle is so excellent and the sentiment so sound that we would be rather stultifying ourselves by writing it into our legislation.  If any case is brought to my notice of a responsible official of the courts refusing to execute a judgment of the courts it can be dealt with.  It can be dealt with direct by me, and, as a matter of fact, the judgment creditor has his remedy at law for such a state of affairs.  I feel that the amendment ought not to be accepted by the Seanad, while I thoroughly agree that an officer refusing to execute a judgment should be removed.</P>

      <P>Before the House proceeds to discuss this Bill I think I ought to mention that I have received a communication from the Joint Committee on Standing Orders.  It is to the effect that they are recommending to the House the adoption of the following additional Standing Orders in connection with Private Bills:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That no member of either House in or before the Dáil or the Seanad or any Committee of the Whole House be entitled to vote upon any Private Bill in which he is personally interested, pecuniarily or otherwise.</P>
      <P>(2)  That no member of either House should bring forward, promote or advocate in the Oireachtas any proceeding or measure in which he may have acted or be concerned for or in consideration of any fee or any pecuniary reward.</P>
      <P>(3)  That no member of either House should act as Parliamentary Agent or in the capacity of counsel in the matter of any Private Bills or other proceedings in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Probably when we meet next these will appear before you for reference, either to adopt them or to refer them to your own Committee on the Standing Orders, but I thought I would mention them now, because I think it would be fitting that we should have regard to them in the discussions that may, or may not, take place on the Second Reading of these Bills to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>As Chairman of the Joint Committee I might point out that we did not definitely suggest that these should be made Standing Orders; we simply passed these as Resolutions expressing our opinion of what should be <Col N="105" /> the practice, and we sent a copy to the Chairman of each House, leaving it to each House to decide, as was the case in England, whether they would pass Resolutions to that effect, or, as in the case of South Africa, introduce a Bill to give legal effect to them.  We passed them in the hope that pending a joint decision on the question they would be adopted in general practice.  I formally move that the Dublin Electricity Supply Bill, 1924, be read a second time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for a ruling as to whether or not it is in order for this to be put, in view of the fact that the Standing Order provides that private business shall be taken at the beginning of each day, prior to public business. As this matter is private business I suggest that it is not in accordance with the Standing Orders.  It should have been taken before public business was taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there is anything in this objection. These two Bills were taken at the beginning of our business, but an objection was then raised, quite within the rights of any member, to the passing of the Second Stage at that time. Accordingly, as I pointed out, it became my duty to fix the time at which the Second Stage must be taken and disposed of.  I do not consider that the Standing Order that Senator Farren has called my attention to applies in that case, and the time I am entitled to fix is independent of any particular business that the Seanad may be engaged in.</P>

      <P>I understand the practice in other places, and I think it has been adopted here, has always been that any member who wanted a copy of any Private Bill could get it on application to the Private Bill Office.  Of course these Bills were advertised, and very fully advertised, in the public Press, but, you see, at present we are only dealing with the Second Stage.  If the Second Stage <Col N="106" /> is passed the Bill has only got over the first of its difficulties.  The real investigation occurs when the Bill is before the Committee.</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty in answering that either. What happened was this: after the discussion that arose on the Second Stage, when this Bill was mentioned first to-day, a request was sent to me in writing on behalf of the promoters of one of these Bills to know would there be any objection to a short statement in regard to its contents being circulated to the House.  But inasmuch as the practice has been that the promoters are entitled to circulate amongst members of the House by post or otherwise any information with regard to a Private Bill, in view of the fact that by my ruling I did not give them the opportunity of doing that through the post, I allowed them to be circulated to-day to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>It is my duty to do so, and I shall always do it when you are disorderly, and you were never more disorderly than you are at the moment.  I shall, therefore, only state for the information of the House that it was in view of the unusual delays, through no cause of the Seanad or anyone else, but owing to public affairs, that have occurred in regard to these Private Bills, that I thought it my duty to invite the House, if they so agreed, to give them the earliest possible consideration, having regard to the state of public business. That was my sole object, and I am glad that the Seanad took the same view.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.40 p.m.</P>
