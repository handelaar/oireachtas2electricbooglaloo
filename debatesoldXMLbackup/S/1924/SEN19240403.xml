      <P>I do not think there is anything very much to say on the Bill.  It is an agreed Bill, and there is nothing new in it.

      <P>It is also practically essential that we should dispose of this Bill at the present sittings. It would, of course, be possible to leave over the Committee and Report Stages until to-morrow.  That would, however, necessitate the Seanad meeting to-morrow, and we will probably have no other business.  It will be a matter for the Seanad to consider after the Second Reading Stage.</P>

      <P>I have always been in favour of Summer Time, and I think this is a very good measure on practically every ground.  There is, of course, a certain amount of objection to it on behalf of the farming community owing to our climate, especially when it comes to the saving of hay or crops.  The best time for saving hay is in the evening.  When I was a tillage farmer I got over the difficulty by beginning an hour later in the morning. That seems to be a very obvious way of dealing with the difficulty which arises under the Bill.  I imagine there are other agriculturalists in the Seanad who have done the same thing.  The mere fact of the clock being at eight when it would otherwise be seven, does not make any difference to a practical farmer who can adapt himself to the circumstances.  I would be in favour of suspending the Standing Orders and passing the Bill at once through all its Stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to offer opposition to the passing of the Bill.  I did so last year, and offered certain arguments in favour of my view, which I do not intend to repeat.  I merely wish to record my protest against the imposition of this Bill on the agricultural community.  It would be a hardship on them to be deprived of the most valuable hour of the day for their work. The remedy suggested of commencing an hour later in the morning would not be of much use to tillage and dairy farmers who have to catch trains at an early hour of the morning in order to provide milk for the cities and towns. In order to save crops at a certain season of the year, both the farmers and the workmen will have to work extra time.  I see by the proviso attached to Standing Order 55 that three clear days notice should have been given to Senators after this Bill had been received from the Dáil.  That has not been done, and I would not agree to give any extra facilities for the passage of the Bill, which would be a great injustice to the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I objected to a similar Bill to this last year, and I object to this Bill now for much the same reasons.  What Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde said, that the agricultural population could begin work an hour later, applies with equal force to the minority of the population who are not farmers.  Those people can get up an hour earlier if it pleases them. I do not see why this should be imposed on the working part of the population, who object to it very much and on whom it is being forced unfairly. It is especially wrong in this country, where we not only lose one hour, but one and a half hours, because we are a half an hour behind London, and in the West of Ireland three-quarters of an hour.  Therefore, I oppose this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the opponents of this measure will not persist in their opposition.  The amount of hardship which it is alleged will be inflicted on the agricultural community is negligible in comparision with the benefit which will be conferred on the people of the towns <Col N="1280" /> and cities.  From a purely economic point of view, it will mean the saving of one hour's artificial light every day. We should also consider what it will mean to the poor, particularly those living in crowded tenements, which are so badly lighted and ventilated, and where they exist in an atmosphere which is not congenial either to health or social development.  The passage of this Bill will mean that seven hours more of every week can be spent outside in the fresh air and sunlight.  In the country districts where a certain amount of opposition is manifested to this Bill, I think, in the main, it will be found that it is mere unreasoning prejudice.  The average farmer will say that it is an attempt on the part of man to interfere with God's time. That is really the basis of the opposition.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, the other form of opposition, that this proposal first emanated from England, that it is purely a foreign importation, and as such should be resisted.  I hope that Senators, at all events, will be able to reason on a better and more logical basis.  In many parts of the country where summer time is not acceptable they simply ignore it.  They start work an hour later in the morning and finish an hour later in the evening, and they are really put to no inconvenience.  After all, it is quite different here, and the opposition should not be so keen as on the part of the agricultural industry in England. If you take London, for instance, a large number of milk trains come in, probably, at four or five in the morning, and in consequence of summer time those connected with the dairy industry have to get up an hour earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland there are practically no early trains, certainly very few compared with the number running into London and other cities.  If you are accustomed to getting up early and have to rise an hour earlier, that is not much hardship.  There was great opposition to the Summer Time Bill in France last year.  This year the Bill was acceptable in France, and is in operation.  All Western European countries, as far as I can gather, have <Col N="1281" /> adopted it.  Let us not be an exception to the rule.  We have sufficient difficulties in connection with customs and boundaries without creating fresh difficulties by having a different time-table from that of England and other western countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurJackson" hpid="Mr. JACKSON Mr. JACKSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JACKSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the Bill, and I am in accord with Senator O'Farrell's views.  There are thousands of people throughout the country who have pretty heavy office hours to whom the extra daylight means more fresh air and recreation.  In the country it is a common thing for farmers not to alter their clocks, so that I do not think they suffer great inconvenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to call attention to one aspect of this matter that has not been alluded to up to the present.  In France last year, when the Summer Time Bill was introduced, the French people decided not to have it.  After a month or two they found it so inconvenient to be dissociated from the rest of Western Europe that they decided to adopt it. This year they have gone one better, and have introduced summer time about a fortnight, I think, earlier than in any other part of Western Europe. That shows that the fact of a State dissociating itself from the rest of Europe was not a good thing.  The French found out that it was a bad move, and they had to go back on their policy.  I am very largely concerned in agricultural work, especially in tillage farming, and I find that my men raise no objection whatever to this Bill. They adopt the plan that was suggested by Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde, and that Senator Jackson mentioned.  They do not alter the clocks at all, but come to work at 9 o'clock instead of 8 o'clock and leave off an hour later in the evening than the Bill would allow.  The only people the Bill really hits are those who supply milk to cities and towns.  Undoubtedly they have to get up earlier. People who go to fairs also have to get up earlier.  Having regard to the balance of convenience all round, I would like to add my appeal to Senator O'Farrell's and ask the opponents of the Bill to withdraw their opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. JOHN BAGWELL Mr. JOHN BAGWELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHN BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this question that it is fitting, perhaps, I should say something as one who would naturally know something about it.  I do not propose to say anything on the general question of the advantage or disadvantage of the Summer Time Bill.  I am, however, entirely in agreement with the views expressed by Senator O'Farrell.  I do not know if it is realised what confusion and inconvenience would ensue if this country dissociated itself from the general programme with regard to summer time followed by other Western European countries.  A practical issue will arise, inasmuch as the steamers that ply between Ireland and Great Britain would sail according to summer time.  The result would be that the steamers would arrive here, if the Free State did not adopt summer time, too early for the trains, and the passengers would have to wait an hour. That, however, is not so bad, and the people would survive the delay.  On the other hand, all trains to the ports would arrive an hour too late, and the steamers would have gone.  That would be highly inconvenient.  The only way that can be avoided is by re-timing the trains.  I need hardly say that that could not be done in five minutes, nor in five days, and probably not in five months.  As this country is so dependent upon the cross-Channel service, it would be exceedingly difficult to deal with those services separate from the rest.  The result would be confusion. Matters would be further complicated by the fact that the Six Counties would adopt summer time, the same as Great Britain, and communication across the border would be confused.  If other countries have adopted the Act we cannot afford to ignore it or to take a line of our own without creating a situation of a most extraordinary character.  To do so would give rise to inconvenience and a considerable amount of loss.  The time given for dealing with correspondence and letters would be reduced owing to the altered train services. The cattle from fairs would not be able to get to the ports in many cases in time to be shipped for regular sailings. There would be a great loss under both heads.  Even if I personally held the <Col N="1283" /> view that summer time is a mistake&mdash; there is something to be said against it in this country&mdash;I would say that we cannot help ourselves, and we must follow it.</P>

      <P>There is one possible disadvantage in this Bill, and I have had experience of it.  That is where an employee comes to his work by the new time, but regulates his own watch by the old time, and leaves off work by the old time, thereby securing to his own advantage a shorter working day, to the detriment of his employer. We may, however, brush that aside, as it is not of very frequent occurrence. On the whole, looking at it from the various points of view, mentioned by the Senators who have just spoken, such as economy, and the health and well-being of the population, and the point of view of hard cash, I think that we should pass this Bill.  It was stated when the Bill was first introduced in England that there would be a saving of something like two million pounds a year in lighting to individuals, institutions, corporations, etc. If it reaches that amount even approximately, there should be a saving here <i>pro rata</i> which would be very important, and which should not be neglected from the point of view of finance.  I am in complete agreement with the Senators who say that the Bill ought to be passed into law without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to this Bill now stands in this way.  Unless Standing Orders are suspended, there should now be an interval of three days between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage.  The result of that, in the present case, would mean that the Seanad could not dispose of this Bill to-morrow, and would have to be convened for next week.  Any date later than that would be too late, because the Bill has to come into operation by the 13th April, so that unless we suspend Standing Orders and put the Bill through its remaining Stages to-day, it will be necessary for the Seanad to sit next week <Col N="1284" /> for the sole purpose of putting this Bill through.  I do not know whether that is the wish of the House, but there is this difficulty regarding the matter. The standing order dealing with the suspension of Standing Orders only permits it in cases of urgent necessity, of which the Chairman is to be the judge.  The Committee appointed to deal with Standing Orders very recently considered this particular clause, and agreed to report to the House that they thought that the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; should be omitted, and that the clause should run &ldquo;in cases of necessity.&rdquo;  As it stands, it reads &ldquo;in cases of urgent necessity.&rdquo;  I hope that Senator Linehan and other Senators will not put me to the necessity of ruling on this.  I pointed out to them the only alternative which must be that we convene the Senate next week for the sole purpose of putting the Bill through its remaining stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, as the Seanad is fairly unanimous on the subject, I do not think it is worth while to stand in the way, but what you said, again brings up the point that Ministers do not bring up Bills in time.  I suppose this is the hundredth time in which a Bill has not been brought up in time.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been a constant subject of complaint here, and while we quite recognise that conditions make it difficult in some cases for these Bills to come to us in any other condition except in a hurry, it is difficult to see how that applies in a case of this kind, but we have to deal with it as we find it.</P>

      <P>May I say a word in explanation of that?  An international conference was called in Paris, and when we got word by dispatch from the British Government that it was the intention of the French Government to summon such conference we hung up this Bill in Committee Stage in the Dáil.  It remained at that Stage for six weeks, and it was only within the last ten days that the result of the conference was communicated to us, and we brought the Bill forward immediately.</P>

      <P>As the Bill was originally drafted, I think this particular clause was made wider than the proposals of the Bill intended, and if the Senators read Section 4 they will see that it applies to all jurors, whereas it was originally meant that it should only apply to those jurors whose names are on the jurors' list.

      <P>Since the Committee Stage of the Bill in the Seanad, I have given very full consideration to the arguments advanced here dealing with this question of money in a bank held up on a stop order from a District Justice, and I had a consultation with the Ministry of Finance on the matter. We have not been able to depart from <Col N="1288" /> the view that as in principle this is a confiscation on something short of absolute proof it is unwise to ask that the courts be directly involved in the matter.  Senators know the kind of case this section was introduced to cover, and they know that it is not by any straining of the imagination we came to the conclusion that it was necessary to insert such a section.  One hears common talk of very glaring cases of people blossoming out in sudden affluence, the only explanation of which could be that they took advantage of the disorders of recent years to enrich themselves.  It is pretty much like internment without trial, internment on something short of proof.  That was an act of the State, and we came to the Dáil and Seanad, and asked that in the special setting, powers of that kind should be given to the Executive. We did not ask the court to be empowered to order internment and detention on something short of proof.  I think it would have been unwise to ask anything of the kind.  You have the same idea underlying this.  It is considered that a particular bank account needs explanation.  The State comes to the District Justice and asks for a stop order on the account, and the person in whose name the account stands, has a month within which to satisfy the Minister for Finance that the money is legally and properly in his custody, and is not the proceeds of lawlessness and of crime.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Farrell's suggestion is that he should satisfy the District Justice of that, and you there bring the courts into it, a procedure which, as I say, is confiscation on something short of proof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that it is not wise to do that. The Minister for Finance suggested that I could state here that a Departmental Committee with one independent lawyer could be set up to hear appeals of the kind, a representative, let us say, of his Department, a representative of the Ministry of Home Affairs, and someone with legal or judicial training.  There is just another aspect, and I want to be quite candid with Senators about it.  It sometimes happens that evidence on which action of this kind is taken is not evidence which could or ought to be brought out publicly <Col N="1289" /> in open court.  Not infrequently it is the evidence of a penitent accomplice, and it may not be at all for the benefit of the penitent accomplice's health that he should appear in court and give the evidence on which the action was taken.  I put that simply to the good sense of Senators, that all things considered, a Departmental Committee is preferable in the circumstances, and having regard to the class of cases that will be dealt with under this section.  The stop order is given by the District Justice, and then a month is allowed in which the person to whose name the money stands has his opportunity of showing the State that he has a clean bill of health, as it were, that this money is properly and legally his.  The offer of the Departmental Committee with one independent lawyer is as far as I can go to meet the arguments that were advanced on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that it is a very serious thing to have an order made by the Minister forfeiting money.  I quite recognise the objection to giving evidence of the nature that is sometimes required in a case like this in a public court, but there would be no objection at all to having the case tried by the District Justice in the way in which he tries income tax appeals, privately in his own room, without the Press being present. Surely that would be much better than to have a case like this decided by the Minister himself.</P>

      <P>It would not apply in any case, of course, until the District Justice puts a stop order on the funds.  Then the Bill provides that an advertisement to the effect that the Minister will proceed to deal with these moneys is to be published, and the persons are to be allowed an opportunity of explaining to him how they came by this money.  It would then be for him either to allow the stop order to remain or to issue an order discharging it.  That is the proposal in the Bill.  The amendment now suggested is this: The Minister, in making his order, should act upon a decision of a Departmental Committee. The Departmental Committee should consist of one official of his own Department&mdash;I do not know who the second would be&mdash;and the third a person of legal or judicial experience.</P>

      <P>I think before I withdraw any of these amendments that it would be better to report progress, until we see the nature of the proposals embodied in the amendment that the Minister suggests to substitute for these amendments.  It is a very serious and important constitutional question affecting the right of the subject, and we should not too lightly hand over these rights to a Minister.  The Minister admits that this is confiscation, and he goes further and admits it is confiscation done in such a way that he would not like to stain the records of our courts of justice by putting the responsibility on them of authorising it.  I appreciate that consideration for the dignity of our courts, but this is a Parliament, and if we authorise this confiscation in the manner suggested by the Bill it is just as dangerous in the precedent it suggests, in the undermining of the common law, as if the courts themselves delivered judgment. One can easily visualise the errors that may occur and the prejudices that may exist in officials, and, after all, it is the officials of the Ministry who will be responsible.  Have we not had numerous instances of huge blunders that officials have made by having acted upon false or insufficient information and having refused to listen to information and arguments that were of a more reliable character? Very often through lack of judgment a man would be guilty of a grave injustice towards another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggests that evidence is sometimes tendered by a penitent who has himself been involved in some of this dishonesty.  Can a person always rely upon the evidence of a <Col N="1292" /> penitent?  He may come forward to tender evidence in the hope of getting free from some other charge of a more serious character, and these things are also open to abuse by a person, having a grudge against another, coming forward and giving evidence.  Seeing that the evidence is not to be given in court and subjected to the ordinary procedure of a court, cross-examination and evidence on oath, the unfortunate person against whom the evidence is given has not the protection that a court extends. It is reducing the law to the old spirit of the inquisition and the star chamber, and if the justification for it may seem somewhat apparent, I think we should be very slow and cautious in the steps we take towards that end. I would, therefore, either press my amendment or move that we report progress pending the introduction by the Minister of the alternative he suggests, in the form of a regular amendment.</P>

This raises a most important question.  If I understand it right, with the Bankers' Institute, and the bankers generally, any contract or business transaction between them and their clients is strictly private and confidential. I have no experience in banking, but I understand that is the <Col N="1293" /> system.  I want to know from the Minister what steps he proposes to take to ascertain whether the funds in the name of any person in the bank are his or not.  To know whether there are funds in the bank or not there must be an examination of the books.</P>

In spite of guns, on a recent occasion they guarded the secrets between their clients and themselves.  The guns did not intimidate them to give the evidence required some years ago.  I think we ought to have some more information as to whether it is intended to take powers to go in and examine bank books.</P>

I think there is a general feeling amongst the Senators that the order for forfeiture of money in cases like this ought to be on the order of a tribunal, and the only difficulty.  I think, is what is to be the tribunal. There is a serious objection to having a tribunal composed of two members of the Departments who are interested in the question at issue.  I would suggest <Col N="1294" /> to the Minister, as he is to have a tribunal, that if there were a single independent person of legal training there could be no objection.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that a provision of that kind would simply nullify the section.  It certainly would deprive it of any real benefit in dealing with the problem.  It is admitted that the action would have to be taken on something short of evidence, something short of legal proof.  If there was proof, of course it is easy to deal with the matter; you would simply prosecute the person and put him in jail, but we contend in the situation arising out of the last two years that either we must let matters pass which are public, and which are a scandal to the law-abiding community, or else take some other exceptional powers of this kind to deal with them.  If there is an appeal from the decision of the Minister, and his Departmental <Col N="1295" /> Committee, what that means is that the Minister is put on his proof to show that this money was stolen money.  He will not be able to prove it; if he were able to prove it the person concerned would be a convict.</P>
      <P>The idea of the Departmental Committee was that the Minister, acting on very strong presumption, gets his stop order from the District Justice, and holds up the money, and the person to whose name the money stands has the onus of proving that that money is properly and legally and cleanly his.  The onus of proving that lies with the individual, and not with the State.  It is an application of the same principle which in an earlier section of the Bill we applied to property, that principle which has existed in the Metropolitan Police Act for a great many years, and which is now being extended to the country generally, that a person in possession of property reasonably suspected of being stolen may be called upon to prove lawful possession.  The proposal now is to apply that to moneys which are reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of stolen property, and if you provide an appeal from the Minister to the Circuit Court, then in fact you put the Minister on his proof, and you change the position which we were attempting to arrive at, namely, that the onus of proof would lie on the suspected person.</P>

      <P>I cannot follow the argument of the Minister, because Sub-section 2 of Section 7 states that the person to whose credit the money is lodged shall prove to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance that such money belongs to him.  All the amendment suggests is that he shall prove it to the satisfaction of a District Justice.  So that under the Bill, as it would be amended, the onus of proof would still lie on the person suspected. On appeal it would still, I take it, lie with him to prove it to the satisfaction of the court.  So that it is not suggested that the onus of proof should be put on the Minister under the amendment.</P>

      <Col N="1299" /> SECTION 9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 9.  To add at the end of this section the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that this section shall only apply to the purchase or manufacture, storage, transport, and sale of materials or appliances to be used in an area in which the Minister, after a local enquiry under Section 8 of this Act, is satisfied that the cost of any materials or appliances in that area is excessive and restrictive of the output of building work.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I introduced this amendment with the idea of restricting the trading activities of the Government to areas where they found prices were wrong or where contracts were so expensive as to stop the work.  If they institute such an inquiry they can use the powers they are taking under Section 9, if necessary.  As far as the discussion on this subject went on the last occasion in the Seanad, it was evident from the vote that was taken that the majority of the Senators were in favour of the Government entering into trading operations on a Bill that is to last only for 12 months.  The Government was to have power to establish factories and purchase quantities of material.  As well as I could, I pointed out that these trading ventures could be entered into without getting the consent of the Oireachtas.  The President stated that every expenditure would have to be sanctioned by the Oireachtas, but the wording of the Bill, as far as one can judge, provides for the expenditure first and for sanction afterwards.  There is nothing to show that that is not the practice that is going to be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I ever knew of a Bill, especially a temporary Bill, giving sanction beforehand for what might be a disastrous course of trading, and interfering perhaps with the perfectly legal profits of persons that this Bill wants to induce to come back to business&mdash;speculative builders.  These restrictions are evidently aimed at speculative builders who may happen to build houses and sell them at a profit. I should think that it would have paid <Col N="1300" /> the State to have some body of men connected with housing to deal with the matter, so as to induce people to speculate in house building, and put their money and labour into it.  Instead of that this Bill insinuates that everybody connected with the supply of material for builders and with contracts is trying to rob the State.  The amendment seeks to restrict trading activities to areas where the cost of materials or appliances is proved to be excessive, so that the powers taken shall not be used all over the country.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the amendment, Judging by the reports, this matter was dealt with very fully on a previous occasion in the Seanad.  As one connected with the trade in the South of Ireland, I can assure the Seanad, whether the majority will agree with me or not, that in the trade connected with the supply of building material at the present time, there is a great deal of competition.  In the City of Dublin, which has been criticised so much, I venture to say that no trade has experienced such keen competition as the timber trade and building materials generally.  As far as I can see, no evidence was adduced on a former occasion of any profiteering in that branch of industry.  As Senator Jameson has remarked, I do not think any member of the Seanad knows of a suggestion such as is contained in this section being made in this or any other country.  I have also tabled an amendment to Section 8.</P>

      <P>It would be singularly unfair to a builder or contractor who entered into a contract for supplying materials that, after the materials had been supplied, at what was mutually agreed was a fair price, a tribunal should step in subsequently and say, &ldquo;We find you could have got the materials at a lower price.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard amendments of this sort discussed on the Committee Stage.  The object of the Bill is to protect builders and not to allow any restrictions.  Senaton Jameson states that we should allow the building to start.  The Bill does not propose to interfere with builders.  If a man comes along and builds a house and gets a subsidy of £100 from the State and £100 from the Local Authority, the only restriction is that he shall conform to the regulations laid down by the Local Government Department and its engineers, and that the house should be of a certain capacity. The object of this particular section is to see that the builder is not hampered and to prevent excessive prices being charged for materials. Senator Jameson's amendment is to the effect that the section should only apply to an area where it has been proved to the satisfaction of the Minister that there has been profiteering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a notorious fact, notwithstanding the statement of Senator Haughton about there being tremendous competition amongst builders' providers, that if you ask for quotations for building materials you will invariably get the same figure from all firms.  If there is such desperate competition in the trade as Senator Haughton would lead us to believe, how do you account for the fact that very seldom is there the slightest difference in quotations from these firms who are in such desperate competition with one another?  That fact is sufficient argument why the Government should have some regulation to empower them to protect builders who propose to build houses under this Bill, from being fleeced by people who provide them with the necessary materials.  I do not anticipate that the Government will build factories to provide these materials, but they provide a section in this Bill that will prevent people who want to profiteer and take advantage of the terrible necessity that exists for houses.  These people will charge excessive prices to the builders who, we hope, will build houses, and it is to prevent excessive prices being charged that the section <Col N="1302" /> is included.  I, therefore, oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Farren deals with facts, and I am only reasoning. He says that there are no quotations to be got at present except one from the providers of building materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that invariably you get the same quotations from all the builders' providers for standard articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is your statement, and the remedy the Government is going to supply to that is to enable the builder to be certain that he will be able to get competitive quotations, and that the Government are going to deal in all these things and give them to the builders at a five per cent profit on what it cost them.  I was looking through the Bill to find out how they are going to get rid of the materials which they purchase, and to complete the Bill they require a clause to compel the contractors to buy those things from the Government.  Otherwise, there is no vestige of doubt that when the Government have materials ready to offer to builders, if their prices are not as good as the builder can get elsewhere, the Government will undoubtedly be left with material on hands so far as this Bill is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing we learned in the Great War and that was, that wherever the Government came along to meddle with trade or to get things made, or to take over business and produce the stuff themselves, it cost the nation an infinite amount of money more than if they left it to people who knew their business and who carried on the trade themselves.  I had a great deal to say to that, as I was on the other side of the water watching contracts, and wherever the Government came in and took things out of private hands in any trade or business, the nation paid a huge sum for it.  Probably the Senator is right; the Government may not use this power, but it is an awfully bad precedent to put in a Bill, that such powers should be given to the Government especially in a temporary measure. <Col N="1303" /> We ought not forget the lesson of the war so soon as this.  This small Free State should not give power to the Government, whether they use it or not, to interfere with the ordinary channels of trade, for if they do, they will probably lose more than the £300,000 grant provided in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect to Senator Jameson, I do not think that he understands the position.  When we talk about builders' providers we speak of handlers and not manufacturers. Practically the only thing manufactured in this country which will be used in this type of house is the brick, so when we talk about builders' providers we are speaking not of manufacturers, but of people who only handle the material.  These things are all imported, and are generally a standard article.  In order to protect the people who will come forward under the provisions of this Bill to build houses it is essential that the builders' providers, who handle the materials, shall not be entitled to charge what they like.  As I understand the clause, it is to protect these builders against the providers charging exorbitant prices.</P>

      <P>The Seanad have gone very fully into this amendment, and most of us will agree with Senator Farren that the object of the section is not to hinder but to help the builders. I hope it will not be necessary to put the section into operation, but if it has to be put into operation, I think we should take powers to utilise it on sound business lines.  I think Senator Jameson will agree with that.  I think it is obvious that if the Minister's power is restricted under this section to particular areas, it will be impossible to work the section economically, and it would practically mean deleting the section altogether. <Col N="1304" /> For that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to make up one's mind on this amendment. What Senator Jameson said in relation to a Government going into business, I am in absolute agreement with.  So far as we know anything about Government interference, it has always been disastrous.  In these countries, at all events, it has always meant a charge on the taxpayer, but, on the other hand, it seems to me that this clause is more or less in the nature of a preventative to profiteering.  It seems to me that this clause is directed against purveyors of building materials endeavouring to charge an improper price.  For instance, it would deal with an individual trying to make a corner in slates or imported timber, or other requisite building materials.  I am against profiteering in every shape, and, on the other hand, I am against Government interference in business of every shape, but, on the whole, I think Senator Farren has convinced me that this is a question of preventing profiteering, and in a Bill which is only going to last twelve months, the Government will probably not be tempted to enter on large commercial operations.  I shall therefore vote against the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and, on a show of hands, declared lost, 9 voting for and 17 against it.</P>

      <P>I beg to move my amendment, which reads, &ldquo;Provided that this section shall not apply to the price of any material which is the subject of a contract entered into before the date of the local inquiry.&rdquo;  Contracts, I have ventured to submit, are solemn things to enter into.  A contract is an agreement between two parties.  If both parties agree to a sum, and subsequently the Minister comes along, maybe months afterwards, and suggests that the price is a little too high and breaks the agreement to the loss of the firm, I submit it would be a gross, a grievous and a moral wrong.  There is one political illustration that comes to me as I speak, and that is the case of one of the States of the Australian Commonwealth, Queensland. <Col N="1305" /> Many years ago they entered into an arrangement with settlers. Leases were signed at a certain figure, and as years passed by, a Government came into power that altered these leases.  The result was that the State of Queensland did not command that respect that it did in previous years.</P>

      <P>This is based on the hypothesis that Section 8 is retrospective.  I cannot find that in the section.  You are assuming a contract made before the inquiry.  As I read the section it seems to me only to provide that an inquiry is to be held as to the cost of any materials or appliances used in the building of houses. If the Minister is satisfied those charges are excessive, he may prescribe a new scale.  It seems to me on reading that section that that would not entitle the Minister to make a scale of charges that would have a retrospective effect on contracts previously made.  If that is the intention, it could be more clearly expressed.</P>

It is only my suggestion, looking at the clause in a cursory way, that it is not retrospective. It might afterwards be decided by the courts that it would be retrospective.</P>

      <P>I think the point is that a building scheme is going to be started in a particular area, and contracts are entered into in connection <Col N="1306" /> with it.  If a local inquiry is held before a contract is entered into, and prices are fixed, those prices will determine the prices in future contracts, but Senator Haughton means that there might be contracts existing before the building scheme is started in which definite prices might be agreed upon between the parties, and the amendment is aimed at preventing any interference with those.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out the difficulty.  A builder who proposes to build under this Bill is compelled to do so within twelve months, or eighteen months at the outside, and in view of the time it takes him to get his plans sanctioned by the Ministry, get in his foundations and proceed with his work, he must place his contracts for the materials straight off.  If, when he places his contract, he finds that he is being fleeced, he demands an inquiry.</P>

He then proceeds to ask for estimates for building materials and so forth, and he finds he is charged on figures which would not make it profitable for him to build houses.  He will not enter into a contract; he will call for an inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out to you that the small man who will build under this scheme will not be waiting for the formality of an inquiry to order his materials.  If a man wants to take advantage of the Bill, he must start building now.  If he does not he will not build at all. This is the building season.  He must, immediately after the passing of this Bill, order his materials, prepare his foundation, and obtain sanction to proceed with the work.  If he has not bought the materials he may be left without them, and he must order and enter into a contract for them.  It is only in the event of his finding that he has been fleeced that he demands from the Ministry an inquiry into the cost of materials in his area.  If this amendment is passed, it defeats the whole object of the section, because it is only after a man has purchased his materials that he finds he is being charged too much.  If the inquiry is held it may have an effect on the next Housing Bill, but I promise you if this amendment is passed the clause regarding the inquiry and the fixing of prices will be of no avail.</P>

      <P>Of course, it is a matter of some difficulty.  I think if this amendment is altered so as to embrace contracts freely entered into between two trading parties, we should be very careful lest we do anything that would break the sanctity of contracts. To safeguard a valid contract I have tried to alter this amendment, and I think the result should meet with the approval of anybody who wishes to maintain the right of contract, and at the same time not to allow collusion to evade the intentions of the Bill.  What I would suggest is this: &ldquo;Provided that this section shall not apply to the price of any material or appliance which was the subject of a <i>bona fide</i> contract entered into at least one month before the date of the local inquiry. Provided that all such contracts are registered with the Ministry within seven days of the making of such contracts.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we pass from this Bill, perhaps the House would permit me to mention a matter.  When the Bill was in Committee there were two amendments in the name of Senator <Col N="1311" /> Sir John Keane, and their objects were to extend the benefit of this Act in particular to members of the Civil Service.  Senator Sir J. Keane is not here.  The first was an amendment to Section 3, increasing the number of square feet that the house may contain, and the Government permitted an increase in the case of houses built by Civil Servants to 1,500 square feet.  The second was an amendment to insert after Section 10 a new section, the object of which was to enable a Civil Servant who probably would not be very rich in this world's goods to borrow money on the security of his salary or pension, and also to enable the Minister for Finance to make regulations under which moneys might be paid to the lender from the salary or pension of the Civil Servant by an arrangement.  That amendment was withdrawn, by leave, on an undertaking by the President to look into the matter before the Report Stage, and he said that so long as the Minister for Finance was not called on to provide money, he had no objection in allowing it to go through.  In the absence of Senator Sir J. Keane, might I ask the Minister whether that has been done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>We looked into this matter, and we find it is impossible to legislate on the assumption that a Civil Servant has a right to future salary, as his appointment may be terminated at any moment.  We can arrange to have a portion of the Civil Servant's salary deducted monthly.  Perhaps that would meet the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>What is necessary, if you are willing to do that, is to remove the present legal bar on charging a salary of this kind.  A Civil Servant, as the law stands at present, is not entitled to charge his salary or pension; so you would require an amendment giving him power to do that.  That is what is meant by the first portions of the amendment:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where any moneys are borrowed by a person who is permanently employed in the Civil Service of Saorstát Eireann, in this section called &lsquo;the borrower,&rsquo; for the purpose of <Col N="1312" /> erecting a house for his own use and occupation in which this Act applies:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  Such moneys (in addition to any other security) be validly charged by the borrower on his future salary and emoluments in respect of such employment and upon the allowance of gratuity (if any) to which he may at any time become entitled in respect of superannuation or compensation for loss of office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it would be necessary to pass that as an amendment, leaving it to the Department to work out the mode on which that would be carried out.  If you would allow me, I would move that as a substantive amendment.</P>

      <P>When Senator Sir John Keane brought this forward I mentioned that I thought there were statutes which prohibited the pledging or forestalling of the pension or salary, and that therefore the amendment would not work unless these sections were implied and repealed. But that is another matter. The Government certainly did not give any undertaking that they would consent to repeal these provisions.  What the President pointed out was: &ldquo;I am afraid there is a difficulty in our way, for I am told there are certain provisions which prevent the pledging of these salaries or pensions.&rdquo;  He said that would be an obstacle in the way of accepting this amendment.  I said I thought the President was right in that.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt about the law.  At present it is not legal to charge the salary or pension of a Civil Servant, but I suggest that for the purpose of getting the benefit of this Bill they should simply, for the purpose of this Bill, allow a Civil Servant to borrow on his salary or pension. I beg to move the amendment in the words in which it was originally moved by Senator Sir J. Keane, omitting part (ii).</P>

I think that by an arrangement similar to that which exists now in the case of a Civil Servant who is insured, <Col N="1313" /> the insurance premiums are deducted from the salary and paid direct to the insurance company, and I think an arrangement of that kind would meet this particular case without any legislation.</P>

      <P>With the indulgence of the Seanad I would like to say certain things that, properly speaking, I should have said on the Second Reading, but which I did not say for reasons which I will explain presently.  At various periods during the last six months some persons interested in the National Gallery and the School of Art urged upon Ministers the desirability of placing the Museum, the National Gallery and the School of Art under the Ministry of Education.  When this Bill came to the Seanad I saw with great satisfaction that these institutions were placed under the Ministry of Education.  After the Second Reading I read the Bill with more attention, and I found that the Government possesses the right to transfer any particular institution to any particular Ministry it likes.  That fills me with alarm. It is, no doubt, quite right that the Government should have such power, but I will take this opportunity of saying that I hope the Government will not transfer these particular institutions to any Ministry except the Ministry of <Col N="1317" /> Education, without consulting these bodies.</P>
      <P>A number of us went on a deputation to one of the Ministers about five months ago.  I have been trying to remember for the last half hour what Minister.  I think it was the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but I cannot remember.  The deputation laid before the Minister a very strong case, I think, to have these institutions included under the Ministry of Education. I would like to touch lightly on that now, because if the Government decide to transfer these institutions to some other branch nothing will be done but to lay on the Table of the Seanad certain papers announcing the fact.  I may be away and may not see them, and other members of these bodies may know nothing about the matter.  It is very important for the future industrial prosperity of this country that Art teaching should be brought into relationship to industry.  That can only be done by some unified system of teaching which will include such institutions as the School of Art and the schools of the country.  In the newer Universities in Germany and in Scandinavia they have professors of the arts for purely industrial reasons.  They have found it essential in order to hold their own in the manufactory of the world that they should teach certain principles of good taste in order that their various forms of manufacture may possess good taste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I begin with an example of what I hope may happen in this country.  I understand that the Ministry of Education will form in the immediate future a Technical Board.  One of the things that might very well come before that Technical Board for consideration is the lace industry of Ireland. If you go back a few years you will find that Ireland had an exceedingly prosperous lace industry, which employed a large number of people.  That lace industry has lost its market to a very great extent, party through the hasty production of good old designs&mdash;the rough and ready manufacture at a quick rate of good old designs&mdash;and partly through the equally hasty production of exceedingly bad modern designs.  For instance, <Col N="1318" /> I understand that in some cases 3s. 6d. would be given for a design to some student.  That is about the same amount as the Free State Government thinks it necessary, I understand, to give for a design for a postage stamp.  It would be possible for the Technical Board of the Ministry of Education to obtain from Austria or Sweden a teacher of lace-making, one with the highest possible accomplishments in the art, so that the industry might be restored to prosperity. Such a teacher would be employed in two ways, going to the country to inspect, and teaching at the School of Art.  You have another example of the effect of teaching in the School of Art on the industries of this country.  About twenty years ago, and I had a little to do with it, a teacher of stained glass was brought from England and employed in the Dublin School of Art.  That teacher was brought chiefly through the efforts of Miss Purser.  The manufacture of stained glass in Ireland was then the worst in the world.  Now, some of the very best stained glass in the world is made here.  One of the makers of the worst stained glass in the world twenty years ago was a man named Clarke.  The maker of some of the best stained glass in the world to-day is his son.  These are unusual topics to raise in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. YEATS</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Government to keep Art teaching under the Ministry of Education in order that a unified system of Art teaching may arise in this country associated with education, so as to help manufactures.  The deputation to the Minister was told that the argument against having the art institutions under the Ministry of Education was that they might be subordinate to a purely mechanical system of teaching, and thereby suffer as art institutions&mdash;I think that is very unlikely under the present Minister.  That argument was put strongly.  I beg the <Col N="1319" /> Government if they detach these institutions from the Ministry of Education, not to give them to any other Ministry, but to give them a Ministry of their own.  The Arts in Ireland have suffered for several generations from having been under the Department of Agriculture.  The Department of Agriculture had no policy in connection with them except a deadly one.  When Sir Hugh Lane, for instance, was rejected when he applied for the position of head of the Museum in Dublin&mdash;the one great connoisseur we had&mdash;he was rejected on grounds which had nothing whatever to do with the Arts, but which were simply matters of policy of that Department.  When the Department was remonstrated with, an official used this argument: &ldquo;The time has not come to encourage the Arts in Ireland.&rdquo;  If you place these particular institutions under any Ministry except the Ministry of Education or under a Ministry of their own, you will find that the time has not come to encourage the Arts in Ireland.</P>

Amendment No. 2, as I recollect it, was an amendment moved by Senator Sir J. Keane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; it reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3).  After the sub-section a new sub-section (4) added, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;No levy shall be made by the under-sheriff under this section against the goods, animals or chattels of a defaulter who, prior to the issue of the warrants under this Act, has delivered to the under-sheriff a writ or writs of <i>fieri-facias</i><Col N="1320" /> or a civil bill decree or decrees for execution, until the under-sheriff has made a return to such writ or writs of <i>fieri-facias</i> or civil bill decree or decrees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suppose the meaning of that was that if the sheriff had in his hands writs to be levied for a party who is being made a debtor by the State, there should not be proceedings against him by the same sheriff until the sheriff had exercised these decrees which the individual was trying to recover himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite recollect on what grounds Senator Sir J. Keane based this amendment. I presume what he was aiming at must have been this: that before a distraint for arrears of rates could be served on any person who had unexecuted decrees in the hands of the sheriff, no levy should be made on him for rates, until the sheriff has made a return of what has happened to those decrees.  In other words, the suggestion is that the particular individual might be waiting for funds from decrees of his, which the sheriff had unexecuted on his hands, and before he should be made liable for arrears of rates he should be entitled to have a return from the sheriff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not present when this Bill was going through the Seanad, as I had to leave suddenly for the other House, but, perhaps, if I had been here Senator Sir J. Keane might not have insisted on his amendment.  Most of us, I think, are in sympathy with the motive at the back of the amendment, but when it comes to putting it into practical operation, I think the difficulties would be insurmountable.  It would be impossible for the sub-sheriff with the large volume of work which he has on hands at present, to go through piles of decrees to give priority to such writs before making seizure.  The effect, through an oversight on the sheriff's part, to omit giving priority might, if the amendment were passed, make him liable for an action for damages.  An additional reason for not accepting this amendment is that it would enable ratepayers to evade payment of rates, even in cases where the <Col N="1321" /> writ was in the hands of the sheriff for a trifling amount, or where the execution of the writ was held to be for any reason in the interests of the creditor. On grounds of policy it would be inadvisable to accept the amendment.  The ratepayer is under obligation to pay the local authority for services rendered. His liability to pay should not depend on the contingency of the possible execution of a writ in the hands of the sheriff.  If the amendment were accepted there is no logical reason why the general principle should not be admitted that the payment of rates should be contingent on all debts due to defaulting ratepayers.  It would be impossible for us to admit that principle.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Seanad would be well advised to insist on this amendment. In the first place, any person who has decrees in the hands of the sheriff, either in the High or County Courts, and who complains of delay in execution, has his remedy against the sheriff under the existing law.

      <P>Before we go to the next business on the Order Paper, the Seanad will recollect that we had the final stages of the Judiciary Bill before us last week, and the Bill was then sent back to the Dáil.  There were 44 amendments inserted in it in <Col N="1322" /> the Seanad.  The Dáil have sent a message to say that they have accepted 42 out of the 44 amendments.  The two which they did not accept were, first, the one that altered the description &ldquo;District Justice&rdquo; to that of &ldquo;District Judge,&rdquo; and the other was the one that transferred the liability for the salaries of District Justices and made them a charge upon the Central Fund. The Seanad will remember that a suggestion was made&mdash;I think it came from me&mdash;that the objection of the Government to the last clause, which transferred the salaries to the Central Fund, might be met, if for the first two or three years they were made payable annually on the Estimates, and at the end of two or three years they were then transferred and made a charge on the Central Fund.</P>
      <P>The Dáil, on the suggestion of the Government, have accepted an alternative amendment to ours to that effect, and I understand that their reasons for rejecting the amendment which proposed to alter the title &ldquo;District Justice&rdquo; to that of &ldquo;District Judge&rdquo; were owing to the fact that a number of Acts have been passed, most of them temporary, in which the expression used throughout is District Justice, and it would be necessary to bring in amending Bills, if that amendment were insisted on, in all those cases.  Once the House has got the concession from the Government and the Dáil, by which those salaries are to be transferred to the Central Fund, it seems to me that the question of title sinks into comparative insignificance.  The Attorney-General is present, and I will mention the two amendments.</P>

      <P>I do not think I can add anything to what you have stated.  The two amendments, 22 and 25, hang together.  The object behind them was that there should be no question as to the judicial position of the District Justice.  Having accepted the principle that their salaries should be like that of other judges, a charge upon the Central Fund, you have the principle established that they are taken out of the realm of discussion of their functions as a District Justice.  The amendment, with all respect to Senator O'Farrell, could not work out.  It would have to be insisted on in the form of 20 different amendments.  Besides, there are several other inconveniences, but the principle, that the position of the District Justice should be recognised as that of a judge, is established by the alternative amendment we propose to Amendment 25.  I think I will leave it at that to the Seanad, and we can compromise on the amendment.</P>

      <P>As the person responsible for the original amendment, I move that the Seanad do not insist on this amendment.  The amendments go together, and the object of the first was to establish the fact that District Justices had all the rights and privileges of judges, and that for that reason their salaries should be placed on the Central Fund and lest there should be any doubt about that, that their title should be changed. Now, the principle has been met, and consequently the real object of both amendments has been met.  To an extent the dangers we apprehended will continue for three years, but beyond that there is no question as to the position of those justices.</P>

In the Dáil they have altered this amendment but accepted the principle.  They have altered it in this way &ldquo;until the end of the financial year ending on the 31st March, 1927, the salaries shall be paid out of monies to be annually provided by the Oireachtas, and shall thereafter be a charge upon and be payable out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof.&rdquo;</P>

    <P Just="Center">Schedule referred to.</P>
    <P>Article 1.</P>
    <P>The High Contracting Parties declare that it is their firm intention to uphold the principle that three marine miles extending from the coastline outwards and measured from low-water mark constitute the proper limits of territorial waters.</P>
    <P>Article 2.</P>
    <P>(1)  His Britannic Majesty agrees that he will raise no objection to the boarding of private vessels under the British flag outside the limits of territorial waters by the authorities of the United States, its territories or possessions in order that enquiries may be addressed to those on board and an examination be made of the ship's papers for the purpose of ascertaining whether the vessel or those on board are endeavouring to import or have imported alcoholic beverages into the United States, its territories or possessions in violation of the laws there in force.  When such enquiries and examination show a reasonable ground for suspicion a search of the vessel may be instituted.</P>
    <P>(2)  If there is reasonable cause for belief that the vessel has committed or is committing or attempting to commit an offence against the laws of the United States, its territories or possessions, prohibiting the importation of alcoholic beverages, the vessel may be seized and taken into a Port of the United States, its territories or possessions for adjudication in accordance with such laws.</P>
    <P>(3)  The rights conferred by this Article shall not be exercised at a greater distance from the coast of the United States, its territories or possessions than can be traversed in one hour by the vessel suspected of endeavouring to commit the offence. In cases, however, in which the liquor is intended to be conveyed to the United States, its territories or possessions by a vessel other than the one boarded and searched, it shall be the speed of such other vessel and not the speed of the vessel boarded, which shall determine the distance from the coast at which the right under this Article can be exercised.</P>
    <P>Article 3.</P>
    <P>No penalty or forfeiture under the laws of the United States shall be applicable or attach to alcoholic liquors or to vessels or persons by reason of the carriage of such liquors when such liquors are listed as sea stores or cargo destined for a port foreign to the United States, its territories or possessions on board British vessels voyaging to or from ports of the United States, or its territories or possessions or passing through the territorial waters thereof, and such carriage shall be as now provided by law with respect to the transit of such liquors through the Panama Canal, provided that such liquors shall be kept under seal continuously while the vessel on which they are carried remains within said territorial waters and that no part of such liquors shall at any time or place be unladen within the United States, its territories or possessions.</P>
    <P>Article 4.</P>
    <P>Any claim by a British vessel for <Col N="1327" /> compensation on the grounds that it has suffered loss or injury through the improper or unreasonable exercise of the rights conferred by Article 2 of this Treaty or on the ground that it has not been given the benefit of Article 3 shall be referred for the joint consideration of two persons, one of whom shall be nominated by each of the High Contracting Parties.</P>
    <P>Effect shall be given to the recommendations contained in any such joint report.  If no joint report can be agreed upon the Claim shall be referred to the Claims Commission established under the provisions of the agreement for the Settlement of Outstanding Pecuniary Claims signed at Washington, the 18th August, 1910, but the Claim shall not, before submission to the tribunal, require to be included in a schedule of claims confirmed in the manner therein provided.</P>
    <P>Article 5.</P>
    <P>This Treaty shall be subject to ratification and shall remain in force for a period of one year from the date of the exchange of ratifications.</P>
    <P>Three months before the expiration of the said period of one year, either of the High Contracting Parties may give notice of its desire to propose modifications in the terms of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>If such modifications have not been agreed upon before the expiration of the term of one year mentioned above, the Treaty shall lapse.</P>
    <P>If no notice is given on either side of the desire to propose modifications, the Treaty shall remain in force for another year, and so on automatically, but subject always in respect of each such period of a year to the right on either side to propose as provided above three months before its expiration modifications in the Treaty, and to the provision that if such modifications are not agreed upon before the close of the period of one year, the Treaty shall lapse.</P>
    <P>Article 6.</P>
    <P>In the event that either of the High Contracting Parties shall be prevented either by judicial decision <Col N="1328" /> or legislative action from giving full effect to the provisions of the present Treaty, the said Treaty shall automatically lapse, and, on such lapse, or whenever this Treaty shall cease to be in force, each High Contracting Party shall enjoy all the rights which it would have possessed had this Treaty not been concluded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bound to advert to the fact that a number of my friends have taken exception to the short notice of the proposal that they have had.  I think it is a pity that a matter of this importance, and of such historical interest to this country should not be dealt with after longer notice.  But in this connection might I suggest that we have all observed of late that there has been a certain liveliness in political circles, and it is quite conceivable that a matter of this nature, important as it is, escaped the attention of the notifying authorities, whoever they may be.  Might I also suggest that, after all, there is no great secrecy or concealment in respect to this matter, because it has been before the world for the last six months at least.  The Treaty in which we are asked to participate was ratified by diplomats on, I think, the 23rd or 24th of January last, and the matter was discussed and debated in all the newspapers on this side of the Atlantic and on the other; published in the English language, so that it is a matter which, after all, comes upon nobody by surprise. All the same, I reiterate the expression of my view that it is a pity we had not longer notice, in view of the importance of the question which we are asked to decide.  I understand, Sir, that the text of the Treaty is practically contained in the Order Paper. There are no secret clauses in it.  I do not imagine, for instance, that it contains any clause enabling members of this House to go to the United States and to escape from its provisions.  At all events, the Minister for External Affairs is here to correct me if I am wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I draw the attention of the Seanad to some of the provisions of this Treaty.  I think, on the whole, it is just as well that we should pay some attention <Col N="1329" /> to what we are agreeing to.  The first Article confirms the principle of the Three-Mile Limit, and that has been the accepted nautical boundary for very many years past between one country and another.  May I also remind the Seanad that in ratifying the principle of the Three-Mile Limit on this occasion, as far as we can ratify it, we are also ratifying it as it has been extended and affirmed by a most important decision in the arbitration case between Newfoundland and the United States which was ratified at the Hague some years ago.  That was a very important extension of the Three-Mile Limit, of very great interest to people who are concerned with coastal fisheries, because, according to that decision, the Three-Mile Limit extends not merely around the contours of the coast, but it also extends from three miles outside the opposing points of bays and estuaries.  As a matter of fact. the whole estuary of the St. Lawrence by that decision was transferred into Canadian waters, as well as various other rivers, estuaries and bays in which heretofore foreigners were able to enter to fish and to do other things up to the Three-Mile Limit. Under this adjudication of the Hague tribunal that Three-Mile Limit is now measured outside the opposite points of the land.  That was a most important decision, and it constituted the main triumph of the Newfoundland arbitration.  So much for Article 1.</P>
    <P>The first Section of Article 2 gives practical effect to what the proposals are, inasmuch as it allows the American revenue officials to board any ship in the merchant navy of any section of the British Commonwealth to see their manifests, examine their papers, and, if necessary, if there is any ground for believing that these ships are endeavouring to infringe the laws of the United States, it further authorises these officials to carry out a search.  In the event of the search revealing the fact that these ships are endeavouring to break the American law, it enables these officials to seize the vessel.  Finally, it extends the limit within which these operations may be carried out by the United States Revenue officials to a distance of twelve miles from the American coast.  Twelve miles is not mentioned in the Treaty, <Col N="1330" /> but it amounts to that.  That is what it comes to in practice.  It is specifically laid down that it is the distance which the searching ship can sail from its own coast in an hour.  That is the way it is expressed.  Then there is the countervailing advantage, the <i>quid pro quo</i> afforded to travellers, which is of importance. In other words, that ships may carry whatever &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; refreshments they consider necessary, and may bring them within the limits of the United States waters under seal, so that as soon as travellers get outside the United States limit on the way back they are enabled to indulge in their natural proclivities.  Then there is a clause as to compensation.  A Joint Commission is set up to decide whether any infringement of the law takes place or whether any injustice is done to anybody, and in the event of a disagreement in this Commission there are further ways of bringing about a settlement.</P>
    <P>Article 5 deals with the subject of ratification, and that is where the Seanad comes in.  We are asked to ratify this Treaty as our contribution from the Irish Oireachtas.  Subject to the ratification of this Treaty, the law remains in force one year, and if it is not objected to within three months of the end of the year, it goes on for another year.  Similarly, it goes on from year to year until either of the contracting parties take exception to it, and then it lapses.  That really is the Treaty.  For my own part, I should like to say that I am in entire sympathy with the Treaty, because I am in entire sympathy with the attitude of the United States Government.  It is not for us to criticise the laws of another country.  Certainly it is not for us to criticise the laws of the United States. The United States people have decreed certain restrictions upon liquor traffic.  They did this in the exercise of their judgment, and under the provisions of their Constitution, which is a written Constitution, and therefore it is not so easily amended.  There are people in the United States who would like to amend the law, but they find considerable difficulties in the way.  I quite imagine that American ingenuity will find a way to amend <Col N="1331" /> this law eventually, but for the time being it is the law in America.</P>
    <P>It certainly would not be my wish to do anything to complicate the difficulties of the American administration, under what is certainly a situation of considerable difficulty, because under this Prohibition Act great interests are involved and great interests have grown up which are opposed to the Government, or the administration of that country.  As I have said, my sympathies in this matter are entirely with the Government of the United States, and I would like to see&mdash;and I believe it will be the result of this Treaty&mdash;a similar Treaty made between the United States and every other civilised country.  This Treaty will be taken as an index one. I commend it to the Seanad, because I am perfectly satisfied that it is in conformity with the wishes of the great majority of the United States. It has also the support of the Government of the United States, to which we owe a great deal, and to which we may owe other things in the years that are to come.  I hope the Seanad, therefore, will agree to this unanimously, in view of the circumstances, and in view of the people with whom we are making our first Treaty as a recognised State&mdash;the Free State of Ireland. The sooner this Treaty is ratified by the different members of the Commonwealth to which we belong, the sooner will other nations who are watching us in the matter follow.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion. As the mover has pointed out, the great American nation has passed a law of prohibition, and they are making efforts, against difficulties, to have that law carried into effect.  It is well we should act in conformity in facilitating them in carrying out the laws they have made.  We know that ships of foreign nations have been trying to flout this law.  By ratifying the Treaty it will preclude foreign ships, by some device or other, from infringing American laws, in, perhaps, the guise of Irish vessels.  It is also good to give expression to our sympathy with the great American people and the American <Col N="1332" /> Government in their efforts to lead not only their own country, but humanity into paths of temperance reform.</P>

      <P>This, as far as I know, is the first time the Seanad has been called upon to ratify or express any opinion about a Treaty made by the English Government.  It is a very serious and far-reaching question as to whether we should do this or not.  We have not had very much time to consider the matter, and it is a matter extending into the Constitution, and the right of the Free State, perhaps, to make its own Treaties, entirely independent of the British Government.  It is a rather serious thing to be suddenly called upon, without any time, to consider this difficult question, to decide as to whether we should carry out this. &ldquo;Seanad Eireann approves of the ratification of the said Treaty, and recommends that the Executive do so advise the Crown.&rdquo;  I do not quite see how Seanad Eireann comes into this affair. I see that Article 2 refers to vessels under the British flag.  What about the Saorstát Eireann flag?  I do not see that we come under this at all; it only affects the British Government.  British vessels are mentioned three times.  This raises the whole question whether Saorstát Eireann is or is not British.  I do not quite know how I stand in this matter, and I am not prepared to enter into it and vote for it without more consideration.  I do not see why more time should not be given to us to go into all the legal aspects, which are far reaching.  I am not a Constitutional lawyer, and I would like to have some discussion with other people to see how far this leads us.  I cannot see that we are concerned with this at all, except to ask the Governor-General to notify the British Government that we approve of the British Government making this Treaty for themselves.  If so, I do not see that we are concerned at all, for no mention is made of Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Minister if this Treaty is being submitted to the Parliaments of the different members of the British Commonwealth, and what will happen in the case of any of these Parliaments not confirming it. Suppose that the Oireachtas in its wisdom does not confirm this, how does the Saorstát stand in regard to this particular Treaty?  One, of course, would want to have some pretty wide knowledge of international law in order to be able to say anything in regard to the matter.  We cannot discuss the merits of the Treaty, and, obviously, we cannot alter it.  We can confirm or refuse to confirm.  Whether that means anything or not is another thing.  If it means anything, the procedure adopted is pathetically simple, the introduction of a resolution which we see to-day for the first time.  If it does not mean anything, I suggest we should not toy with it.  Ships sailing under the British flag will be bound by this whether or not we assent to it, for that flag represents the authority and power of Britain.  I do not know whether that assumes that the Saorstát is eventually to have a mercantile flag of its own registered internationally and recognised, and in such an event whether it would be necessary to have a separate Treaty as far as the Saorstát is concerned.  I presume that for practical purposes we really are not interested in it at all, because I do not suppose that many of the &ldquo;boot-leggers&rdquo; come from the Emerald Isle or are likely to come in the near future.  They do too good a trade at home in Donegal and elsewhere.  The three-mile limit, of course, is an important consideration. I believe it is an international arrangement.  It is one that affects the fisheries of Ireland particularly, and I believe it is not sufficient to guard the fisheries in places like Donegal, at least so I am informed. I do not know whether it is correct or not that a wider limit is necessary in order to prevent the poaching of foreign vessels on Irish <Col N="1334" /> fishing grounds, or that Irish patrol boats have no power under international law to interfere with them at present.  These are considerations which would enter into any Treaty to which we were a party.  Of course, we have not been consulted at all in connection with this.  We have not power to discuss amendments to it, and it has not been shown to us yet if it matters whether we pass it or not.</P>

      <P>The Senator asked if this Treaty had been submitted to the other Parliaments of the British Commonwealth.  It was submitted to all of them.  I think the last to pass it was Canada.  The Senator also asked what would happen if we did not recommend ratification.  I might reply to that in the words of the reply given in the Canadian Parliament, that the British Government would probably re-word the Treaty and exempt from its provisions the country so dissenting. This Treaty came about in this way.  There was an amendment to the American Constitution, to Article 18 I think it was, bringing in prohibition.  That amendment was made operative, made effective legally by an Act, known, I think, as the Volstead Act, which stated that liquor should not be exported, imported or transmitted through American territory. The Americans had to seize boats.  There was a big, highly immoral, and very lucrative business run, not so much from the Emerald Isle, possibly, as the Senator said, as from, say, the Bahamas.  This business was going on and the American Government was seizing ships.  A case was brought into court in which it was decided, as it obviously must be decided, that American territory included all areas where American sovereignty existed.  That included the territorial waters, because the Act said that liquor could not be transported or transmitted through American territory, which meant that liquor on ships, even under seal, had to be seized by the American Government.  That gave a great deal of trouble, and, in the event of our having a mercantile marine, we might say that if we do not &ldquo;bootleg&rdquo; we do certainly produce intoxicating <Col N="1335" /> liquor in this country, and we might be exporting such liquor to a country where it would be necessary for the boats incidentally to call at an American port.  Without signing this Treaty, all liquor on board a boat would be seized by the American Government.  The <i>quid pro quo</i> that is got from the American Government for this is, that liquor under seal on boats, and recognised as ships' stores, is not seized under the Treaty.  The Treaty had to be made because the question had already been raised in the courts. It was made by the Constitution and by the Act.  As far as the Constitution was concerned, it would not affect ships, because the Constitution does not apply a penalty.  Therefore, the thing was inoperative except by means of the Act.  A Treaty over-rides an Act.  This Treaty has been ratified, I think, or will be ratified, in the American House of Representatives. That has the effect of over-riding the Volstead Act as far as the terms of this Treaty are concerned.  That means to say that the liquor on boats does not have to be seized.</P>

    <P>With regard to the use of the words &ldquo;British boats,&rdquo; I understand that the Department of Industry and Commerce have had on hands for some time past a Merchant Shipping Act which will affect that.  You will have the Act first and, I suppose, you will have the merchant shipping afterwards.  I do not believe we can anticipate being a great mercantile marine country.  We were consulted with regard to this Treaty both by despatch and in the Imperial Conference.  I myself in the Imperial Conference recommended, as far as my voice went, that we should meet America on this.  During the last two years I, as a member of a Government, realised a thing that possibly I did not realise before, and that is that when a law is made in a country, irrespective of whether it is good or bad, that law has to be applied.  The Americans have made this law, and I recognised that it was certainly the business of the Government there to see that that law was enforced.  There was no doubt whatever about it.  I have heard myself of cases of ships running liquor over there, and on one journey making <Col N="1336" /> tremendous sums of money.  The way it was worked was that the ships went and lay outside the three-mile limit&mdash; usually slow-going vessels.  Then quick motor-boats came from the mainland, took the liquor and went ashore with it.  If we had rather a better supply of ships when there was a good deal of gun-running last year, we might also want to go outside the three-mile limit, and at present we might very easily want to go outside the three-mile limit to deal with foreign trawlers in our waters.  This Treaty decides that, irre spective of the three-mile limit, search and seizure may take place to one hour's distance from the coast.  The one hour's distance applies to the boat that takes the liquor to the land.  For instance, when a slow-going vessel goes and lies outside the three-mile limit a fast motor-boat comes out to take the liquor back.  The hour's journey is the journey of the motor-boat.</P>
    <P>With regard to the words &ldquo;British ships,&rdquo; that is more a matter for the Attorney-General to explain.  The word &ldquo;British&rdquo; is a word with two connotations.  There is Great Britain and there is the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Inasmuch as this Treaty has been adopted by the various members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, I presume that the words &ldquo;British ship&rdquo; refers to any ship belonging to any country included in the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Since coming to the Seanad it has been suggested to me that we were attempting to conceal something.  That is not a fact.  In order to avoid any misunderstanding, I might as well say, the Treaty is as it is there.  That is the Treaty submitted to us and as we agreed to it up to the time of its signature by the British Ambassador in Washington. When the Treaty is set out, there is to it a Preamble.  In order to avoid any misunderstanding, with the permission of An Cathaoirleach, I may as well read the Preamble, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Right">Washington,</P>
    <P Just="Right">January 23, 1924.</P>
    <P>His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British <Col N="1337" /> Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India;</P>
    <P>And the President of the United States of America;</P>
    <P>Being desirous of avoiding any difficulties which might arise between them in connection with the laws in force in the United States on the subject of alcoholic beverages;</P>
    <P>Have decided to conclude a convention for that purpose;</P>
    <P>And have appointed as their Plenipotentiaries;</P>
    <P>His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India;</P>
    <P>The Right Honourable Sir Auckland Campbell Geddes, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., his Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the United States of America;</P>
    <P>The President of the United States of America;</P>
    <P>Charles Evans Hughes, Secretary of State of the United States;</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me, since I came into the Seanad, that it was objectionable that the Preamble, which is not part of the Treaty, has the phrase &ldquo;His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;  I may as well explain, as far as I understand it, that that is a remnant of pre-Treaty days.  I have myself suggested to the British a new interpretation.  At present that title is actually attributed to the Crown. I have suggested that it is now obsolete. It is a matter that would require an Act of Parliament in England. <Col N="1338" /> I have not pressed for a change until the actual definition with regard to the Boundary here is settled.  We can then see quite distinctly what definition is to apply to the term &ldquo;United Kingdom.&rdquo;  I mention this as it has been suggested that this document might commit us to something. The terms on the Orders of the Day are the terms of the Treaty.  The Preamble is not an essential part of the Treaty as submitted to us.  With regard to ratification and the words &ldquo;His Majesty,&rdquo; ratification between heads of States, as far as Ireland is concerned, has to be done through the machinery of the Crown.  It is a question of at whose instance that ratification takes place.  In this instance, as far as the Free State is concerned, the ratification will be done at the instance of the Irish Government.</P>
