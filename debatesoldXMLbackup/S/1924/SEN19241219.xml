      <P>In changing the hour of our meeting from 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock, I think I have been justified by the fact that only five minutes ago the Dáil put through a motion suggesting a Joint Conference of the two Houses with a view to adjusting, if possible, their differences over the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  I have received the following Message from the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Dáil Eireann has this day passed the following Resolution to which the concurrence of Seanad Eireann is desired:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it is desirable that a Conference be held between members representing the Dáil and the Seanad upon Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 9 made by the Seanad to the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Bill, 1924, to which the Dáil have disagreed and upon which the Seanad in their Message of the 12th December have insisted;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That five Deputies represent the Dáil at the said Conference.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That the Seanad agree to the suggestion contained in the Message from the Dáil, and that the Seanad do now proceed to elect five representatives to a Joint Conference with the representatives of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>They may be very much the better for it.  At the same time, the liquor industry represents 75 per cent. of the revenue of the Free State, and it would not be right, I think, that the majority of the representatives from this House at the Conference should represent the temperance ideal. I think it would be much better if we were to discuss here ourselves what compromise might be arrived at.</P>

      <P>I have great respect for Senator Colonel Moore.  I nearly always act with him, and I think his opinions are very sound on almost every question except the liquor question, on which, I think, they are particularly unsound.  Therefore, I would propose that the name of Senator Martin Fitzgerald be substituted on the Committee for the name of Senator Colonel Moore.</P>

      <P>There is no provision that I know of to have a vote by ballot.  Whenever we intend to have a vote by ballot it is provided for in our Standing Orders.  I think it <Col N="1398" /> would be rather strange to take a vote by ballot for this.  In any case, I do not think we have the power to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>In opposing the amendment, I desire to point out that the object of the Conference is not to commit this House to anything whatsoever. The recommendations from the Conference, whether they be good, bad, or indifferent, can be accepted or rejected by this House.  The same of course applies to the Dáil.  The intention was to provide amongest the five, a majority of the persons who voted for the two amendments on which the Seanad has insisted.  I have just been present in the Dáil where, in the selection of Deputies to act on the Joint Conference, the same principle has been adopted, the whole idea being to see if it is possible to reach an accommodation between the two points of view, one of which has a majority in the Seanad and the other a majority in the Dáil.  The recommendations of the Conference will not be binding on either House.  They will simply be recommendations to both Houses.</P>

      <P>May I suggest to Senator MacKean that he should allow the Committee to stand as originally nominated.  Whatever recommendations are made by the Conference will come before both Houses, and may be either agreed with or disagreed with.  For myself, if there is a division I shall support the nomination of Senator Colonel Moore, but I think that in the circumstances, it would be just as well for Senator MacKean to let the matter stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacKEAN</NameTxt>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil has fixed the <Col N="1399" /> hour of 2.30 p.m. for the members of the Joint Committee to meet in Committee Room, No. 2.  I take it that the members of the Joint Committee, who have been nominated by this House, will make it their business to be there at that hour.  In view of that, and in view also of the fact that I understand an announcement is to be made in the Dáil at 3 o'clock in reference to the Shannon Electricity Scheme in which a great many members of this House are interested, I suggest that the wisest thing for us to do would be to adjourn until 3.45 p.m.  We can re-assemble at that hour and hear what the result of the Conference has been and also dispose of the remaining business on our Agenda.</P>

      <P>I beg to submit the report of the Conference of members representing the Dáil and the Seanad on certain amendments made by the Seanad to the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Bill, 1924, and disagreed to by the Dáil.  The report is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  The Conference was set up by Resolution of the Dáil, of the 19th December, which was concurred in by the Seanad on the same date.</P>
      <P>2.  The following Deputies were nominated to represent the Dáil at the Conference:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Deputies Johnson, Daly, Baxter, Lyons, and P.J. Egan; and the following Senators to represent the Seanad:&mdash;Senators Guinness, Countess of Desart, Bennett, Farren, and Colonel Moore.</P>
      <P>3.  The Conference met at 2.30 p.m. to-day in Committee Room No. 2 of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>4.  The following members were present:&mdash;Deputies Johnson, Daly, Lyons, and P.J. Egan; Senators Guinness, Countess of Desart, Bennett, Farren, and Colonel Moore. Deputy Johnson was moved to the Chair.</P>
      <P>5.  The Conference decided to recommend&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> (1)  That the Dáil agree to Amendments 1 and 2, to which it had previously disagreed, but insist on its disagreement to Amendment 9.</P>
    <P>(2)  That the Seanad do not insist on Amendment 9.</P>
    <P>6.  The Conference reports accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report is signed by Deputy Johnson as Chairman of the Joint Conference. If I am in order, I beg to move that the Seanad do not insist on Amendment 9, which, I think, is all that is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this motion is passed, I should like to address a few words to the Seanad.  I understand, from what passed here early this afternoon, that the Seanad is in no way committed to the report of this Committee. I believe, if we do agree to this compromise, that the whole question of the licensing liquor laws will have to go before a Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite the position, I think.  What I think the Minister for Justice did say was, that it was his intention to appoint a Commission to go into certain specific matters, but I do not think he said that the Commission was to rove over the whole question of the licensing laws.  He told us that one of the matters to be referred to the Commission was as to whether the existing number of public-houses was too many and should not be reduced.  He also stated it would be possible to refer to that Commission this question of structural alterations. These are the two things that the Minister mentioned.  He did not say that the Commission was going to rove over the entire subject of the licensing laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EarlofMayo" hpid="EARL of MAYO EARL of MAYO">
      <NameTxt>EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this question of structural alterations is to be dealt with by the Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EarlofMayo" hpid="EARL of MAYO EARL of MAYO">
      <NameTxt>EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a most important matter.  Therefore, if we accept the report of our Committee which has come to this compromise, I hope the Seanad will clearly understand that this question of structural alterations, in houses where groceries are sold as well as liquor, will have to come before the Commission.  As the Minister has stated that, I am not going to criticise in any way the report of the Committee from both Houses that has just been submitted.  These windy storms which occur in the Dáil pass as summer breezes.  I hope that we are not going to increase in any way the difficulty of making laws in our Free State.  As you, A Chathaoirligh, have made it perfectly clear that this question relating to structural alterations will have to come before the Commission, I shall not oppose in any way the findings of the Joint Conference of both Houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>As I wish to guard myself from any misunderstandings hereafter, I desire to say that I have no power whatever to state what the scope of this Commission will be. All I can say is that the Minister for Justice said that this question of structural alterations would be an excellent subject to refer to the Commission, but I must not be taken as saying that he thereby pledged himself that it would in fact be made the subject of such a reference.  I believe myself that it will, but I do not want to have any misunderstanding about it.  I am making no promise, because I could give no promise or pledge on the subject.</P>
      <P>The motion now before the Seanad is: &ldquo;That the Seanad do not insist on Amendment No. 9.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended, on the motion for the adjournment, to ask the leave of the Seanad to raise the question of the Note recently sent to <Col N="1402" /> the League of Nations.  I do not now intend to raise the question, but ask leave merely to state my reason for not taking that step.  My reasons are that, in the first place, a statement was made in the Dáil by the Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald) to the effect that the Government of the Free State have sent a letter to the League of Nations, and that that letter will be published as soon as it has been received by the League. Naturally it should not be published until it has been received by the League.  That letter deals with the British Note, and, in view of the fact that that letter has been sent, it would make it much more difficult for us here to discuss the matter as satisfactorily as if we had the full circumstances before us.  A further reason is that the House is so small.  The only object of discussing the matter, it seems to me, here would be to strengthen the Government in the position it finds itself in, I do not think that my purpose would be achieved in such a small House as we have at present.  In these circumstances, and for the reasons I have given, I do not move the motion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter was taken in hands by the Board of Works, two months ago, after an interview with several Senators, including the Vice-Chairman and myself.  We suggested certain accommodation should be provided in the Chamber allotted for the purpose of our sittings.  There were two alternative plans with regard to the admission of the Press and the public.  Any Senators who have been to view the place will recollect that as you go up the grand staircase, as I may describe it, there is a large statue of stone or marble which, to some extent, blocks the way.  One suggestion was to remove that statue and to run a gallery which would have an exit into our Chamber by making a doorway in the main wall of the building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> The other was to leave that staircase alone&mdash;that is, the existing stone staircase&mdash;and to put up an approach for the public and the Press upon the other side of the Chamber.  That would involve a substantial outlay, because it would mean the construction of an approach from below up to a level with our Chamber.  It would be a much more convenient and suitable adjustment, because it would enable accommodation to be made for the Press and would give them a private writing room and it would also completely cut off the access of the public and strangers by that staircase, which would then be exclusively reserved for Senators. I do not think that any decision has yet been come to as to which of the two plans they will adopt.  The first does not involve much expenditure; the other would involve considerable expenditure, but it would be a material advantage to the value of the premises, and in that way the expense might be compensated for.  I do not know what the ultimate decision will be.  The Board of Works are proceeding as quickly as they can with the transformation of the Chamber to make it suitable for occupation by the Senate. It certainly will not be available the next time we meet, and probably we will not be in it very much before Easter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inform Senator Yeats that if the first plan is carried out, then the door, which is a dummy at the moment, would be used, but as far as the internal decorations are concerned, they will not be interfered with.  If, on the other hand, that can be dispensed with, then the window on the other side will become a door. No serious alteration will take place except on the ground floor to make it suitable for the Seanad.  The small staircase would interfere with the hall. Putting across the hall a short staircase would not add to its beauty.  But we were assured by the Board of Works that it can be easily taken away&mdash;which would leave the hall just as it was before.</P>

      <P>It would be an advantage if Senators would utilise the opportunity between this and their next meeting to go and see the premises. The Board of Works and their architect were exceedingly courteous and obliging, and are only too anxious to receive suggestions and hints, and only too desirous to meet our views in every possible way.</P>
