      <P>There was a difficulty suggested to me by Senator Douglas with regard to the question as to whether the Committee that is now sitting and dealing with those Electricity Bills would have power to function at a time when the Seanad itself is not in actual session.  My own view is that there is no difficulty in their doing so, It is not a prorogation.  It is not the end of a session.  It is simply that we are not holding a meeting for another interval.  My own view, and the Standing Orders do not seem to conflict, is that there is nothing to prevent the Committee from remaining on and concluding their business.  The Chairman has told me that they require the whole of next week to conclude.  They propose to sit the whole of next week, and they contemplate sitting certainly until Friday next.  At the same time, if there is any doubt in the minds of the Seanad it would be no harm to pass a resolution authorising, on behalf of the Seanad, this Committee to continue their business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not an opportunity of consulting with you.  My suggestion is that if we adjourn there would be no doubt, but if we were to pass a resolution there would be.  There has been a question of the length and duration of the session.  If the other House brought the session to an end, under the Constitution the session of <Col N="1314" /> the Seanad is not necessarily brought to an end.  As it is a joint committee, a point of difficulty might be raised. My own view is if it is decided to bring the session to an end then it would be wise to pass two resolutions, one carrying forward all Private Bills to the next session in the stage in which they were. That might later be inserted as a Standing Order.  In the case of those Liffey Bills, I think it is necessary expressly to give the Committee powers to meet whether the Oireachtas is in session or not, and take the stage they reach as the complete stage, provided they complete their work before the following session.  I consulted with the Examiner of Private Bills and I find there is some difficulty in drafting a resolution.  I came to the conclusion that we would have to meet for a short period next week, and in that case I would undertake to have a resolution provided.  I do not think it would be wise or necessary to move any resolution.</P>

      <P>I think it would be very well if we had on our Standing Orders a resolution to the effect that Private Bills might be carried on to the next session at the stage they reach.  I think that would be a public convenience, and probably it would result in saving money.  I do not know whether Senator Douglas considered that point.  I certainly would be in favour of having Private Bills coming on at the conclusion of the Session taken up for consideration at the next.  With regard to this Electricity Bill, there is no doubt that its promotion has cost a good deal of money.  It is a question that should be settled as soon as possible, and if it were necessary that they should continue their Session after the Dáil had adjourned, I think some resolution would be necessary.</P>

      <P>In other places the practice has been that when they are adjourning a public Session or when there is a prorogation there is a special resolution passed continuing all Private Bills at the stage they reach on prorogation.  I see no reason why we should not have a Standing Order on the subject, and it is a matter I should carefully look into.</P>

    <P>Perhaps Senator Douglas will see if I am right in this.  No. 1 referred to in the message of the Dáil deals with the amendment inserted on his motion in sub-section (3) of Section 1 of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think No. 2 deals with that.  No. 1 deals with an amendment to Section 1, sub-section (1).  For all practical purposes they are the same amendment and one is consequential on the other.  I move that the Seanad insist on amendments 1 and 2, or preferably I will move 1 and 2 together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Seanad insist on amendments 1 and 2:</P>
      <P>1.  In Section 1 (1) the word &ldquo;or,&rdquo; line 22, deleted and after the word &ldquo;day&rdquo; in the same line, the words &ldquo;or St. Patrick's Day&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>2.  In Section 1 (3) the word &ldquo;or,&rdquo; line 38, deleted and after the word &ldquo;Friday&rdquo; in the same line, the words &ldquo;or St. Patrick's Day&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>I think the Seanad will act rightly if it decides on its point of view with regard to the effect of closing on St. Patrick's Day.  Personally, from a fair amount of correspondence I had on the subject I believe the Seanad would be representing a fair majority of the country in its opinion on St. Patrick's Day closing.  I think that if the Dáil had shown a disposition to have met the point of view of the Seanad, certainly for my part, I would not have been at all inclined as they say to put up a fight for the sake of an amendment like this&mdash;if the Dáil had given away on amendments number one and number two.  In view of the position, and after the Dáil declining to agree to the three Seanad amendments, I think it would be foolish of the Seanad to run away from the amendments, particularly the first and second ones.  I do not think, and I imagine that a great many members of the Seanad will agree with me, that any great calamity is going to happen the country if this Bill is held up for a period of nine months.  While I would have preferred, and still prefer, that an agreement or an arrangement should be reached with the Dáil: nevertheless I think some advantage might be gained by having this matter frankly discussed in the country.  There are large organisations, some representing the trades affected, and others, such as the Pioneers, prepared to try and find out what really is the feeling in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> That might have a healthy effect, and at the end of nine months, if it is desirable&mdash;I express no opinion&mdash;a referendum might be taken inexpensively, in view of the fact that the Seanad elections will take place in twelve months. The two could take place on the same day.  It will be practical politics to have a referendum then.  I do not express any opinion whether it would be desirable or not, except to say that the nine months' delay which may result from the Seanad insisting on its point of view is not a delay that we need be unduly afraid of.  For these reasons, and because I believe there is a strong feeling in the country which we represent on the matter of closing on St. Patrick's Day, and also because I think the movement for the better keeping of St. Patrick's Day was part of the best spirit of the new national movement, it is a great pity the majority of the Dáil should have gone back in such a matter as the observance of that day.  I think we should insist on the amendments, and I believe the Minister for Justice was correct when he said that in this matter we expressed the views of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EarlofMayo" hpid="EARL of MAYO EARL of MAYO">
      <NameTxt>EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Douglas in this matter. St. Patrick's Day is one of the few days in the year on which the public-houses should be closed so that the assistants could have a real holiday. Many of the assistants do not live in the houses where they work, and it would be a good thing to enable them to have a day off to see their friends or relations.  It is wrong that the feast of our patron saint should be celebrated by many people getting drunk.  I do not say that the people drink as much now as they did in years gone by.  The younger generation do not drink as much as was drunk by their predecessors. The soldiers in both armies do not drink so much.  I think it is right that the day should be celebrated without too much drink being taken.  In the big towns, of course, people like to have a pleasant time and to &ldquo;drown the shamrock.&rdquo;  That can be done without going into public houses or getting drunk.  I hope the Seanad will insist upon its amendment, notwithstanding <Col N="1318" /> what the other House has done.  In doing so, I do not think we will be going against the wishes of the people of the Free State.  I agree with Senator Douglas that the day should be kept as a holiday so that the assistants in these houses could go and see their friends and not be stuck behind bars serving drink.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion.  As far as I can see, there does not seem to be any desire on the part of any section of the community to have the publichouses opened on St. Patrick's Day, with the exception of the licensed trade.  It was stated at a recent meeting of that trade that severe losses would be sustained if the public-houses were closed on that day.  It seems rather peculiar that that is the only trade that complains of losses on that day.  Does not every other trade and industry lose to the same extent? In this particular trade they are only asked to close on three days out of the 365.  God knows that is not asking too much.  Still, that trade complains that it would be destroyed if the houses have to close on St. Patrick's Day.  I think it would be unworthy of the dignity of the Seanad if it did not stand by its amendments.</P>

      <P>I think it is incumbent on us to do what we can to see that the national festival will be celebrated in a manner consistent with our national self-respect.  I will certainly vote for the retention of the amendments, and I hope the Seanad will agree to do so unanimously, so that such action will have an effect on the opinion of the country.</P>

      <P Just="Center">AMENDMENT 9.</P>
      <P>Before Section 12 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  From and after the 25th day of September, 1927, it shall not be lawful to carry on any business (except the businesses hereinafter expressly authorised) in the same <Col N="1319" /> building as that in which the business of the sale of intoxicating liquor by retail for consumption on the premises is carried on, unless the portion of the building in which such sale of intoxicating liquor is carried on is structurally separated from and has no internal communication with any portion of the building in which any other business (except as aforesaid) is carried on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move that the Senate insist on amendment No. 9. It was not my intention to move in this matter but Senator Moore is absent, and he and I had some discussion on this matter.  He told me it was his intention that the Seanad ought insist upon amendment 9, notwithstanding whatever action the Dáil may take in the matter.  For that reason I rise to move it.  If the Dáil had shown a reasonable attitude towards amendments 1 and 2, I would not move to insist upon this.  In view, however, of the attitude of the Dáil, it is important that both these questions should be before the country.  There would be a disposition on our part not to insist on amendment No. 9 if the Dáil had respected our position with regard to 1 and 2.  In the meantime I think we ought to insist on all three amendments.  There are practically two and a half years to elapse before the section will come into force, and during that time a great deal can be done in making these structural alterations.  We have read that the Dáil is setting up a commission to go into this whole question of the sale of liquor, and for that reason I think it would be a very useful thing to have this section reinserted by the Senate, if only for this reason, that it will show the point of view of a very large number of persons in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received a very large number of letters, not from temperance associations, though I have met them as well, but from various other people, and all these are in favour of the provision for the structural alterations.  I think it is extremely desirable that in such reductions as will take place, preference should be given to those who have made these structural alterations between now and the findings of the commission. <Col N="1320" /> I think this section serves a useful purpose. My considered judgment is that in view of the action of the Dáil it would be wise for us to insist on this amendment No. 9 standing part of the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeNesbitt" hpid="Mr. NESBITT Mr. NESBITT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NESBITT</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that I have to vote against the motion of Senator Douglas.  Unfortunately, I was not present in the Seanad when this amendment was passed, and, unfortunately also, the number of Senators present that day was very small, as has been admitted by Senator Colonel Moore.  I think there is nobody in the Seanad or in the country who agrees with the principle of mixed trading.  We all know that it leads to a great many abuses.  In the matter of this amendment it is the question of confiscation that I am against.  I think really that what was said during the debate on this question on the last occasion when it was debated here was the proper view, and that was that it was a question for a commission to decide.  The publicans are blamed for all the drunkenness that takes place in this country.  Now, the publican supplies what I might call the more democratic drinker in the country.  I notice that the Minister never said anything in the course of the debate, so far as I have read, of the irregularities in the matter of the supply of drink in this country.  The fact is that our lady friend drives up in her motor car or carriage and goes into a chemist's shop to get a prescription made up, but she can also take away with her a bottle of port, not wanting in quality, and I suppose drink consumed in one's home can affect a person's head just as well as drink consumed in a public house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, again, there are shops in the city called dairies, usually called after some famous flower&mdash;&ldquo;Hyacinth,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Bluebell,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tulip.&rdquo;  These so-called dairy shops do a kind of huckster business.  They sell milk, butter, margarine <Col N="1321" /> and so on.  I was quite surprised, passing some time ago one of these, to see the window of one particular shop full of bottles of wine.  Of course, a chemist's business is quite a proper one to run on its own. I do not see why it should be allowed to sell wine when there is a very large industry in the country, very heavily taxed, for that business and for the sale of drink.  Why should such an industry be compelled at the present time to provide large structural alterations when such a condition is not imposed on the chemist?  I think it is a question for a commission to inquire into.  We all know we have too many licences in this country; investigation by a commission would be one way of doing away with some of them, and then we might hope that the licensed trade would be more profitable and there would be less temptations and less irregularities connected with it.  I will vote against insistence by the Seanad on this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLYSAGHT</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support what Senator Nesbitt has said.  I voted in favour of this amendment originally, but I am very reluctant to do so now in view of the fact that we have insisted on our St. Patrick's Day amendment.  I think it would be more satisfactory and more likely to win approval in the country if, after insisting on our St. Patrick's Day amendment we do not insist upon this.  After all there is a commission to be set up, and if it is to be of any good it is bound to result in some legislation.  If so, there cannot be any advantage in insisting now upon a point that cannot be carried into effect for two and a half years.  If the commission is going to result in legislation that particular reform can be embodied in it if the people of Ireland so desire.  I think we would be doing nothing derogatory if we did not insist on our amendment now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EarlofMayo" hpid="The EARL OF MAYO The EARL OF MAYO">
      <NameTxt>The EARL OF MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in reference to what Senator Nesbitt has stated.  He talked of confiscation but he did not develop his argument with regard to confiscation. He simply mentioned confiscation and stated that it was confiscation for the Seanad to put this amendment into <Col N="1322" /> Clause 12 of the Bill.  Apparently he has the cause of the publicans very much at heart in regard to this matter, and his argument is that there is going to be a commission, but it will take a very long time before that commission reports and I do not think that this matter should be deferred until the commission reports.  My experience is that commissions report long after the matter is necessary to be dealt with, with the result that the evil goes on and remains for a good number of years. The Senator brought forward an argument against a dairy shop, and he said he was astonished to find that one particular dairy shop was selling wine.  I do not know where that particular shop is.  I would like to know.</P>
      <P>It would be very interesting to see a shop for the sale of milk and cream with all sorts of wines in the window. I wonder whether there was wine in the bottles or were they merely an attraction to induce people to buy Dublin milk.  Now, these structural alterations, according to the amendment, need not be done for two and a half years, and how anybody with an idea of common sense can say that that does not give these wronged publicans sufficient time to make these structural alterations, or how anyone can talk of that as confiscation baffles me.  I do not suppose that anyone wants a wall of three feet thickness put up between the grocery shop and the counter where drink is sold.  The structural alteration that the Minister talks about would be merely a good strong wooden partition that people cannot get through, and I cannot imagine how anyone can describe that as confiscation.  The publicans have two and a half years to make this alteration and I think that is quite sufficient.  Notwithstanding what Senator Douglas said, and notwithstanding what Senator MacLysaght said, that because we insisted on the one amendment we should give way on another, we should insist on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compromise is essential to politics, but this is not a matter of politics, it is a matter of controlling drunkenness and drink traffic in this country.  I do not want to make a Second Reading speech, and therefore I can only touch <Col N="1323" /> upon the fringe of this whole matter. This question is exercising the minds of people not only in this country, but all over the world.  Look at America. What they have done there was done on a sudden, and there was nearly being war over the matter.  I quite allow that the Ministers are right; they must take this matter piecemeal, and I have pleasure in supporting the motion that the Seanad insists on its amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given this amendment such thought as I could.  I did not vote upon the original matter, so I more or less am free now.  I think the difficulty of enforcing this upon the country is very great, and if enforced it would inflict great hardship, not only on the owners of the public-houses but on people who frequent those houses. I am not satisfied that the change is altogether desirable, and I think it is one of the questions on which the country ought to be able to make up its mind in the period of time that will elapse between now and when the commission will report.  I know many houses in the West and South of Ireland which are largely grocery establishments, and in regard to which a tremendous hardship would be inflicted on the people if they are compelled to close, as they would be if we insist upon this amendment.  They have very little accommodation and they are so small that they could not put up a substantial division.  We know the contentions that arose out of putting up shutter divisions in the past, and similar contentions have and would give trouble to the community.  For that reason I cannot support the motion to insist on our amendment.</P>

      <P>I also oppose the motion to insist on the amendment.  A great deal of hardship would be inflicted on many people if this amendment was insisted upon, by reason of the fact that it would not be possible for them to make these huge structural alterations.  A great many people are not in the position of the Earl of Mayo, who could have three or four, or ten entrances to his place.  Many of these shops in the country would have to be <Col N="1324" /> rebuilt, or reconstructed, and even if they were reconstructed they could hardly provide two entrances.  These places belong to the people and they are as dear to many of them as the greatest castles in the land are to their owners, and to inflict this hardship on the people would be quite wrong.  I do not care about the two years.  What is the good of two years?</P>

      <P>Two years and a half or a dozen years do not make much difference.  What is the use of two years and a half if people have not the money?  I say it is not fair, and the Government have no authority from the people to put this matter forward. All the talk we hear about the vice of drunkenness and the encouragement of drink comes from people who never went into a public-house and who know nothing about it.  It is altogether exaggerated. Senator Douglas talked about having the country behind him. I deny that he has the people of the country behind him.  He has men behind him who communicated with him, and men who are in favour of prohibition and confiscation, but he certainly has not the majority of the people of this country behind him.  I should like to see this matter referred to the country and a vote taken upon it, and then we would know how many people will go in for this confiscation.  There is no use of talking about high ideals to be aimed at in these public-houses.  Many houses cannot be structurally altered. They are too small, and the attempt to do so would destroy the living of people, and I am certainly not out for that and will vote against the insistence of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NESBITT</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say a word of explanation as to what was stated by the Earl of Mayo.  The Earl of Mayo criticised me for not developing the confiscation argument to a conclusion. What I meant was, and everyone knows the fact, that licences being attached to houses increase their value, and the owner has a certain vested interest in the premises, and to deprive him of this would be a great hardship.  It is <Col N="1325" /> economically impossible in the short time at his disposal and without any compensation that he could make these alterations.  A great many of these houses in the country are run by a family&mdash;that is, by the husband and the wife and daughter and so on.  If certain structural alterations are insisted upon it means that they would have to pay a staff and that is another hardship.  The Earl of Mayo talked about what is done in dairy shops&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister is at present engaged in the Dáil operating another Bill, but the Minister for Agriculture is here and he will give us the benefit of his advice so far as it goes.  We cannot expect him, of course, to be fully acquainted with the minutiæ of a Bill that is not in his Department. I think the Bill was not treated as a contentious measure in the Dáil. There does not seem to be anything very contentious in it.  It seems to be more in the nature of a supplementary Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a very simple one.  It makes provision for the payment of unemployment benefit to a number of insured contributors whose benefit, through long periods of unemployment, had run out.  It proposes that people who were unemployed contributors will get credit in what is known as the fourth benefit year, that is to say, they will get paid the insurance benefit they were entitled to be paid, and were paid, in the third benefit year.  In other words, people who received unemployment benefit to the full extent of the stamps to their credit at the end of the third benefit year, and who ceased to be entitled to get further benefit will, under this Bill, be put into benefit again.  The Bill also provides that the money that will be paid will be benefit in advance.  In other words, it is not a free gift.  It is a continuation of the previous Unemployment Insurance Act that was passed in August last.  There is another important factor in connection with this Bill, and it is this: It proposes to put into benefit <Col N="1327" /> ex-National Army soldiers other than those who previous to their becoming members of the National Army had been in what is known as insurable employment. That is very necessary because of the fact that in the previous Unemployment Insurance Bill provision was not made for these young men who joined the National Army and who had not been in insurable employment prior to 1920.</P>
      <P>You must bear in mind that most of the young men who joined the National Army were not in a position, in the majority of cases at least, to be in what was known as an insurable trade prior to 1920.  Prior to 1920 the number of trades that were known as insurable employment were limited.  It was after 1920 that the great bulk of the workers other than agricultural labourers and domestic servants, were included in the Unemployment Insurance Scheme. Therefore, it is a great hardship on a large number of National Army soldiers, who had not been in insurable employment prior to 1920 and who joined the National Army, that they were not entitled to receive Unemployment Insurance.  The Bill proposes that stamps will be placed to their credit and that they will be deemed to have been in insurable employment.  Therefore they will be entitled to a certain number of weeks' benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.  I would ask the Seanad to study carefully the figures as regards unemployment in this country.  I may say from my experience, and I have a fairly general experience of working conditions in this country during the past 25 years&mdash;this is the experience, too, of the oldest men in a Trade Union movement&mdash;that there has never been, in the history of this city, so much unemployment among what is known as the regular workers as there is to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a lamentable state of affairs that this Bill does not propose to deal with chronic unemployment.  This Bill proposes to deal with the genuine unemployed, with people who are victims of the circumstances of the unemployment that is rampant at the moment in the country.  It proposes to put people who <Col N="1328" /> have been for a considerable period out of employment and whose benefits have lapsed at the end of the third benefit year, into benefit for what is known as the fourth benefit year, and I would suggest to the House that every facility should be given to the passing of this measure.  I notice from the reports of the debates in the other House that the Minister was anxious that the Bill should pass as quickly as possible so that people will be entitled to get this benefit before the end of the year, and I would appeal to the Minister that every effort should be made to have this Bill passed so that the benefits may be paid at least&mdash;to ensure that the great bulk of these people would be sure of their Christmas meal&mdash;if possible before Christmas.</P>
    <P>I do not think I require to say anything more on that side of the question. The Bill deals with two particular classes.  It proposes to put into benefit people whose benefits have lapsed at the end of the third benefit year and some whose benefits have practically lapsed.  Secondly, it proposes to do what is long overdue, to provide unemployment benefit for ex-National soldiers who were not in insurable employment prior to joining the National Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to give some information as to the amount involved for the financing of the scheme.  We all agree with what Senator Farren states, but I think it would be well if, as a matter of information, we were told what the amount involved is.  I would be grateful if the Minister would give that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot take the simple and non-controversial attitude towards this Bill that Senator Farren does.  He and his colleagues have continually told us that this Bill is in the nature of an advance towards a fund to provide benefit for workers in the insurable trades, and that, for the time being, during the prevailing depression this fund is overdrawn and there is a hope that when things get better the fund will get into credit.  I cannot take that view.  Up to a certain <Col N="1329" /> point I did, but the figures are becoming so large and so alarming that I think we have to face the fact that this is no longer a good asset.  It involves, the Minister will tell us, a sum of over a million.  There was a sum of three quarters of a million under the previous Act and there is a sum of £350,000 involved under this Act.  Supposing you place that item on our national balance sheet as an asset, I wonder what any business, any bank, or any insurance company would give you for that?  I think in view of the fact that we are paying it out of revenue, not very much.  I do not think that it should be regarded as an asset that will be afterwards paid off.</P>
      <P>That being so, it looks as if a certain class are getting an undue proportion of unemployment benefit.  The whole principle has rather outlived its purpose, and instead of its becoming a benefit in the proper sense to the workers who contribute, it is becoming more in the nature of public assistance and it should be viewed from a different angle.  That being so, it is really a general question to consider&mdash; I do not suggest that this Bill be thrown out now&mdash;whether this is not the last that we should have of these advances towards unemployment funds and whether any future provision for unemployment should not take the form of relief work covering all the unemployed whether they are in an insurable trade or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope we will have some assurance from the Government that this is the last we are going to get of assistance to this largely overdrawn fund for benefits for certain workers in certain covenanted trades.  That leads to the whole question of public assistance.  I think that is one to be reviewed by the Government and to be co-ordinated. I do not think we know the amount involved in public assistance.  In England many attempts have been made to find out the total amount given to public assistance for pensions and local relief.  In view of the urgent need for economy it seems desirable that public assistance should be brought under one Department, the Department of Finance, and controlled by that.  While <Col N="1330" /> undoubtedly benefits should be in some cases regarded as personal to the worker, the circumstances of the whole family should be taken into account, and where large sums are reaching the family from one source that should be taken into account when distributing from another source.  Where there are large sums in pensions, for example, going into a family, the outdoor relief should be watched.  This public assistance should meet the needs of the case. I know it is a big question, but we will have to face it.  We cannot afford large sums, and the first thing is to bring it under the Department of Finance. Another important thing is to have accounts showing how much we are spending.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to make is that all the grants and contributions of this kind are only in the nature of a palliative to deal with the present trouble, and there is a great danger that the Government and ourselves, following the line of least resistance, will deal with this question in a piecemeal fashion by grants, and our attention will be diverted from the real remedy, which is the revival of our industries through strict economy in public expenditure, through the reduction of all taxation in order to divert money from unproductive into productive channels. I feel the longer we go on meeting problems in this way the less inclination there is to meet the fundamenaal issue, which is to revive trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this is merely a palliative measure, but unfortunately it is the only measure that can be taken in time to avert what would otherwise be a disaster.  It is true also that this debt of the unemployment fund is an asset, although payment of it may be delayed according to the delay in the revival of trade. It is merely an overdraft of the unemployment fund.  I understand the fund was first of all affected prejudicially immediately after the cessation of hostilities in 1918.  Thousands of people who paid no unemployment contributions were then placed on the fund.  It was then merely a dole, because these people paid no contributions.  Since they have contributed in the ordinary <Col N="1331" /> insurance basis it has ceased to be a dole.  The debit to the central fund is an asset and it will be realised that its realisation may be delayed.  When this Bill was being introduced there was a far more encouraging development and that was the assurance of the Minister for Finance that certain relief schemes would work side by side with this, and that a specific amount of money had been set aside for that purpose.  It was mentioned that where relief schemes through the medium of road work have been undertaken throughout the country that local authorities have taken advantage of grants they have got through this to reduce their estimates for road work.</P>
      <P>That is a misappropriation of the funds.  It was never intended for the relief of rates but for one purpose for which it should be used.  In other words, large sums voted for constructive work were availed of by the local ratepayers to relieve themselves.  There is the other question of the amount of work if the money voted for compensation were utilised to start rebuilding. It is a deplorable state of affairs to find in the cities of Dublin and Cork sufficient work available for two or three years and the people responsible cannot be got to start.  No clear reason has been advanced for that.  I cannot see why those buildings cannot be restarted. I think it is time the Minister for Finance began to consider whether he should not come to the Oireachtas for fresh powers to deal with people who do not start in time.  He has power to reduce the grant already, and I suggest that there should be a graduated scale whereby the longer a building is delayed the less the amount to be paid by the State is, unless there were good reasons given for not starting the building.  Another way would be to give something additional to those who would start at once and give employment. Personally, I would consider that a good means of starting the work. We are informed that unemployment is due to lack of confidence in the stability of the State.  That is due to a number of reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the trade depression <Col N="1332" /> there are about four reasons.  The most important is the action of the Republican party in the country in pledging themselves publicly and otherwise to pull down the State either by peaceful or violent means at the first opportunity that offers.  The second is a series of Army crises among themselves which have shaken the State from top to bottom. The third is rumours of dissension amongst the Government ranks. We have those deplorable rumours of squabbles for minor and senior posts, and talk of resignations and secession and so forth.  Those have had a terrible effect on credit and the stability of the State.  After all, the party entrusted with the Government of the State cannot afford to be divided at such a time as this when it requires all the resources of statesmanship that it can command.  It shows a remarkable lack of foresight to see a small party causing rumours to be spread that they are split up and that there is no party to take their place.  I think they should take steps to reconcile their differences and to let the country know where it stands.  The fourth is the attitude of those who are friendly neither to the Free State nor to the Republicans, and who are disposed to take advantage of the present condition of affairs to bring back the conditions that existed before the 6th December, 1921.</P>
    <P>There is a hope, I believe, in the minds of certain people, because of the internal strife in Ireland, that the State may collapse and that the British may return. All these are considerations that affect credit.  I know that someone will say labour has played its own part.  I contend that, in the main, its record has been the most creditable of the lot, and that in a period of wild alarm and civil strife, when the very pillars of society were in danger of being pulled down, the Labour Party was the one party that stood solid, unmoved by either side in its trade union and political organisations.  An ill wind from the west blew in a person, who, in any but in this delightful country, would not be convenienced anywhere except in its prisons.  Naturally, that caused a little friction which is being effectually dealt with and will disappear in <Col N="1333" /> a very short time.  These considerations all underlie the question of unemployment, and until they are considered in a very sincere manner, I do not think we are going to have very much improvement, even when the period of this Bill expires, in March next.</P>
    <P>While the country is being torn asunder by this question of the Treaty <i>versus</i> Republic, and while we have forty or fifty members elected to this Parliament, going about with the dignity of membership of this Parliament, working for the destruction of the State, we must not hope for stability. I urge on the Government the suggestion that I made in another place; that is to face the question one way or the other.  Let the Government take their chance and put the question to a Referendum of the people.  I have my own opinion as to what the result would be.  Let it be what it will, it is better to have it decided.  Make it impossible by legislation for any persons to go about the country with the dignity of T.D. after their names, while at the same time they are working for the destruction of a State of whose Parliament they are members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with Senator Sir John Keane, and largely with Senator O'Farrell.  There are other factors that have tended to aggravate the question of unemployment. I really think that Senator O'Farrell has been particularly tender to his own Party, even though I know that some of the difficulties have been forced upon it.  Still, it is not lacking in that respect.  I happen to be a Jonah in connection with destroyed premises, both in Cork and in Dublin. The difficulties of people whose property was destroyed have been very great.  I suggested on behalf of one company that a higher rate than the standard wages should be offered in return for increased production.  They were told it would be absolutely useless to do so, and that the restrictions on output would not be waived.  I think that has tended to increase the cost of building to some extent, and that it would be necessary for those whose property was destroyed to incur financial <Col N="1334" /> liability to supplement the award given them.  They were deterred by the excessive cost put on them owing to restrictions.  It is only fair that that should be known and considered by men who, I admit, are reasonable men, in the Party with which Senator O'Farrell is associated.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in the debate again but for the remarks of Senator Dowdall.  I am glad to have an opportunity of publicly meeting the statement he made.  He has referred to restrictions on output by the trade unions.  I deliberately challenge Senator Dowdall, or anyone else, to produce any single trade union rule that puts a limitation on output. It is not fair for people to make a general statement of the kind without evidence to substantiate it.  Some time ago a statement appeared in the leading article of one of the daily newspapers, that there was a limitation and a restriction on output by the trade unions.  When the editor was challenged to bring forward proof of the statement, he ran away from it.  I suggest it is unfair, without evidence to support it, that such statements should be made publicly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to repair the omission in my earlier remarks and also to supplement what Senator Dowdall said as to the causes of unemployment. A more important cause than any that has been mentioned is in connection both with the rates of Income Tax and its administration.  The rates themselves as compared with England are only a very small difference, but they act as an impediment to the inflow of capital for industrial development. Not only do they act as an impediment to the inflow of outside capital, but <Col N="1336" /> they act as an impetus to the outflow of capital for investment abroad.  A far greater impediment, however, is the administration.  We have no very attractive securities to offer, but even if we had the same security equal to that available in any other country, we have this fact of the double deduction of tax, with the most elaborate and perplexing methods of recovery.  I know, of my own personal knowledge of investors in England, who have deliberately sold their Irish securities in order to get rid of all this trouble. That is to say, you have people selling Irish securities on account of these Income Tax recovery perplexities, and the difficulty of obtaining a repayment even if ultimately you do gain a repayment. This will not help to bring any fresh capital into the Saorstát.  I entreat the Government to give their earnest consideration to this matter. As things now are, they cannot look with any confidence to outside capital being brought in to any great extent for the development of our industries.</P>

      <P>When the Army Act was passed it was rather rushed through on the understanding that many more of these Bills were to be introduced so as to give opportunities for fuller discussion.  That has not been done.  Since then, also, trouble in the Army has arisen, and I really do feel that it is necessary to give Parliament an opportunity of passing such criticisms as may be necessary from time to time, so that there may be no question whatsoever as to the supremacy of the Civil power in, the country. For that reason I beg to move that the <Col N="1338" /> Army Act be added to the Schedule of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Senator has raised a question of huge importance, and I do not know that even the Seanad, with its characteristic courage, would embark on a proceeding of this kind at such short notice.  The Senator has raised a question that has brought about revolutions in many countries.  He has raised possibly the most important question that could be raised if we were settled down and existing in normal conditions.  I agree with the Senator.  I hope he will return to the charge at his first available opportunity, and I promise him I will give him all the assistance I possibly can.  Because, no doubt, many of the things now done would make our fathers turn in their graves.  We are passing through a revolutionary period. In principle, I cordially agree with the Senator and I hope he will return to the charge at a more favourable time in the future, when I hope to be here to support him.</P>

      <P>That disposes of all the business that is available for us.  So far as I know, that question of the Railways (Directorate) Bill, 1924, which it was thought would reach the Seanad before this hour, has not yet been dealt with by the Dáil, who, I understand, have not finally considered it yet.  I understand it is still being discussed in the Dáil.  The <Col N="1339" /> discussion is likely to terminate soon and the Bill to be passed.  The alternatives are now that we should adjourn until 4 o'clock, or that we should adjourn now and meet again next week.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The House can determine that when they meet at 4 o'clock.  I am not for a moment asking them to do anything unusual with regard to the Bill.  That will be for the Seanad itself.  It is only a question when we have the Bill before us.  I am anxious to consult the convenience of the members of the Seanad as far as possible, and if the Bill would be ready, whether it would suit the convenience of the members to consider it at four o'clock.  Then we could make some progress with it.</P>

      <P>As Senator Douglas has said, we will in all probability meet next week, and might I suggest that if we do meet next week that it is not very easy for Senators who have other engagements here in the city, to get out of these engagements at such short notice, and for that reason I suggest that it would be more convenient if we did adjourn now until next week.</P>

      <P>My sole and only purpose in view is to consult the convenience of the greater number. What I feel is that if we do meet next week, probably, say, on Wednesday, it is extremely likely that the whole proceedings would be over in an hour.  It is not conducive to the dignity of the House that we should be having these separate sittings and that they should be of a short and brief nature.  The only thing now left over is this Railways (Directorate) Bill, 1924, and the outstanding question between the two Chambers in the matter of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  If we call a meeting of the Seanad for next week, we will be bringing a number of persons from different parts of the country, and probably occupy their time for two hours.</P>
