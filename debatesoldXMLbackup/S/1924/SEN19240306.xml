      <NameTxt>Mr. HAUGHTON</NameTxt>
      <P>To this effect&mdash; that some of us in the South of Ireland are under the impression that it is almost impossible for the Committee to arrive at a satisfactory agreement with regard to sites in the metropolis.  Many of us thought, and I think that the majority of the people throughout the country also thought that the Old House in College Green would ultimately be selected for that purpose, but I fear it is not likely to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenjaminHaughton" hpid="Mr. HAUGHTON Mr. HAUGHTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HAUGHTON</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of my suggestion is there is an old saying &ldquo;Limerick was, Dublin is, and Cork will be,&rdquo; and I was going to suggest that the City by the Banks of the Lee be selected as the Old House in College Green is apparently not to be utilised.</P>

      <P>You see that in order to give permission, as our Standing Order is framed at present, I should have to determine that the matter was one of urgency as well as of public importance.  Inasmuch as there is a Committee sitting to deal with the question of the temporary accommodation of the Oireachtas and they have not yet approached the question of permanent accommodation, I cannot, I am afraid, rule this matter as urgent though it is one of public importance, but you will have an opportunity in the future when the various reports come up of raising the important question about the fair city in the South of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an amendment that was discussed on a point you raised, and I now submit the following new amendment: In Section 23 to insert the following words: &ldquo;That no judge shall sit upon the hearing of an appeal in an action tried before him, whether with or without a jury, or upon any appeal from a judgment or order made by him, or to which he was a party, whether concurring or dissenting.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>These were left over to enable me to ascertain from the Chamber of Commerce whether I should agree with them or not.  I had a conversation with the Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, and I believe that Senator O'Dea, on behalf of the Chamber, will deal with any matter concerning it.  I do not propose to deal with them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>The alternative is the Government amendment No. 22, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 50.  To insert immediately after clause (iv.) and before clause (v.) a new clause (v.) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(v.)  If the plaintiff so elects, in any action founded on contract, whether the claim be to enforce, rescind, dissolve, or annul the contract, or for damages or other relief for the breach thereof, by the judge for the time being assigned to the Circuits within which the contract was made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That amendment approaches the matter from a different angle, and I understand it was accepted as an alternative by the mercantile gentlemen whom I received on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DEA</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with this amendment which the Attorney-General has proposed.  Of course, we <Col N="906" /> only got this amendment yesterday, and there has not been time to call a meeting of the Council of the Chamber of Commerce.  I have, however, spoken to several members of the deputation that waited on and had a consultation with the Attorney-General.  In the first instance, I am instructed to thank him very much for the great courtesy and great pains he took with the matter which we are discussing.  They feel perfectly satisfied that this amendment meets their case very fairly so far as Section 46 is concerned.  What they instructed me to ask the Attorney-General was to apply the same procedure to the District Courts.  I think the Section they mean it to apply to is Section 76. I think it would be very prudent, and it would save a lot of confusion and expense if the same procedure were applied to the other clause.  In case the Attorney-General is willing to do that we would have no further opposition to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion made is that a clause somewhat similar to this, so far as it is applicable, should be passed to deal with District Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to see how it will be framed. There will be always power to take the matter to the High Court, and ask the High Court to send it to the District Court.  I do not see for the moment how we can frame one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection was that in many cases where an action was founded on a book or a contract debt it would involve a man taking his book-keeper and accounts to the country, and the point you met is to provide that if in such a case as that the contract was made in Dublin the plaintiff could sue in the Circuit Court in Dublin.  Senator O'Dea says his Association is anxious that a similar clause with reference to District Courts should be inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>Contracts to that amount could be brought up in the Dublin Circuit Courts if the contract was made in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think <Col N="907" /> that in the District Court the jurisdiction is where the defendant resides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Shall we leave it over for a little while?  Are you satisfied with that, Senator O'Dea? The Attorney-General says he is not quite sure that under the terms of the Bill you have not got that power already. You can raise the point again when we come to Section 76.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>No. 26 stood over in order that we might examine the form of words.  There is no difference of opinion as regards the idea, which is that judgments should be executed in any part of Ireland which are judgments of the Circuit Court.  I propose a new Section 58 in these words: &ldquo;Rules to be made under this part of this Act shall provide for the service of all originating or other documents or notices both inside and outside the circuit of the judge before whom the matter is intended to be brought or is pending.  Any judgment or order of the Circuit Court may be enforced in any part of Saorstát Eireann in any of the modes in which a like judgment or order of the High Court might be enforced.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The next is a Government amendment:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 63.  After the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in line 44 to insert the words <Col N="908" />&ldquo;of whom one shall be a solicitor having his office and carrying on the practice of his profession outside the City and County of Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>During the week I had a deputation from the provincial solicitors in Ireland with reference to the Bill.  The only complaint they had was as regards representation under the rule-making authority, and I undertook that I would offer an amendment in which provision would be made that one of their body at least should be on the rule-making authority in both the Circuit Courts and the District Courts.  They will be most interested in the procedure of both these Courts, and it is highly proper that they should have a voice in the making of the rules.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 32, to delete Section 64, not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 64, Government amendment:&mdash;To insert immediately after the word &ldquo;costs&rdquo; in line 6 and within the bracket the words &ldquo;and also the entering-up of judgment and granting of summary judgment in appropriate cases.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>That amendment is in fulfillment of a promise that I made to Senator O'Dea's colleagues in the Chamber of Commerce and the Mercantile Association, that there would be in the Circuit and District Courts provision for entering up judgment where no defence is made to a claim, and also power to apply for summary judgment on affidavit.  This amendment is for the purpose of enabling rules to be made carrying out these ideas.</P>
      <P>Amendment put, and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Government amendment to Section 66:&mdash;To delete the word &ldquo;Judges&rdquo; and to substitute the word &ldquo;Justices&rdquo; therefor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government asks the House not to press the amendment, which was carried in Committee.  The position of the District Justices is undoubtedly that of Judges; there is no question of that, and there can be no question of it.  But when it comes to putting the same designation <Col N="909" /> on Judges of every grade in the hierarchy of Judges, it may lead to some confusion.  We do not want the thing made ridiculous, as in the case of the colonels after the American Civil War.  However, there is also another feature in this which makes one suggest that it should not be insisted upon.  These District Justices were created something over a year ago, and they have become an established institution.  They are known by this title of District Justice throughout the country.  All their stationery, forms and rules are printed, and to make this change would lead to another upheaval.  We had one upheaval when we got rid of the Resident Magistrates, and it would lead to another if the title of these Justices were to be altered now.  I met Deputy Johnson on the matter half-way in the Dáil by accepting as the Irish term the term Breitheamh.  This is the same term that is applied throughout to all the Judges, and I think that with that compromise perhaps Senator O'Farrell will not insist upon this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved this amendment I pointed out that in my opinion it was not one of supreme importance, but that I thought it was desirable if they were looked upon as judges and thereby rendered independent of every power, except the Constitution and the law, that it should be so stated in plain English, that they should get their proper definition.  The Attorney-General has made that definition in the Irish language, but he does not see fit to make it in the English language, which is an extraordinarily anomalous position.  Of course, he follows the same line as the President did on the last occasion, that it is to prevent confusing of these judges with Circuit Judges, but I think on that occasion we also pointed out that there might be a similar danger of confusing Circuit Judges with High Court Judges, and that it was hardly a very legitimate objection to the change.  There is also, of course, the position, as we pointed out on the last occasion, that the jurisdiction of these judges or justices, or whatever they may be called, will be considerably changed or widened as the result of the passing into law of this Bill, and that it might be desirable to mark that great <Col N="910" /> change by calling these people judges instead of justices.  It would be one other means of bringing home to the community as a whole the fundamental change that had been made in the matter of the administration of the law. Of course, as to whether they are called justices, from the point of view of convenience, as against judges, is a matter perhaps for consideration.  There is nothing fundamental in that.  But what makes me apprehensive of the whole position is this, that this amendment seems to be only paving the way for the amendment which the Attorney-General has down, providing for the salaries of these justices to be paid out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas, and consequently open for discussion every year. That is the dangerous part of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to assure the Senator that there is no relation whatever between them, as he will see when I come to the other.  It never occurred to my mind that there was any relation between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the assurance of the Attorney-General, but these are the motives that inspired me to move the amendment, and I confidently left it to the House, which decided, after a pretty full discussion on the last occasion, to change the name.  It is rather undesirable, in my opinion, that after we discuss a matter pretty fully, taking the views of both sides, and passing in Committee a certain amendment, we should, without any new cause being shown, come along on the Report Stage and reverse our decision. I am afraid that is putting us in the position of simply passing amendments to show that we can pass them, but when they come back, without any new argument adduced or any new reasons advanced, we are asked to alter our position right away.  If the House agrees to adopt that procedure, I cannot accept any responsibility for it, and the House itself will be at liberty to adopt that attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here when the matter was discussed on the previous occasion, and I did not know I was covering the same ground as the President had covered.  I should have tried to avoid it otherwise.  But <Col N="911" /> it has been impressed upon me that there would be a large amount of administrative inconvenience, and I merely put it as a request that the thing should not be pressed.  I leave it entirely in the hands of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner in which confusion has undoubtedly arisen is this, that in the old days one never thought of describing as Judges Resident Magistrates or the unpaid Justices.  &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; was a name reserved for the County Court and High Court Judges, and I think it was this that the framers of the Constitution had in their minds.  But, nevertheless, on the strict interpretation of the Constitution it would certainly include Judges of all Courts set up under the Constitution, and that being in the Constitution, therefore, covers District Justices.  This was fully discussed before.  The Seanad took the view that it would be better to call them Judges, and the question now before the House is whether the reasons put forward by the Attorney-General are persuasive enough to induce the House to go back upon their previous decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put this aspect of the case before the House.  In the public mind the term &ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; from the legal point of view, is largely associated with Justices of the Peace. Knowing that would tend to give the impression to the general public that these Justices were reduced, as it were, or not considered to be equally entitled to the appellation of &ldquo;Judge,&rdquo; I think it would be rather unfortunate.  I anticipate, owing to the increased jurisdiction that has been given to District <Col N="912" /> Justices, there will be, at the outset, at least, a large number of appeals.  We should raise the dignity of these Courts in very possible way, in the matter of title or otherwise.  They will be largely used as lesser courts, by defendants and plaintiffs, for the purpose of testing the strength of the other side with the ultimate intention of appeal.  They will be used just as a sort of going over the course to find out as much as they can of the case of the other side.  That was the practice heretofore in the lesser courts; the idea always was to appeal.</P>
      <P>Unless you give the impression to the public mind that those who preside over the courts are, as in fact they are, in every way capable of dealing with the matters that will come within their enlarged jurisdiction, I think that will increase the chances of appeal from these courts.  That is not an end that is to be desired, and the fact of selecting out from a whole series of courts, those presiding over these courts, and describing them simply as justices, will have the effect of conveying an impression to the public that they are of a minor capacity, or for some reason or other are not entitled to the appellation of judge. That would be rather unfortunate.  The Government has proposed to meet the case by calling them Breitheamh.  I think Breitheamh would possibly mean more than the ordinary conception of a judge, and it is a higher title than judge, but if there is a change at all to be made why not change consistently, and call everyone presiding over any court a judge of that court?  That is a very rational suggestion to make, and there can be no confusion arising.  If you call one who is presiding over a district court a district judge, one presiding over a circuit court a circuit judge, and so on, you will have no ambiguity, and you will know what is meant.  The point I wish to stress particularly is, that in making any distinction of this sort, which is a rather subtle one, it should be one that would satisfy the ordinary man.  The ordinary man in the street will simply know and observe that there is that distinction made, and that it is derogatory, and that would be unfortunate.</P>

      <P>It occurs to me that the inconvenience referred to by the <Col N="913" /> Attorney-General is entirely temporary, whereas the name District Justice or District Judge, whichever is adopted, is going to be adopted permanently. Therefore I think temporary inconvenience ought to give way.  I will have great pleasure in supporting the view of Senator O'Farrell.</P>

      <P>I have been looking up the Standing Orders, and although I am satisfied the Attorney-General, with his legal knowledge, has got inside the Standing Order, I suggest he is sailing dangerously close to the wind.

      <P>It would be in the hands of the Chairman; if the Chairman thought it was brought forward for obstructive purposes he has power to rule it out.  I suggest that if a member of this House proposed an amendment on the Committee Stage, and it was defeated, and he put down the same amendment on the Report Stage, that it would be within the power of the Chairman to rule it out of order.  I say the exact position is the reverse now.  The amendment was passed in the Committee Stage, and the Government come along now and propose an amendment to change that amendment.  I suggest that is sailing dangerously close to the wind.  However, dealing with the merits of this case, we have to remember that the District Courts will approximate to what the County Courts were, and that the functions of the District Justices or Judges will be similar to those performed in the old days by the County Court Judges.  If it was right that those who presided over the County Courts should be designated judges, there is no reason why those who preside over the District Courts should not have the designation of judges also.  After all they are acting in the capacity of judges, and what <Col N="914" /> is the reason the Government are not anxious to give them their proper title? The Attorney-General's argument does not hold water.  A rubber stamp put over the present stationery will meet the inconvenience that would be caused regarding the stationery at present in stock, in which they are described as District Justices.  If that is all the inconvenience, I think the House has not sufficient reason why they should alter the decision arrived at on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The Attorney-General has said that he has given these District Justices an Irish name. That is by way of compromise, I believe. What I want to know is, what is the difference between a Justice and a Judge?  I have a dictionary here, Cassell's New English Dictionary, which is the latest, and I find there that the Lord Chief Justice is a Judge combining the former functions of President of the King's Bench.  I take it that Justice and Judge are much the same, then.  If so, why all this trouble and fuss about papers that have been printed?  After all, that is not a very great matter, and, with all due respect to you, sir, after having consulted the latest dictionary and finding that Justice and Judge mean the same thing, and as a District Justice has been labelled with an Irish name, which seems to please people very much, why should we not let it remain as it is and allow the Government amendment to pass?  We are discussing a matter in which there is really the difference between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on this amendment on the last day, and I think if Senator O'Farrell will look up his list of amendments he will find four, or possibly five, amendments disposed of on the last occasion, which again appear on the list.  I do not complain of that. I simply point out that the Attorney-General has not secured any special treatment for the Government by introducing another amendment.  I mentioned on the last day that these District Justices were set up by the Government during a time of great trial and stress.  It was at a time when, I think we might reasonably <Col N="915" /> confess now, the positions were not regarded as plums, and that there was considerable danger attached to the holding of these offices at that time.  I think that during the 14 or 15 months not one single District Justice resigned his office.  They performed their duties sometimes under great difficulties in a time of stress, and they honoured this particular distinction by which they are described in the Bill, by the Committee which advised the Government, and upon which the Bill is founded.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;District Justice&rdquo; has become during a time of stress an honoured term, a new institution in the country under which the Justices were given much more jurisdiction than formerly attached to the elementary courts, which is probably the easiest way of describing them.  They have come to be known as District Justices. I hope and believe they are respected and that the people have a considerable amount of confidence in them.  Relabelling them &ldquo;Judges&rdquo; will not enhance or increase that confidence.  It might, however, lead to some mixing up of terms if we had District Judges, Circuit Judges, and Judges of the High Court, as we would then have something like forty judges in all.  The term &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; is not a term of reproach in the hierarchy of the judiciary, as the Attorney-General has stated.  Practically all the Judges of the High Court, I think, are known by the term &ldquo;Mr. Justice.&rdquo;  There are also special distinctions with regard to particular Judges, such as the Lord Chief Justice or the Lord Justices who are Appeal Judges.  In this case I urge that this has become an honoured and honourable method of describing this particular class of Judge through the country, and the present occupants retaining that office I think ought to be allowed to retain whatever credit they acquired during that period of trial and of stress when they did their duty fearlessly, and, I think, with great satisfaction generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the remarks made by the President are really a good, sound reason why we should take his advice, and I think the whole Seanad should agree with him.  Senator O'Farrell is trying to give a title of honour to the Justices, or Judges, and the President's argument is that the greatest honour is done them by leaving them with the title of Justice.  We have two amendments dealing with these judges.  If the same treatment in reference to their pay and the source of their emoluments is given to them, then probably the President is perfectly correct. But if we find that their pay is to be left to be chargeable on moneys provided <Col N="917" /> by the Oireachtas, whereas all the other judges are charged on the Central Fund, then I hold that there is a great deal in what Senator O'Farrell said and that the title of Judge will probably carry with it the fact that they will have to be paid also out of the Central Fund.  I think the two amendments are very much tied together. Refusing the title of Judge, because Justice is a higher title, and at the same time refusing to put their salaries on the Central Fund, because they are Justices and not Judges, seems to be the argument as far as I can make out.  Therefore, I think Senator O'Farrell is absolutely consistent in his two amendments.  I would like if it were possible to debate the second amendment of Senator O'Farrell before we come to a decision on this one, because the two hang together.  If the District Justices are to be placed on a different and more uncertain Fund which renders them likely to be severely criticised in a way which the other judges are not liable to, then I think we ought to do the best we can to give them the title of Judges, whether we can carry the other amendment or not.</P>

    <P>With reference to this amendment, unfortunately, sir, I think your attention was not called to the necessary preliminary to all matters of finance, namely, a message of the Governor-General upon which every piece of financial legislation must be based.  If it had, I think you would probably have dealt with the amendment that was carried in a different way.  I think really the resolution should accompany Bills when they come up here.  The message under Article 37 of the Constitution provides for the charge upon the Central Fund of the remuneration and <Col N="919" /> pensions of the judges of the High Court, the Supreme Court, and the Circuit Court, and for the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of the remuneration of temporary Assistant Circuit Judges, the remuneration and pensions of Justices, Deputy Justices, and temporary Assistant Justices of the District Court, and any other expenses incurred in carrying such Act into effect.  The financial resolution of the Dáil was in the same terms as the message.</P>

      <P>Certainly, unless I am very much mistaken, the President was here, and I do not think this point was raised.  I think I ought to have got some notice if it was intended to raise it to-day.  It is a very serious Constitutional point, and I do not profess to be capable of dealing with it straight away at a moment's notice.  The position appears, from a copy of the Governor-General's message which has been sent up by the Attorney-General, to be quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;On the advice of the Executive Council and for the purpose of Article 37 of the Constitution I have to recommend that for carrying out the provisions of any Act of the present Session to provide for the establishment of courts of justice according to the Constitution and for the better administration of justice, authority be granted for <i>(a)</i> the charge upon the Central Fund of the remuneration and pensions of the Judges of the High Court, the Supreme Court, and the Circuit Court; <i>(b)</i> the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of the remuneration of Temporary Assistant Circuit Judges, the remuneration and pensions of Justices, Deputy Justices, and Temporary Assistant Justices of the District Court, and any other expenses <Col N="920" /> incurred in carrying such Act into effect.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This is a Message, I take it, in pursuance of Article 37 of the Constitution.  &ldquo;Money shall not be appropriated by vote, resolution or law, unless the purposes of the appropriation has in the same Session been recommended by a message from the representative of the Crown acting on the advice of the Executive Council.&rdquo; The first point that occurs to me is that that only deals with the purpose of the appropriation.  It does not deal with the fund from which the money is to come.  I am not at all satisfied even if this resolution is binding on the Seanad when it comes to discuss the financial clauses of a Bill like this, that this Article covers it.  This Article only seems to make it a condition precedent that the purpose of the appropriation is to be specified.  It does not make it mandatory to specify out of what fund it is to come.  The question here is, inasmuch as the Message of the Governor-General limits the authority over the financial grant in the case of the District Justices to payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, whether that is binding upon the Seanad here, and prevents them saying: &ldquo;No, the payment for the District Justices is to come out of the Central Fund in the same way as the other Judges.&rdquo;  That is the question.  It is a very difficult question to spring here now after completely ignoring it in Committee.  Certainly I am not prepared to pronounce an opinion on it.</P>

      <P>It raises a <Col N="921" /> very grave and serious question which I anticipated must be raised some day, and dealt with.  At the same time it has never been raised until now.  It is this, whether in the case of a Bill not certified as a Money Bill, the hands of the Seanad are tied, so that it is incapable of making any change in any scale of salary or otherwise that is provided in the Bill as it comes up from the Dáil. There is no such limit in the Constitution that I can find.  I am speaking now as I anticipated this and looked into it.  There is of course a restriction on the powers of the Seanad in the case of Money Bills so certified with which you are all familiar.  There is no actual restriction imposed by the Constitution upon the Seanad in regard to Bills that are not Money Bills in dealing with the finances of these Bills. That leaves untouched the question whether having regard to Article 37 of the Constitution, there being no Resolution in accordance with the Message of the Governor-General which sanctions this payment otherwise than out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, the Seanad can go behind that.  That, I think, is the Attorney-General's view.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest, if this is to stand over for consideration, it might be desirable to have a small Committee appointed to consider it.  I should like to have the assistance of Senator Brown and Senator Douglas on this matter, and I think it would be a very desirable thing that they should be associated with me in the consideration of it.  It does not merely affect this particular Bill, but it affects our procedure and raises a question of precedent for all time.  It is the most important and far-reaching question that has been raised in my time here.  Is it the wish of the Seanad that consideration of this particular amendment be postponed, and that in the meantime the Seanad refers it to a Committee consisting of the Chairman, the Vice-Chairman, and Senator Brown, to report.</P>

      <P>Section 74, page 16, lines 53-54.  To delete the words &ldquo;for a declaration of title or in ejectment in relation to such land&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;except in any proceedings brought for the same cause of action.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is really a drafting amendment. I explained it when the Bill was in Committee.  The Attorney-General was not there and it stood over.  The effect of my amendment is to widen the cases in which the decision of the District Court is not to be an estoppel.  If you look at the Section in the Bill you will find it gives the District Court jurisdiction in cases where title is involved. My amendment confines the cases in which the decision of a justice is not to be an estoppel to those two particular cases.  My amendment widens the possible cases in which the decision of a District Justice might be pleaded in an estoppel.  I suggest it is a useful amendment, as there are several other cases where that might occur.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I can hardly agree that that improves the Section.  As a matter of clearness, the expression, &ldquo;the same cause of action&rdquo; is so wide and indefinite that I think it would defeat the object in <Col N="926" /> view.  The idea was this, that a District Justice might have a case of trespass brought before him.  If the matter of title was raised he might dispose of it and the parties might go away, but it left it open, if they liked, as a matter of title, to come to the Circuit Court. The weakness I see in Senator Brown's amendment is this.  As a matter of trespass you might have trespass on Monday, Tuesday, and so on, and if Senator Brown's amendment is substituted the decision on a matter of trespass would not be final at all, because a trespass on each day would be a separate cause of action.</P>

      <P>Certainly, as a tort.  It was not intended to encourage that sort of thing.  It was intended that there should be an estoppel as regards suits for trespass. It left it open to the parties to go in for a declaration of title.  I submit the expression &ldquo;the same cause of action&rdquo; is so dangerous and would give rise to such disputation that it is really opening up a field of litigation instead of closing it.</P>

      <P>I could well imagine cases where the trespass could be repeated.  That would make the measure of damages different from what it might be the previous day.  A gentleman could walk across your ground the first day and commit a trespass.  The next day he might cut up a pathway as he went along.  Your cause of action the second day would be a much more serious one.  I do not think there is much difference in effect between the two.  If I may venture an opinion, I prefer the form which the Government have.</P>

      <P>That, of course, raises another difficulty.  Perhaps this thing requires to be thought out a little more, and as we are not concluding the Report Stage to-day by reasons of the difficulty that arose over that particular amendment that had to be adjourned, we might let this stand over, because, you see, the peculiarity about this whole clause is this.  I think myself it is an excellent clause, particularly because it was I who recommended it.  But the difficulty about it is this, for the purpose we are at now, that it excludes some things that a District Justice can already try without the consent of the accused.  So that if you were to put these words in a very <Col N="929" /> stringent form it might deprive the District Justice of jurisdiction that has already been conferred on him in certain cases.  There are other offences enumerated which he could not try under the existing law, and which he is given power to try for the first time by this Bill.  Therefore, I think it might be desirable to separate it and to put in one category&mdash;(a) those whom he can already try without consent, and (b) those for which he will require to see that the accused realises his position and is satisfied he should be tried.  If it is the desire of the House that this particular matter should stand over to be dealt with until the Bill is finally considered, I think it would be much better.</P>

The President said at the time that he was in favour of it, but he would consult the Minister for Home Affairs, and the Minister for Home Affairs told him that his greatest difficulty was in finding Irish speakers in these Irish-speaking districts of sufficient intelligence and education to carry out the functions of Peace Commissioners. I was rather surprised at the statement, and since that time I put myself in communication with certain sources of information.  There is a Committee of the General Council of County Councils, which has been formed for the purpose of developing Irish culture and the preservation of the Irish language, and if the Minister applies to that Committee he will get very full particulars and very extensive lists of names of men in prominent public positions in these Irish-speaking districts who are fluent Irish speakers and who are sufficiently well educated to carry out the functions of a Peace Commissioner.

Nobody understands them, and they cannot understand anybody.  I think the sources of information tapped by the Minister for Home Affairs must be very meagre.

      <P>I am afraid there is a danger of running considerable risks on this question.  We would all like to see the Irish language revived, and the younger generation well grounded in it, but the action of my friend, Senator Kenny, reminds me of an incident that occurred some years ago. A certain gentleman came down from Dublin to Cork, appeared before the Corporation there, and enlarged on the desirability of the Irish language being universally adopted, suggesting that the minutes of the Corporation should be in Irish, and that Irish should be, as far as possible, broadcasted in the Corporation. A friend of mine who was a member of the Corporation, now gone, I trust, to a better world, asked him a question in Irish, and he could not understand it.  The question was repeated, and then he had to admit, with considerable shamefacedness, that he did not know a word of Irish.  He was thereupon told by my friend that he should go back to Dublin by the next train and not be wasting the time of the Cork Corporation, that they knew how to conduct their own business without being dictated to from Dublin.  I think in this age of broadcasting, when the countries of the world are drawing closer and closer together, and communicating with each other so marvellously&mdash;a friend of mine was listening to &ldquo;The Blue Bells of Scotland&rdquo; being played in New York the other day&mdash;my friend, Senator Kenny, and others wish to have a narrow wall drawn round us, and to have the law interfered with by persons who, if they happen to know a little Irish, are to be appointed to Judgeships and other positions in preference to a prominence of knowledge of the law.  I do not wish anyone to think that I am not as earnest and as keen on the younger generation being taught Irish as any member of the Seanad, but I think there is a danger of going too far on this question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment of the Government is, to my mind, the smallest concession that can possibly be made to the Irish language, Irish sentiment, and Irish thought.  Senator Haughton made some very attractive remarks, and he told a pleasing story at the expense of the Irish language, but he has altogether overlooked the fact that, I am glad to say, the Government has not overlooked, that in a great many districts Irish is the only language really understood.  Senator Haughton speaks from a knowledge of a particular part of the country.  I have been in many parts of the country, and my Irish may be bad, and my English worse, but they understood my Irish and did not understand my English. For any Senator to suggest now that it is an injustice to allow Irish to be spoken is hardly a fair attitude to adopt.  I think in a country like Ireland where, I might say, the position we have attained is largely due to the great interest which was taken in the Irish revival, such an expression from any member of the Seanad at this stage is very retrograde.  I think, and I hope, that the attempt that is being made to revive the language will make each and every one of us feel more keenly the pride of race which we ought to have. Let us be Anglo-Saxons, Anglo-Irish, or whatever we wish to be, we can all have a pride in the past of Ireland and a pride in the ideals transmitted to us through the vehicle of Irish.  That being so, anyone who suggests that Irish should not be fostered in these days of broadcasting ought not to get sympathy from anyone who desires to make Ireland what we all hope she will be eventually, a real Irish-Ireland, thinking through the culture inspired by <Col N="934" /> Irish thought and the ideals transmitted to us, kindling in our veins a responsive chord struck through the ages, through the medium of the Irish tongue. All these things affect our national existence. I, for my part, thank the Government for having made the only concession possible to assist in the method of administration of justice at the moment. I think the Government will find in a short time from the interest taken in the language that it will be practicable and possible to secure in every Irish district every administrator of justice from the District Court to the Superior Court who will be able to expound the language for the benefit of the people.</P>

I think they met us in every way possible, and I do not think any advantage will be taken of the words &ldquo;where practicable.&rdquo; I think if, as has been suggested by Senator Kenny, men have been appointed who are not suitable, that is a matter if brought to the attention of the Minister for Home Affairs could be rectified.</P>

      <P>Senator Haughton's speech reminds me of a good deal of the talk and statements made outside by people who profess a great Platonic affection for the Irish language, but at the same time hold that on no account is it to be used in the Courts or taught to anybody, and that if you give Irish its proper place then the person who does not know English is not to have any fair play in the law or anything else.  That is the effect of what Senator Haughton stated.  Senator Bennett pointed out, very correctly, that it is due practically to the efforts made by the Gaelic Leaguers for the past twenty years that we have gained all we have since then. <Col N="935" /> That is due to the Irish language, and Senator Haughton would not be sitting in this room at present were it not for the movement on behalf of the language. There is no doubt whatever of it, but Senator Haughton perhaps is not as well acquainted with these matters as some of us.  There are people who do not know the history of the past twenty years so well.  Senator Haughton, I think, ought to be a little more careful before he attacks the national language of Ireland in the way he has done.  People who have hitherto felt with him have adopted quite a different attitude.  I congratulate the Government on making some effort, and I hope they will make stronger effort in bringing forward the Irish language.</P>

      <P>The object of the amendment is this. Under the existing law a Justice of the Peace could condemn on report of the Food Inspectors material that was displayed for sale for consumption as human food if it happened to be unsound, and order its destruction.  This amendment enables a Peace Commissioner, on having similar certificates produced to him, to make an order condemning and ordering the destruction of unsound food.  If it were to wait for the arrival of the District Justice it might have become more unsound.</P>

      <P>I want to ask why under Section 87 the number of Justices on the Rule-making Authority is not stated.  Apparently, as it reads now, the Committee could consist of only two Justices.  I would also like to know, although I do not usually <Col N="937" /> champion it, why a knowledge of the Irish language is not necessary in the case of the District Justices as it is in the case of a certain number of the Circuit Court Rule-making Authority. There seems to be a totally different procedure adopted in the case of the Rule-making Authority for the District Courts and there has been no explanation why a different procedure is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the language, the great majority of the District Justices have the language. The range of selection for the other Courts does not afford the same opportunity. It would be almost impossible to constitute a rule-making authority of District Justices without having men who know the language amongst them. A great number of them are fluent speakers of the language, and it is probable for that reason that it did not occur to anyone as necessary to stipulate it.  As regards the number, a large number of District Justices are actually engaged at work, and the difficulty always will be that these Courts, being actually constituted, it will be a matter of trying to recall a certain number of the most efficient for this particular class of work and forming them into a Committee.  We thought it better to leave the number at large.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 90.  Immediately after the foregoing Section to insert a new Section (91) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;91.&mdash;Nothing in this Act or in any rules to be made by virtue thereof shall affect the mode of giving evidence by the oral examination of witnesses in trial by jury, or the rules of evidence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Section which is practically taken from Section (66) of the present Judicature Act in Ireland.  Its objects are, first, to ensure that evidence will be given <i>vivâ voce</i> in open court and be subject to cross-examination and, secondly, that the established laws of evidence shall not be altered by any Rules of Court.  I think it is a necessary limitation of the power of a Rule-making authority that they should not have any power by rules made under the Bill to alter the established rules of evidence.  It is a Section which was thought necessary when the Judicature <Col N="939" /> Act was being framed, and I submit it is a Section which ought to be introduced into this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather afraid of this amendment.  There was a reason, of course, in the Judicature Act why it was necessary, but in this Bill, as it stands, there is absolutely nothing that purports to touch the rules of evidence or the method of giving evidence.  I am rather afraid that if a qualification of that kind is put in, it might suggest that other things are affected.  The Bill does not purport to touch the Rules of Evidence and I do not see myself, if we were to change the laws as regards evidence, how we could do it otherwise than by a subsequent enactment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that I have never contemplated these rules as making alterations in substantive law.  As a matter of fact, at an early stage when we were working out the scheme of this Bill, I foresaw that we would necessarily have to introduce some kind of consequential Bill dealing with a number of matters that would become evident, and that would involve alterations in the law.  It has always been my view that at a later stage when we have worked out the draft rules, we will see a number of matters in which amendments of existing laws will be necessary.  As an instance, we can take the Petty Sessions Act procedure.  I feel sure that we will require a kind of <Col N="940" /> Omnibus Bill dealing with a variety of repeals and amendments of Sections which at the moment it would be impossible completely to visualise, but which will become apparent when the Rule-making Committees get to work. We do contemplate one alteration as regards evidence, by a Bill which shall be submitted to the Oireachtas, enabling accused persons to give evidence in criminal cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely satisfied with what the learned Attorney-General has said.  I am greatly afraid that they might, by rules of court made under this Bill, provide that the mode of giving evidence in cases tried with witnesses before a jury might be altered.  I think that is a very serious thing.  It was thought absolutely necessary in the Judicature Act to put in these limitations as to what could possibly be done by Rules of Court.  I ask the Attorney-General to consider seriously whether he ought not to have some provision of this kind limiting the power of the rule-making authority in these two matters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> The object of the amendment is to retain in the High Court the right to a jury in all cases.  As the Section stands it deprives a body of the right to a jury in the High Court as well as in the Circuit Court, in actions for liquidating sums or for the enforcement of damages for breach of contract.  I submit that this is too great an invasion on the old-established practice of having a question of fact tried by a jury.  It is right, I think, in a Circuit Court where the amounts sued for will be comparatively small, and where the juries are not likely to be quite as satisfactory as they are in Dublin.  I, therefore, think that the Section should be altered so as to preserve in the High Court the right to a jury in all cases.  I quite agree that in the Circuit Court the Section should stand as it is.</P>

In this Section we have dealt only with matters of contract.  We have made it necessary to apply to the court for a jury, and I really cannot see in principle why there should be a distinction between the Circuit Court and the High Court.  Moreover, I am having appeals from all directions to enable some kind of commercial court to be set up in Dublin, and in my judgment this really is the first step towards that end.  I submit that the Section should be allowed to stand.</P>

      <P>I think <Col N="945" /> there is great danger in that.  First of all it would impose upon the judge the necessity of reading from start to finish these notes.  Supposing an appeal is taken from the Judge's own judgment, human nature being what it is, there is always a temptation to read the evidence in a particular way.  It is irresistible. You would really be making the Judge the arbiter of what is said and not the stenographer.  I think what you really require is to certify that these are the notes taken by the stenographer in a particular case.</P>

Furthermore these notes will be used for the purpose of endeavouring to upset his judgment.  It would be putting the judge in a false position if he were compelled to certify in the way you suggest.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>This Section was referred to by you, Sir, yesterday, as perhaps going a little further than was contemplated.  I have reconsidered the Section, and have had it re-drafted.  I propose to move it in the following form:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 96.&mdash;To delete the Section and insert in lieu thereof the following Section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Age of retirement for existing judges appointed under this Act.&mdash; 96.  Where any person who is at the passing of this Act a judge of the Supreme Court of Judicature in Ireland, a Recorder, County Court Judge, Divisional Justice of the Police District of Dublin Metropolis, or District Justice, is appointed to be a judge or justice under this Act, the age of retirement prescribed by this Act may in his case be extended by the Executive Council, after consultation with the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General, to any age not exceeding the lesser of the two following ages, that is to say, the age of 75 years, or the age of five years beyond the said prescribed age of retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who has been a judge of the Supreme Court of Judicature in Ireland, a Recorder or County Court Judge in Ireland shall not be disqualified from being appointed a judge of the Supreme Court, the <Col N="948" /> High Court or the Circuit Court by reason of his having at the date of such appointment already attained the age prescribed by this Act as the age of retirement of the judges of such Court, and where such person as aforesaid is appointed to be a judge of any of the Courts aforesaid after he has attained the age of retirement aforesaid, the age of retirement shall in his case be deemed to be extended to the maximum age to which it could be extended by the Executive Council under this Section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I make this suggestion in all seriousness? Would it not be far better to say that where any person is appointed to be a judge or a justice that the age of retirement prescribed by this Bill shall be extended for three years?  The way that will work out is this.  In the case of a judge newly appointed he would retire at 72.  In the case of an existing judge kept on he would retire at 75. That is the case of the High Court.  In the case of a Circuit Court any newly-appointed judge would retire at 70. Any existing judge re-appointed would retire at 73.  In the case of a District Court any new appointment would retire at 65, but any re-appointment would have until 68.  In other words, make an automatic addition of three years to the period prescribed in the Bill in the case of men re-appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two cases to be considered.  There is the case of a man who has not attained the full age limit, where the Government might be willing to recommend his appointment for the balance of that period.  Then there is the case of a man where they would like to extend that particular case or the case of a man who has attained the age of 72. It is proposed in that case to give automatic extension.</P>

That would leave the maximum in the High Court at 75, Circuit Court at 73, and a District Court at 68, except in the case of the Dublin Justices, in whose case it would run to 73.</P>

It would take away that invidious position in which you put him, that his case is to be considered when he reaches the age of retirement.  You have done it in all the other cases.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Government make that concession. I really think it simplifies it.  The Seanad understands what is proposed. In the case of all existing judges, including in these words District Justices, Circuit Judges and Judges of the High Court, if in the case of any of these Courts an existing Judge is re-appointed who has reached the age prescribed in the Bill for retirement, he gets an automatic and further term of three years added to his term.  If, however, at the date of his re-appointment he has not reached the prescribed period, he has to go at the prescribed period and he gets another three years automatically added.  That is the proposal, that a new section to this effect be inserted in lieu of the existing section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment which I now propose is as follows: To delete Section 97 and to substitute therefor the following new Section: &ldquo;All Rules of Court made under this Act shall be laid on the Tables of both Houses of the Oireachtas but shall have no force or effect unless within six months from the date of their being so laid they shall <Col N="952" /> have been passed into law by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  I think I may say that this is my last effort to keep the Rule-making provisions of the Bill within the Constitution, and the amendment is one which I hope will meet the views of some Senators who voted against my amendment yesterday and may even capture the support of the Government. The effect of the amendment is this, that it leaves the Rule-making Authority untouched; that is, the Rule-making Authority as provided originally in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Rules are to be made by the Minister for Home Affairs in the manner provided by the Bill, but instead of laying on the Tables of the two Houses and coming into force automatically if not objected to, as they would under Section 97 as it stands, I propose that the Rules of Court shall be enacted as laws by the Oireachtas.  Under that amendment the Government will have obtained all the objects which they desire, and which they told us they desired yesterday.  The Rules of Court will be prepared in the way they are proposed in the Bill.  They will be able to provide by these Rules for the cheap litigation, for arrangements for vacations, and all other matters they have at heart and the only disadvantage to them will be that they will have to put a Bill, scheduling these Rules through the two Houses, and in a matter of such importance as this, I suggest that that is a small thing.  It certainly is a small price to pay for the certainty that these Rules will be within the Constitution and that they will be understood by the Houses, and that the Houses will have an opportunity of understanding them.  We all know what papers laid on the Table of the House means.  Personally, I never physically saw the papers on the Table of the House until yesterday, and I very much doubt whether any member has ever read any of the papers.</P>

      <P>I should like to second the amendment, and in doing so I desire to call the attention of the House to the fact that fresh evidence in this matter has been revealed to-day in certain statements of the Attorney-General which must convince us that this Rule-making power is very closely allied to legislation.  He has told us that when they come to consider these Rules there will then arise a necessity for further legislation.  If they are so intimately bound up as that, I do think that it is very important to this House to have a close and positive scrutiny of the rules.  Further, I think he gave us to understand that some question of the rules of evidence was to be considered under the new Rules.  I am sure the House will realise how important the procedure of evidence is, and how very necessary it is that any change of that kind should be fully reviewed by the sovereign power which is the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Then, there is a small but important matter that came up to-day, as to the method in which these shorthand notes are to be taken, and what happens to these notes after they are made, what happens to the transcript, and so on. These are only a few of many other matters which will concern the Rule-making Authority, and I make the point that it is not sufficient that the House should be satisfied by tabling papers.  They should take definite cognisance of these rules whether in the form of an actual Bill or by Resolution, or by some method to ensure that they receive full and careful scrutiny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried, to the best of my ability, to understand the position in regard to the discussion on the Rule-making Authority, and I should be prepared to support some definite sanction by the Houses of the Oireachtas, and if Senator Brown had brought that in in a form which seemed to me both constitutional and workable, I, for one, would be prepared to support it.  As brought in, in this amendment, I doubt if it is strictly <Col N="954" /> constitutional, and I doubt if it is workable. In the first place, I do not think that one Act can say that another Act must be passed within six months, because it seems to me that once these Rules are brought in as an Act they would then stand as an Act by themselves, and will have to pass under the Constitution subject to such delays and amendments as would take place.  From that point of view I doubt the workability of the statement that they shall have no force or effect unless within six months of being so laid they shall be passed into law.  Passed into law presumably means the introduction of the Rules by someone in the form of an Act and that might mean a delay of nine months.  I doubt, as I have said, six months is possible, or that it would be correct under the Constitution.  Sir John Keane suggested that a simple Resolution might meet the case.  I rather question the statement of Senator Brown, with great respect, that we all know what papers laid on the Table means.  I should like to point out to members of the Seanad that the papers laid on the Table differ according to the Regulations and Acts under which they are laid.  Certain papers are laid for the information of the Seanad, and other papers the Seanad have power to prevent coming into force by Resolution, but all these papers are not only to be laid on the Table, but they are actually quoted in the Orders of the Day which every member receives. Apart from that question, I have not much sympathy with members of the Seanad who feel because they do not read these Papers, and are not interested in them, that therefore they have no powers.  At the same time, I would rather hope, as this matter has been debated so far, and as Senator Brown has said that the main thing he wants is effective control by the Oireachtas, it might be possible to alter the form and substitute a simple Resolution approving without amendment by both Houses.  I have no idea of the view the Government will take in that matter, but if that were done it would be more acceptable than the form proposed by Senator Brown.</P>

      <P>Further, I said at an earlier stage, if in course of preparation of these rules we find, as I believe we will, that there will be substantive laws here and there that require amendment, adaptation or alteration, we will bring in a sort of omnibus Bill, to cover these points.  It appears both Senator Brown and myself have spent some of our midnight oil on this, and I only wish it was the same oil we had spent, because I have here a proposal alternative to Section 97, which is exactly on the lines of Senator Douglas's suggestion, and which, I submit, meets the situation. The desire that was evinced here yesterday was that a responsible Minister should come in and definitely propound the body of rules, and that there should be an opportunity of discussing the body of rules, having them first laid before the House by him, and expounded by him.  In order to give effect to that I propose this alternative to Section 97&mdash;&ldquo;No Rules of Court made under this Act shall come into operation unless and until they have been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and have been approved by a Resolution of each House.&rdquo;  I do not know if Senator Brown will say that that is a workable alternative to his, which I agree with Senator Douglas in thinking is neither constitutional nor workable, and with the leave of the House, and your permission, Sir, I would offer that as a Government amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a small matter which I raised in Committee and the Government said they would look into it.  It deals with certain officials connected with the various Courts who are to carry on their work under the new regime.  The idea is that they should be confirmed in their pensions and emoluments as they would have been if this Bill had not been passed.  The Government agreed to the question of principle some time ago.  When the Bill was first introduced it had a Section which was drawn up to the satisfaction of the persons concerned.  In Committee in the Dáil that Section was amended and certain words were taken out.  The taking out of these words these persons think means their case is not as water-tight as it was before.  I propose therefore to insert the words that were in the Bill when originally introduced, unless the Attorney-General can assure me that the word &ldquo;tenure&rdquo; means that they will get the same treatment and receive the same pensions, etc., as they would if the Bill had not been passed.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Ministry of Finance that their positions are safeguarded by Article 10 of the Treaty and by Article 77, I think it is, of the Constitution.  I do not know that there are any cases which have a right to be considered which are not covered by these two Articles. There was, however, one particular instance, which I think I mentioned here before, that there were certain people employed in the Courts, for a very considerable sum of money, at work which could easily be done for something like half the sum.  In that case there was no position analogous to that of the civil servant.  If there be such a case I would undertake to look into it.  To accept the amendment in this form might prejudice the Chief Justice when he would have to decide whether the terms were analogous to those they had already.  Let us take the instance of the Courts opening at 11 o'clock. Should it be decided that they should open at 10.30 some person employed there might say that it was unreasonable to expect him to attend at 10.30. Only in such a case as that would there be a likelihood, so far as I can learn, of anything in the nature of a dispute. I am informed that the Section, as it stands, safeguards the rights and privileges and pensions, so far as they are consistent with Article 10 of the Treaty and Article 77 of the Constitution. I am advised that it would be scarcely within our power to go outside of those Articles, as they are above the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad requests the Government to adopt measures to improve the transit of live stock and other agricultural produce, and to exercise supervision over the handling of live stock at fairs, markets and railway and steamship yards.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great importance attaches to the subject matter of the resolution, especially when we consider that 75 per cent. of the total wealth of the Free State is derived from agriculture.  If the country is to prosper everything possible should be done to improve the industry. I intend mainly to deal with the transit and handling of live stock.  The live stock trade is by far the biggest side of the agricultural industry, and it is computed that over £1,000,000 is lost annually owing to the bad facilities and the careless and brutal handling of live stock at fairs, markets, railway stations, and steamship yards.  In pre-war days the railway companies ran special trains at something approaching reasonable time, but since the British Government took over the Irish railways and guaranteed the dividends, the railway companies have gone from bad to worse.  I admit that the railway companies in recent years have had a very difficult time, but even now they are making scarcely any effort to get back to normal working conditions.  In pre-war days if cattle trains were unreasonably delayed a complaint was made to the railway company, and they put forward some sort of reasonable excuse.  Now any sort of excuse is good enough when a complaint is made by the cattle trade. I have seen cattle &ldquo;specials&rdquo; shunted into sidings and left lie there for hours <Col N="960" /> in order to allow &ldquo;specials&rdquo; from race meetings to get in at the scheduled time.  I do not object to race &ldquo;specials&rdquo; getting in in scheduled time, as I consider that all trains should be run up to time.  I protest against preferential treatment being given to sports or other forms of enjoyment as against the cattle trade.</P>
    <P>At most of the stations the railway banks are too small, and are badly constructed. In a good many cases the cattle waggons are obsolete and badly ventilated.  There is a shortage of waggons, which is one of the great causes of hardship on and the beating of stock.  The shipping yards also want to be looked after, and improved facilities provided for the feeding of stock.  I would like to say a few words about the Dublin cattle market.  From the point of view of numbers and quality of stock the Dublin market is the finest in the world, but it is a disgrace, I might say to civilisation, the way cattle are treated there.  In the heavy season there are sometimes as many as 8,500 cattle in the market, crowded into a space that cannot accommodate more than 5,000 cattle.  The Government should insist on the Corporation providing sufficient accommodation for the stock shown in the market.  My idea in bringing forward this resolution was to draw public attention to and to see what means could be devised to remedy matters.  I think we might add to the motion a request to the Minister for Agriculture to call a conference of the Cattle Trade Associations, representatives of the railways and steamship companies, as well as members of the Transit Department of the Department of Agriculture to devise means and draw up rules and regulations that should be drastically adhered to.  Unless that is done, it is useless to look forward to any improvement in the deplorable state of affairs that now exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to ask what is the fate of a resolution of such importance as this?  When we make a statement, I should think as regards the Government reaction to it, the only advantage <Col N="961" /> we have is to use the Seanad as a platform.  Resolutions passed in the Seanad, so far as we have had any experience, are really only pious aspirations. The definite resolution to approach the Minister for Agriculture is very necessary, because when we pass a resolution or draw attention to an outcrying scandal, such as exists in connection with the cattle trade, there should be some means whereby we get an acknowledgment that such a resolution reaches the ears of the Government, or that our words come home to roost somewhere.  Otherwise it is like writing letters to the newspapers. There is an aspect of the treatment of cattle that I think is very important. That is the cruelty to the animals. The amount of suffering caused to dumb life in this country is greater than in any part of Europe.  The attitude towards dumb animals is more callous than anywhere else except in some parts of Southern Europe, where they are equally callous to horses.  The statement that £1,000,000 is lost annually to the country by ill-treatment of animals does not cover the entire loss, because Senator Counihan has told me that in some instances a beast may be depreciated to the extent of £5 by bad treatment.  I will try to explain what constitutes bad treatment and what depreciates the worth of the animal. It seems that if an ox is beaten weals arise under the skin, into which the blood flows.  If the animal's life is preserved for a month even then the weals would not be altogether healed. The result is that a butcher on the far side of the Channel knows that if he buys a badly beaten animal he will lose when it is killed about 3d. per pound, which would amount to about £5 per head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means about £5 a head, or it might mean more.  The point is:  Can nothing be done by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to summon people, responsible for the conditions which give rise to this scandalous treatment of brutes?  Senator Counihan has shown that the shortage of cattle trucks and the thrusting of cattle into wagons which cannot contain them contribute to this cruelty. Then again the shipping facilities are <Col N="962" /> very poor.  Getting animals on board and taking them off the ship involves a great deal of hammering and belting, and helps towards injuring them.  Then, again, the method of dishorning cattle involves a great deal of cruelty.  I need not go on from dealing with cruelty to live stock to the methods of plucking geese.  All our references to such scandals seem to end in the ventilation of them.  I just wish to point out first that some arrangement should be made by which our resolutions should go before the Departments to which they are addressed. Secondly, we might draw the attention of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to this important matter.  I think the country can draw its own conclusions regarding the monetary loss sustained by these acts of cruelty.</P>

      <NameTxt>The EARL of KERRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the motion, and especially the point of view emphasised by Senator Gogarty that much of the cruelty which is involved is due to insufficient accommodation.  Senators are aware that a good deal has been written about this matter on the other side of the Channel lately.  I was asked by a friend last week whether something could not be done on this side.  I do not know to what extent the sufferings which animals undergo on board ship would form a subject within the scope of the Government of this country.  I suppose it is a matter whether the shipping is Irish or British owned.  I understand that most of it is British.  Anyhow, there would be room for improvement on this side also.  The cruelties to which Senator Gogarty has referred consist largely of driving the animals on board, as well as the insufficent accommodation for them on the ship.  I suppose there are Inspectors on this side, as there are Inspectors on the other side, and both Governments ought to co-operate through their officials with a view to largely remedying, if not obviating altogether, these conditions.</P>

      <P>I have practical experience of the conditions that prevail in fairs and markets and I am satisfied that Senator Counihan has established a good case.  I hope, however, when considering this matter that the docility of the average bullock will be taken into account and whether the hardship inflicted is not to some extent necessary.  In fairs there is a rush of dealers to get the cattle to the terminal points with the least possible delay.  20 or 30 beasts are hurriedly driven to the nearest railway station. They are closed up together and one bullock may be of a peculiar temperament, and may attempt to escape.  I suggest that the three or four-year-old bullock is not an animal to which you would say, &ldquo;Come, my dear, kiss me.&rdquo;  Instead of that he makes a rush for you and I say that it is asking too much from a human being to stop the use of his stick.  I hope that in investigating the matter my countrymen will not be maligned for having in self-defence hit a simple bullock.  I do not think that my countrymen are as cruel as it has been the fashion of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to suggest.  I hope when the grievances are being ventilated the whole aspect of the question will be considered and that it will be acknowledged that a certain amount of coercion is necessary for certain animals.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that in this discussion we have perhaps wandered a little away from the excellent resolution which Senator Counihan put before us.  We have wandered into a question of cruelty to animals which is of course involved in this question. What we really seem to want is to try and devolve some system by which our cattle trade may be regulated.  At the present time it is not regulated at all and every man works on his own <Col N="964" /> system.  Every man drives his own bullock with the largest stick he can find.  If there were some branch of the Department of Agriculture definitely responsible for all matters connected with the transport of animals it might be well.  I do not think that there is any proper system of inspection at ports.  Seeing how very great our cattle trade is it is not asking our Government too much because the expense incurred would be repaid in the immense saving there would be in preventing the deterioration which occurs in the transport of animals.  If a proper system of inspection were rigidly carried out an immense amount of that deterioration could be avoided and the country would benefit to that extent.  I agree with what Senator Gogarty said.  I do not know what happens when resolutions such as this are passed.  I do not know what power we have beyond expressing our pious opinions.  The opinions of many of those here are worth considering, and I hope that the matter will be brought to the notice of the Government.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement with the resolution put forward by Senator Counihan, and particularly with the views expressed by Captain Greer.  It seems to me rather strange, however, that there is such a tenderness with respect to cattle on the part of the members of the Seanad generally.  Why should it be expressed for cattle over and above any other class of animal?&mdash; for, to my mind, the same cruelty is practised on other classes of animals and nothing is said about it at all.  Go to an ordinary race-course and you see a jockey mounted on a horse, with spurs, with steel spikes half an inch long, to goad the animal, and a heavy whip to lash him along.  That does not seem to strike people at all.  In the country districts an innocent deer is brought in a cart, and hounds which are kept from food and made hungry are let loose after the deer.  When they want to train hounds a lame deer is brought out, and if they have not a lame one they tie up one of its legs in order to blood the hound.  Take the case of fox-hunting.  The fox is hunted into a net, pulled out and thrown alive to a pack of hounds.  Is there no cruelty <Col N="965" /> in that?  It is sport.  If an unfortunate working man works a horse with a sore on its back or breast he is prosecuted. It seems to me we should look on those matters in a much more logical manner.  The real thing that matters, to my mind, is that the trade of the country is affected by the cruelty with which cattle are transported and handled in bringing them to the other side of the channel.  I have no doubt a considerable loss is entailed, and that the bruises and injuries sustained in transporting the cattle from the Dublin market and others will go on as long as the trade goes on.  I would suggest to Senator Counihan that the proper method to adopt to wipe out that loss is to encourage the members of his own trade to take over and put into working order the dead meat factory at Drogheda.  By developing the dead meat industry he will wipe out whatever loss is incurred in this way, and which in general is inevitable, to my mind.  I would like that it should be made an offence to abuse any animal, whether it is done for sport or necessity.</P>
