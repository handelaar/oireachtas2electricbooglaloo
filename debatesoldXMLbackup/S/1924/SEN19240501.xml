      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before a discussion takes place on this Bill, I suggest that the Minister in charge should make a statement explaining its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill are of two main types.  First, there is an all-round cut of one shilling in the old age pension.  There is also provision for a revision of the scale of means.  At present a person may have private means and an old age pension, totalling in all £1 per week.  It is proposed that in future the pension and private means shall not exceed 16s. a week.  This Bill is being brought in out of necessity.  Senators are pretty well aware of the financial situation of this country.  They are aware that even with a very much higher rate of taxation here than exists in Great Britain, there is a deficit.  It seems to us that no good can be done for the country if we try to wipe out our deficit by means of increased taxation.  It would be comparatively easy, I should say, for some time ahead at any rate, to collect the taxation that might be necessary to meet our ordinary expenditure, including debt charges.  But we know that the country is already handicapped very seriously by the heavy burden of taxation, and to increase it would tend to strangle industry and handicap enterprise, and finally to impoverish the country.  We feel that our line of policy must be to endeavour to make our Budget balance by reducing expenditure and not to be content merely with balancing our Budget on our present scale of taxation, but if possible, to reduce the present burden which, as I have said, is already very considerably higher than it is in the neighbouring countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have undertaken during the course of the past year several substantial economies.  We have carried out several measures which give substantial economies.  For instance, in <Col N="4" /> the case of national teachers, whose salaries have risen very considerably since the beginning of the European War, we effected a cut of 10 per cent. In the case of the D.M.P. and Civic Guard we effected a cut which amounted to one-seventh of the salary, a good deal more than 10 per cent.  We felt that it was necessary also that a cut should take place in old age pensions. At present this is a very heavy charge on the State.  As a matter of fact, we are paying now, with half the Irish revenue for 1920-21, three-fourths of the total charge of old age pensions for all Ireland in 1920-21.  We have only about half of the all-Ireland revenue to do that with.  In Scotland in 1920-21 the old age pension charge amounted to 2 per cent. of the revenue. In Ireland in 1920-21 it amounted to 9.1 per cent. of the revenue, and in the Free State at the present time, it amounts to 13.2 per cent. of the total revenue.  We could not undertake any policy of economy and say that no attention should be paid to this particular charge.  We are most anxious not to inflict hardship on these poor people, but we have to bear in mind that the cost of living was higher when the old age pension was fixed at its present scale, than it is at the present moment.  It rose in the intervening period to a point a great deal higher than it was when the pension was fixed at 10s.  A reduction of the pension to 9s. now would not leave the pensioner any worse off from the point of view of actual value or of actual purchasing power than he was when the 10s. rate was fixed.  It would leave the pensioner a good deal better off than he was during the years 1920-21.  So that, from the point of view of actual value, we are not leaving the position of the pensioner harder than it was during those years I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I think people will also understand that, in view of the very great financial difficulty that this country is in, we can hardly afford to pay more in actual value to the pensioners at present than was paid to them, say, in 1920, or than was paid pre-war, because the value of 9s. now will be as great as the value of 5s. pre-war.  We are simply keeping them in or about the same position. <Col N="5" /> from the point of view of the value of the pension.  If we do that, it is all that we really can do in the present circumstances. We who propose this would be desirous that the value of the stipend of the pensioner should be increased, but we find that that cannot be done, and we propose simply to make an adjustment that will not result in actual loss to the pensioners.  In the case of those who have private means, we feel that there is not so much hardship in the provisions for the revision of the means scale.  It is not necessary, I think, to go into the details of the provisions of the Bill.  If events had been different in this country during the past couple of years, such a measure as this would not have been necessary.</P>
    <P>We have had a certain burden of debt piled up against us, and not only that, but great damage done to every industry and business in the country by the upset of these years.  We cannot simply ignore that.  We must try to carry on our business in such a way as to make the handicap as light as possible.  It would be easy for us, perhaps, to say that we were not going to try to meet our recurrent and normal expenditure out of revenue.  A policy of that sort would very soon hit the old age pensioner and every other class in the country a great deal harder than economy will.  If we pursued a policy of borrowing to meet requirements, the value of money would go down rapidly, and 10s. would not be anything like the value of 9s.  Even the £ might soon find itself of less value than 9s., if we did not pursue a sound policy of economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.W. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no quarrel with the necessity to reduce the old age pension for the purpose of balancing our Budget, but in the present Bill there are one or two sections that seem to me to be rather harsh.  I allude to Section 5 (2)&mdash;</P>
      <P>(ii)  the yearly value of so much of the capital value of the said property as exceeds the sum of twentyfive pounds shall be taken to be one-tenth part of the capital value thereof.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>What I mean is the cut seems to me to act rather unfairly.  When the time comes I will possibly move that the one-tenth be made less.  These are the only things that appeal to me as rather harsh.  I would like if some of the anomalies in the existing Bill had been repealed. I know that through administrative action large numbers of people have been excluded possibly who are most deserving of the pension.  I think it is a pity that some arrangement could not be made to meet the case of persons who never have had the pension, or who are never likely to get pensions&mdash;old people whose ages could not be found and whose names through one cause or another are not on the registers.  I know many cases where such people have not got pensions.  I regret that some section was not inserted to meet such cases.  Otherwise I think the necessity for the reduction exists.  I think the arguments for the reduction from 10s. to 9s. weekly perfectly sound.  I think if such a reduction was not made and if our finances were let get into a state of confusion the 10s. would possibly not be worth what the 9s. would be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLYSAGHT</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to vote against this Bill, and I would like to give the reason for doing so on such an important matter.  The arrangement dealing with assignment is a very good one, but nevertheless I feel that I must vote against the Second Reading.  The question of economy is a bee in my bonnet, and Senators will remember that I made unavailing efforts previously to effect some economies.  I quite agree that these economies are necessary, but I think the axe is not being used as ruthlessly as it should to justify an attack on the poorer section of the community. At the outside, these people have 16s. weekly, and some of them have nothing at all.  To take 1s. from them represents 10 per cent. of their means, and means depriving them of the necessaries of life.  If you reduce, let us say, a salary of £360 a year by 10 per cent. you are only making the <Col N="7" /> holders give up luxuries and, perhaps, making them use a tram instead of a taxi.  Since I was here last I believe that Dublin has gone in for taxies!  In the case of old age pensioners the cut means giving up something that is absolutely necessary.  The Minister for Finance states that 13.1 per cent. of the revenue is represented by these pensions. I believe the reason the percentage is 13.1 is that the wrong people have pensions.  I do not want to stir up muddy water, and it is exceedingly muddy water, this question of old age pensions in the country.  The people know the unsatisfactory way in which the pensions were given.  It is really a legacy of the old <i>regime</i>, and I do not want to rake it up.  What I do say is, if the ineligible pensioners were eliminated it would be much more satisfactory than to deprive the poorer section of the community of one-tenth of their income, and it would save much more than £300,000.  If I saw an indication that the axe was going to be used impartially, and that ineligible persons were going to be deprived of the pension, instead of depriving the deserving ones of 1s. a week, then I should vote for the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Following what Senator MacLysaght has said, I think it is an open secret that there are vast numbers of pensioners throughout the country who are not really entitled to it.  There are men who were owners of farms, that they made over to their sons, and who remain in the house, in receipt of pensions.  Their wives may be also getting pensions.  These people are to all intents and purposes in the same position as they always were. They have far more means than the minimum set out in the Schedule of the Bill.  I am quite sure that what Senator MacLysaght has said is absolutely true, that if power was taken to revise these pensions a far greater saving would be effected than by depriving old people, who really deserve it, of 1s. a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a case which occurred a short time ago within my own experience. A woman met me on the road and said that it was very hard lines that she was not in receipt of <Col N="8" /> a pension.  She said that she believed that she was the right age, but there was no record of it.  I said, &ldquo;How are you entitled to a pension; have you not got a farm?&rdquo;  As a matter of fact, she was driving three very good milch cows along the road.  She said, &ldquo;My husband has a pension, and I do not see why I should not have one also.&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;How are you entitled to it?  Your means are greater than the minimum in the Act.&rdquo;  She stated that everyone else had a pension and she did not see why she should not have one as well. I know that these cases exist to a large extent, and I should not be surprised if on investigation it was found that the bulk of old age pensioners was composed of people of that class. I hope that the provision of Section 4 will either be extended or used to enable this sort of pension to be reviewed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister when explaining this Bill informed us that there would be an all-round cut of 1s. a week in the old age pension, and that further than that there would be a revision in the scale of means of persons eligible to get the pension, and a revision of the amount in proportion to the amount they received. It is intended not only to take 1s. a week off the old age pensioners, but there is a further cut to take place, so that people who have been a little bit thrifty and who have endeavoured to provide for their old age are to be penalised, and the amount of the income they receive is to be considerably reduced under this Bill.  I asked the Minister to explain the Bill, but he did not tell us what the amount of saving would be.  I was anxious to hear the figures as to the amount of saving which would be effected by a reduction of 1s., and by the reduction on the amount of income which they would be entitled to have to enable them to receive the pension. He bases his whole case for the Bill on the fact that we must have economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of this Bill we propose to have economy at the expense of the poorer section of the community, the section that can offer the least resistance&mdash;the poor tenement <Col N="9" /> slum dwellers who have nothing but 10s. a week to keep body and soul together, and who, because of their pride, will not go to the union and be branded as paupers.  These people are endeavouring to eke out an existence in miserable slums in Ireland and by their refusal to go to the union are saving the ratepayers a considerable amount of money, because if they went to the unions they would cost the ratepayers considerably more than the miserable 10s. which they get to enable them to keep body and soul together.  The Minister, when introducing this Bill in the Dáil, said that some people were inclined to think that because of the success of the Loan there is less need for economy than previously.  He said that there is no less need&mdash;in fact, we still have to borrow, and if we are to carry out the promise of economy given when the last loan was issued, we would still have to economise.  Are we to understand from that that the Minister got his loan on the promise of economy such as this?  I say, &ldquo;If this is the price we are to pay for the loan of money, for God's sake give it back.&rdquo;  Is this the price we have to pay for wealthy people subscribing to the loan?  Are we going to reduce the aged poor to such a state, when.  God knows, they are in a bad enough position already.</P>
    <P>The Minister, while making the 1s. cut all round, proposes to reduce the amount of income a person should have to entitle him to receive the old age pension.  That means that people who have been thrifty and who have endeavoured to provide for the rainy day, are to be penalised.  In most of the Trade Unions in this country men from boyhood and women from girlhood, have subscribed to the different Trade Unions, to many of which are attached benevolent funds.  They subscribed from the time they were 18 or 20 up to the period at which they are past their labour.  They subscribed in many cases for over 50 years to the benevolent funds, and they are entitled to a small superannuation allowance from the respective Trade Unions.  The Minister, under the Bill, proposes to penalise these people because they endeavoured <Col N="10" /> to do something which every right thinking man and woman would endeavour to do.  These people will have their pensions docked so much in consequence of their being thrifty.  If the Trade Unions who pay superannuation allowances to their old members have any sense, they will take the benefit to themselves and not allow the State to have it.  I think that is likely to take place.  It is unfair that old men and women who have been thrifty should be penalised in this fashion.  The Minister told us also that the old age pensioners will be as well off now with the proposed cut as they were in pre-war days.  Would the Minister tell us that they will be as well off as when the Old Age Pension Bill was first introduced?</P>
    <P>What is the difference between the cost of living when the Old Age Pension Bill was first introduced and the cost at present?  If he makes a calculation he will find that they will not be as well off by the reduction of 1s. as they are now.  I must oppose this Bill, because I think we are starting economy at the wrong end.  We see across the water that not alone are they not going to make a cut in the old age pensions, but responsible statesmen have promised to wipe out this question of means altogether.  They have in contemplation a reduction of the age limit. I think some old age pensioners in this country will begin to wonder whether this glorious prospect that was held out to them a few years ago when we got the management of our own affairs, is such a glorious one.  The Minister does not tell us that there is any intention to have a revision in the pension in a few years time, and so far as I can gather, this is only to be the first cut. He does not hold out any hope that if things improve there will be a little increase given.  I do not intend to say anything more on the Bill at this stage, as in Committee we will have a further opportunity of discussing it.  I oppose it, and will vote against the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. GOGARTY Dr. GOGARTY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be forgotten how this old age pension arose. To listen to the statements here one might think that there was a general refusal for anyone to enter the seventies, until that extraordinarily generous <Col N="11" /> democrat, Mr. Lloyd George, made a gesture, at the nation's expense, first of 5s. and later of 10s.  That was one of the most unwelcome heritages we had to accept when the Free State was being formed.</P>
      <P>While I listened to those who objected to the old age pensions and who objected to the cut, I noticed that it was not so much against the cut as against the fact that there was no machinery to discriminate between those who were deserving of the pension and those who were not.  I have seen people who were middle-aged drawing the old age pension, because they thought it had become the fashion. When we remember the country is greatly handicapped and has to pay over a million a year for the vote-catching device of an English politician, I do not think it is incumbent on us to raise a cry against the very worthy attempt of the Treasury to make us live within our income.  One would think there was nobody prepared to live in the country if he could not get a pension at 70 years of age, and that the civic pride of which Senator Farren spoke as existing in the slums, is absent from the rest of the country.  Nevertheless, it does not prevent people accepting the dole with alacrity.  It is not so much the Bill he criticises as the discrimination of those entitled to the pension, or the suggested machinery to prevent people divesting themselves of their goods in favour of their sons in order to enjoy this alien imposition imposed on our State.  I am in support of any attempt at retrenchment, and I shall support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I consider that the most unscrupulous cutting down of expenditure should be made in this country, and if that had been done I would find no fault with this Bill, but on the other hand, I see extravagances <Col N="12" /> and expenditure of money that should never have been expended, and all sorts of extravagances that ought to have been put down.  It is those extravagances in the Army and other places that have produced the necessity for the Budget or the Estimates that have now come before us, and which showed the necessity in this country of cutting down expenses.  If the Ministry had begun at the top of the tree, for instance, with the Governor-General and the expenses concerning his establishment, and all the other expenditure, and gone down through the list of expenses which are quite beyond the power of this country to pay, I would have nothing to say against this Bill.  I feel that the present Minister for Finance is doing his best to make some cuts, but I think he began at the wrong end.  He began with the poorest instead of the richest and that is the reason why I oppose this Bill.  We see in the Budget all sorts of things which are going to hit the people.  Jam, which is most used by the poor people, is taxed.  Everything is against the poor instead of the rich.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FORAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say something on the point raised by Senator Gogarty, who describes the old age pension as an alien imposition.  I would like to say that if the aliens had imposed more legislation of this kind on the country I would regret their leaving it, and how any Senator can get up in this assembly and actually disagree with the pensioning of the aged poor in this or in any other country, I cannot understand.  When he gets up and makes a statement of that kind, I fear it would be too much to allow it go unchallenged.  I think that in every democratic State in the world the tendency is to introduce legislation of this kind.  It may be that in this country the administration of it is somewhat loose, and that we may be able to do something to tighten up the administration, because nobody would approve of middle-aged people drawing pensions. These are the people we are to deal with instead of coming in and attacking unfortunate people who have to try and exist on a pension of 10s. a week. We are told that the rate must be cut down to that of the pre-war period.  No <Col N="13" /> Senator in this House, or no fair-minded pensioner or fair-minded individual, agrees that a pension of 5s. a week is adequate for any person who has spent a decent life and gets into the seventies after having rendered valuable service to the State.  I do not think it was that much-talked of politician who introduced that Act at all.  I think it was Asquith, and not Lloyd George.  On our side we disagree with the amount of pension, but approve of the tightening up of the administration.</P>

      <P>I do not suppose there is a member of the Seanad who would not vote gladly against the Bill if they thought they could do so fairly and honestly.  The Bill is naturally an unwelcome one.  Most of us who have given support to the Government would feel that we would like to dissociate ourselves from a measure of this kind. I have given it great thought, and decided I will not vote against the Bill, not because I do not think the whole of it is desirable, but because I think we must all share to a large extent the responsibility.  The Bill divides itself into three parts, one of which I am totally opposed to, one of which I reluctantly agree to, and one of which I favour.  The latter provides for the general tightening up of the machinery in which, I think, we must give every possible assistance to the Government. I doubt very much the wisdom of the provision by which thrift is penalised. Unless the Minister puts before us figures which will show that this is a vital part of the Bill, I will vote against it in Committee, because I think, particularly in Ireland, it is a mistake to have it thought or felt that those who are at the age of 70 should be unduly penalised because of their savings.  In a sense, that applies to another provision of the Bill, but to alter it would be unwise.  The other provision is a provision which reduces the 10s. a week to 9s. in accordance with the cost of living. That I reluctantly would agree with under present circumstances, though I do not like it.</P>

      <P>I would like to call attention to one matter in particular in this Bill.  Presumably it is the intention of the Bill to put all old age <Col N="14" /> pensioners pretty well on the same footing.  We find in the schedule that the first application of the reduction to 9s. would be to people whose means do not exceed £18 5s. a year.  Now, that £18 5s. a year would be 1s. a day, and that provision would mean that a person having 7s. a week would get 9s. pension.  Now, anybody who has experience of old age pensions administration would know that the vast majority of people at present in receipt of old age pensions are not drawing 7s. a week from their own resources.  My experience is that most of those people have nothing at all. But they have a son or daughter who are in indigent or poor circumstances, but who yet can give them a corner at the fireside and a bed to the aged father and mother.  That particular class of accommodation would be worth perhaps 2s. a week.  Most of the pensioners have that.  Others have 2s. or 3s. a week in addition to that from a former employer who is charitably disposed.  Well, here you find a schedule with 7s. a week or 1s. a day.  There is a big disparity between the old age pensioner who has 7s. a week and gets a further 9s. a week pension and the vast majority of the people to whom I refer.  These are people who have nothing at all, but who are entirely dependent on the 9s.  I do not think that anybody could say that 9s. a week would provide barely an existence for a person at the present prices.  But when you come to a minimum&mdash;no matter how low you place the standard&mdash;then every penny cut off that standard means a lowering of it.  That would be getting on towards the actual hunger point. I do not think any Teachta or Senator would like to see a person in circumstances like that.  I only refer to it to ask the Minister to reconsider this point.  I cannot give him approximately what the change would mean, or what it would amount to.  Take, for instance, a person who would be in receipt of £7 16s. a year.  That would be 3s. a week.  My suggestion would be to give him 10s. a week. Now, that person would have 13s. a week between the two.  That would still leave a great disparity between that person and the next person who <Col N="15" /> would receive 16s.  I do not know what the change would mean in the way of money to the Treasury, but, certainly, the intention of the Bill is to put all old age pensioners as nearly as possible on a similar footing.  At the present moment there is too much of a gap between the man I indicate and the one who gets 16s. a week.</P>

      <P>I believe that there are many people who find themselves in the position that I find myself in&mdash;that is, being drawn into consultation without having the information needed for coming to a just and right opinion.  An inquiry was begun by the Government last November, and the facts given by the Government in April do not add a single item to what we were told in November.  We do not know how many figures like 80 per cent. are given.  They convey nothing.  We do not know what is the proportion of the various classes, how many are fraudulent and how many are honest people, and unless some figures of some kind are given it is very difficult to make up one's mind.  It would, I think, be a relief to some of us if we could feel that in a year's time there would be some further examination of the whole question.  Then we might know what were the facts, how far the city districts differed from the rural districts, where aid was most needed, and how, without lessening economy, we could give the best aid to the poor.  If we had some promise of that it would be a relief to some of us.  I do not know whether the Minister would be inclined to consider that view, but it would, I am sure, be a relief to many of us.</P>

      <P>I intend, sir, to vote for this Bill, particularly on the score of economy.  There was one remark made by the Minister for Finance, Mr. Blythe, which I could not follow, when he said that 5s. some few years ago would be worth 9s. now.  That would lead one into a vista of statistics and calculations which is quite beyond my brain even to think about.  Now, there was another remark made by Senator Colonel Moore.  He asked why do you <Col N="16" /> not begin at the top.  He said why not begin at the salary of the Governor-General, which is, I believe, £10,000 a year.  Why not begin here with ourselves?  We get paid for coming here and we get free passes.  I would ask the Labour Members now would they consider this proposition &mdash;if they would like to return 10 per cent. of their salary to the Government or perhaps a little more, and pay a part of their free passes.  I think that would make a difference, and it would, at all events, be some help to meet our obligations and would be well received, I am sure, by our Finance Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Sir HUTCHESON POE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to one matter which has been lost sight of by other speakers. It is very material.  When the Old Age Pensions Act was introduced some years ago, the idea was to save a certain percentage&mdash;what the percentage was I do not know&mdash;of people who in those days were obliged to go into the workhouses, from doing so.  It was never intended that the Act should be a step towards the evasion&mdash;because that is what it meant&mdash;of family obligations. In those days there were certain people&mdash;I am speaking in reference to the agricultural community particularly&mdash;who were not in a position to support the aged members of their families, and the old people, in the absence of any help, were obliged to go into the workhouse, a stigma which we all know they were very much averse to.  Unfortunately when the Old Age Pensions Act came into operation, many agricultural families took advantage of it to try to evade their responsibilities towards the aged members of their families, and instead of supporting them as they had done, they tried to get in the thin end of the wedge, and they got the pension.  The Minister has referred to the great laxity in the administration of the Act, and grave abuses arising from it.  I gather from the reports of the proceedings in the Dáil that the Minister intends not to be too strict as to exactly who shall benefit by this Bill, but he will be very strict in the case of people who are not entitled to any benefit, getting any benefit from it.  I am quite in agreement <Col N="17" /> with Senator Mrs. Stopford Green's suggestion, and I believe we would all welcome a revision of the scheme after a short period.  The Minister tells us he has no intention of interfering further with old age pensions, and I think we can accept that assurance.  I am quite sure that is the intention, and that that intention will be adhered to.  Later on, when we come to discuss the details of the Bill, if the Minister can see his way to make any little concessions, I am sure he will do so.  I hope the Seanad will not think of rejecting the motion for the Second Reading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke in the first instance, I omitted to say that the saving to the Exchequer by means of the Bill if it passes in its present form, will amount in the first full year to £400,000, and that amount will ultimately rise to £500,000, or a little over it, per annum.  While I would be very glad if we could revise this Bill, and if necessary reverse the process of it, I do not think there would be any possibility of being able to do that within a year, or even two or three years.  Some little time must elapse before our finances would be in such a position as to enable us to do that.  While undoubtedly a considerable number of people in the past received the pension though they were not entitled to it, the number is not nearly so large as is commonly believed. You usually find there is more <Col N="18" /> talk about the one person who is receiving a pension without being entitled to it than there is about the thousand persons who get the pension and are justly entitled to it.  Everything possible has been done, since the change of Government, to review questionable cases with a view to taking the pension from people not entitled to it.  I do not think the number is really very great.  It certainly would not give us any considerable fraction of half a million a year. When people talk about economies the thing to remember is that we want economies running into some millions, and certain picturesque cuts which we could make and which might save perhaps £50,000, are not any solution of the difficulty.  I would like also to deny entirely the charges of gross extravagance made against the Government. I do say that while we were not able to concentrate on the question of economising during the time when the safety and the life of the State were in danger, we have not indulged in any orgy of expenditure. If Senators will remember how the Army was created, how it was flung together and sent out to fight almost in the process of being created, they will understand that there was of necessity some laxity and some losses, but I do not think there is any other State where an Army was so created in which there has been less or as little cause for complaint.</P>

      <P>I move the following motion&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Eireann recommend the Executive Council to ratify in respect of Saorstát Eireann the Convention concerning &ldquo;The Rights of Association and Combination of Agricultural Workers&rdquo; and &ldquo;Workmen's Compensation in Agriculture&rdquo; adopted by the Labour Conference at Geneva on the 12th <Col N="20" /> November, 1921, the terms of which are set out in the schedules hereto.</P>
    <P>There is no need to go into detail on this matter.  The Treaty of Versailles set up a Labour Organisation of the nations of the world for the purpose of regulating, as far as possible, the labour conditions in the various countries.  Representatives of all these countries meet and consider certain aspects of questions dealing with industrial matters.  When the Convention decides a question, it has to be referred back to the respective nations, who are part and parcel of the League of Nations for the purpose of confirming the decision arrived at.  In this particular case, the decision deals with the rights of agricultural workers to association and combination, and it proposes that all such workers should have rights, same as they have already got in this country. It makes no material change here, because we have already got the conditions sought, in this country, but it is essential that we should ratify the findings of the Convention.  The idea underlying the Labour Organisation attached to the League of Nations is to level up, as it were, the industrial conditions in countries that are not well organised.  As a matter of fact, it will help the countries that are not well organised and in which something approaching humane conditions govern the employment of the workers.  It will serve to lift up those countries where there has not been very much progress regarding factory legislation. As I have said, we have in this country the right of association for agricultural workers, but it is essential that we, as a self-governing State, represented in the League of Nations, should ratify on behalf of this State the findings of the Labour Convention.</P>

It does not introduce anything new into our administration, but sanction is simply required from the nations which constitute the League of Nations.</P>

      <P>May I ask if Senator Farren is strictly accurate in saying that this motion makes no change in the conditions in this country? It does seem to me that it proposes a change.  He is quite right in saying that agricultural labourers have the right to combination in this country. But, under Article 1, if this country ever found it desirable to introduce legislation to control that right, they are prevented doing so, because it says that for ten years no change can be made.  You would have to give notice before any change could be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know a little more about this recommendation before I vote for it.  It proposes to deal with those engaged in agriculture, and to place them in the same position as industrial workers as regards association and rights of combination, and also in respect of compensation for injury from accidents in the course of their work.  At the present time there is a very great inequality as between the agricultural and the industrial worker, inasmuch as the agricultural worker is called upon to provide his proportion of a vote of £200,000 a year to supply unemployment pay to the industrial worker.  He has to do <Col N="22" /> that, although he has no right whatever to share in that grant.  It appears to me very strange that those who represented the Irish Free State at this Conference overlooked the fact that there was this inequality.  I can only account for that by the fact that there was no representative of those engaged in agriculture in attendance at that Conference.  It appears to me that this Convention is the only outcome of our membership of the League of Nations&mdash; a membership which is costing us £9,100 a year.  This Convention, which proposes to give us what we have already, is a very bad result for the expenditure of £9,000 a year.  I think the sooner we take into consideration the question of ceasing membership of this League the better for the taxpayers of this country.</P>

      <P>I think the last Senator's speech hardly brings us any further towards the point on which we are going to vote.  It seems to me that Senator Farren put the case quite clearly when he pointed out that there was going to be no alteration in this country by voting for this motion here to-day.  I think really and truly the Labour section have been very wise, indeed, in trying to force up labour conditions in other countries, because one of the worst difficulties that we are up against in this country is that every one of us has to compete in business against the products of countries who work upon sweated labour of every description, and who have no liability for accidents.  We have arranged here fair conditions of livelihood.  The employers have reasonable liability to the worker for accidents.  That is fair, but it puts up the cost to us, and it is quite right that labour should do what it can to secure that the same conditions shall be established in other countries.  Then very probably we will not have things dumped here as the products of sweated labour.  So far as I can see, this is a resolution we should vote for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Jameson made the point he has made. This Convention represents international co-operation between employers and employed, and I think there is no doubt whatever that co-operation of <Col N="23" /> that kind is going to make possible the general raising of the standard of living without unduly penalising those who may be a little less advanced than others.  Personally, I think there is little doubt that whether we were members of the League or not it would be desirable that we should take part in the International Labour Conference.  I think I am correct in saying that the United States of America, by special arrangement, sent representatives or delegates to take part in the Conference, although they are not members of the League.  It would be extremely foolish if we were to refuse to ratify this Convention because it was not fully up to the standard we have reached when we know it is a very considerable advance on conditions in many other countries of Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EXTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the remarks I was about to make have been covered by Senator Jameson.  It happens that in respect of labour legislation we would count as an advanced country.  Being an advanced country, we would be bound to be at a slight disadvantage as compared with other countries, where the workers are in a much worse condition than in this country.  There is, naturally, competition amongst the various countries, and in that competition the country which gives good conditions to its workers has to meet the competition either by reducing the condition of its workers or alternatively, other countries which are backward, and where the workers are not well treated, must be brought up to the level of the good countries.  This does not propose any change in legislation in Ireland, because we count amongst the more enlightened countries.  The effect of this International Labour Bureau resolution is to bring the weight of public opinion to bear upon those countries in which the conditions of workers are not so good as in Ireland. The effect is that we recommend other countries really to do what we have already done here.  In that you may say we are putting ourselves at the service of the ideal, and incidentally we are endeavouring to <Col N="24" /> improve our own position by removing unfair competition and unfair conditions.  That really is the purport of this Convention.  There is no change whatever proposed in the legislation of this country.  We are only saying that as we have been very virtuous so far we recommend people who have not been so virtuous to do as we have done.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not dealt with my point.  I will call attention again to Article 7, which says: &ldquo;A member which has ratified this Convention may denounce it after the expiration of ten years from the date on which the Convention first came into force, by an act communicated to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations for registration. Such denunciation shall not take effect until one year after the date on which it is registered with the Secretariat.&rdquo; Now, it does seem to me that this alters the position of affairs here.  I may say I am quite in favour of the passing of the Resolution, and quite realise what Senator Jameson has said.  But I am very doubtful as to the desirability of tying ourselves down for ten years without any possibility of meeting whatever set of circumstances may arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not seem to me to be a quite accurate description.  If the Senator will look at Article 8 he will see that provision is made for a meeting at least once in every ten years.  &ldquo;The governing body of the International Labour Office shall present ... a report on the working of this Convention and shall consider the desirability of placing on the Agenda of the Conference the question of its revision or modification.&rdquo; That is to say, it is incumbent on them to do that at least once in every ten years, so that, I think, would afford a remedy for the evil which the Senator suggests.</P>

Article 7 <Col N="25" /> deals with an individual member, and he can only denounce&mdash;that is the peculiar expression they use&mdash;it once in ten years, but the governing body are compelled at least once in every ten years to consider the question of the revision or modification.

      <P>This is, I think, the first International Convention, and if there were to be no limit of ten years, or some other period, the value of the Convention would be almost nil.  We would be keeping it, without any guarantee that in three months' time other nations, who had signed, might not break it.  The only change, as far as I can see, is that we are agreeing that we will keep our present standard for ten years.  There is nothing to prevent us improving on it, if we think it convenient. Surely that is a thing which, in the interests of the general improvement of the countries of Europe, we are prepared to do.  Ten years in the life of a nation is a very short period, and this is very little to ask.</P>

      <P>I think a great deal of the discussion is beside the point, and more or less futile.  The majority of Senators who have spoken seem to think that this confers a right on agricultural workers, not otherwise enjoyed by them.  I would like to point out that it can at some future time deprive them of the rights of association. I would also like to point out that Article 9 of our Constitution secures the right of any agricultural worker to join any association which he thinks fit for his own protection. Senator Linehan referred to the agricultural workers sharing in a grant of £200,000.  There has been no such grant voted towards the relief of unemployment in which the agricultural worker shares.</P>

      <P>There seems to be a misunderstanding about this matter.  As a matter of fact, this decision of the League of Nations Labour Conference was arrived at in 1921, before the Free State was established.  For the purpose of putting the matter in order, the decisions arrived at by that Conference, which was composed of representatives of employers and labour in all the countries who are members of the League, have to be ratified by the nations represented. So that we are only approving of decisions arrived at by the Conference. It does not affect us in the slightest iota, because everything in this Convention is already in force in this country and guaranteed by the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad request the Government to expedite the hearing of claims for compensation in the case of persons who have suffered losses prior to the 11th July, 1921.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a subject which I have touched upon before, and which affects many people in the country districts. Everybody is aware, I think, that post-Truce claims in Dublin have been met to a certain extent.  We who suffered losses in the country certainly do not grumble at that, but I know of cases in which decrees were given a year ago where no compensation has yet been paid.  Figures have been given in the Dáil by the Minister for Finance, showing that claims to a large amount have been paid.  I think I am right in saying that Dublin was included in that financial statement.  I think the claims were all lumped together&mdash;the country claims and the claims dealt with in the city of Dublin.  In the country, however, the fringe of these claims has hardly yet been touched.  The hearing of them before the judges has not even taken place.  I am perfectly aware that the judges have a great deal of <Col N="27" /> work to do, and that the pre-Truce claims have to be dealt with.  These claims have to come before a Commission. In the meantime, those people in the country districts who have suffered losses since 1921, are beginning to get excessively anxious, and wish to know when their claims are going to be dealt with.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with post-Truce claims, and the motion can be altered, as suggested.  It bears very hard on those who are prepared to reconstruct, and also on those who wish to rebuild on another site.  I allude to those whose houses have been burned, and in this category those who wish to live at home in the Free State, and also those whose lives have been made unbearable by raids, by cattle-driving, by stealing, and by burglary.  The Minister for Finance has dealt with pre-Truce claims in his Budget speech.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Also the awards made by the Compensation Commission in dealing with pre-Truce damage, did not involve such large payments as was at one time expected, while in cases where payment is due only on fulfilment of a building condition, applicants have been slow in taking steps to carry out this condition.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Again, on the expenditure side, the debt charge has not yet reached its full development, and in particular a substantial addition to the burden under this head may be expected through the creation of Compensation Stock in settlement of awards under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As you know, that is an Act that was very fully discussed in the Seanad.  In the Budget cake, if I may so call it, that the Minister for Finance has presented <Col N="28" /> to the Free State, there are plenty of currants, but I do not think you will find in it many plums.  As the Minister truly remarked, &ldquo;the protection duties will give us a limited but sufficient experiment in the use of a tariff for the stimulation of Irish industry.&rdquo;  To that I say, &ldquo;amen.&rdquo;  But we want to pay our debts.  From what I saw during the last two days, at some races that everybody seemed to attend, there appears to be plenty of money amongst the people of the Free State.</P>

      <P>I heard a remark, &ldquo;the wrong people.&rdquo;  I do not know if I am included in that category.  I may as well say it has been stated that there were 6,000 motor cars in the vicinity of the course at Punchestown races on the first day.  I do not say that all the motors got there, but the occupants did.  That, of course, is material to what I am speaking about, as the occupants had to pay to go in.  I can quite understand any Finance Minister in any country where two taxes, income tax and super-tax, are in existence, under such circumstances, saying, &ldquo;I do not know why I should reduce income tax and super-tax.&rdquo;  I believe it to be perfectly true that there is plenty of money in the country for people to amuse themselves.  Therefore, I do not think grumblers have very much right to say what they are saying.  I was glad to see the Ministers and the Governor-General taking a holiday.  In these days of rush, hurry and vulgarity it is a good thing to shut the office desk and go for a few hours' fun and for a look occasionally at the green fields.  So far as the finances of the Free State are concerned, I am an optimist.  I am not pessimistic.  I hope that you, sir, will pass it on to those responsible for the Government of the Free State that when a year has elapsed from the date of the introduction of these protective duties they should float another loan.  The credit of the State is good. The motto should be &ldquo;Pay your debts and smile.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to propose&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it is desirable that a Standing Committee consisting of five members of each House of the Oireachtas be appointed to consider the position of the Saorstát in relation to foreign affairs, and to report thereon to the Oireachtas from time to time accordingly, and that a message be sent to Dáil Eireann requesting its concurrence in the appointment of such a Committee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reasons for putting down this motion are two-fold&mdash;first of all, I wish to call attention to the general importance, particularly in view of our position as a member of the British Commonwealth, of Foreign Affairs, and also to suggest that both Houses, and particularly the Seanad, would be greatly strengthened in the consideration of matters which must inevitably come before them in the near future, if such a Committee were appointed. There is an impression among a number of people in this country that foreign affairs are relatively unimportant, because they do not immediately feel the effect.  Because our standing, the extent to which we are respected, the extent to which we co-operate with other countries, and the extent to which we trade with them, are not immediately felt by farmers in some country districts, it is thought that they are not thereby affected.  Because Irish industry does not immediately see the effect, for instance, of the ratification or non-ratification of a Treaty with Turkey, the United States, or some other country, it is thought that, therefore, it is not affected.  There is a very considerable want of interest&mdash;due, perhaps, to our history of the last century in which we have been concerned largely with internal matters&mdash;in foreign affairs. I suggest that it is desirable that there ought to be in each House, preferably working together, a small number of persons whose duty it would be to keep in touch with events which might affect <Col N="30" /> our Government, so that it may be able to put information before us when we are obliged to discuss matters affecting foreign relationship such as we discussed to-day, or such as came before the Seanad recently or as will come before it in a short time.  The state in which Europe was left after the Great War has created a large number of problems which we hope are in the way of being solved, but which will involve many agreements, settlements, pacts and treaties in the near future.  We are placed in the position that we will be either asked to take part in these negotiations, or if we are not asked to take part, we may be asked to approve or disapprove.  I suggest respectfully that it is a matter of the utmost importance that we should be informed when we come to deal with these important matters. We may reach decisions&mdash; this is my important point&mdash;which may make a big difference to the future of this country.  I suggest that it is international trade we need almost more than anything else if we are to improve our financial position.  Senator Linehan considers that the resolution to-day was the only thing that emerged from our membership of the League of Nations. If you want an argument for my motion as to the need for information, I cannot suggest a better one than the Senator's remark.  Apart from the merits or demerits of our membership of the League, the very existence of the League and the existence of the Conferences to which we would be invited means that international agreements, sometimes minor agreements and sometimes major agreements, will come before the Seanad, and it is of the greatest importance that we should be in a position to deal with them with intelligence and knowledge.</P>
    <P>There is a further reason why I think foreign affairs must, and will, loom as matters of considerable importance in the near future in this country, and that refers particularly to our membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  It has been asserted and admitted that the self-governing portions of that Commonwealth have a coequal status.  Their independence and sovereignty are admitted.  It has been asserted and admitted that the Parliament <Col N="31" /> at Westminster has not power to pass laws affecting these self-governing countries, and so far as we are concerned, that is stated in our Constitution. It has been further asserted, and I think, equally admitted, that the King, before signing Treaties, affecting the whole Commonwealth, must be advised by the Ministers of each and every one of the self-governing nations. It is perfectly obvious, I think, that the assertion of independence which was so vigorously asserted by all States in the Commonwealth, together with the need for co-operation, particularly in foreign affairs, will lead to situations which from time to time may be difficult, and which should be handled with the greatest amount of goodwill and commonsense. We and other countries will not give up our independence, our right to express our point of view, to ratify or not ratify.  Various points will come before the Oireachtas in the near future of the greatest importance in foreign affairs, and I suggest that such a Committee should keep in touch closely with developments, and in a sympathetic way, assist any development of our independence in International affairs.  I shall deal later with the position which has arisen in regard to one particular Treaty which may come before us before long.  I have said enough to show, I think, that our position as a member of the Commonwealth will not lessen, but will rather add to the delicacy and difficulty of the consideration of foreign affairs, and will add to the importance of their consideration here.</P>
    <P>Development inside the British Commonwealth has been gradual in relation to foreign affairs.  Prior to the Great War Great Britain negotiated.  There was consultation to a greater or lesser extent.  The self-governing nations had very limited powers.  If they asserted themselves they might succeed in getting their point of view recognised, but substantially the position was that Great Britain negotiated or carried out treaties with other countries, and the self-governing colonies had to put up with the result.  After the war a new publicly recognised international status <Col N="32" /> was achieved by their independent membership of the League of Nations, and with that it was recognised that England could not alone complete a Treaty on behalf of the Commonwealth including these nations, which were not only self-governing as far as internal affairs were concerned, but also had a recognised international status, and, consequently, there came what I call the second stage of their development.  You had the right to ratify and give independent advice to his Majesty in the matter of foreign relationships recognised.  Following that, we had recognised the right to decline to ratify treaties, and I find that even as early as 1919 the proposal was made of an offer of a pact with France, and if my information is correct that pact, which, owing to the unwillingness of the United States to agree was not ratified, also failed to obtain the assent of Canada and South Africa. You have there the assertion of the right not to ratify.  We have the further assertion made by Canada, but now regularly admitted of the right of each self-governing colony to negotiate and ratify directly a treaty, subject to due consideration of the rights of the other parts of the Commonwealth as a whole, but, as has been definitely asserted in Canada, that due consideration is a moral rather than a legal obligation. Now we have the definite assertion by Canada that if she is not represented in treaty negotiations she is not concerned, and therefore not bound by them.</P>
    <P>I mention these things to try and draw attention to the fact that our foreign relationships are matters of urgent importance, that they are bound to arise from time to time and that they will need commonsense and goodwill to achieve a solution of the various problems that will arise therewith, at the same time maintaining our independent status.  Also, I want to suggest that the need for a number of independent persons representing different points of view and different groups to keep in close touch with these and kindred affairs is more important when we are a member of the Commonwealth than if we were merely an isolated State, the reason being that we have not only <Col N="33" /> to watch our interests as far as we are concerned, but we have to see that Great Britain, Canada and South Africa do not negotiate a treaty which, by implication or fact, we might be affected by.  As to the particular reasons for proposing a committee, Democratic control in the matter of foreign relationships has been advocated very much of late.  At the same time those who have most advocated it have recognised that democratic control, however desirable, is a matter of very great difficulty to achieve.  When it was desired in our Constitution to assert a measure of democratic control the difficulties were such that eventually we got narrowed down to Article 49, which asserts that this country cannot be committed to active participation in war without the consent of the Oireachtas. I find in Bryce's book that two countries have a somewhat similar constitutional provision.  One is the United States of America and the other is France, and I further find that both these countries found it advisable and necessary to have a committee representing different parties which can consider foreign relationships and which can, of necessity, be consulted by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting analogy. I want to make clear that this Committee should have no specific rights or powers to demand information from the Minister.  I suggest, if it is a competent committee, the Minister will find it important to have its opinion and lay information before it, particular information which cannot be laid before the House in the open, not because you want necessarily to hide it from the members, but because it may concern the affairs of other governments which you have no right to publish, and which I conceive, may be laid before such a committee.  A committee of the kind would not be a meddling committee, but would be a committee which would meet from time to time to consider our relationships. There would be a special duty laid on it to do so, and it would be availed of for consultation with the Ministry if they found it desirable to consult with it.  I suggest that our Government may not have to negotiate a treaty, but <Col N="34" /> nevertheless may find themselves in a position to declare that they are not concerned.</P>
    <P>They may find it convenient to have ready a representative committee which would give them some measure of the opinion in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not for one moment suggest that this committee should take the place of the discussions which should take place from time to time on foreign affairs, but I do suggest that the committee might prevent discussions at an inopportune occasion, and at the same time they would add very much to the general standard of debates.  I do not think I would be accused of saying anything derogatory to the Oireachtas in saying that our debates on matters of foreign affairs have not been of the standard that every one of us would desire or wish for. I have, perhaps, taken rather long, but I would like to refer to one or two matters which are practically certain in some form or other to require consideration in the near future.  There is, for instance, a Conference in London between the British Government and Russia.  If that leads to anything, it will lead to certain conventions which, in all possibility, may require a certain amount of ratification, and it will be of the greatest possible importance that some person should keep in touch with it, and be able to advise, if necessary. You will have from time to time League resolutions, such as we have had to-day, many of which will be of a much more important character, and you will have questions of pacts and agreements, which will, I think, be of particular interest to this country in view of Article 49.</P>
    <P>For instance, there is the question of the Lausanne Treaty.  I do not wish to go into the matter of whether or not we ought in any measure to ratify that Treaty.  I do not want to go into the question of whether we ought not to make a declaration similar to that of Canada&mdash;that having taken no part in the negotiations we are not bound thereby.  I do suggest, however, that that Treaty, and particularly the Straits Convention in that Treaty, raises an issue which will have to be carefully considered by the <Col N="35" /> Government and the Oireachtas.  That particular section of the Treaty&mdash;and I take it Mr. McKenzie King takes a similar view as far as Canada is concerned&mdash;might conceivably mean that this country at some future date would be bound to go to war in support of Turkey in certain circumstances.  It seems to me we cannot sign or ratify such a convention consistent with Article 49, which indicates that we could not enter into such a war except with the assent of the Oireachtas. I want to suggest that while, in this matter of the Lausanne Treaty, Canada's position, in so far as her declaration is concerned, may appeal to us and may be an easy way out, it is not at the same time desirable for us simply to follow Canada, because we are a European nation and Canada is not, and our position and relationships may conceivably be very different.  Then, again, the question of our representation in foreign countries is being raised.  We understand we are to have an ambassador at Washington at an early date.  It is pretty obvious we cannot afford to have ambassadors in every country, and a considerable amount of thought and consideration will be necessary to decide what countries we will gain the most from in return for the expense incurred by sending an ambassador.  That is largely a matter for the Government, but they will have to consult both Houses, and I suggest that is a matter in which the Committee I propose might be extremely useful.  At the last meeting of the League, Canada proposed an alteration in Article 10.</P>
    <P>She failed to get that alteration, but she got a declaration which practically amounts to this, that she is not bound to go to war in support of Article 10 without the definite assent of her Parliament.  I am not certain whether that applies to Canada only, or also to us.  We would require to make it clear that our position in the League is of a somewhat similar character. My main point is this: The existence of a Joint Committee, or, failing it, a Committee of the Seanad, which would have the definite duty of considering these matters, which it is not always wise to bring out in debate, or <Col N="36" /> to express definite dogmatic opinions about hastily in public, might be of very great assistance to the Seanad, particularly if, as I anticipate and propose, that the Committee should be representative of different sections.  In conclusion, I want to point out that our foreign affairs mean our relationships with the different countries of the world, whether outside or inside the Commonwealth.  Our standing, our trade and our own development to a very large extent will depend on how we are regarded by them.  The extent to which we can, both as traders and as a nation keep our pacts and agreements, and our general standing abroad will go to make a big difference to us here.  It is not a matter of Party politics.  Mr. MacDonald found himself recently considering the ratification of a Treaty negotiated by Lord Curzon, and it is quite possible that Mr. Johnson may yet find himself in a similar position in regard to a Treaty or agreement negotiated by President Cosgrave. There is not a single one of these complications and difficulties that have arisen in connection with our position in the Commonwealth which would not have arisen under Document No. 2, and it may be when we get real peace in this country that some other Party may find themselves in the same position. Therefore, as I say, it is not a matter of Party politics because it is a matter that is of equal interest to each Party, and it is one that a useful non-Party Committee should be appointed to deal with.</P>

      <P>It is not often I agree with Senator Douglas, but on this occasion I wish to second the motion he has proposed.  It is very desirable that the Minister should have the best advice he can get from the Oireachtas in regard to foreign matters. In this country there is quite a number of people who do not travel abroad, and they pay little attention to outside affairs.  It is necessary to have information in regard to Ireland's relationship with other countries spread about, and it is necessary that the Minister should be informed of the opinion of the Dáil and Seanad on these matters. Recently there was a subject brought to <Col N="37" /> our attention in a sudden fashion, and it had a rather narrow shave in the Seanad as well as in the Dáil.  Such contingencies could be avoided if the Oireachtas could have placed before it full information; it would then be in a position to decide upon many important points, even though presented with the matter in such a sudden fashion.  I think Committees are very important. In the early days of the Seanad I made a somewhat similar proposal in regard to a variety of matters, but apparently it did not meet with approval.  In particular matters that proposal may now be thought better of.  Where there is a joint Committee opinions may be exchanged, and such a Committee would be a decided advantage.  I do not think there would be much difficulty about this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to disagree with the appointment of such a Committee. I enjoyed very much the able and lucid statement of Senator Douglas, when he traversed the whole field of politics.  But, by listening carefully to his arguments, I felt that a great number of them tended to kill themselves. One of his main reasons for establishing such a Committee was that matters would not be alluded to which possibly might be alluded to in the Dáil. In other words, he advocates secret diplomacy.  Secret diplomacy at the moment is on its trial, and in many cases it has been found wanting.  I am not in favour of secret diplomacy.  The Senator laid emphasis on one matter. He said the farmers in certain country districts seemed to think that international affairs are no concern of theirs, showing thereby that in Senator Douglas's mind the farmer is incapable of any thought, and merely sat down on his ditch ruminating on the probability of a good turnip crop.  I think that farmers give very serious thought to the large problems of Ireland's international affairs, as well as to the internal problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas suggested that not much thought and not much thinking was given by the country to these matters.  And yet, he suggested or proposed to remove the incentive to thought on the part of the Seanad by taking the consideration of foreign <Col N="38" /> affairs from 40 or 50, who are now considering these matters, and who are entitled to bring up any matter that they consider wise.  These men are advised to discontinue that, and to put the whole consideration of these matters and these immense problems in the hands of four or five people.  That was his argument.  If that was his argument for that proposal, it is defeated by the objects which he intends to promote. Democratic control seems to be desirable.  These were his words. I think that the establishment of a Committee is the abnegation of democracy. Not, mind you, that I wish to compare the discussions of this Seanad in any matter with the babbling of the crowd.  Yet I think we have admirable discussions here introduced on notice of motion, and I see no reason why matters of international interest should not be introduced here on notice of motion and receive all the consideration which they should receive.  I do not wish to put it beyond this, beyond moving that such a committee should not be appointed. I think the Seanad as a whole is the place where any question of importance that arises should be discussed.  I agree with Senator Douglas that not enough thought is given to these matters of international importance, and I think that anything that would tend to reduce the incentive to thought is undesirable.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to take part in this debate, but after hearing Senator Bennett's remarks I just wish to make a few observations. He said that the proposal to form such a committee is an abnegation of all democracy. Now, we have already heard that similar committees exist in two countries, France and the United States.  Is it seriously put up to us that a thing which is done in what I consider to be the two most democratic countries in the world should be described to us as the abnegation of democracy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Senator Bennett altogether in his reasons for opposing the setting up of such a committee as this.  I view the matter absolutely and entirely from a totally different standpoint.  My objection to the resolution was that it stopped short <Col N="39" /> where it did, and that we were not told how this committee would be made to work, and what results would be got from its working, and how it would be put to work&mdash;how a committee on foreign affairs would proceed generally. Senator Bennett thinks that the whole Seanad and the Dáil can manage foreign affairs, and that it is our business to set to work and deal with all the different matters connected with foreign affairs which it is possible to imagine may infringe upon or touch on our various Free State matters.  Now, if we have five intelligent Senators and five intelligent Teachtaí&mdash;for I hold that this is not a thing which should be taken up by the Seanad alone &mdash;they would be in a much better position to deal with foreign affairs than the whole body would.  If the Dáil do not approve of this resolution I think there will be very little use going on with it.  If on that committee you have representatives of the different parties in both Houses you would have a committee better qualified to deal with foreign affairs.  Each different section of opinion must be represented in that way.  The weakness I see in the present proposal is this: it does not tell us how the work is to be done.  The suggestion is, perhaps, that you pick out a committee and tell them then: &ldquo;You are a committee.  Look after foreign affairs, and keep us posted,&rdquo; and so on. I do not see if having ten men picked out in that way who would feel themselves bound to go into all these things in the way in which they should be gone into, that it would not be making for efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They will undoubtedly require to have some sort of permanent staff. They will have to put some very intelligent individual whose business it is, and who is paid to do it, to watch all these different things and matters, and summon that committee and make them go into the work, and when a debate does come on in the Dáil and Seanad we would have at least five of our members sitting here who would be thoroughly acquainted with the business. We know the difficulty we are in here in the Seanad when we have not a Minister to explain the questions that <Col N="40" /> Senator Douglas referred to.  We would have these men who would save us from being in the position that we would not know what we were talking about when a question of this kind came up for discussion.  On occasions of this kind, if we had five of our Senators who had studied these matters telling us their views and generally explaining the matter, we would be in a very much stronger position to deal with anything that may arise.  The whole Seanad or the whole Dáil could not possibly get all the information on these points.  I do not believe it is possible that they could.  Individually I know very well that I look to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to manage these things.  None of us in our past lives has ever meddled in foreign affairs.  Now, we will have to get on and deal with foreign affairs.  In these circumstances I would like to know that I was having the views of some of my fellow-Senators who had considered the matter, and had given thought to it, rather than that we should have a day or two, when we get notice to read up all the matter, and try and give a considered opinion on a matter about which nine-tenths of us knew nothing whatever.  However, if Senator Douglas' motion is carried, and if we have a similar motion carried in the Dáil&mdash;for I believe it will be no use unless it is followed by a similar motion in the Dáil&mdash;then we would have it taken up by the Government, because I think expense will be incurred, and if it is to be put to any use it must do really good work.  Some excellent official will have to be appointed who will keep the Committee in touch with everything.  Their staff must also keep them in touch with the Foreign Minister.  That such a Committee should be there, would be of the greatest value to the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HAUGHTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in support of the motion of Senator Douglas.  I think in these days of broadcasting and reading the newspapers very closely, more closely than ever before, we in Ireland are in closer touch with what is happening in other countries than ever before.  I do not think that the ignorance which Senator Jameson hinted at is so characteristic <Col N="41" /> amongst us in Ireland.  Inasmuch as we are already committed to a substantial sum towards the League of Nations, I think we should endeavour to get as good value as possible for the money.  I take it from the suggestion of Senator Douglas that the committee of five which he suggests would not approach this matter unless five members of the Dáil are also appointed on it. Without any reflection on the Minister for Foreign Affairs I think it would be a great help for him to have the advantage of a committee like that inquiring and looking into and keeping the members informed on what was happening elsewhere and advising on it.  As regards the question of expense, I do not think that that will arise very much. A little extra expense may be incurred, but no expense to a large extent will be necessary.  I hope the motion will pass.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CUMMINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in supporting the motion.  Questions arose in connection with our foreign affairs within the past few months that were very embarrassing, I think, to most of the Senators, and also to many members of the Dáil, by reason of the fact that what Senator Bennett termed &ldquo;secret diplomacy&rdquo; had been carried on for some time.  We were not acquainted with the questions until the matter was brought up here. It placed members in a very difficult position and led to nasty wrangling in the other House.  If the Committee proposed is to be effective, I think it would be absolutely necessary that it should have the sanction of the Minister for External Affairs and that all the information he has access to should be placed at the disposal of that Committee, so that they may digest it and place it at the disposal of members of the Dáil and Seanad before any public discussion.  They would then have an opportunity of considering the matter in all its bearings.  The setting up of such a Committee, if it were not in touch with the Minister, would be useless. Such a Committee, I imagine, would have no international recognition, and, therefore, would not have access to genuine sources of information. Their information, as it appears to me, would be derived from Press reports and other unofficial sources.  I <Col N="42" /> would entirely approve of the motion, on condition that the Committee be in touch with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and have access to the information at his disposal.  In the present fluid state of world politics and commerce, it is essential that this country should keep closely in touch with these matters.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Bennett when he suggests that the proposer of the resolution advocates secret diplomacy. What, I think, was in the mind of the Senator who proposed the motion was, that there were certain matters not of public importance that might possibly lead to complications, if divulged.  I beg to support the motion.</P>

      <P>I, also, desire to support the motion.  We, members of the Seanad, and members of the public, have very scant facilities for making ourselves acquainted with the details of treaties or other international arrangements. The particulars that we are able to glean from the scant references in the Press are of no utility at all when we come to consider whether we should, or should not, vote for ratifying a treaty presented to us here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the difficulty in the way of setting up this Committee, I think that could be overcome.  Certainly, expense will be entailed.  It would be too much to expect members of such a Committee to take upon themselves in addition to their ordinary everyday duties and business, the very close investigation and inquiry, of a continuous character, that their functions will entail, so that they would be able to give us their considered advice when matters of this kind would crop up.  There are in existence already, in connection with certain Departments of the Government, what are known as consultative or advisory committees, which act entirely under the Minister for the Department concerned.  There is a statutory Committee called the Roads Advisory Board, and all the information of the Road Board is at the disposal of the Minister.  He calls us into consultation occasionally and we can, of our own volition, assemble to discuss any matter we may consider of importance, and thereafter advise the Minister.  Such an arrangement as that <Col N="43" /> might be come to if the Minister for External Affairs were approached and if he were willing to have such a body associated with his Department, as an advisory or consultative committee. Any travelling or other expenses entailed would be borne on the Estimate for that Minister's Department. The Committee would then have at their disposal all the information the Minister possesses and any further information he may be able to procure from time to time, and that would enable them to come to useful decisions on any important matter affecting the relations of Ireland with foreign countries.  If a Committee, such as I have suggested, of an advisory and consultative character, could be set up, I think many of the objections presented by Senators would be overcome.</P>

      <P>The Resolution provides that a Message be sent to Dáil Eireann requesting its concurrence in the appointment of such a Committee.  If Dáil Eireann agrees with the request, the arrangements can easily be carried out.  The resolution absolutely asks for the concurrence of the Oireachtas, and if that is secured, most of the objections will be dissipated.</P>

      <P>Mrs. Wyse Power has explained one point which I wanted to emphasise.  I felt that it would be unwise, in moving in a matter of this kind, at first, to put down too many details.  It might happen that the proposal generally would be acceptable to the Dáil, but that exception might be taken to some of the details.  It is desirable, I think, to claim no right to control the Minister in any way, because the Minister is directly responsible to the Oireachtas for his actions. He must answer for that responsibility to the Oireachtas and not to any Committee. At the same time, the functions of the Committee would be largely twofold. The Minister would consult with them from time to time, and they, I believe, would go to the Minister on matters on which they thought he had information which they thought should <Col N="44" /> be placed before the House.  The Committee, if it functioned properly, would give quotations and references to members of either House in respect of matters occurring from time to time.  Certain small expenses might be involved, but I do not visualise, in the first year at any rate, any difficulty.  One clerk from the Seanad or from the Dáil could act as Secretary and get assistance in the matter of papers and documents which might be available from the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I have no doubt such assistance would be given.  But I do not think we should make any kind of condition that would appear to make it obligatory upon the Minister to do these things, because he is directly responsible to the House, and I think it is generally unwise to appoint a Committee that would seem to control the Minister.  I do not want it to be thought that that was in my mind or in the mind of the Seanad in proposing this arrangement.  With regard to the exact procedure, there may be some difficulty, but I think it would be wise to appoint a Committee with reasonably wide terms of reference, and leaving it to the Committee to define its own method of procedure. I have not had an opportunity of discussing this matter with members of the Seanad, but I thought this is an opportune time to have such discussion, and that was the reason why I put such a motion down.</P>

      <P>With regard to Items 14 and 15 upon the Order Paper, I would like to remind the Seanad that when the report mentioned in Item 14 was presented to the Seanad in March last they agreed upon my suggestion to let it stand over until the report dealing with Item No. 15 on the Agenda was ready, because there was another Committee known as the Joint Committee on Procedure in regard to Seanad amendments to Bills which was preparing its report.  As that report, we anticipated, would involve an addition to our Standing Orders, the Seanad, on my suggestion, agreed that the report of the Standing <Col N="45" /> Committee on Standing Orders should be postponed until this Second Report came up.  Therefore, I think it would be more convenient now if Item No. 15 were taken first, because No. 15 will involve further addition to our Standing Orders and will save the necessity of a second alteration in the print.</P>

      <P>I put down that motion because it seemed necessary to have more than a mere formal proposal.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The only other matter on the Order Paper is with reference to the Report of the Joint Committee on the temporary accommodation of the Oireachtas.  A message has been received from the Dáil in connection with that, and I wish to explain the rather curious position that has arisen.  The House will recollect that a Joint Committee was appointed consisting of five members of each House, who were asked to consider and report upon temporary provision for the accommodation of the Oireachtas.  This House agreed, and on that Committee they appointed their Chairman, Senators O'Farrell, Jameson, O'Dea and Mrs. Wyse Power to be their five representatives.  The Committee sat on a number of occasions, and some of them who had never been there before visited the Royal Hospital for the purpose of inspecting it in regard to its accommodation as a Parliament House.  They went very fully into the question of the various alternative sites that were either suggested to them or that occurred to any member of the Committee as suitable.  They made their report, which was an unanimous report.  It was brought up here before the Seanad and unanimously confirmed and adopted.  When it went before the Dáil for their adoption, Deputy Thrift called attention to the fact, or to the alleged fact, that this Committee had not considered a suggestion that had been made, that accommodation could be provided for the Oireachtas on the Lawn&mdash;the <Col N="47" /> vacant ground in front of Leinster House facing Merrion Square&mdash;and he proposed in the Dáil a motion that the report be referred back to the Committee for the purpose of considering that suggestion.</P>
      <P>After some discussion the Dáil agreed to a resolution sending back the report. But the Committee, in so far as it consisted of members of the Seanad, having reported to the Seanad, and the Seanad having confirmed their report, that Committee, in so far as it consisted of Senators, was <i>functus officio</i>&mdash;it no longer existed, it had discharged its duty, and its report was adopted by the Seanad.  Therefore, if this report were to be considered by the same Committee it would be necessary for the Seanad to re-appoint its five members.  But before doing that there are one or two observations I think it my duty to make. In the first place I wish to say that Deputy Thrift is in error in thinking that that matter of providing accommodation by erecting a temporary structure on Leinster Lawn was overlooked by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion was present to all of us, but we thought so little of it that we did not think it was worthy of consideration. It was obviously, we thought, an alternative that would afford no satisfaction to the members of the R.D.S., because to turn Leinster Lawn, for an indefinite period, into a place occupied by buildings such as the Seanad and the Dáil would require would, we thought, have exaggerated rather than mitigated the grievance under which the R.D.S. professed to labour.  In addition, as the idea involved the complete evacuation of Leinster House and the erection upon Leinster Lawn not only of debating chambers for both Houses, but also of accommodation for Ministers and for officials, we thought the proposal was impossible from the point of view of extravagance and delay, and, accordingly, as I have said, we did not really think it worth while considering.  But the curious fact I wish to draw attention to is, that while that was the motion moved by Deputy Thrift, and on the faith of which the Dáil agreed to send the Report back, the Government, <Col N="48" /> through the President, while supporting the motion to send the Report back, denounced Deputy Thrift's suggestion, and pointed out that it would be no relief to the R.D.S., and would desecrate the beautiful grounds they had in Leinster Lawn.</P>
    <P>It was obvious that the Government were still hankering after Kilmainham, because they supported the view that the Report should go back on the ground that this Committee did not state as fully as they might the reasons why they reported against the selection of the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham. Inasmuch as the Committee not only visited that place for the express purpose of the Report, but also set out in it that in view of the difficulties and inconvenience of access, and also in view of the fact that the estimates and the evidence satisfied us that it would cost at least £70,000 to make it suitable even for temporary accommodation and would involve a delay of at least one year, we reported that we could not recommend the adoption of the Royal Hospital. Senators might well ask what useful purpose is to be served in sending this Report back to the Committee, and I have got to confess that I do not think any useful purpose will be served.  At the same time, I do not see that it is going to do any harm, and if it is desired that there should be a more elaborate statement of the reasons why we turned down the suggestions about Leinster Lawn and the Royal Hospital there is no possible objection to that being done.  But, as I say, so far as any useful purpose is concerned, I do not anticipate that there will be any change in the views of the Committee, because they went into these two matters very fully and exhaustively, and I am pretty well satisfied, from what I know of the members of the Committee, that they are not likely to change their views.</P>
    <P>What I rose particularly to call attention to is this.  I do think the time is long overdue when proper and decent accommodation should have been provided for the members of this Seanad.  We have been sitting here under conditions which are really discreditable, which are really beneath the dignity of any assembly which claims to be of a representative character. <Col N="49" /> We have put up for over one and a half years with a condition of grave discomfort, not merely to the members of the Seanad, but also to the Press and to the members of the public.  Your Chairman and your official staff have sat here upon a scaffold, behind which there is a cupboard, from which your Chairman emerges, and into which he disappears.  The whole arrangement&mdash; the accommodation for the officials outside, the seats provided here in what is called the public gallery, the inconvenient position in which the Press are left&mdash;is really very unworthy of the position the Seanad occupies, and I think it is high time that the Seanad should make this fact known to the Government and ask them to come to their relief and provide them with some accommodation that will be consistent with dignity and decorum.  Therefore, I would suggest, if the Seanad are prepared to pass a resolution re-appointing the Seanad members of this Joint Committee for the purpose of reconsidering this Report, that they might add to that an expression of their belief that the time has come when suitable and proper accommodation should be provided for members of the Seanad, the Press, the public and the staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that would be out of order.  I want the Seanad to understand that this Committee has nothing whatever to do with permanent accommodation for the Oireachtas.  We were solely asked to consider and report on immediate and temporary accommodation, and were <Col N="50" /> expressly forbidden to go into the question of the final or permanent resting place of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this matter, I think that the Seanad should be careful in adopting the words sent to us from the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Report be referred back to the Joint Committee for reconsideration of Section 3 of paragraph 4, and that Seanad Eireann be requested to agree to this course.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If Senators will look at the Report of the Committee they will see that Section 3 actually deals entirely with the Royal Dublin Society.  To send the Report back to the Committee merely to deal with one matter which they have already gone into elaborately and on which they have given reasons would seem to be no use whatever.  You can hardly expect the members of the Committee to alter their decision regarding Leinster House.  Undoubtedly the Dáil was convinced that the carrying out of this resolution was going to inflict a very serious injury on the Royal Dublin Society.  There is no question of that.  That case was evidently made by Deputy Thrift and the Dáil agreed with him.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly evidence was brought before the Committee that damage had been done to the Society by the occupation of these premises.  From enquiries I made, and from listening to the evidence, I came to the conclusion that very serious damage was going to be done to the Royal Dublin Society. How great that damage is, is another question.  What we thought was the wisest and the only solution for the State is set out in paragraphs 1 and 2. They deal with Kilmainham and the Castle.  What we stated about the Castle is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Castle, on the other hand, is excellently situated, and capable of early, if not immediate occupation, while the expenditure would be comparatively small.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an expression of opinion by the Committee which undoubtedly means, other things apart, that they <Col N="51" /> would recommend the Castle.  I think that is clearly set out.  Then the Report went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But the Joint Committee was confronted by the fact that it had been allotted to the Courts of Justice and occupied by them after expenditure upon necessary alteration and equipment; and unless some other suitable and available location for the courts can be obtained, the Joint Committee cannot recommend the selection of the Castle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If you are going to re-appoint the Committee or to add any other names to the Committee, whatever committee sits ought to be given power to consider paragraph 2 again.  It will be quite possible, then, that they may carry out their ideas on different lines. Although we got information that there was no other suitable and available location for the courts, I am not at all as certain of that as I was when the Committee passed the Report.  I am inclined to think that the facts are the other way.  I believe from what I have heard on very good authority, that if it were put up to the Judges, the members of the Bar, and the solicitors' profession how great was the necessity for proper accommodation for the two Houses, and if the courts were accommodated at the King's Inns for a certain time, we would find the Bar assisting instead of blocking us in this matter.  We have heard some criticism of the Bar and of the legal profession in the Seanad, but I honestly believe that if properly approached in this matter they will be found as good citizens as any of the rest of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out the great difficulty about what you suggest?  You see that this Report was brought up before this House, and confirmed <i>in omnibus.</i>  The entire of it was adopted.  When it came up for confirmation in the Dáil they took a different view, inasmuch as one paragraph is concerned, and they passed a resolution referring it back to the Joint Committee for one purpose only, and that was for the reconsideration of section (3) of paragraph 4, and they asked <Col N="52" /> us to agree to this course.  The difficulty, therefore, is this, that if this House now were to propose to reconsider the other portions of this Report, it would require an amended resolution on the part of the Dáil.  Of course, that is not an insuperable objection to the course suggested by Senator Jameson, but I want to point out what it would involve.  It cannot be left as it is.  In the Dáil the only change made is to ask the Committee to reconsider one paragraph only, which does not include the particular paragraph referred to by Senator Jameson.</P>

      <P>Dealing with what you say, if we merely adopt the Message of the Dáil, I think we would rather stultify ourselves and put ourselves and the Committee into a <i>cul de sac</i>.  Is there no way by which we can leave the matter as you suggest?  I believe it would be possible to get an adoption by that Committee of another resolution, if we are to consider the thing as a whole, and along the lines of not rejecting the consideration of the Castle.  In asking the House to do that, I think it is well to take a rather large view of the situation.  Now, we <Col N="53" /> cannot ask the Judges, and the legal profession generally, to go for an indefinite period to the King's Inns, and I think the matter, as regards them, is one which could be dealt with, but it must be dealt with by the Government. I think the Government are not assisting the Committee in the way in which they should.  It is a Governmental matter to deal with the Courts of Law, and it is a Government matter to tell them what is going to happen in the future as regards the Law Courts.  The Law Courts, as they used to be, were in a magnificent building, and I believe that the Courts in that building were excellently fitted for their purpose, and that, with some modern improvements, the restoration of the Four Courts would make one of the most noble law buildings in the world.  We need not go to foreign architects, for we have the design there.  I am watching the building day by day, and they are taking down the great stones.  I believe, if there is one thing in the world which could be restored with small cost, it is the Four Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it would pay the Government well to borrow money to re-build the Four Courts, and it would help our Labour difficulty by giving an immense amount of labour on a magnificent object.  That, however, is a question for the Government.  We, a small Committee, are being asked to deal with these mighty things and to give an opinion which, undoubtedly, if it were given, would turn the Judges out of the Castle and put them, without any promise whatever as to the future, into the King's Inns.  That is the situation in which the Committee finds itself, and I do not think it is a fair position for the Government to put any Committee in.  Undoubtedly, what we are thinking is that the Oireachtas should go for temporary accommodation to the Castle.  It is undoubtedly the easiest place; it can be got at once, and it has decent accommodation for both Houses, while it means no disintegration of the Royal Dublin Society or of the legal business either.  But its selection would have to be accompanied, so far as the law courts are concerned, with some determination on the part of the Government <Col N="54" /> as to what they are going to do with the law courts in the future.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking now as a member of the Committee, but as an ordinary member of the Seanad, and it seems now to be a question whether the Government will make up their mind to do the right and proper thing with regard to the Oireachtas.  The Dáil do not like their accommodation, and we know what this place is, and the recommendation that they should sit there is unpopular.  Undoubtedly we may get a decent room if we take the best rooms from the R.D.S., but that would involve damage to one of the greatest Irish institutions we have, and great damage to the country.  If the Committee is to sit down without any assistance from the Government except to make the cheapest suggestion, and if we are to be referred merely to Section 3, paragraph 4, it will do no good whatever.  The Seanad should find out some means by which we could enlarge the enquiry, and let us get a chance of seeing whether the Government will or will not assist us in getting really good accommodation and in providing for the law courts.</P>
    <P>That is the right course to be adopted, and we should not send it back to the Committee who can do nothing under the Resolution the Dáil has passed.  The success of the whole thing will depend upon whether the Government will assist the Oireachtas in getting proper accommodation.  The right horse ought to be saddled, and it ought to be clear to everybody, if the Government is earnest in its desire to give these two Houses the proper accommodation which they require, that there is only one way to do it.  If the Committee is left perfectly free to give advice as to what that way is, they should be re-appointed, but whether they will give the advice which is wanted is another question.</P>

      <P>I think what Senator Jameson said is wise and sound. Personally, I was going to suggest that the time had come when the Government ought to take this matter in hands and bring forward a definite proposal. I have no doubt they desire to give every opportunity to all points of view in both Houses of the Oireachtas <Col N="55" /> in leaving it to the Committee, but the results have been unsatisfactory, because we got no proposal which seemed to be acceptable.  Possibly I would be in order in moving that the Seanad agree that the Report be referred back to the Joint Committee for consideration, provided that the Committee consult with the Government and be empowered to consider the whole Report.  I consider, as the Committee was a joint one, that it did not cease to exist until both Houses considered the Report, and therefore it is not necessary to re-appoint a Committee.  Whatever be the result, I hope, if we are going to consider accommodation, some other provision will be made for the Seanad. This room is badly appointed, and is an uncomfortable one for the Seanad.  It was formerly intended as a store-room for antique furniture, and, notwithstanding what the President has said, it is not suitable for the purposes of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the proposition to refer this back to the Committee.

      <P>Senator Jameson said in the course of his speech that the great stones were being taken down from the Four Courts.  If that is true, there may be some explanation of it. It is possible that the building is unsafe, and so on, but it is a matter so serious that I think, as the stones are being taken down, the Government should give some explanation to the public.  We have there a building of great importance and great dignity, which we ought to have looked upon as a trust received from the past.  It has <Col N="56" /> been, unfortunately, almost destroyed, although not absolutely, I think, beyond the possibility of rebuilding, and I think we should preserve what remains of it.  I desire to support what Senator Jameson has said.</P>
      <P>The explanation of the curious position in which we find ourselves is that the majority of the Dáil think that the only thing for them to do is to go into Leinster House, but they think it would be an unlucky decision to make for themselves; and the Government would like to go into Kilmainham, but they think that it would be an unlucky decision to make for themselves, and both bodies of men are trying to get somebody else to make the decision.  I read in Fraser's <i>Golden Bough</i> that there was a certain nation of antiquity which once a year used to launch a small model ship and sail out into the ocean and put on board all the reluctant community.  If we do not do that we must make a deposit of the ill-luck of the community.  The Joint Committee of both Houses has been appointed to act in the capacity of that model ship and carry away that ill-luck from the majority of the Dáil and the Government.  I hope at this moment the Chairman is trying to exercise his ingenuity in framing a resolution to defeat that object.</P>

      <P>What has been described is perfectly correct.  We who live in the neighbourhood and pass the building every day are extremely glad to see the stones being removed, because we never might know otherwise when they would come tumbling down on our heads.  Whatever the Government is doing in removing the stones it is perfectly right, because the building is a danger to the public.  They are being carefully taken down, and it will be very easy to re-erect them and use them again.  In fact, I am praising the Government for the careful way in which the work is being done.</P>

      <P>If that is the case, I entirely withdraw.  I was suspicious that there was an ulterior object and that there was a pretence that the building was about to fall, and that then the best thing to do was to remove the stones.  If only what is necessary is being done, then, of course, no one could object, and I heartily approve.</P>

I entirely agree with Senator Jameson that the Committee should be in a position to report on whatever building or site they might consider suitable for the accommodation of the Oireachtas.  The Castle is unquestionably the place, not alone for temporary accommodation, but for permanent accommodation.</P>

      <P>The really important thing for the Government is to go ahead with the restoration of the Four Courts.  Possibly their reason for not doing so is economy.  If they considered it advisable to borrow I do not imagine the amount required would be so great. I think anything up to half-a-million would be quite sufficient, and then the Judges and lawyers could return to their own building.</P>

We have no business for to-morrow except the formality that would ensue by putting the Private Bill that was objected to to-day down for to-morrow.  I do not like to ask the Seanad to come here to-morrow for that, and at the same time I do not want any unreasonable delay placed in the way of the promoters of this Bill.  Accordingly, although we have only one Bill for next week, I think we ought to sit on Wednesday next.
