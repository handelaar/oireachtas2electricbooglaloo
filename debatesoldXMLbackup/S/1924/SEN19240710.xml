      <P>On Clause 1, I would like to ask for some information which I asked for on the Second Reading and which I do not think was given, and it is when may we expect the Annual Report of the Revenue Commissioners for 1922-23.  This report should give certain valuable information to those who take an interest in finance and without it we are unable to give independent and proper criticism to the Government proposals. For instance, on this question of income tax we should know the amounts brought into assessment and whether they are increasing or decreasing, also the amount of arrears brought into the receipts.</P>

      <P>I do not expect that any report will be issued for 1922-1923. <Col N="784" /> The reason for that is that the Commissioners were really brought into being, if I might say so, with regard to their activities as Commissioners of Revenue somewhere about February or March, 1923.  It will be in the recollection of the Seanad that a definite line was not drawn with regard to the Customs until April, 1923, and with regard to the other matters of income tax and so on, I do not think that it would be easily possible having regard to the fact that the Ministers in 1923 submitted a report in that connection, but I will undertake to speak to the Minister for Finance on the matter and see if he has any report before him on the subject.  I should say that ordinarily we would start the year 1923 on the 1st April.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION </P>
      <P>Where tax under Schedule A is charged in respect of a house or building or part of a house or building the annual value of which is ascertained according to the respective surveys and valuations from time to time in force for the purposes of poor rates, no allowance or deduction shall be made under paragraph (b) of sub-rule (1) of Rule 7 of No. V. of Schedule A of the Income Tax Act, 1918, or under Section 24 of the Finance Act, 1922, unless it is proved to the satisfaction of the special commissioners that the whole of the property in respect of which the tax is charged (in so far as it is not vacant) is bona fide let by the landlord or immediate lessor and that he has undertaken to bear the whole cost of repairs thereof.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;To delete Section 2.  I have a recommendation under Section 2 dealing with allowance for repairs and I had hoped to a certain extent to prepare the Seanad by a statement I made on this subject on the Second Reading.  The matter is somewhat technical and I hope the Seanad will excuse me if I examine it now in some detail.  I understand that these allowances for repairs were a benefit won for the Irish taxpayers largely owing to the strategy of the national party.  They then had the balance <Col N="785" /> of voting power in the House of Commons and used it to secure this benefit for the Irish taxpayer.  Now, in the matter of allowances for repairs, relief has come in two forms&mdash;first of all in the form of deductions from the poor law valuation, and it has also come in the form of repayment.  I will deal with these two separately.  Supposing a person owns a house of which the poor law valuation is £120, and if at present he lets the house for £120 he is assessed on £120 less one-sixth.  That is to say, he is assessed on £100.  Similarly the same applies if he occupies the house.  Now, under this new proposal it is intended to differentiate between these two sets of circumstances.</P>
      <P>If that house is let the deduction will be continued if it is let at the figure I stated, that is, at the amount of the poor law valuation, whereas if it is occupied the deduction is withdrawn. That is, I submit, inequitable.  The Government argued&mdash;I hope I am not interpreting them incorrectly&mdash;that the rent is in excess of the poor law valuation in 99 cases out of a hundred, and that ordinarily when a house is let the rent being in excess of the poor law valuation no deduction is permissible. Therefore, it is not fair or equitable that merely because a person occupies his house he should not get the benefit which he would get if he let it.  I challenge the basis of that contention.  It is certainly not borne out by the facts in the case of country houses.  Country houses are not in many cases valued above their letting figure.  On the contrary, they are not value for the poor law valuation. Country houses are a drug on the market. In fact, they cannot be let at all. This has been illustrated in the compensation given in the courts lately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases where the owners will not rebuild, the market value is taken as a basis for compensation and the sums allotted are almost nominal.  I know of a case recently where it would take £24,000 to rebuild the premises and £2,400 was given in compensation.  That was taken to be the market value.  That is in support of my argument that country houses are not valued above their letting value, because they have not got any letting value at all in certain cases.  Yet the Government proposes <Col N="786" /> to deal with this in one way, a general rough-and-ready-manner, treating all property alike on the argument that in the majority of cases it will be fair enough.  Now, that deals with the deduction from poor law valuation.  So burdensome did the British Government consider this question of the upkeep of property that they went further and said: &ldquo;Not only will we allow you to deduct one-sixth from the value or rent, as the case may be, of the assessment, but where you can show us by your accounts of five years average that you spent more than one-sixth, we will allow you repayment on the full amount of your expenditure up to a total of your valuation if you can prove it has been spent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All that is automatically taken away by that proposal.  It is not at all an uncommon thing in the cases of the owners of houses or house property to find that they spend twenty-five per cent. in repairs.  All round the cost of the upkeep of property is far more than the average person who has no experience of the matter, thinks.  I know that in the case of one English estate, that of the Duke of Bedford, where there was a law suit, he showed that forty per cent. of his income went in repairs, and it is for that reason that this concession, allowing a repayment of the total amount spent in upkeep was given.  It seems most inequitable that by this apparently simple amendment all those benefits should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>There is a further matter, a rather interesting point.  It is only one word, but it throws an interesting light on this amendment.  The House will notice that the word &ldquo;whole&rdquo; is introduced before &ldquo;the cost of repairs.&rdquo; That is a new form of words.  Hitherto the relief was given where the owner undertook to bear the cost of repairs. The absolute term is now introduced. That means that where an agreement has taken place between a landlord and tenant, under which the landlord would undertake to do outside repairs, and the tenant would undertake to do certain of the internal decorations, the benefits of the deduction were allowed to the landlord.  I do not know <Col N="787" /> that the case was ever taken to the courts on that point, but as a matter of administrative practice, where the landlord did the bulk of the repairs, the benefits of the Act were given him, and the wording made that clear.  Now the wording being made positive and absolute, that would be withdrawn, and the Commissioners would be saying: &ldquo;You are not doing the whole of the repairs. You are only doing 75 or 80 per cent. by your agreement.  Therefore you will not get any of the value of this deduction.&rdquo;  That seems hard, especially in the case of people who made an agreement in the light that this deduction was present, and who fixed the rent in view of the fact that this deduction habitually operated.</P>
    <P>Moreover, there is no definition of repairs.  I have never seen a definition of repairs.  I may be wrong, but I feel as the amendment will not operate you might strain it to make even what was more on the border of wear and tear&mdash; you might even stretch that to mean repairs.  The reasons I ask the House to accept this recommendation and recommend the deletion of this clause are that it is a rough-and-ready and inequitable manner of dealing with the problem.  The right method of dealing with the problem is provided in the Act by revaluation.  Those powers are already covered by the Income Tax Act, and the Government can re-value any property they think has the present value below its true letting value. Now, that will take time, but that is the right method of doing it, and I do not think it will prejudice present owners.  Furthermore, the owners of all property, and especially house property, are taxed almost to the limit of endurance.  The tax is a great handicap on the development of industry and on general progress of every kind. Very little revenue is going to come out of this, it is generally admitted, but it is argued that it is going to be a great administrative convenience.  It is going to do away with a great number of claims for revisions of assessment where owners bought out their houses. I ask the Seanad not to accept that as a sufficient reason for doing away in a rough-and-ready manner with the advantages <Col N="788" /> which house owners, a very much to be encouraged class, have enjoyed for years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLYSAGHT</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Senator Sir John Keane said, and to urge the House to accept those recommendations.  I suppose this was originally framed to meet the owners of house property in towns. There are, as he says, a large class of persons who own property in the country. I would like to remind the Government that that does not apply to one class of persons only.  There are other persons besides those generally supposed to hold large property in the country.  These people have been trying for some time to make ends meet, and even in the very best of times it was practically impossible to make 5 per cent. on their money.  For the last two years they have been working at an absolute loss, and, therefore, I consider this arrangement a very serious hardship, indeed, on that class of persons, and it makes one more straw on the camel's back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JACKSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to support Sir John Keane.  I am aware of a great many houses of various ratings that are untenanted, and the first thing to be taken into account is the incidence of rating.  It is a great pity that those should remain unoccupied and deteriorate so much in value.  As a rule it is the land adjoining the houses that is valued, and the house is taken as thrown in.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the motion.  Even granting that it would be administratively easier to carry it out as it is now, this is a most inopportune time to introduce an amendment of the kind that is provided in this Section of the Bill, because it is a discouragement to the taking up and using of the older houses.  For national and other reasons every kind of facility should be given to the taking up of those larger houses, many of which are at present unoccupied.  Senator Sir <Col N="789" /> John Keane laid emphasis on the words &mdash;&ldquo;whole cost of repairs.&rdquo;  I should like to lay emphasis on the reference to the letting of the whole of the property. Many of the large houses can be taken, and separated, or partially let, or divided between two persons, and I think it is a mistake to discourage that by the provision which is in the section if I understand it correctly. Unless an owner has let the whole of the property, and undertaken to bear the repairs of the whole of the property, he can get no allowance.  It seems to me if one-half were taken, and he bore the repairs on that one-half, he should be entitled to an allowance, but under this section that is denied. I am in some difficulty with regard to this question, inasmuch as while I would like to support the recommendation, I would at the same time have liked to send an alternative recommendation, so that, if you could not get the whole of it, you might at least have some amendment on the lines suggested. I think the wisest thing for the Seanad to do is to make its position clear and support the amendment of Senator Sir John Keane.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear on this.  There is one particular aspect of it that I am interested in.  I think that an allowance certainly ought to be made to the persons for the houses in which they reside.  I have in mind in the City of Dublin that you will have in the very near future thousands of owners of small dwellings who will have these houses on the purchase system. They will be the lessors of the house, and I think that it would be unfair if these people were compelled to pay income tax on their valuation and not get an allowance for repairs.  Apart from that, I think that persons ought to get an allowance for repairs to the houses in which they reside, so that the argument put forward that the letting value of houses is far in excess of the valuation of the houses does not apply. I think this ought to be allowed, certainly in respect of houses in which the owners reside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardButler" hpid="Mr. BUTLER Mr. BUTLER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BUTLER</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the recommendation of Senator Sir John Keane, not so much from the point of <Col N="790" /> view of the larger houses but from that of the farmers' houses.  Farmers generally reside in these houses, that is, they are very seldom let.  At present farmers who own their own houses are getting an allowance for repairs, but if this section of the Bill passes they will lose that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the last two points first.  In the first place farmers' houses are not affected by this section, and in the second place, even though, as I hope, there will be a great many owners of small houses, it would be a fair question to put: where did they get them.  On examination of the Public Accounts it will be discovered that they were provided very considerably from subsidies given by the Government.  The question arises: where did the Government get the money?  If you deprive us of the means of getting this money I am afraid that the date on which the small owners will commence to flourish will be postponed indefinitely, and then there is the question of how far it is possible to get in sufficient money to enable the revenue of the State to meet the expenditure.  In this particular case there will be some hardship, there will be problematical or nominal hardship, by reason of the fact that owners of property, even under this particular clause, may not be so favourably situated as they were.  But the facts are that in the overwhelming majority of cases the poor law valuation upon which income tax is charged is considerably less than the actual rental that is paid for any of these properties. In fact most rentals are nowadays what we at one time called rack-rents.  I think it was two-thirds where the rental was once and a half of the valuation, and that was looked upon as rack-rent. In quite a large number of cases it will be found, not alone in the country but more particularly in the city, that the valuation bears no relation whatever to the actual rent that is charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The valuations of houses were assessed somewhere on an average of about 50 or 60 years ago, and they were assessed upon the then value.  Although money has changed its relation <Col N="791" /> compared with the actual value of that period, altogether the rents have increased, but the poor law valuation has remained unchanged.  You could except such cases as, say, the city of Dublin, the city of Belfast, and, possibly, in a short time, the city of Waterford. where re-valuations have taken place, but even the last re-valuation in the city of Dublin took place somewhere about the year 1915 or 1916.  I think it was 1916, and in those cases where the low valuation has occurred alterations in the assessment in respect of Income Tax did not come into operation.  They may come in this year, that is, many years after it has been re-valued.  The case for re-valuation goes by the board at once, because demands on the Valuation Office, by reason of the occurrences of the last few years, are such that we will probably reach the year 1927 before the Valuation Office will have kept pace with the ordinary demands coming in for re-valuation from the country. A particular clause in the Finance Bill was introduced last year to enable us to dispense with certain statutory obligations on the Valuation Office to re-value certain property.</P>
    <P>In the majority of the cases that have come before me the relation of the valuation to the rental is about 40 per cent.  A house for which one would pay £100 a year in the city of Dublin will rarely be found to have a valuation of £40 a year.  I think that those who live in the city will bear me out in that. As a matter of fact, it might be only £30 a year.  In the country the cases in which the vast majority of people are interested, farm houses, certainly do not come within this measure.  Then there is but the one class left, and it may be that there is a case in respect of that.  But one can scarcely legislate for a very small number, and I think that if cases of hardship during this year were put to the Minister for Finance who, I know, is very keenly interested in retaining the particular order who inhabit these houses, he would probably consider them.  I think there is evidence of that in another part of the Finance Bill where Super Tax has been reduced from a certain figure, and there has been a considerable <Col N="792" /> response even to that measure of relief.  I do not subscribe to the theory that has been put forward that a man with a certain income is sufficiently well off to enable him to pay taxes to an unlimited extent.  I think people like that perform very useful and very important functions in the State, and the Minister for Finance, in giving the particular relief that there was in that case, had in his mind the particular imposition that he would be putting on, and balancing the two together, he came to the decision that they had the better part of the bargain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. GUINNESS Mr. GUINNESS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>The President said that the farmers were outside the Clause.  As a farmer I would like to ask him has a farmer ever been defined. What is a farmer, and what is a farmer's house?  Because he went on in the later part of his speech to speak of another class of people, to whom Sir John Keane referred, that unfortunately have large houses and are subject to the operations of this particular clause.  But where can a line be drawn, because a great number of these people who had large houses also had large farming interests?  Could they be considered as farmers in the sense that they would be outside the application of this Clause?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the President was quite correct when he said that no farmers' houses will be covered by this section.  It operates in cases of assessment upon any house or building except a farmhouse or a building included with the lands in the assessment.  I think if the President were to consult his advisers he would be told that a very large number of farmhouses are not included with lands, but are valued separately from the lands.  Certainly any farm bought in recent years will be valued separately from the lands, and to these houses this section will apply.  Possibly in the case of the very much smaller farms this section would not operate, but these are not liable for income tax at all.  I do hope that the House will not be drawn aside by the argument of the President&mdash;I hope I am not <Col N="793" /> misinterpreting him&mdash;that it will really only be a hardship on a rather small minority who live in biggish houses, and that you cannot legislate for everybody. I do submit that that is hardly a fair way of putting it.  I would stress more the fact that those people who live in these big houses are sometimes almost prisoners in them; they have got no capital; they cannot get away, and they cannot sell their houses.  They are really very much to be pitied.  But it is not on that ground at all.  It is far more on the grounds put up by Senator Farren, that small owners who buy their houses, say, on the instalment system through a building society, are now to be assessed on the full value, whereas they have hitherto been allowed a reduction for repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know how expensive these repairs are.  I do not think that the delay in re-valuation ought to justify this if only a limited measure of hardship be involved.  The President stressed the city of Dublin.  Probably if you were to look into all the rates of the city of Dublin, being a metropolis, they are considerably higher than elsewhere. I think if you will take some of the houses in the smaller country towns or villages you will find a great disparity between the letting value and the valuation, especially houses that have been recently built.  I would like very much if the President would say how the Minister for Finance is going to give an administrative concession, because that is what he indicated, to certain property owners after this Bill passes.  We know that the power of the Executive is very great, but I do not see how they are going to get over a specific enactment, and I am afraid it will be impossible. The Revenue Commissioners will have to work under the statute.  The Minister for Finance will be very nice to them as he always is but when you ask him to do something he will say: &ldquo;I am sorry, there is the statute and I have got no discretion.&rdquo; I do not therefore get much comfort on the suggestion tentatively put forward by the President.  I hope the Seanad will accept this recommendation and I hope the Dáil will also reconsider the clause and that the whole question may be <Col N="794" /> dealt with in a much more scientific and fairer basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>We are speaking about persons who own their own dwellings, people who are fortunate enough to have houses built for them by the municipality, but there are, to my own personal knowledge, many hundreds of poor people in the city who have struggled to buy houses for themselves.  I know of more than one case where people living in these houses are under heavier obligations than they were when they were paying rent to a landlord because they had to go to a bank and get a loan of some capital sum to purchase a house.  They have got to pay interest on that and rates and taxes as well and these charges have made their commitments larger than they were when they were paying rent for the house.  In addition they have to provide for the upkeep and repair of the house.  I think there is a clear case for people living in such dwellings, that they should get a remission of one-sixth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the President was under a misapprehension when he thought that it was largely the case of those who were paying or likely to pay super tax that would be affected. I would not like it to be thought that the Seanad was making this recommendation in the interests of any particular section or class, either poor or rich.  I think it is rather that in the interests of the State people should be encouraged to buy their own houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I am a farmer pure and simple.  I live in a house which is not on a demesne, and yet it is assessed at £20 or £25 a year; the assessment is there although I have no income.  I may say that I suffered a loss on the lands for two years, and I applied for a rebate, but I could get no reply to the letters.  I have had a big form to fill as regards super tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite unable to understand why the circumstances should be different in the case of a person who rents a house and the owner who pays for the upkeep.  He has got certain privileges but if the tenant <Col N="795" /> buys the house he has to keep the premises just the same, and he is put in a worse position than the person who owned it and let it to him.  That is a thing I cannot understand.  A great many people have been forced to buy their houses whether they liked it or not and at once they were put in a worse position than they were before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NESBITT</NameTxt>
      <P>An aspect of the case which I do not think has been touched upon up to the present is the consequential effect that failure to allow this remission will have on general appearances. I speak for the City of Dublin. I do not think anybody can say that the City of Dublin is noted for the amount of money expended on the houses.  I think the appearance of the streets is shabby, both in the suburbs and main streets, compared with the British cities, and if this allowance is not made to the class of people referred to I am afraid that the repairs and decorations necessary will not take place and therefore there will be a loss of labour which is so badly wanted at the present time, and that the houses will not get the repairs which are sufficient to keep them in good order and condition.</P>

      <P>In connection with Section 6, I wish to say I am in the position of trustee for a certain person for various small sums of money, and I think there seems to be differential treatment in regard to charges for Income Tax.  In some cases I found 9/6 deducted which, to some people, is practically their whole income, and in other cases only 7/3 and 5/-.  I think I am correct in saying that there are some securities under which there should be no differential treatment, and I wonder will the time ever come when a poor person will know what he will have to pay.</P>

As I said on Second Reading, where we have just undergone a change in our administrative system, it is difficult to arrange everything at once.  There is the question of Colonial Income Tax and Dominion Income Tax, and they are all involved in this.  The real way to settle the question is for the two Governments themselves to come to an arrangement.  It is not a matter that we can settle.  It is a matter for both Governments, and I suggest to the President that the sooner he can come to an understanding with the British Treasury the better both for the Government and for the peace of this country as well.  It is a very great hardship for people to have to pay this double income tax and then to have to wait a very long time and to fill up a series of forms or to pay other people to fill them up, for that is what it comes to, in the endeavour to try to get some of this excess taxation back.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the recommendation in Section 23, sub-section (1), to delete in line 38 the words &ldquo;fifteenth day of July&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;1st day of September.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this recommendation, I might point out that Section 23 of the Finance Bill imposes the new duty on Customs Entry Forms known as the &ldquo;Statistical Tax.&rdquo;  This tax is being imposed, not for Revenue purposes, but in order to curtail the present traffic in small consignments across our land and sea frontiers, and to encourage importation in large quantities with a view to developing a retail distributing trade in the Saorstát.  The tax is to take the form of a 6d. fee in respect of each item of imported merchandise shown on the Customs Entry Form. The object of the present amendment is to postpone the date of operation of the tax from 16th July, 1924, to 1st September, 1924.  The date&mdash;16th July 1924&mdash;was originally inserted because it was necessary to present the Financial Resolution imposing the tax in a complete form, but it was never expected that it would be possible to bring the tax into operation at so early a date.  The tax is to be denoted by means of adhesive stamps on Customs entry forms, and for this purpose it has been necessary to provide a special stamp.  The work of cutting the dies, printing the stamps, and arranging for distribution throughout the Saorstát is a lengthy process and cannot be complete much before the 1st September next.  It is accordingly proposed that the 1st September should be made the operative date.  The postponement will give traders a further breathing space in which to accommodate themselves to <Col N="799" /> the new arrangement.  As already explained, the tax is not imposed for Revenue purposes, and the postponement will not affect the estimate of Revenue receipts.</P>

      <P>I gave notice to the Minister last week of a question about the Estimates.  I find that in the Estimates for 1923-24 there is no reference whatever to land annuities.  On looking at the Estimates for 1924-25 it is stated, in the column allotted for 1923-24, that there was £2,900,000 expended. When I look at this year's Estimates, 1924-25, nothing at all is expended under that head.  The result is that these figures are put down as showing that the country is better off by £2,900,000 than it was last year.  It is quite clear that the land purchase annuities were recovered last year and <Col N="800" /> paid over to the English Government. I cannot see how the country is better off by £2,900,000 than it was last year.</P>

      <P>On the motion that the Bill be now passed, as this is the first Bill the Minister has dealt with in the Seanad, I would like briefly to express the appreciation of Senators on these benches, and I think of the Seanad generally, of the manner in which the Minister has treated this Bill, and particularly the way in which he has endeavoured to meet the suggestions put forward from various quarters. Even in cases where the Minister did not see his way to accept suggestions he did so in such a nice way that one felt it was almost unreasonable to ask him to do so.  The Bill leaves the Seanad with comparatively few amendments, but I think it has been amended <Col N="802" /> for the better.  Of course, it would have been better if all the amendments put forward from these benches were accepted.  Perhaps that would be too much to ask.  It would be too sudden to become so progressive as to fall in with our line of policy.  Taken with the Courts of Justice Act, and the Land Act, I think the Railways Bill can be looked upon as one of the three great measures of a more or less progressive character that have been put through the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In this particular measure private enterprise is given a chance under exceedingly favourable circumstances to justify its existence in controlling a great public service.  Nobody will be better pleased than I will if it succeeds. But if it does not succeed I am confident that there is only one other step to be taken, and when that step is taken, Senator Sir John Keane will be found to support it, because I believe that he is not nearly so non-progressive as he pretends.  Notwithstanding his repeated declaration against nationalisation I feel that inwardly there are promptings that convince him that that is the only right step, and I believe that these repeated statements of his are merely assurances to himself that he has not changed.  I believe that this Bill is a good Bill, as good a Bill as it could be made.  I hope it will be a success.  We congratulate the Minister on the unexampled tact and ability he has displayed in piloting this measure through both Houses.</P>

I am very glad that Senator O'Farrell raised the point, because as we have been passing Bills at such a rapid rate there was the danger that it would have passed through without our saying anything at all about this.  I congratulate him on his manner in getting through an extremely complicated Bill.  He knew what he was talking about from top to bottom.  All the provisions of the Bill were elucidated by him, and nothing could exceed the good temper in which the whole Bill was passed through the <Col N="803" /> Seanad.  I think the Benches opposite have shown that they appreciate this Bill, and consider it a good Bill. Whether it is going to bring about perfect peace in our railway world or not I cannot say.  But I hope it is to be a step in that direction.  I quite agree with Senator O'Farrell that private enterprise has now a great opportunity of showing what it can do.  If it will not succeed in pleasing everybody it certainly will succeed in pleasing a good many people in the long run if it gives as efficient and cheap a service as possible.  I think we have done a good day's work in passing this Bill.</P>

I think the Government deserve credit <Col N="804" /> in trying to get over a very difficult question.

Senator Douglas made a suggestion to me to-day which occurred to myself previously.

A Bill has been introduced into the Dáil, not a very comprehensive measure, and that appears to be abandoned. We appear to be drifting with regard to the retention of these local bodies.  They are a long way now beyond their time, and, as the Seanad knows, they were elected under peculiar circumstances.  Some hold that they are not the right people to administer local affairs.  The country is anxious that you should have a new lot of men to administer local affairs. I want to know what is the policy of the Government and whether they would give a definite date when these elections will take place, and whether they will take place under the present Acts or under any new Bill, or under a Bill that we have already seen introduced. We are very much in the dark on the whole question.  It is a matter of great anxiety to the farmers.

      <P>If that is the only question, I could give the Seanad some information.  The Senators may possibly have other matters to raise.  I must, of course, explain that the present Minister for Local Government has been taken suddenly ill and is at the moment in hospital through a breakdown owing to pressure of work in his Department.  This Bill is quite a simple one.  It proposes to extend the date from the present limit, the 30th September, 1924, until the 31st March, 1925, as the last date to which elections may be postponed.  That date by no means implies that such a day will actually be the date on which the elections will be decided.  It simply gives power to postpone the elections until the 31st March, 1925, as the latest possible date to which they could be postponed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The postponement is due to one reason, that is the matter of finance.  A Bill has been introduced into the Dáil which, if passed in its present form, <Col N="806" /> will effect great changes in Local Government administration.  The Bill was found to be very contentious, and it was put to the Minister and the Government that the whole question deserved greater consideration, and more detailed examination than would have been possible if the Bill had been pressed forward.  The Bill was pressed forward because the elections were due. If the provisions of the Bill prove acceptable to the Dáil and Seanad you would have this position, that local elections would take place at great cost. If this new measure came into operation those councils would have been dissolved within a month, and the money expended on the elections would have been lost.  The sum of money is very heavy, and it was thought better in the circumstances, as the provisions of the Bill had to be further examined, to introduce this measure allowing for further postponement until the Bill now before the Dáil, and deferred for some time, should have some little consideration. That Bill has been held up for fuller consideration over the summer, and the policy of the Government cannot be definitely stated, because the fate of the measure is in the balance. The Government's intention is shown by the measure.  It seeks to abolish certain local authorities, and to that extent would avoid the necessity for certain elections.  If the Seanad wishes to have the Government attitude defined with regard to the staleness of the local authorities at the moment, there can be no two opinions about that.  These authorities were elected under peculiar circumstances, and as a result of various circumstances which have ceased to operate, there have been great cries from the farming community and the country generally that those bodies are no longer representative, and should be changed as far as personnel are concerned.  The Government are at one with the country on that, but they put it to the Dáil and to the Seanad that it is not wise to refrain from postponing the date for the election further.  If that date be not postponed the elections will have to take place.  They will take a large sum of money, and if the Bill is passed afterward the particular authority will disappear.  It is a definite measure <Col N="807" /> brought about by the peculiar circumstances that the Local Government Bill had to be postponed because it was considered of such weight and importance that further consideration was necessary.  The motive behind this is a financial one of saving money.</P>

      <P>No, the report of the Commission is the method settled upon to give better consideration to the terms of the Local Government Bill. If the Commission report in favour of the continuance of the present system, then, at any rate, the present Bill will have to be withdrawn.  If the Commission reports in favour of the proposals contained in the Bill, that Bill will be passed.  If they report otherwise, certain changes will have to be made in the measure.  The fate of Local Government will depend to a large extent on the report of the Commission.  It is definitely secured as far as any human event can be, that that Commission will have reported in time to have legislative measures brought in either to preclude the elections to those bodies or to allow elections to be held before March, 1925.  The sum of money involved in the holding of the elections is £65,000. It is thought, even at the undoubted risk of keeping in those people who are not representative, that it is better to prevent the expenditure of this money to no purpose.</P>

      <P>I think neither the Minister for Industry and Commerce nor myself would be in a position to answer for the Minister for Local Government as far as that is concerned, that is as to whether there would be a larger Commission, or whether there would be a Commission at all.  The Minister for Local Government is an extern Minister, and during his indefinite absence owing to illness we are not in a position to state whether he intends to set up a Commission of the kind I outlined myself in the Dáil a month or six weeks ago.  I do not know whether he adopted the idea at all of having a Commission.  I suggested it to him, but my own activities have been sufficient to absorb my entire attention, and I have not had time to consult him on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a protest against this Bill because of the exceedingly sweeping character of its provisions.  In the first place I fail to see why it has been extended to the 28th June, 1922.  I think it should have terminated in the period coinciding with the Truce, seeing that another Indemnity Bill would have to be introduced covering the whole of the period up to the present time.  This Bill proceeds to indemnify or actually to make valid every act, matter, or thing done by any person who could claim to have been acting under the authority of the First or Second Dáil, unless it can be proved that he did such act, matter, or thing in bad faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had Public Safety Acts passed under which a man had to prove that he was innocent before he was released. Nobody had to prove him guilty, but there was an assumption that he was guilty of something, and he had to <Col N="809" /> prove that he was innocent before he was let free.  Under this it would have to be proved that any deed, no matter how atrocious it was, was done in bad faith in order that the guilty person would be punished.  We know that the moral conscience of the world was aroused because of the atrocities of the Black and Tans.  In connection with the British Labour Party campaign many of us tramped Great Britain to try to arouse the conscience of the British people because of these atrocities, and I think that that movement was a great success.  It was these atrocities that aroused the indignation of the world. An Indemnity Act was passed in the Oireachtas to indemnify people on the other side, and there was no other alternative. That dated up to the 11th July, 1921.  From that period there was no such excuse&mdash;there cannot be an excuse for atrocities&mdash;as might have obtained when passions were high, and blood was hot, as before the Truce. This seeks to indemnify people for acts committed since then.</P>
    <P>We know that there were many acts of rapine and slaughter committed during that time that were absolutely unjustifiable, and that people imagined simply because they were employed in a more or less irregular way by the State that was a justification for things which would not be tolerated in any civilised country.  This Bill proposes not only to say that these people were wrong in doing that but to forgive them.  It really says that these are legal deeds, carried out in the ordinary way.  I do not think that any legislature should be responsible for an Act so sweeping as that.  In its present form it would be impracticable to amend it to bring it into conformity with civilised practices, but I certainly would not like it to pass without some protest.  During that period there were people who were partly in the Army, such as it was, and partly out of the Army, but in other respects they claimed to be acting in an official capacity, and they committed atrocities, deeds of the vilest kind, on the ground of politics, of previous sympathies and of religious persuasion, things that no Government or no State could justify.  This Bill seeks to prevent <Col N="810" /> these people from being brought to justice unless it can be proved that they did these things in bad faith, and I believe that that is impossible in this country at present.</P>
    <P>I do not think they should be put outside the pale of justice.  It may not be possible to bring them to justice just now, but one of the great powers of the law is that it has a very long arm, and no matter how long a crime goes a person can eventually be caught and brought to justice.  We should not, by passing this Bill in its present form, render that wholly impossible.  Many people entered the Army for ulterior purposes, for purposes of acting against the State, and while they were in the Army they committed acts of violence against the State, although nominally they were in the service of the State. This Bill will prevent those people from being brought to justice, whether now or in the future.  I think that it is not in the interests of the State and in the interests of law and order that some of these notorious crimes should go unpunished for all time, as they will do if this Bill passes in its present form.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologised in the Dáil for the delay in introducing this measure.  Measures like this are in the order of things usually introduced after a period of disturbance, and usually Governments ask for fairly large absolutions for the acts of their servants during periods of disturbance when peace has been restored.  I should have preferred very much to introduce a measure which would wipe out from the point of view of the Government, the point of view of the law, the point of view of every person in the State, these acts which have been referred to by Senator O'Farrell.  But during the course of the time that this measure has been under discussion no particular case, no list of crimes such as has been suggested by the Senator, or in the other House by persons who oppose this measure, has been produced to me in which a case might be made for reserving absolution for the offences so committed.  It is all very fine to get <Col N="811" /> up here with a fine gesture of virtue and say: &ldquo;We are not going to stand over that.&rdquo; I say, a Chathaoirligh, that it is impossible for any Government in the situation in which we are placed to put into two sections a list of those offences that we are going to pardon, and a list of those offences which we are not going to pardon; that in the case of the disturbances such as we have gone through Senators, or members of the Dáil, or outsiders cannot of themselves really and justly say: &ldquo;This was an atrocious crime, and that was something that should be forgiven.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I know just as well as anybody that these things are not confined to the disturbances that have taken place here; in the continental fighting in the recent war I heard many atrocious stories of events that happened.  These are inseparable from war, and those who bring about war ought to consider that before they enter into that particular sphere of activity.  But in this case, here are quite a number of men acting under orders during a period of disturbance when decrees did not get that careful and exhaustive consideration that they get here now, acting under orders, doing certain things, from the commandeering of a box of matches to houses or motor cars.  We have found that persons acting under these orders have been prosecuted in the courts for the return of property into the possession of which they entered, but the actual possession of which they never enjoyed.  Men who have not taken part on one side or the other, certain people who affected a neutrality that does them a good deal of credit from one angle, and relieves them of any great responsibility from another, have been prosecuted in the last two years for the return of a bicycle or a motor car, or something else in certain cases.  They have come to us and said: &ldquo;Is this the treatment we are to receive, and is the arm of the Government not strong enough to preserve us from these things?&rdquo; Poor men have been dragged into court, and decrees have been given against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> I am informed that latterly the Library, what you might call the impedimenta of the law, was full of writs, and actions are pending in connection with these cases.  We cannot cover every particular case.  We have not heard of them all, we are not expecting to hear of them all, and we are not likely to hear of them all within the next five or ten years.  In cases that we are hearing of, and that we are settling, one of the complaints that was made in the other House regarding claims against the Government, was that we did not settle them quickly enough, and we did not give enough money. I could produce a stack of anonymous communications that have come to me saying that we have spent money in places where we should not have spent it.  Only this week I have heard of the case of a man who had a claim against us for £40 or £50, and was advised to put in about ten times that amount on the ground that he would get a little over the mark, and as he had an elastic conscience he took the advice.  There are cases in which, even with this Bill, we can prosecute, and when we are talking about prosecutions we ought to consider the amount of assistance the Government gets in preparing prosecutions. We have men at present that we know, that we are convinced, could take our oaths on the Bible or on our prayer-books that they are guilty, but it cannot be proved, and it is not fair or just in the circumstances through which we have passed, for people to get up and say: &ldquo;You allow A to go scot-free, and you prosecute B with all the rigour, all the authority, and all the resources of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The facts are that a great many of our own soldiers have been brought into court, prosecuted and found guilty and are serving terms of imprisonment, while there are other ruffians much more guilty than they are, who are walking around and against whom we cannot get sufficient evidence.  In every case I know of where evidence is forthcoming, we have prosecuted our own soldiers who, although they faced the danger in the hour when they were wanted, may have had lapses; there are others walking around with many lapses to their credit, but it is almost <Col N="813" /> impossible to get sufficient evidence to support a prosecution.  This is a generous measure, but you cannot be too generous in some of these cases, because if you lacked generosity the innocent may suffer, and I would prefer to see a number of persons going free who should be prosecuted rather than to see a small number of innocent persons convicted, when the real guilt did not lie to their door at all.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask why the telephones have got a capital account that no other Government service apparently enjoys.  I take this opportunity to raise the question of the whole method of scientific Government accounting.  There is no reason why the telephone service alone should have a capital account.  The argument probably is that telephone expenditure is reproductive and as such justifies borrowing, but it is not the only expenditure that could be called reproductive. Any expenditure on machinery or plant of a labour-saving character which would enable working expenses to be reduced would be also reproductive. Similarly any expenditure of a non-recurrent character, the benefit of which will be felt for a long period of years, would be also reproductive and should be in a capital account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was one of the recommendations of the Samuels Committee which dealt with this whole question of public accounting&mdash;a recommendation that a clear distinction should be made in Government accounting between recurrent and non-recurrent expenditure, and that the Government was justified in borrowing for non-recurrent expenditure. I do suggest to the Government, that with the heavy taxation we have now placed on us, it would be sound finance to separate their accounts <Col N="814" /> into recurrent and non-recurrent expenditure, to borrow for non-recurrent expenditure and, according to the nature of the expenditure, obtain a loan for a longer or shorter period.  I am afraid the Seanad is getting rather tired of this subject because I brought it before them on a previous occasion and they passed a resolution that the whole question of Government accounting should be inquired into.  I take this opportunity of pressing upon the Government, and I hope the Seanad will support me, the vital necessity of placing their accounts on a scientific basis so that we can examine administration from a businesslike point of view and get finance more or less analogous to a commercial enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have a better opportunity on the Appropriation Bill of entering into this matter, but the facts are that this particular Telephone Capital Account is one of our inheritances.  It was a system that must have been in operation when the British Government had control of the Post Office; I am not quite sure and I make that statement subject to correction. In any case it really comes to this now, that the alternative method would be to place the whole of the cost of extensions on the Post Office Vote for a particular year.  If Senator Sir John Keane had been a member of the Dublin Corporation as long as I was he would appreciate to some extent the financial difficulty of this particular method of dealing with Post Office extension as far as telephones are concerned. Once you placed telephones in a sort of hotch-potch with telegraphs and postal facilities, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would have innumerable applications from all parts of the country for the extension of the telephone with the usual commendation that &ldquo;it is bound to improve business.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present instance he is not in a position to justify the expenditure of capital unless he can get a certain income from the extensions which will enable him to pay for whatever capital moneys have to be expended in order to justify that particular sphere <Col N="815" /> of expenditure.  Bearing in mind that the Post Office is not a remunerative business proposition, that it entails costs on the State, it would be very much better that any extensions of the telephone system should be self-supporting. If the capital system be withdrawn, then it goes entirely on a different basis.  It is nobody's business as it were, but whereas I have heard the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs say in the Dáil he would give an extension if it were found to be an economic proposition, in such circumstances I am prepared to consider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry to rise again, but I was hoping that somebody else might speak on this matter. I should like to ask one or two things about this Bill.  The first point is why the banks cannot do this business. I suppose there must be certain risks involved that the banks do not care to take, and the Minister must stand behind the banks.  We have got a distinguished banker here and he may be able to enlighten us on this question.  If money is wanted for business purposes, and presumably the Minister is not going to guarantee anything unless it can show a good prospect of succeeding, why cannot the banks give this money?  There is a lot of money locked up in investments in the banks, and I am sure the banks, from the little I know of them, are only too anxious to lend.  They live on lending, and in fact if they did not lend they could not live.  It puzzles me that <Col N="816" /> the banks cannot underwrite this or what class of risks the Government underwrite that the banks would not. Then again I would like to know what form of security the Government are going to take.  Presumably they are going to take a security that would not be entirely satisfactory to the banks.  Otherwise why do they come into it at all?</P>
      <P>Then, with regard to Section 1, a rather curious form of wording occurs. &ldquo;This guarantee is to apply in connection with the carrying out of any capital undertaking or in connection with the purchase of articles manufactured or produced in the Saorstát and required for the purpose of such undertaking.&rdquo; So that the alternative would appear not to be an alternative at all, for really if the capital is to be applied in carrying out an undertaking, presumably that comprises the articles required for the undertaking. I am not quite clear that that word &ldquo;or&rdquo; really suggests a distinct alternative. The second condition is comprised within the first, so far as I can see.  Or is it intended that all the articles used in this manufacture must be of Irish manufacture?  Of course, that is absolutely impossible.  For any form of creamery enterprise, for example, the machinery is not made in this country and you could not expect to get it. You may buy it from someone who has an establishment in the country, but he is only a factor, and the machinery has been imported from outside the country.  I do not know what the Government has in mind by that somewhat ambiguous alternative.  There is one other point.  I notice that the expression &ldquo;working capital,&rdquo; perhaps wisely, is not defined.  It says that no loan is to be guaranteed for the purpose of working capital, and when I look at the definition clause, being interested in this particular question, to see how working capital is defined, I find it is omitted.  I suppose it rests with the Minister in his wisdom to decide what working capital is, and I think he will find it a pretty elastic term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. GUINNESS Mr. GUINNESS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Sir John Keane as to why these enterprises are not financed by banks, <Col N="817" /> anyone with an elementary knowledge of banking can answer that question. Banks are not in existence for the purpose of lending money for long periods for enterprises of this description.  If a railway has to be built or a canal to be made, or a waterworks to be made, or other works of that description, the money is not provided for them by banks.  It is provided by the public, and unless the enterprise itself has something inherent in it, that will attract public money to it, then this system which was introduced not so very long ago in England in the Trades Facilities Act comes in to give such enterprise that security which will encourage and enable people to come in with their money.  But as all these loans are for long periods for 20 or 30 years, as Sir John Keane knows, it is not the function of banks to lend money for such periods.  Banks lend on security for comparatively short periods, and they do not finance capital expenditure of that description. There is one thing I would like to put to the Minister, and it is this, the total amount mentioned in the Bill to be provided is £750,000.  That, I may take it, is a mere drop in the ocean if anything is to be done.  In England something like £110,000,000 has been issued. I presume the amount mentioned in this Bill is a first step and that the Government are quite prepared if suitable enterprises come forward to enlarge these figures and powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. GUINNESS Mr. GUINNESS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from that that at the expiration of the year the guarantee for £750,000 would lapse.  If it lapses at the end of the year it would be perfectly useless from the borrowing point of view.  In another section of the Bill it would appear that the Government is actually coming into competition with banks and other lending bodies where they are actually providing the money themselves.  That is a totally different proposition and it is, I think, somewhat questionable whether <Col N="818" /> it would be an advisable thing for any Government to come forward and advance public money for what is nothing else than competition in trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this Trades Loans Guarantee Bill because I think the Ministry has taken an extremely wise step in introducing this Bill.  I agree with Senator Guinness that as regards the amount mentioned it is only a drop in the bucket, but it is better to have that drop than nothing at all.  Prior to the introduction of this Bill, I think I am correct in stating that both in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain an Act of a similar character was in operation, and that industries there could be assisted in the manner proposed in this Bill while in the Free State no such facilities could be given.  If such assistance was necessary in England it is doubly and trebly necessary, particularly under present conditions, in the Free State.  I was rather interested to hear from Sir John Keane that banks live by lending, because if he would undertake to start a bank I should be glad to borrow from it.  My point really is that banks cannot go on lending unless at the same time there is sufficient money put into these banks to enable them to function. There seems to be an idea that banks could keep on providing money in the country if their deposits were to be reduced.  I agree with Senator Guinness, and it is really obvious that banks cannot exist by lending money for long periods and that if, as I am afraid is frequently the case, small industries are started on the strength more or less of securing loans from banks, expiring at the end of four or five years, and they find at the end of that period that they cannot pay, the result is that the banks have to take legal steps to enforce their proper rights for the repayment of the loans and you have failure in business.  I do not think you could possibly build up industries in the Free State on that basis, and if this Bill does anything to enable money to be made available for industry over a long period it will have achieved a great deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point I would like the Minister to deal with, and it is this. £750,000 is admittedly a small sum.  It <Col N="819" /> seems to me, under this Bill, no distinction is made as to whether the State guarantees the capital or only the interest. If the whole of that £750,000 is to be a guarantee as capital, I admit you could not possibly go any further, but if you are only guaranteeing the interest on even half that sum you could go to a much larger sum.  I would like to see the Act amended, if the Government only guarantees the interest to be paid on the capital, so as to enable them to give a larger sum than £750,000, because the State is only subject itself to a comparatively small liability if it only guarantees the interest. There will be cases where the whole capital will have to be guaranteed, but there will be many other cases where only the interest will be guaranteed and where the public put up the money, and if so, I would like to see the Advisory Committee placed in a better position than it is under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the remarks of Senators Guinness and Douglas, I agree that for fixed capital expenditure banks cannot be expected to finance it.  Already, rightly or wrongly, banks finance a large amount of retail distributive business.  A large number of the co-operative societies are financed by banks.  As to the reduction of retail prices, even the title of the Bill shows that it is not by any means to be a long term measure.  I hope Senator Douglas did not think my suggestion was that banks live solely by lending.  Lending is an advantage, just as you live by eating, drinking and sleeping.  I say that lending is a direct advantage to the banks themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane opened his remarks with a question, why the banks cannot lend this money.  I think that rather implies something amounting to slander on people's respectability, or something in that way.  If he had out it, why the banks will not lend, he would be simply echoing a groan that I emitted for the last few months when schemes came before me, and when I referred the people who presented them to me&mdash;essentially sound schemes&mdash;to the banks.  I asked them why they could not go to the banks.  I rather think that the effect of the Trades Facilities Act in England and in Northern Ireland, and pretty well in every country, where the problem of unemployment has to be faced, seems to me to imply a certain criticism of banking institutions all over the world; that they cannot adapt themselves to the circumstances of the present day.  The fact of the matter is, whether that criticism be applied rightly or not, that every government in the world is faced at this time with the question of unemployment, and the main plank of every party in every state has been to rely upon something in the nature of a Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act and a Trades Facilities Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill of ours is not by any means new.  With one exception&mdash;Section 2 &mdash;it is pretty well a copy of the British Act.  Section 2 is, I think, totally new, and is certainly not in any Trades Facilities Act so far.  It is the answer, in so far as the Government have been able to find an answer, to the repeated claims that have been brought forward for an anti-profiteering Bill.  The question was considered, and it was discovered that the control set up during the war had only led to the establishment of rings which cut out competition. Apparently the only way to break rings is to increase competition. This Bill aims at that.  It is an experiment that we are going to watch with close attention.  Although a certain small sum is set down for the purpose of Section 2, I may mention that <Col N="821" /> the Minister for Finance has been so far prevailed upon as to give me an assurance that if the working of that section is successful, other moneys will be advanced under it.  It has been pretty well decided that of the different projects brought forward to revive and create industry in this country, these Trade Facilities, or Trade Loans (Guaranteed) Acts are a better remedy and a better answer to the problem of unemployment than fiscal adjustments.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane raised a few technical points which I may as well advert to.  He said that the Ministry was not going to guarantee unless the project showed good hopes of success. The Ministry is carefully protected in this Bill from guaranteeing until an Advisory Committee has considered the project and passed it.  I may say&mdash;and this is a point that was raised in the Dáil that I can make clear here&mdash;that the recommendation of the Advisory Committee is not going to be accepted automatically. It is purely an Advisory Committee.  It has been thought advisable in all countries, and here, to remove the supervising machinery under the Bill outside the Department. We thought it better to get an Advisory Committee of a certain expert type of people, and when they come along to the Department, their recommendation will naturally fortify a good claim.  I am sure Senator Sir John Keane was not intentionally misleading, but his remark might have a wrong effect.  Of course, the Ministers will be the final persons in deciding if the scheme is passed.  If it has run the gauntlet of severe criticism, and if it has successfully emerged from the Advisory Committee, it will come along to the two Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>As to the alternative in Section 1, I agree with the Senator that it does not seem to be much of an alternative, and that it is something pretty well comprised in the first one.  I think I may stress the intention.  The intention was to single out the question of Irish manufacture, but not bank on it completely. As the Senator has pointed out, there are many industries where it will be impossible to get things, such as machinery, in Ireland.  It has been <Col N="822" /> considered wise to stress that point. Where no alternative scheme comes up, which would have the effect of involving a larger sum than is allowed, then such a scheme will take precedence, whether or not the material is going to be manufactured in the country.  It stresses one point and that is not meant as a definitely complete alternative to the phrase quoted by Senator Sir John Keane.  Now the other point raised by him is, of course, the most delicate matter in the whole Bill.  I would avoid the responsibility, as I have avoided it, of defining &ldquo;working capital.&rdquo; I do not think in a House of business men I should be asked to define anything so elusive as working capital.  I think what might be considered capital expenditure in one scheme, might be accounted working capital in another.  I hope to leave it to the Advisory Committee to define this.  I hope to be able to pick out an expert body for that purpose.  I prefer to leave it to the Committee as to whether or not the expenditure concerned is to be considered capital expenditure or working capital.</P>
    <P>Now, Senator Guinness raised a point as to the amounts to be made available under the Bill.  Clause 1 provides for £750,000, and Clause 2 for £250,000 of which no more than £50,000 is to be paid out in actual loans.  That, as I have already stated, is definitely recognised as being a beginning and nothing more.  The Minister for Finance has guaranteed that if these schemes go well there will be no restriction in the way of money. There will be necessary restrictions in the way of how far we can get to guard ourselves, but within that limit there will be no undue holding up of schemes.  I am specially concerned with clause 2.  I look upon it as of a snowball character.  If one or two good schemes are to be started for the purpose of reducing the cost of commodities I believe it will have a big cumulative effect, and that the cost of living will be brought down with a run. A considerable amount of our trouble would then be passed.  The Trades Facilities Act in England, Senator Guinness has told us, has through its <Col N="823" /> operations expended £110,000,000 so far.  I accept that statement from him. One of the first acts of the Labour Government was to announce an extension of from 60 to 65 millions and in Northern Ireland whatever has been required under the same Act has been granted.</P>

      <P>It will depend upon the success of the schemes coming before the Advisory Committee and entertained under the provisions of this Bill.  A suggestion was made by Senator Douglas that an amendment might be accepted to allow the earmarking of a certain amount of money for guarantee, and a certain amount in the other way.  I would prefer not to have that and I hope the Senator would not consider it necessary in the light of what I have said that this is to be an experiment. If it is to be successful, there is going to be no further holding up of money.  Let the Bill develop as schemes come in.  It depends on what particular type of schemes comes along, whether they are the actual loans or the guaranteeing of interest.  I am afraid I cannot give a satisfactory answer to Senator Irwin with regard to financing this by the issue of Treasury notes.  I am afraid that if we were to delay the scheme until the experts in the matter decided questions of currency or the issue of Treasury notes, the earth's face would almost have crumbled before we could have any advance.  I believe very much in this Bill, and I am very pleased to find that the Seanad has so far approved of the measure because we are in a difficult position in this country.  I have alluded to this before but I think it is necessary to stress the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not exactly in the position in which other countries found themselves after the war when certain industries were destroyed owing to the destruction of wealth.  We are in that position, and, in addition, if we had all the industries that were ever in this country going at full blast, there would still be unemployment.  We have to create new industries, and we must get <Col N="824" /> the investing public here, and we must get the creators and directors of business enterprise.  There is much more than the lending and guaranteeing of money in this.  The pyschological effect is this: If a scheme is put up and passes this expert committee, and in addition is given security under the Bill, then it is a sign that it is a good scheme and the public will have confidence if it passes the barrier of criticism. Secondly, the scheme will have a reasonable chance of succeeding, because the Government would like it to succeed.  There is that at the back of the scheme as well as the material assistance which we hope to render under the Bill.  This psychological effect will help the scheme as much as the material assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very pleased to hear the speech of the Minister in connection with this Bill.  I also think the Bill will, in addition to its material aid, have a psychological effect, and I speak as one who is interested in the Irish Industrial Development Association.  I would like to ask the Minister one question in connection with clause 1 of the Bill.  In a case where the scheme has gone through the various courses of criticism and test, which it is proposed each scheme should pass through, then until the project is approved and the machinery put before us for supporting any particular enterprise, is there any proposal or amendment for auditing and safeguarding of the capital as if it were a public company? Is there anything done by way of the appointment of an auditor or the publication of certain returns as is the case in all public companies?  The Bill says &ldquo;the Minister for Industry and Commerce may guarantee...as he shall think fit&rdquo; and so on.  I think that is rather loose and not sufficiently specific, because sometimes I have got money easily from banks or other people, and I think when money comes easily it is not so closely safeguarded as if you had to pay 5 per cent. to the shareholders and others at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. GUINNESS Mr. GUINNESS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his opening remarks rather criticised the action of the bankers in this country.  He stated that he had <Col N="825" /> been snowed under by applications for credit from enterprises which in his opinion were good, and that he referred them to the banks and that the banks had not been open to receive them.  Well, he then went on to explain that under this Bill when these enterprises, for which facilities and guarantees are going to be given, come along, that before the grant is made or a guarantee given, the proposition has to be examined carefully by an expert Advisory Committee and get their approval.  It has then to get the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance.  That is to say, it has to run the gauntlet of at least three very important bodies or individuals.  Now, if we go back to the banks, and a proposition of a somewhat similar kind comes before the banks, we are not supplied with Ministers and Advisory Committees. We have certain individuals known as directors and they have to examine the scheme as best they can. I do not think it is exactly fair to the banks to criticise them more or less in the way the Minister has done.  The directors of the banks are responsible for the money of the depositors.  That money has been handed to them and they are responsible for it.  The directors themselves might be brought into court and prosecuted for malappropriation or negligence in the use of that money.  The Minister, on the other hand, is not using the money of depositors. He is using the public money and there is very little responsibility attached to him in using that money. He and the Government may be put out of office, but it is a very unusual thing and a far-fetched idea that they would be.  In one case he criticises adversely the banks for not doing what they ought to do, and at the same time he surrounds himself with expert critics in connection with a matter for which there is not very great responsibility on himself.</P>

      <P>Senator Dowdall has put to me two very pertinent questions. I might answer them both together. As my mind runs at the moment with regard to the Advisory Committee, I had intended to have one Committee for the purpose of Clause I <Col N="826" /> strengthened for the purposes of Clause 2, by the addition of someone connected with agriculture, or having experience in agricultural matters.  It has been put to me that I should have two separate Committees and have two bodies, one for Clause 1 and another for Clause 2.  If I can get six men of the expert type I require with sufficient spirit to take on both, I will have two Committees, but so far I have found it difficult to get three men.  If I have three it will be needful to have an expert accountant as one of those three. I think what the Senator requires would be looked into.  I was going to put in a clause to read &ldquo;on such terms and conditions as the Minister may think fit.&rdquo; Those terms would include audit of accounts and supervision of the expenditure of the money. With regard to what Senator Guinness said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I had no intention of attacking the banks.  What I did say was that I have received a considerable number of applications since I came into office, and my thoughts were, &ldquo;Why could not the banks give this?&rdquo; The Senator inferred a different thing from that.  That is what I meant.  I was looking at the banking conditions, and I realised that certain schemes put before me were outside the purview of ordinary banking.  I did not intend to criticise the banks. I did say that great facilities were regarded as necessary.  I did not mean to imply any criticism of banks as at present constituted, but merely said that banks did not adjust themselves to the new conditions.  I quite agree that banks have such a responsibility for the handling of depositors' money that they cannot move outside a certain radius.  I had no intention of attacking the banks.  In fact, my expert Committee <Col N="827" /> is to be very much on the type of a bank directory, and the functions of that committee would be definitely the same kind as those functions discharged by the directors of a bank.</P>

      <P>I want to inform the Seanad and to get their help and assistance in a matter regarding those two Bills to which we gave a Second Reading to-day, namely, the Witnesses Oaths Bill and Private Costs Bill, 1924.  There is apparently so much work at present being done in the Dáil that it is difficult to get hold of any person with whom arrangements could be come to.  Senator Douglas and I thought it would be a wiser course to refer those two Bills to a small Select Committee.  They were introduced by Senator Douglas and supported by Senators Brown and Barrington. If we were to refer those to a Select Committee, one or two hours on Tuesday would dispose of them and they would be available on the Report Stage for us on Wednesday.  Therefore, if a Senator proposes that those two Bills be referred to a Select Committee&mdash;a Select Committee of four with a quorum of three would be probably enough&mdash;we might take the matter as being disposed of.  I presume there will be at least four Senators patriotic enough to give two or three hours of their time on Tuesday afternoon to dispose of those two Bills in Committee.  If that is the view of the Seanad, some Senator might propose that those two Bills be referred to a Select Committee of four.</P>

      <P>There is another matter that interests Mrs. Stopford Green and other Senators, and that is with regard to the question of when we take up the discussion of the report of the Joint Committee on the temporary accommodation of the Oireachtas, and what form that discussion ought to be in.  I ought to mention that it was before the Dáil to-day, and by practically an unanimous vote they adopted the report, particularly recommendation No. 4, that is, the taking over of the balance of the unoccupied portion of Leinster House.  That has been adopted in the Dáil.  For the last few days we have had rather a poor attendance of Senators. I do not know whether we had at any time at the outside 25.  I know some are leaving to-day.  If we meet to-morrow I am afraid we will have a poor House, and I think in the interests of those who are anxious about this matter like Senator Mrs. Green and others, it would be better if we fix this discussion for 11 o'clock on Wednesday when we may very likely have a larger attendance of Senators here.</P>

      <P>Speaking from the personal point of view, I think that unless we take longer than we usually do, the Committee Stage of that Bill would not take a great deal of time. The drawback is that if we wait to sit until next week, unless we are prepared to sit much longer in the summer (if you would call the present weather summer) the Report Stages of Bills would come very quickly after the Committee Stages, which a good many Senators feel is a mistake.  With regard to meeting at 11 o'clock, I know it is the point of view of some business men that it is exceedingly difficult to get here by that hour.  It can be done with an effort, but by the time letters are delivered and attended to, if we are sitting the whole day it is decidedly inconvenient.  I would suggest that we should sit at 2.30 on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of next week, and we could then do our business without meeting at 11 o'clock.</P>
