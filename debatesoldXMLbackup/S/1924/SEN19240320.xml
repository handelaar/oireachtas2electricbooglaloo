      <P>The first business upon the Order Paper is the Report of the Committee appointed to consider the question raised by Amendment 39 to the Courts of Justice Bill, 1923.  As this Report is one of most vital importance as regards the powers and position of the Seanad, I would like that we should have had a fuller House for the purpose of receiving and discussing it.  At the same time, as it is on the Order Paper, I think it is better we should proceed with it, but as one or two Senators may arrive in a short interval we might perhaps dispose of No. 2 which is the Second Stage of the Public Safety (Punishment of Offences) Temporary Bill, 1924.</P>

    <Title>THE PUBLIC SAFETY (PUNISHMENT OF OFFENCES) TEMPORARY BILL, 1924.&mdash;SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That this Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>One feels that there is not much use in saying very much about this Bill in view of all that has been said in respect of a similar Bill last August.  There are certain very objectionable Sections in the Bill which outrage humanity to a certain extent and which experience has proved do not tend to stop the abuses for which they were originally conceived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular Section to which I refer deals with the infliction of the punishment of flogging in respect of certain crimes.  After all, the great difficulty in regard to the preservation of order has been the difficulty of apprehending the criminals.  Very few people, no matter how desperate they might be, will commit crimes of this kind if they feel certain they will be apprehended <Col N="1126" /> and get a punishment of penal servitude for a number of years.  They are more inclined to commit the crime if they feel that their chances of being arrested are pretty small.  It is a pity that when the Minister for Home Affairs was introducing a punishment of this kind that he did not hit on something more effective.</P>
    <P>Personally I think the introduction of the old system of the pillory would be far more effective, would be less inhuman, and, on the whole, would not be quite so objectionable as the infliction of corporal punishment by means of the &ldquo;cat.&rdquo;  The pillory is an antiquated method, but, at all events, it showed up the criminal, held him up to public opprobrium, and brought on him an amount of contempt and public censure that no amount of corporal punishment of another kind would bring upon him. The Government, I think, might have looked up old punishments which have long since fallen into disuse if they desire to inflict punishment of that kind. They would probably find that these punishments were far more effective in cases where it was necessary to inflict punishment of that kind at all.  After all, we have seen a number of incidents where robbers have been chained to church rails.  I believe that that form of punishment has been far more effective in preventing crime than the punishment suggested in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of flogging there are other very vital Sections of the Bill, and in considering them we should have some regard to the Constitution, a document that has been discussed very often as to whether it is being observed or otherwise.  By Article 72 of the Constitution it is enacted that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge without a jury, save in the case of charges in respect of minor offences triable by law before a court of summary jurisdiction.  Yet, in Section 1, sub-section (2) of this Bill you find that it is proposed to give a court of summary jurisdiction&mdash;a District Justice sitting without a jury&mdash;the right to inflict a sentence in respect of all the offences mentioned in Part II. of the Schedule. That means that you take away from the prisoner the right of trial by jury, as given by the Constitution.  I may be <Col N="1127" /> told that these are minor offences, such as are contemplated by Article 72 of the Constitution.  That, of course, is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>Nobody would suggest that armed robbery and arson were minor offences. Certainly no offence is a minor offence in which a Court can inflict a penalty of 12 months' hard labour, and failing the payment of a fine of £50, an additional six months' imprisonment. Crimes which merit punishment of that kind are not minor offences within the meaning of the Constitution.  In my opinion it is quite unconstitutional to submit offences of that kind to a court of summary jurisdiction and deprive the criminal, no matter what his crime, of the right of trial by jury.  It is believed that a sentence of two years' imprisonment with hard labour is the severest sentence, short of hanging, that the law can inflict.  It is much more serious than a much longer period of penal servitude.</P>
    <P>The whole draftsmanship of the Section seems to be wrong.  By the common law every offence is triable by a jury, and the right to have offences tried summarily is created by express statutory enactment.  Several of those offences cited in this Bill are of a very serious character, such as I mentioned, robbery under arms.  If it is desired for the purpose of this Bill to make all these offences minor offences triable by a court of summary jurisdiction, I think the Bill should state definitely that all the offences mentioned in the Schedule are hereby declared to be triable summarily, if that is what it means.  Under the old Public Safety Act at least one District Justice contended that the passing of the Act did not make acts triable by summary jurisdiction which were not triable by summary jurisdiction under the law as it stood before the passing of the Act. If you take Section 4 of the Bill, a person alleged to have stolen property is found guilty unless he can prove to the satisfaction of the District Justice that the goods or valuables in his possession have come to him through the ordinary legal means.  Under our obsolete law as it stands a man cannot give evidence on his own behalf. Therefore, unless he can get witnesses <Col N="1128" /> to prove his innocence he has no means of proving it himself.</P>
    <P>That rule of law was done away with in England in 1898, and I understand the Government of Northern Ireland have also done away with it, so that in these places a man charged with an offence can now give evidence on his own behalf.  I believe that the Attorney-General gave an undertaking that a Bill for that purpose would be introduced in the future, but seeing that time can be given for the manufacture of all sorts of oppressive statutes one would imagine that the Government could find time for the introduction of a single clause Bill which might be passed within 24 hours, enabling a prisoner to give evidence on his own behalf, particularly in cases of this kind, where he is called on to prove that he is not guilty or that goods he has are his own property.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill makes the Minister for Finance his own judge Sub-section 3 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If within such time or extended time as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section any person proves to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance the matters mentioned in the foregoing sub-section, the Minister for Finance shall certify in writing that the order made by the District Justice under this Section in respect of such sum of money may be discharged, and upon production of such certificate to a District Justice such District Justice shall discharge such order.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister for Finance is made a judge in his own case.  After an order is made by a District Justice in regard to money lodged in the bank about which there is some doubt as to the ownership, you have to prove to the Minister for Finance, and not to the Court, that that money belongs to you.  I would suggest, in order to be constitutional, that the proof that the money belongs to the person who claims it should be made to the Circuit Court of the district in which the person concerned resides.  The Minister who is responsible and who would otherwise claim the money should not be made <Col N="1129" /> his own judge in his own case.  These are merely a few blemishes apart from the general trend of the Bill that suggest themselves to me.</P>
    <P>It would seem as if the Government have conceived the Bill without paying very much attention to the Constitution. If we have a written Constitution we should be careful that it is not violated in a manner which will leave it open to the ordinary individual citizen to say, with a certain amount of reason, that there is a written Constitution but that it is utterly ignored in a number of these enactments which have been introduced on the plea of special circumstances. Special circumstances do warrant in some cases extraordinary action.  In view of the fact that we have the Courts functioning, that we have police established in almost every town and village in which they were at any time established, and that we have the means of enforcing the law, I think we should have greater regard for the Constitution than we have had up to the present.  It is not so much the punishment you inflict as being in a position of inflicting any punishment at all.  You cannot inflict punishment by summary indictment unless you first catch the prisoner.  For these reasons and for these violations, in my humble opinion, of the Constitution I am going to vote against the Bill.</P>

      <P>In view of the very grave constitutional question raised by Senator O'Farrell I am sure the Seanad would be glad of the assistance of the Attorney-General.  I think we ought to extend an invitation to him now to take his seat in the Seanad as he is within the precincts.  If that is the wish of the Seanad I shall ask the Attorney-General to take his seat.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just say a word in reference to the point raised by Senator O'Farrell?  I regard this as a very serious matter indeed because there is little doubt as to the language of Article 72 of the Constitution.  I will read it: &ldquo;No person shall be tried on any criminal charge without a jury save in the case of charges in respect of minor offences triable by law before a court of summary <Col N="1130" /> jurisdiction.&rdquo;  That is to say, in every case of a criminal charge, except in cases of minor offences which under the law could be tried by a court of summary jurisdiction, every accused person is entitled to a jury.  I do not see anything in the preamble of this Bill or in its title which suggests that it seeks to alter the Constitution.  What I wish to point out to the Attorney-General is this, that unless he introduces into this Bill, if he considers that that would be a proper way of dealing with it, a Section which would describe these offences in Part II of the Schedule as minor offences, then in my opinion the power here conferred upon District Justices to try such cases as robbery under arms without a jury is going beyond the Constitution.  I would have little doubt that any person, convicted by a District Justice for a charge of that kind, and tried and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment without a jury, would be entitled to have the proceedings set aside as being a violation of the Constitution.  It is a very difficult matter to know how exactly it ought to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primarily, it seems to be a point of order for the Chairman, that is to say, to rule whether this particular provision to which Senator O'Farrell has called attention is or is not a breach of the Constitution, because if he was of opinion that it was a breach of the Constitution it might be his duty, if called upon to rule it as a matter of order, to say that being a breach of the Constitution it was outside the scope of the Bill, because the Bill does not purport to affect the Constitution or to alter it in any way.  I do not like doing that until some definite understanding has been arrived at between the Speaker of the Dáil and myself as regards our position in this matter.  This Bill has passed through the Dáil and I do not know whether this point which Senator O'Farrell is making was made there or not, but I must assume that the Speaker considered these various Sections as the Bill went along, and I must assume that if the Speaker was of the opinion that the Section violated the Constitution, he would have called the attention of the Dáil to it.  Being in ignorance of what happened.  I am not going to deal <Col N="1131" /> with this as a matter of order in this particular case.  I would seriously urge the Attorney-General to consider this matter.  It might be possible, as I have suggested, to remedy the difficulty by prescribing in the Section that these offences in Part II are minor offences. Whether that can be done consistently with the character of the offences is another matter, but unless there is some provision of that kind put into the Bill it seems to me that in giving power to the District Justice to try charges of this kind without a jury, and to impose a sentence of twelve months' imprisonment, this Bill over-steps the expressed language of Article 72 of the Constitution. For that reason, I think it would be important to have the views of the Attorney-General, because I am sure he must have considered this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt Article 72 of the Constitution does raise difficulties in this matter.  That Article was before the draftsman when preparing the Section of the Bill, and the view that was before his mind was that it is impossible to say that a particular offence by name is a major or minor offence in all cases, because it is very often a matter of degree.  The idea of this division here in the Section was, that if the District Justice considered the matter, in the degree in which it occurred in the particular circumstances, was a matter not so grave that he should send it on for trial, then he should be at liberty to deal with it, having first decided that it was a lesser degree of a particular offence, and that he should deal with it himself summarily.</P>

      <P>I was going to refer to the Courts of Justice Bill, to that Section on which you had an amendment here.  There the words occur: &ldquo;the Justice if he shall be of opinion that the offence is a minor offence.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better to have here a ruling to provide <Col N="1132" /> that the Justice should expressly decide that the facts constituted a minor offence.  It would have this advantage: that an appeal would lie from that decision.  That would, perhaps, meet the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty I was in was that under this Sub-section (2) the Justice could himself impose the penalty of 18 months' imprisonment with hard labour.  It is not easy to say that this is a minor offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an examination made of the penalties that would be imposed by a District Justice.  I did not know that I should be dealing with this matter or I should have had the material here.  I did cause an examination to be made, and I know that there have been a number of cases in which a court of Petty Sessions could impose a sentence up to two years by statute.  Consequently we determined that punishment alone even up to a period of two years would not determine whether the offence were a minor or a major one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that an amendment &ldquo;provided that before disposing summarily of any offence contained in Part 2 of the Schedule the district justice shall be satisfied that under the circumstances it could be disposed of as a minor offence and so certify and then give an appeal from that,&rdquo; or something like that would suit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Attorney-General adopts the suggestion from the Cathaoirleach, I would like to give him an opportunity of considering the wording of Article 72 of the Constitution. It defines a minor offence as a minor offence triable by law under summary jurisdiction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I had this point in mind, but if this Bill passes it becomes law.  I do not think it could mean &ldquo;heretofore triable by law.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>With great respect I would ask the Attorney-General to consider that.  Might I also refer to a question asked by Senator O'Farrell under Section 4?  Section 4, perhaps, is intended to give the prisoner the right of giving evidence.  It presumes, I think, that he may give evidence.  Ought it not be made clear that that is so?  Otherwise there may be an amendment, introduced in Committee, giving a prisoner, accused of an offence, the right of giving evidence on his own behalf.</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>That Section is copied from the Dublin Police Act of 1846.  It is a very useful provision, and it never extended outside Dublin.  I will look into it and see.  As <Col N="1134" /> regards the question of the Prisoners Evidence Act, it is not so simple as Senator O'Farrell seems to think to put through a One-Section Act.  There is a Criminal Evidence Act in England which was passed in the year 1898.  I have at present a recently published volume devoted to that Act.  I am having examined the Act with a view to see what modifications are required, because it is said to be badly drafted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>

    <P>1.  A message from His Excellency the Governor-General, bearing date the 23rd day of September, 1923, was duly delivered to the Dáil, and reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the advice of the Executive Council and for the purpose of Article 37 of the Constitution, I have to recommend that for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of any Act of the present Session to provide for the establishment of Courts of Justice according to the Constitution and for the better administration of justice, authority be granted <i>(a)</i> for the charge upon the Central Fund of the remuneration and pensions of the Judges of the High Court, the Supreme Court, and the Circuit Court, <i>(b)</i> the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of Temporary Assistant Circuit Judges, the remuneration and pensions of Justices, Deputy Justices and Temporary Assistant Justices of the District Court, and any other expenses incurred in carrying such Act into effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the receipt of this message and before the Courts of Justice Bill was considered in Committee of the Dáil, a resolution phrased in the terms of the message was adopted by the Dáil and Section 71 of the Bill, which incorporated the terms of this message and resolution, in so far as they provided for the payment of the salaries of the District Justices out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas, was subsequently passed through all its stages by the Dáil.  In the Committee Stage of this Bill in the Seanad, an amendment to Section 71, providing that these salaries were to be paid by making them a charge upon the Central Fund, was duly carried, but on the Report Stage the question was raised on behalf of the Government as to the powers of the Seanad, under the circumstances, to make the amendment; and the general question as to the powers of the Seanad in this respect was thereupon referred to your Committee for their consideration and report.  We accordingly have met, and after full and careful consideration beg to report as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>2.  First, we are absolutely satisfied that there was nothing in the terms of the message itself which precluded the Seanad from making the amendment in question.  The extent and authority of any such message is expressly defined by Article 37 of the Constitution in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;37.  Money shall not be appropriated <Col N="1137" /> by vote, resolution or law, unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same Session been recommended by a message from the representative of the Crown acting on the advice of the Executive Council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is plain from the language of this Article that the sole and only function of every such message is to recommend the purpose of the appropriation, and consequently, in so far as in this particular case it goes on to direct the appropriation and the manner in which it is to be made, we are clearly of opinion that it exceeded its authority and had as regards these further matters no control or effect upon the action of either the Dáil or the Seanad.</P>
    <P>3.  Secondly, we are of opinion that the position of the Seanad was in no way altered or affected by the subsequent resolution of the Dáil. We have failed to find in the Constitution or elsewhere the slightest authority for the proposition that the adoption by the Dáil of any such resolution binds or controls the action of the Seanad.  Such a proposition is in direct conflict with Article 61 of the Constitution, by which it is enacted that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All revenues of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) from whatever source arising, shall, subject to such exception as may be provided by law, form one fund, and shall be appropriated for the purposes of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Article plainly provides that no appropriation of any of the revenues of the Free State can be made, or the manner of such appropriation prescribed, otherwise than by law, while Article 12 makes it equally certain that the sole and exclusive power of making laws is vested in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>4.  Thirdly, there being nothing, therefore, in the terms of the message or of the resolution as adopted by the Dáil to restrict the powers of the Seanad, the question submitted for our consideration is narrowed <Col N="1138" /> down to this:&mdash;Can the Seanad amend an appropriation clause in a Bill other than a Money Bill?  Again, the answer is to be found in the Constitution, which by Article 38 provides that every Bill initiated and passed by the Dáil may, unless it be a Money Bill, be amended in the Seanad, and the Dáil shall consider any such amendment.  The sole and only restriction to be found in the Constitution upon this unlimited right on the part of the Seanad to amend any Bill other than a Money Bill is in the case of an amendment which involves the appropriation of any part of the revenues of the Free State, as no such amendment can be made unless and until the purpose of such appropriation has been recommended by a message from the Governor-General under Article 37, a condition precedent which is equally binding upon both Houses of the Oireachtas.  As this condition was admittedly fulfilled by the message in the case of the particular amendment which has given rise to this question, we have no hesitation in answering it in the affirmative.</P>

      <P>I hope that members of the House have got copies of this Report before them.  We were only able to have it printed last night, but it has been circulated to-day, and I am exceedingly anxious that every Senator should have a copy of the Report, because it deals with, perhaps, the most important question that has yet come before the Seanad in reference to its own powers and privileges under the Constitution.  The Report we made as short as possible&mdash; in effect, merely the conclusions at which your Committee arrived&mdash;and as the matter is a little complicated and somewhat difficult, I hope the House will bear with me if I proceed to elaborate it a little more fully than it is in the Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be within the recollection of the House that during the Committee Stage of the Courts of Justice Bill an amendment was introduced and carried to Section 71, as it stood in the Bill, the effect of the amendment being <Col N="1139" /> to transfer the salaries of the District Justices so as to make them a charge upon the Central Fund.  The Clause in the Bill as it came before the Committee of the Seanad, contained a provision that these salaries, as distinct from the salaries of the High Court, Supreme Court, and Circuit Court Judges, should be paid out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas.  On the Report Stage an amendment was put down at the instance of the Government, the effect of which, if carried, would have been to delete the amendment made by the Seanad, and to restore Section 71 to the shape in which it was when it left the Dáil.  Before that amendment of the Government was discussed the Attorney-General intervened and called my attention to a Message that had been received from the Governor-General, and a Resolution that had been adopted by the Dáil as a consequence of that Message.  The Attorney-General did not quite formulate his proposition&mdash;indeed, I do not think he had the time to do it&mdash;but I think the House understood it to be, and I so interpreted it, with his assent, that he was of opinion that having regard to the contents of this Message and the Resolution in accordance with the Message, which had been adopted by the Dáil, that the hands of the Seanad were tied as regards this particular Section 71, and that they were not entitled to make the amendment they had introduced upon the Committee Stage.  It is important, therefore, and as I say, I am exceedingly anxious that every member of the Seanad should follow me, and I wish to make it as plain as possible.  I would invite them, in addition, to take this Report home and in the light of the Constitution to read the Report for themselves, and to read it in connection with the various portions of the Constitution that are referred to in the Report, because this is a matter which is inevitably bound to crop up here in different forms, and affecting so vitally as it does the powers of the Seanad in reference to legislation, I do appeal to each and every member to make a special study of it in the light of the Report and the Constitution itself.</P>
    <P>The Message from his Excellency, the <Col N="1140" /> Governor-General, you will find set out in the Report, but I would like to read it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the advice of the Executive Council and for the purpose of Article 37 of the Constitution, I have to recommend that for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of any Act of the present Session to provide for the establishment of Courts of Justice according to the Constitution, and for the better administration of Justice authority be granted (a) for the charge upon the Central Fund of the remuneration and pensions of the Judges of the High Court, the Supreme Court, and the Circuit Court; (b) the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas for Circuit Judges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the Message, and is dated the 23rd September, 1923, and a few days later, and before the Dáil went into Committee upon the Bill, a Resolution was proposed and adopted by the Dáil which followed the terms of the Message. The first matter for the Seanad is this: whether this Message, in so far as it apparently provides in anticipation that the salaries of the District Justice were to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, did or did not in any way fetter the action of the Seanad.  Your Committee report to you that they are clearly of opinion it did not, and for the following reason: This Message from the Governor-General was sent in pursuance of Article 37 of the Constitution, an Article which, by the way, I may mention, is practically to be found in every written Constitution throughout all his Majesty's self-governing Dominions.  It runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Money shall not be appropriated by vote, resolution or law unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same Session been recommended by a Message from the representative of the Crown, acting on the advice of the Executive Council.&rdquo; Now, you have only to read that to see that the Message is confined to one purpose and one matter only, and that is to recommending the purpose of the appropriation. The Governor-General has no power to recommend the appropriation, nor has he any power to recommend the manner in which the appropriation shall be made.  Therefore, <Col N="1141" /> in so far as this Message goes beyond recommending the purpose, and goes on actually to make the appropriation and to prescribe the method in which the money is to be provided, it was absolutely mere surplusage; it has no legal effect or power of any sort, kind or description, and has no sanction under the Constitution.  Therefore, so far as the Message is concerned, it is plain, I think, and the Committee unanimously so report, that there was nothing in the terms of the Message to control the action of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The next question then, of course, arises as to how far, if at all, the action of the Seanad was controlled by the fact that the Dáil adopted a Resolution in the terms of this Message.  It is an interesting question, whether that Resolution bound the Dáil itself, having regard to Article 61 of the Constitution. Article 61 of the Constitution is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All revenues of the Irish Free State from whatever source arising, shall, subject to such exception as may be provided by law, form one fund, and shall be appropriated for the purposes of the Irish Free State in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, no provision can be made for the purpose of paying for Government or public services except by moneys appropriated for the purpose, and that appropriation, and the manner of that appropriation, is to be imposed by law.  Now, Article 12 of the Constitution says that the only law making authority is the Oireachtas&mdash;&ldquo;The sole and exclusive power of making laws is vested in the Oireachtas.&rdquo; Therefore, if you paraphrase Article 61 it plainly means this, that no appropriation of any part of the revenues of the Irish Free State can be made for payment of public services unless the appropriation itself, and the manner of the appropriation, is prescribed by the Oireachtas.  In so far as this Resolution, when it dealt with Judges of the High Court and Supreme Court, provided that their salaries were to be a charge upon the Central Fund, if I might pronounce an opinion upon it, that clearly bound the Dáil.  That is to say, once they accepted that Resolution <Col N="1142" /> they were bound to provide for the payment of the Judges of the High Court and Supreme Court in the way in which the Resolution which they adopted prescribed.  But in so far as the Resolution went on to say that the salaries of the District Judges were to be paid out of money provided by the Oireachtas, they were simply saying what is in the Constitution itself, because the Constitution says that all appropriation of moneys for the public service are to be made by the Oireachtas, and it is difficult to see how even the hands of the Dáil were fettered by a provision in a Resolution which said they were to do merely what the Constitution itself says they are to do, that is to say, provide the money.</P>
    <P>All that the Resolution bound the Dáil to do in regard to District Justices was to provide the money, and it does not seem to me to have fettered their hands in any way as to the manner in which that provision was to be made; in other words, that even in the Dáil they could have if they wished, notwithstanding this Resolution, provided that the salaries of the District Justices were to be paid out of the Central Fund, for you will see that the Resolution does not say that the salaries are to be put upon the Estimates. It does not say they are to be paid by an annual vote.  It simply says they are to be paid by money provided by the Oireachtas.  As the money in every case, whether made a charge on the Central Fund or not, must be appropriated by the Oireachtas, and as under the Constitution they, and they alone, have the right to prescribe the manner of the payment, it seems to me that even the Dáil had the right, if they wished, to make the amendment we made.  However, that is a matter for the Dáil itself under the advice and the direction of its able and vigilant Speaker, and I pass away from it.  The matter which concerns this House is the effect, if any, that that Resolution had upon the action of this House.  I need hardly say to you that to hold that we were bound by a Resolution to which we were no party, and to which our consent was never asked, would be a distinct violation as it seems to me, and the Committee so report, of Article 61, which leaves the appropriation and the <Col N="1143" /> manner of the appropriation of public grants to be determined not by the Dáil but by both Houses&mdash;by the Oireachtas &mdash;that is to say, to be determined by law.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, we are right, as I think we are, in reporting that neither the Message by itself nor the Resolution by itself, nor both combined, had any power or effect to fetter the action of the Seanad, then the only question that remains is this: assuming it to be no way hampered in its action by the Message or by the Resolution, had this House, in the case of a Bill which is not a Money Bill, the power to insert the amendment that it did insert?  Of that, I think there can be no question whatsoever, because if there is anything in the Constitution which is clear, it is that, with the exception of a Money Bill, this House can make any amendment it thinks fit in any Bill, and that amendment has to be considered by the Dáil when it goes back to the Dáil.  The words are so plain that I have only got to read them to you.  &ldquo;Every Bill initiated in and passed by Dáil Eireann shall be sent to Seanad Eireann and may, unless it be a Money Bill, be amended in Seanad Eireann, and Dáil Eireann shall consider any such amendment.&rdquo;  So there is a constitutional right, as clear as language can make it, conferring on this House the right to make any amendment it thinks fit in any Bill, if it is not a Money Bill.  The only restriction upon that power is this, apart from the restriction of it being a Money Bill, that if the amendment introduced in the Seanad purports to appropriate for the first time public money, then it would be out of order, because neither the Dáil nor the Seanad can appropriate any public money unless and until a Message has been received from the Governor-General recommending the purpose of the appropriation.</P>
    <P>Once he has recommended the purpose of the appropriation, then the Dáil and the Seanad are free and empowered and entitled to make an appropriation and to determine the manner in which that appropriation shall be made, <Col N="1144" /> whether by a charge on the Central Fund or otherwise.  So that it seems to me, and it seemed also plain to your Committee, that in inserting this particular amendment on the Committee Stage, in Section 71 of this Courts of Justice Bill, they were acting absolutely within their powers.  That really is a summary of the whole position.  You will find it condensed in the Report, and you will find the particular Articles of the Constitution, that I have referred to, mentioned there.  As I have said, it is a matter that does not affect merely this particular amendment, that arose upon this particular Bill, but it is one that goes to the very root of the limited powers that are conferred upon this Seanad.  In view of the limited nature of these powers, I felt it my duty to invite the Seanad most carefully to consider this matter, because we are the trustees for the people of the Free State of the powers conferred upon us under this Constitution. We ought to guard them very vigilantly and to see that, at least in our time, they will not suffer any diminishment or infringement.  It was for this purpose and for this reason that I thought it my duty to endeavour by a supplementary statement to make the contents of this Report plain and intelligible to every Senator.  It will now be for the Seanad to move the adoption of this Report, if some Senator would formally do that.  Then the matter can be discussed if necessary.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a word or two on this situation.  It is a very important one.  We appear to be living in a constitutional crisis, but I suppose that is more or less in the nature of the situation at the commencement of our legislative functions. I have no doubt whatever that the view set out in this Report is correct. I have carefully read the Report, although when I was reading it another constitutional question was sprung upon us by a Senator opposite.  This Report is perfectly clear.  It deals with the various points, and I have no doubt in my mind that the amendment <Col N="1145" /> that we carried the other day was perfectly within our powers.  It was merely a question of the allocation of the funds from which these salaries were to be paid, and, according to the Constitution, all we are concerned in is, that there is an authentication from the Governor-General empowering this appropriation to be made.  So far as this Seanad is concerned, I think we are perfectly within our rights.</P>
      <P>The only thing that occurs to me is that this Report has only been in the hands of the Seanad since this morning, and it may be that a number of Senators have not had time to read it and study it.  The matter is very important, and I think that the Seanad should in the decision it comes to, if possible, be unanimous.  If there is any doubt in the mind of any Senator present about the Report, it will be well to defer it until to-morrow or next week so that all Senators could consider the matter and that we should arrive at an unanimous conclusion.</P>

      <P>Personally I would not have the least objection, but there is a difficulty which arises in this way.  This is really in the end a matter for me, because it is a question of order.  No matter what this Report contains, or what the action of the Seanad is, I have to take upon myself the responsibility of ruling the point of order.  It will come up in a few minutes, because we are now going to pass on to the consideration of the Courts of Justice Bill, and the very first matter that we have got to deal with is this very question.  There and then I shall have to rule on it, because the objection that was raised to our amendment being retained is the very first point that arises when we come to deal with that portion of the Courts of Justice Bill that remained over.  We have practically finished the Report Stage, but there were three or four matters, including this serious matter, which the Attorney-General said he would consider and let us know the views of the Government on it when the Bill came up to-day.  Consequently, unless there is some Senator who is anxious to look into the matter further, I suggest that the Seanad should adopt the Report <Col N="1146" /> now.  Otherwise, I think we will have to adjourn the consideration of the Courts of Justice Bill.</P>

      <P>I am afraid our plans have all gone agley with regard to our business for to-day, and in the immediate future.  Yesterday, at the request of the Government, I informed the Seanad, in view of the interest taken by the President in the Housing (Building Facilities) Bill, that it was desirable that it should stand out and not be disposed of to-day.  I mentioned that it would appear upon the Order Paper because it was too late to have it struck out, but that by common consent we might agree that it should not be taken to-day by reason of the absence of the President through his regrettable illness, and for his convenience. The Seanad naturally agreed to that.  To-day, however, I received intimation that the President is very anxious that this Bill should be disposed of&mdash;which was not in agreement with the message I got last night, and which I communicated to the Seanad&mdash; and that he thought it better, if the Seanad would agree, that the Committee Stage should go on to-day, and he would have some Minister in attendance to take his place.  However, I pointed out that I could not well ask the Seanad to do that for two reasons. First, in view of the intimation I had given them, it was possible that Senators who had amendments down, which they wished to move, might not attend to-day, on the faith of the Bill not being taken.  In the next place, I knew there were amendments that had been sent in, in addition to those on the Paper, and there had been no time to print them.  Consequently, I came to the conclusion that it would not be reasonable or right to compel the Seanad to proceed with this Bill in Committee to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> That raises this next question.  The Seanad will remember that we considered and practically agreed to a suggestion that, everything else being equal, we should meet fortnightly.  It looked as if, and it still looks as if, we could finish the business on the Order Paper to-day if we omit the Housing Bill, with the result that in the normal course we should not have met for a fortnight.  But, I understand, that this day fortnight would bring us into the conclusion of Holy Week, and some Senators have expressed the desire that there should be no meeting of the Seanad during that period.  The week after that will be Easter Week, and, unless we make some other arrangement, it will practically mean that we would not meet again for a month. In view of the pressing nature of this Housing (Building Facilities) Bill, what I am going to ask the Seanad to do is this: It would be possible to meet to-morrow and take the Committee Stage of the Housing Bill, but we would not gain anything by that, seeing that we would have to take the Report Stage afterwards.  That would involve an interval, and would require the Seanad meeting to deal with the Report Stage.  What I am going to ask the Seanad to agree to is, to meet on Wednesday next.  On that day we could take the Committee Stage of the Housing Bill, and other business that is ready for us.  I may tell you shortly what it is.  There is the Second Stage of the Electricity Undertakings Bill.</P>

      <P>Well, it is rather a fiery subject.  That is all I know.  There will probably be the Second Stage of the Juries (Amendment) Bill. I believe lady members of the Seanad take some interest in that.  There is the Second Stage of the Summer Time Bill; the Committee Stage of the Public Safety (Punishment of Offences) Bill, to which we gave a Second Reading to-day; the Report Stage of the Ministers and Secretaries Bill; the Fifth Stage of the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Bill; and the Concluding Stage of the Courts of Justice Bill.  I think there is enough <Col N="1148" /> work in that to keep us occupied on Wednesday and Thursday of next week. If the Seanad agrees with me I would suggest that that is the best way out.  I greatly regret that I have so frequently to ask the Seanad to arrive at a decision as to their meetings, and the next day to ask them to do an exactly opposite thing. It is not my fault.  It is really nobody's fault.  It is a misfortune due to the illness of the President and circumstances of that kind that must be constantly occurring. I do my best to accomodate Senators by providing a bill of fare that will be available at a convenient date, but if our arrangements go astray they must not blame me, but put it upon the exigencies of the position.  Is it the wish of the Seanad that after our adjournment to-day we should meet again on Wednesday next?</P>

      <P>I think my recollection of the principal argument raised by the President was that it was very desirable to keep control each year over the number of these District Justices, because it might arise that a few years' experience would show that thirty-three were not necessary, and might be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the argument presented to the Dáil, that it was desirable, at any rate for one or two years, to keep the question of the number of District Justices one which might be raised on the Estimates until the Government have had an opportunity of seeing how many would in fact ultimately be required.  When that had been arranged, and when the number had become fixed, then I take it the Government would itself advance the proposition that their salaries should be charged on the Fund in order that there might be no question of debating the exercise of their functions. That is the sole matter in question. Apart from this other matter, upon which I do not touch now, the only question was whether it would not be advisable to leave it as it is for a few years until we see how the thing was working and discuss the number provided. Afterwards, when the number was determined, the question of charging their salaries would be again a matter which the Government would probably entertain.</P>

      <P>That amendment stood over in order that I might consider and discuss it with Senator Brown.  I have explained to him the difficulty I have in the matter, and it is largely due to this, namely, that we are anxious to enable certain methods of proof of documents to be provided.  The mercantile community and the Chambers of Commerce say that there are now under the rules in England methods by which facilities are given for proving documents in cases involving contracts, bills of lading, and documents such as those from consignors and consignees, and we want to be able to make provision for such proofs of documents.  We do not intend to make any alteration in substantive law, but we are afraid that this amendment might be taken to interfere with the rules on the subject.  Senator Brown agrees that this amendment does not affect anything substantial, and might interfere with the provisions which I think we are all agreed should be made.</P>

I agree with the Attorney-General that in jury cases it is a matter of importance to be able to prove various documents, as you can under the present law, without great expense and without the production of witnesses perhaps from great distances.  If the Bill provides that evidence of that kind can be given without great expense and without summoning witnesses, there would be no great objection to it.

      <P>This deals with the question of fixing the age of retirement, and it stood over after the debate of the last day in order that we might reconsider the terms.  It will be remembered that the Government proposed that in the case of judges, reappointed under the new scheme, who do not reach the age fixed as the limit for retirement under this Act, they should have power to extend the age limit, and that in the case of those who <Col N="1154" /> reach the limit the age should be automatically extended.  The Government put it to the House that they did not want to insist upon the right or the power to extend, and, the opinion here being against it, the amendment has been redrawn.  The proposal now in substance is, that there are a series of retiring ages prescribed in the Bill.  If any existing judge is reappointed, first, if he is a man under the age, he will go out at the fixed age named in the Bill, and if he has reached the retiring age it is to be automatically extended for three years.  The amendment now reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 96.  To delete the Section and insert in lieu thereof the following new Section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>96.&mdash;Where any person who is at the passing of this Act a Judge of the Supreme Court of Judicature in Ireland, a Recorder, County Court Judge or District Justice in Saorstát Eireann, or a Divisional Justice of the Police District of Dublin Metropolis, is appointed to be a Judge of any Court under this Act after he has attained the age of retirement prescribed by this Act for the judges of such Court, such age of retirement shall in his case be extended by the addition of three years thereto.</P>

      <P>There was a matter that stood over of some importance, that is with regard to the question of estoppel.  At present your clause will not work.  It is a question of title being raised before a District Justice.  It is in Section 74.  My difficulty is this.  Take the case you put. It is an action for assault, and the defendant says, &ldquo;The man was trespassing on my right of way.&rdquo;  The District Justice says, apart altogether from the question of title, he has no right to beat him.  That apparently would be an estoppel, either in a suit for a declaration of title or an ejectment.  Why should it be estoppel where the individual is asserting his right of way again or defending it in some form of action?</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that some of those right of way cases burden people with small holdings. The Donegal Deputies were vociferous on this point, however, and this was a cheap method of trying out a case of assault before a District Justice.</P>

If it is going to be final let it be final for all purposes.  If it is not to be an estoppel why should it be an estoppel as regards everything except two forms of litigation?</P>

      <P>It is being put up to me in this way.  It might be tried out before a small number of witnesses as an assault case, but when it is tried on process it is a matter of throwing witnesses on each side of varying longevity, and the idea is if they could have a cheap method without an excessive number of witnesses in a district court a District Justice should be given an opportunity of disposing of it notwithstanding the question of title.</P>

      <P>If we do that we will then throw on the District Justice jurisdiction to hear title processes in which the witnesses will be massed, and it will be impossible for the District Justice to do any other business.  I have interviewed a number of District Justices on this subject, and they were afraid of its being so framed that it would induce litigants to treat it as one of those title processes in which you would have a great number of witnesses and the case would last several days.</P>

      <P>You see, there are two points of view to look at in this.  You have got to look at the point of view of the man who is claiming the right of way and the unfortunate man over whose lands he is claiming it, because it may be a very disastrous thing for a small farmer with a valuation less than £10 to have a right of way established over his land, and it is no wonder it is a thing he resists to the death.  On one side they are anxious to get a right of way, and the man on the other side is equally anxious to resist it, because there was not a right of way, and if you are going to let the District Justice decide this, and decide it for all time, it seems a very strong thing to say that it is worked practically as an estoppel, wherever a right of way is involved, and if it is worked as an estoppel, he goes to the Court of Chancery and asks for a declaration.</P>

      <P>Last year we adopted England's fiscal policy, and we did not know at that time that there was such a thing as a duty on chloroform, ether, and other drugs used in the treatment of the sick.  It came on us like a thunderbolt.  I am really more concerned with the difficulties of procuring medicine, ether, chloroform and other drugs, than I am with the amount of tax that was imposed.  There has been nothing but chaos and confusion, and it has caused very unnecessary suffering.  Last year we approached the Minister for Finance, President Cosgrave, and he decided to remit the duty on chloroform and ether used in public hospitals.  The Revenue Commissioners issued regulations prescribing that the least amount that could be got was five gallons.  Another Board, the Local Government Department, issued orders previously that the amount of any drug that a dispensary doctor could order was a three months supply, and the three months supply in most dispensaries would not amount to more than two pints, so that between the two orders a doctor can do nothing. The duty on chloroform is about 100 per cent., and on ether practically 100 per cent. also.  Very serious trouble has arisen over this duty.  It was only yesterday that a druggist in this city ordered <Col N="1160" /> pneumococcic serum by telegram, and in the ordinary way that would be procured from London next morning. On this occasion he got it four days after the unfortunate man for whom it was required was interred in Glasnevin. Another chemist told me that some weeks ago he ordered a drug called actophan, and instead of having that drug the next day he received, four days after, a letter from the Customs Department, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Postal Authorities have handed to this Department one packet addressed to you from Charles Zimmermann, London, containing aetophan, which reached this country through letter post.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As the importation of such dutiable goods by the Foreign Letter Post is prohibited, I hereby give you notice that the packet will be retained as a seizure.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That chemist is now liable to a prosecution because the man in London sent the drug by letter post, and not by parcel post, not declaring its contents. It was, of course, necessary that the drug should be obtained in a very short time, but he has not got it yet.  I would appeal to the Minister for Finance when introducing the next Budget, to do away with this tax which originally was a tax to protect the manufacture of chloroform, ether and other industries, and not for the purpose of revenue.  It is a tremendous hardship on people, rich and poor alike, and I think that this tax should be remitted.  One of my friends, speaking to me on this question, asked me did I mean by &ldquo;other drugs&rdquo; whiskey and rum, which are very often used for illness.  I do not include these drugs, and I do not wish that the duty should be remitted on them, but only on drugs supplied by a chemist.</P>

As Senator O'Sullivan pointed out, it was imposed as a protective <Col N="1161" /> tariff in England, but, needless to say, it protects no industry in this country, and the amount of revenue secured from it is negligible.  It has never been imposed as a revenue-earning tax, but it has made some drugs that are absolutely indispensable exceedingly dear, and worse than that, it causes the delays to which Senator O'Sullivan has referred.  These delays are, as he pointed out, in some cases fatal, and they tend to add to the great difficulties under which the medical profession in country districts labour at present. There are many drawbacks because of the distance of local hospitals from some parts of the country&mdash;30 or 40 miles&mdash;and this inflicts considerable hardships on the sick poor particularly, and these delays, caused by the infliction of this tax, add to the sufferings which have to be borne in country districts. I suppose the importation of such a drug as opium or things of that kind is absolutely forbidden, but, of course, that does not come within the terms of this particular motion, which I hope will be passed unanimously.</P>

      <P>May I say that if Senator Dr. O'Sullivan will accept a slight addition, it might help the object he has in view.  I think that more delays arise in connection with the Post Office and the Post Office Regulations than in connection with the Customs, and if he added something to say that the Post Office be requested to give facilities for these things, I think it would strengthen the case, which everybody admits is proved up to the hilt.</P>

      <P>I think the main point of this resolution is to give publicity to the matter, and there would be some difficulty, possibly, in wording it in a perfect form.  It is unfortunate that it comes to-day when it is quite obvious you could not, under the present circumstances, expect the Minister who is conversant with the whole details, to be present.  I doubt if there is a patent medicine tax applicable to Ireland. In England there is a little stamp on the bottles containing patent medicines, but I believe the tax, apart from the duty, is not applicable to this country.  There are two points in Senator O'Sullivan's remarks which are important, but which I think are somewhat different in their character.  In the first place, I believe a tax on these drugs is part of the continuation of the key industries duties, which apply to optical instruments, drugs, certain kinds of glass, and a number of other industries introduced during the war, and which was for the protection of these vital industries in England, which could not by themselves enter into competition with foreign countries.  I think it is practically admitted that to continue that duty on all these articles here is nothing but absurd.  The Fiscal Committee which went into the matter, reported that the duty realisable from these articles was negligible, and recommended its removal.  Why steps have not been taken to remove the duty on them, I have no idea.  There is a second point which is not included in the resolution, but for which Senator O'Sullivan <Col N="1163" /> has made a clear case, and that is that the ordinary Customs regulations, which, whether we like it or not, have to be carried out if the Customs duties are to be enforced, ought not to be applicable in their rigid form to drugs, medicines or other articles which are either perishable or of an urgent character, and it seems to me to be exceedingly simple to provide a regulation by which suspected drugs could be delivered to reputable hospitals and medical men, leaving the question of the payment of duty to be discussed afterwards, without actually holding back the goods, and thus affecting the life of a patient, perhaps.  I think, apart from the question of duty, that a parcel may be held up, as suspect, and there ought to be some arrangement by which chemists, hospitals and people from whom it would be easy to collect the duty, could obtain their supplies without delay.  I think if that were done, apart from the duty, a good deal of the difficulties referred to by Senator O'Sullivan, could be met; and I think if this were brought before the notice of the Revenue Commissioners that they would bring it before the Minister for Finance to deal with it.</P>

      <P>That point was emphasised by Senator Barrington in suggesting that the Post Office had a good deal to say to this, and perhaps Senator O'Sullivan may wish to have these words added at the end of his resolution: &ldquo;And should in any event receive special facilities for transmission through the post.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am not quite sure that the Post Office in this matter is to blame.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest another method of dealing with this subject.  I remember hearing from General Maxwell how he dealt with the case in Pretoria when the troops went in there.  He told me what the Irish Medical Mission did, was first to get all the medicines in Pretoria pooled into one central store, so that whenever medical men wanted a supply he was able to come at once and get it.  Evidently the trouble is the main supply of these things lies in Great Britain, and we only have small quantities here.  The question of duty is only a bagatelle, I suppose, in such matters to the Government. Why should there not be a central store open in the Free State for whatever things the medical profession say are required?  Duty free or not, that is a detail, but for hospitals and such institutions, they should be duty free.  If we got proper supplies here in a store properly looked after, where every medical man and hospital in Ireland could send at once, you would get over the difficulty of small lots held up by Customs officers and trouble in the post.  I think it could be quite easily arranged that someone connected with the medical profession, or the Government themselves should open a small central store for all these things, and all those supplies ought to be bought in by the Government, and anyone who came in there and paid his money should be able to get what he wanted without any stoppage whatever.</P>

      <P>I think that will do all right.  It is the delay in delivery that causes the trouble.  Drugs have often been held up for months.  There was no delay until the imposition of this tax.  I think Senator Douglas was labouring under a mistake when he said that this was a recent war tax on ether and chloroform.  That is not so.  I believe it was in 1876 that a tax was put on chloroform and ether.  Anaesthetics were imported form France, and a tax was put on by England to protect her own industry, and so foster the manufacture of ether and chloroform, particularly in Glasgow and Edinburgh. They manufacture their own supplies now, and have not to import these drugs.</P>
