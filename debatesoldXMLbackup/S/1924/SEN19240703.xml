      <P>&ldquo;Go gcuirtar Bille na gCuanta Stáit, 1924, chun Có-Choiste den dá Thigh a hainmneofar do réir forálacha Buan-Ordú 61 (Gnó Príobháideach);</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the State Harbours Bill, 1924, be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses to be nominated in accordance with the provisions of Standing Order 61 (Private Business);</P>
      <P>That all petitions against the Bill presented three clear days before the date fixed for the meeting of the Joint Committee be referred to the Joint Committee, that the petitioners be heard either personally or by their counsel or agents against the Bill, and that counsel or agents be heard in support of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Seanad do concur with the Dáil in the Resolution that has just been read.  In doing so it might be convenient if I were to explain to the Seanad the circumstances under which this Resolution comes before us.  This is the first case of what is known as a hybrid Bill, and a hybrid Bill is one which, having been introduced as a public <Col N="563" /> Bill, is, in the opinion of the Chairman of the Dáil in which it was introduced, one that should, nevertheless, as private interests were affected, comply with the Standing Orders relative to Private Business.  Consequently the Ceann Comhairle referred this Bill on his own authority, as provided in the Order, to the Examiner, and the Examiner has sent a message that this Bill has complied with the Standing Orders relative to Private Business. When the Bill is a hybrid Bill it is treated, as far as the Committee's examination is concerned, the same as a Private Bill, but in all other stages it is treated as a public Bill.  The object of that is that private interests may petition during the Committee Stage, which is proposed to be by Joint Committee, exactly the same as a Private Bill, and their interests can be so heard.  After that has taken place the Bill can be dealt with as a public Bill. Standing Order 52, which deals with a hybrid Bill, is not quite complete, and therefore it is necessary to add to the Resolution which was passed in the Dáil the second part of this Resolution with reference to petitions.  I think I am safe in stating that the Committee on Standing Orders for Private Business will propose an addition to the Orders which will make it unnecessary in future in private Bills to have an elaborate Resolution like this.</P>
      <P>Motion: &ldquo;That the Seanad do concur with the message received from the Dáil and that the usual steps be taken under the Standing Orders to appoint our nominees to this Joint Standing Committee&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Schedule 3, page 34, to delete in line 36 the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;three.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to secure compensation for the loss of employment to all employees with three years' complete service instead of five as at present.  A similar amendment was turned down in the Dáil.  I trust that the Minister will have softened from the adamantine attitude he adopted <Col N="564" /> in the Dáil.  The hardships involved in excluding all employees with less than five years' service from any compensation at all for loss of employment are great in some cases.  Perhaps the hardest case of all is that of the clerical staff who entered by open competitive examinations.  These clerks are almost invariably the sons and daughters of poor men, small peasant farmers and workers generally.  To educate them up to the standard of being able to win a place in open competition at a fairly stiff examination is no small task for the parents of these children.  Now, if a boy enters the railway service, he sits for an examination when he is at or about the age of sixteen.  If he wins a place, it is in many cases a year after before he is called into employment.  He is then seventeen years of age.  He has four years' service at the time he becomes redundant.  He is then 21 years of age and has passed the age at which he may compete for the Civil Service or any public service.  He is thrown on the unemployment market, having got a specialised training which is of little or no value to him in other walks of life, because the knowledge of railway work, being of a specialised character, is of very little use to him in other employments.  Sending that boy home when he has turned that age, after all that has been spent on him to educate him and to get him into the position&mdash;and, remember, he has spent a number of years in the position at a small salary&mdash;is a very great hardship indeed.</P>
    <P>Under the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1920, an employee with three years' service is looked upon as being a permanent employee and the Minister for Industry and Commerce issues a certificate of exemption from Unemployment Insurance as a result.  Therefore, it is clear that in getting rid of a man with three years' service you are getting rid of a permanent employee in the sense that permanent employment is understood.  One of the arguments advanced against this is the fact that under the Civil Service schemes of pensioning for redundancy people with less than 10 years' service get no compensation. That is not correct, because they get a gratuity which is in the <Col N="565" /> main far more generous than a man with less than 10 years' service gets under this Bill.  Even under the Local Government Bill, which has been introduced in the Dáil, employees with less than five years' service, in the event of becoming redundant, get a half year's salary as compensation.  Still it is contended that in the case of railway clerks no compensation whatever should be given to a man with anything less than five years' service.  My proposal is an exceedingly modest one, and you will see that when I tell you what a man would be entitled to.  Take a clerk with three years' service.  He has then about thirty shillings a week.  If a consequential amendment lower down is carried there would be one year added to that.  He would then be entitled to four-sixtieths or one-fifteenth of his salary as an annual allowance. In other words he would have two shillings a week compensation if he had three years' service.</P>
    <P>The amount is ridiculously small and the best way to meet that situation would be to give the man a lump sum as a gratuity so as to carry him over the period during which he would be looking for employment.  In present circumstances it would take him a considerable time indeed to get employment. That is the position particularly as it affects clerical staffs, who would have to get a special educational training before they secure a position and who, during the three or four years in which they are in the service, have been specialising on a particular branch of business that would be no use to them in the world outside.  If this amendment is not carried, I trust at least that the Minister will see his way to meet the position in some manner, such as is proposed in the case of public board employees under the Local Government Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I shall have to repeat the arguments that I used in the Dáil, with the addition of one argument which a Deputy put up in connection with the particular point I was making.  There are two points against this amendment.  One is the analogy with civil servants in cases where a gratuity may be payable. Take a case where a man is not due <Col N="566" /> for pension; he does not become pensionable until he has ten years' service. Three years is the period in connection with a particular extraordinary type of Act, the Unemployment Insurance Act.  The compromise between the three years and ten years in the case of the Civil Service is a period of five years.  That was hit upon as being equitable for this Bill.  A pension really is, and always has been looked upon as, deferred pay.  A man who gets into an office which is pensionable has a certain amount of money which would come to him ordinarily as salary, taken off and set aside as contribution towards his pension.</P>
      <P>Railway servants are not pensionable, and consequently no deduction is made from their pay to pull up for pension purposes in the future.  The Civil Service is quite different.  Money is always deducted from the civil servant's salary, and the civil servant has a legitimate grievance if, on being removed within the ten year period, he does not become due for a pension. Then he gets a gratuity.  His rights are very definitely secured to him by reason of the fact that deductions are made from his pay from the moment he enters the service, in order to accumulate as a fund to provide a pension for him in his declining years.  In the case of railway employees there is no such abstraction and no such deduction from pay.  Railway employees get whatever money is due to them on the basis of their service.  That is a definite procedure.  Their post is not pensionable.</P>
      <P>We propose to take railway servants of a particular type and put them on a pensionable basis.  We consider that a period of five years is equitable.  I do not know if that appeals to Senators. If not, then they can place Senator O'Farrell's argument against mine and make up their minds on the subject. We think that the compromise arrived at between the ten years' period in the case of civil servants and the three years specified under this very extraordinary Unemployment Insurance Act is very reasonable.  The Seanad can make up its mind on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. BAGWELL Mr. BAGWELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel bound to point out to the Minister that in some <Col N="567" /> cases I do not think his information is correct, as regards railway servants not being pensionable, because in a great many cases they are pensionable, and they have sums deducted from their salary in order to contribute to a pension in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>To take a very small sum of money, as Senator O'Farrell says, and turn it into the form of a pension, would cause infinite trouble in the way of book-keeping, etc.  If a private business had to dispense with anybody in this way he would be given a few pounds to carry on with.  I cannot see how we could vote for a pension in these cases with all that it implies. I suggest that the Government should make provision for some gratuity in case a young fellow with three years' service has to turn round and look for something else because of the coming into operation of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the point raised by Senator Bagwell, I am not clear as to the men he refers to.  But if he refers to railway clerks, who are members of the Superannuation Fund, then what he says is true.  Redundant men, however, will receive back any moneys they have paid into the Superannuation Fund, so that their rights are not being defeated.  If Senator O'Farrell sees fit to agree to the acceptance of Amendment 46 instead of this, we might have a compromise on that basis.  Amendment 46, as it stands, I do not think would fit in very well at the end of Sub-section 5 (a), but if the idea is acceptable in lieu of Amendment 44, then we could get Amendment 46 fitted properly into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has misread Amendment 46, which is really consequential on Amendment 44.  It merely provides for the adding of another year to the period of service. If a man only gets one-sixtieth of his remuneration it would be absurd. According to the Schedule, a man with five years' service has three years added for the purpose of computing pension.  Amendment 46 provides that one year shall be added on for those having less than five years' service. <Col N="568" /> That amendment does not meet the cases which I am dealing with under the present amendment.  It would only mean that if a man has four years' service, and one year is added on, that would bring him within the purview of the Bill.  The suggestion of Senator Jameson is the most acceptable one. In the Dáil an amendment on those lines was moved, and it was turned down.  The reason I moved this amendment is in order to keep the Bill in proper symmetry, by having this on the same lines as for men with five years' service and upwards.  As Senator Bagwell points out, the Minister is mistaken in stating that railwaymen are not pensionable.  Certainly all station-masters and clerks are pensionable, except on the small railways, and have deductions of from 2½ to 6 per cent. made from their salaries for pension purposes.  I earnestly urge the Minister to consider extending to these men at least the provisions which the Minister for Local Government and Health is offering to officials of public boards.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Third Schedule, page 35, immediately after the word &ldquo;service&rdquo; in line 16 to insert the words &ldquo;with the company or any amalgamating or absorbed company.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment which I trust will find acceptance.  It is merely intended to make the meaning clear. Throughout the Schedule the words &ldquo;amalgamating and absorbed companies&rdquo; are used.  These words are omitted here, and that might tend to convey that the words &ldquo;every completed year of service&rdquo; only apply to completed service in the company in whose service the man is when the amalgamation takes place, whereas I think it should apply to years of service <Col N="569" /> with any company in the Free State.  The effect of my amendment would be to make it read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The compensation shall be an annual allowance to be paid to the existing officer or servant during his life not exceeding in any case two-thirds of his remuneration and emoluments, and, subject to that limitation, to be calculated at the rate of one-sixtieth of his remuneration and emoluments for every completed year of his service with the company or any amalgamating or absorbed company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite acceptable, except that I would suggest to the Senator that before the word &ldquo;company&rdquo; where it first occurs, the word &ldquo;amalgamated&rdquo; should be inserted so as to read: &ldquo;With the amalgamated company or any amalgamating or absorbed company.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. BAGWELL Mr. BAGWELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the object of the amendment, but I thought it was moved for another purpose, because the effect will be that a man who entered any of these amalgamating companies on transfer from another company will only have his service calculated from the time he entered the service of the second company. Supposing a man, because of special qualifications, had been transferred, say, from the Great Northern Railway, or any other railway, to one of these amalgamated companies after he had had 10 or 20 years' service with the first company he was employed by, his service will only be calculated from the time he entered the second company. It would be a great injustice to a man who had, say, 15 years' service with one company outside the amalgamation, and had an additional ten years' service with the second company, if he got credit only for that 10 years' service, although he had been taken over because he had special qualifications. I think the companies should not be allowed out of their responsibilities <Col N="570" /> in a case of that kind and be allowed to say: &ldquo;The service you had with the previous company is not going to count, although we did take you over because you suited us, and took you over with your superannuation commitments.  Although you lose your job because you came to us, you are not going to be compensated for your service with the previous company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There was some talk in the Dáil about men coming from American and Chinese railways.  There are no such men.  In fact, there are very few men who transfer from one railway to another in Ireland.  But where such a thing occurred, it is only fair that the man should get compensation for the service he had with the previous company, seeing that he was brought into the second company with the consent of that company.  There is one man I have in mind at the moment who occupies a fairly responsible position and who was taken over from another company because of special qualifications which he had.  It is now sought to deprive that man, if he loses his position, of all compensation, except on the basis of the few years he has had with the second company, if this Bill is literally administered.  That will be the position unless the amendment 50, down in my name, is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is quite right in saying there was a certain storm in the Dáil over railway servants who were alleged to have come here from Chinese and American railways. An attempt was made to show that that argument was raised to prejudice people who had been in the service of some railway previously absorbed into one of the existing railways. All such men are protected. However, if the Senator is not quite sure that sub-section 5 (c) meets the case, we could consider strengthening it, but not on the lines of his later amendment.  I think sub-section 5 (c) meets such cases:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of an existing officer or servant who was appointed to his office as a specially qualified person at an age exceeding that at which railway service usually begins, his actual period of service with an amalgamating or absorbed company <Col N="571" /> may be increased by the addition of such number of years as may seem just, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, and thereupon his compensation shall be calculated on such increased period of service.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Amendment 46 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Third Schedule, page 35, to delete, in line 34, the words &ldquo;the whole of.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment, and I think it is necessary because the schedule provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where any existing officer or servant was temporarily absent from his employment as such officer or servant and during the whole of such absence was engaged in service in the National Forces of Saorstát Eireann, or any military forces serving under the authority of the First Dáil Eireann, the Second Dáil Eireann, or the Provisional Government of Ireland, or the British Army, Navy, or Air Force, such temporary absence shall for the purposes of this Schedule be reckoned and included in his period of service as such officer or servant.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am afraid, if the Schedule remains as it is, unless a man was the whole of the time engaged in military service, he cannot claim compensation.  At least he cannot claim that such a period should be reckoned.  It is only recently we got men reinstated in the Irish railways who took part in the 1916 rising.  We could not get them back up to that.  They were not in the National Army.  Some of them were not physically fit for it.  I have one case in mind where a man was not physically fit and he is now only able to get back to the service.  He was not in the National Forces the whole time, although he played his part before the Treaty.  If the Bill is left as it is, that man would not get compensation for the period of time that the railway company kept him out for political purposes.  That is the reason I move the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great <Col N="572" /> sympathy with the type of case mentioned by Senator O'Farrell, but it would be very dangerous to wipe out the words &ldquo;the whole of.&rdquo;  I was under the impression that the amendment sought to cover the cases of men who served in the National Forces and who fell ill while on such service; it was considered the period a man was in hospital would not be counted for the purposes of service.  Of course it would be reckoned as a period of military service.  In the cases of men removed from the railway company's service in 1916 and who were only recently reinstated, if it is sought by means of the amendment to have the whole period of such men's absence from the railway company counted as a period of service, it might go much too far.  There are certain cases where the railway company may have been to blame.  I am not quite clear that there have been such cases.  If there are, of course they would have to be met in another way.  We should have to see to these men's cases.  There are cases of men who took part in the Rising of 1916 and who after that did not apply for reinstatement.  I think this amendment would go too far in regard to such individuals, as they would be able to count the whole period from 1916, whether they applied for reinstatement or not.  I do not think that would be quite fair to the railway company. Obviously, in such cases the men thought they could do better in other walks of life and they might now find it better to return to the railway company.  I do not think it would be fair to the railway company to have the intervening years counted.  I think it would be very dangerous to put that into the scheme, as it would open the door to all sorts of fantastic claims.  If the Senator knows of such cases we could see how they could be met, and might take steps to make such representations to the railway company as would have substantial justice done to them.  I do not like the amendment to delete the words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly bring them to the notice of the Minister. I have one typical case in mind. I am not anxious to impose on the railway companies any unfair burden.  I <Col N="573" /> do not think any man who did not apply is back in the service.  It was only after many applications and strong pressure that the other men got back at all.  There is a danger that the railway companies will now be acting legitimately, if they dispense forthwith with the services of these men on the grounds that they are redundant.  If the companies have to reckon this period as service, they may try to find employment for these men.  I wanted to see that no injustice was done.  With the leave of the Seanad I will withdraw the amendment until the Report Stage.</P>

Immediately after the word &ldquo;Force&rdquo; in line 38 to insert the words &ldquo;or in any other employment of national importance.&rdquo; During the Great War railway men, principally clerks, were lent to Government Departments.  For instance, they were lent to the Coal Control Department and to the Shipping Control Department, and were absent for a number of years from the railway service. They returned to it when the war was over.  If their cases are covered by the Bill, and if they get credit for the periods of service during which they were lent to the Government Department, I do not want to press the amendment. I would like some assurance that that period of service would be reckoned for compensation in the event of these men becoming redundant.</P>

      <P>An amendment similar to this was moved in the Dáil, and I went to considerable pains to ascertain what was the employment of national importance, outside the service of the Forces referred to, which would seem to entitle these men to special treatment.  I now hear from Senator O'Farrell for the first time this specific case of the Coal Control Department. I understand that any railwaymen who were lent to the service of the Coal Control Department continued to be paid by the railway company, and consequently were reckoned as being in the employment of the railway company. <Col N="574" /> Such men have not had their rights defeated. Their rights are preserved, and their service will continue to run.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;To delete in line 39, the words &lsquo;temporary absence,&rsquo; and to substitute therefor the word &lsquo;service.&rsquo;&rdquo;  It is really his period of service in the National Forces or at work of national importance, that counts in calculating his compensation. It is merely a verbal amendment, and if the Minister sees any particular objection to it I will not press it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the objection to it that it is very hard to construe.  As I construe it, it would seem to require the complete re-wording of the sub-section.  If we start off by speaking of existing officers or servants, and we get a period of temporary absence of certain officers, then we say, such temporary officers' absence shall be included in the period of service. The Senator now seeks to substitute for &ldquo;temporary absence&rdquo; the word &ldquo;service.&rdquo;  How that can be construed I cannot clearly see.  It might be open to this construction: that you <Col N="575" /> get an officer or servant who applies for permission to leave the railway company to join the National Forces. Being in the National Forces for three or four months he decides that a soldier's life is his for the future. If he resigns from the company and a year afterwards thinks better of it and wants to come back, such a period of service would be reckoned as &ldquo;temporary absence&rdquo; and you would be grafting on a period of service much longer than should count as temporary absence.  It is a case that might not arise, but if it did I throw it out to be an objection to the particular amendment.  I do not know what substantial point is behind it; it would seem to me if carried to necessitate a re-wording of the section, and it would change the sense, and we would have to get the whole section and not the phrase.</P>

      <P>The section reads: &ldquo;Where any existing officer or servant was temporarily absent from his employment as such officer or servant, and during the whole of such absence was engaged in service in the National Forces of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  The amendment proposes that such service shall, for the purpose of this section, be included in his period of service.  It is unlikely that a man who would resign from the service definitely would get back again into the service because, of course, his period, no matter what the Bill does, would only count from the time he joined.  He would not be permanent until after a number of years had elapsed.  I do not see any danger in this.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Immediately after the word &ldquo;begins&rdquo; in line 43, to insert the words &ldquo;or who has been employed in the service of any railway company which has carried on business or discharged functions in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment merely emphasises the provisions of sub-section (c), that where &ldquo;an existing officer or servant who was appointed to his office as a specially qualified person at an age exceeding that at which railway service <Col N="576" /> usually begins&rdquo; shall have such additional years added to his service for the purpose of compensation as shall seem just.  That is a mild way of covering these men who had service with other railways and had been taken on because of their special knowledge.  It is to put in, in line 43, the words &ldquo;or who has been employed in the service of any railway company which has carried on business or discharged functions in Ireland.&rdquo; It is really what the Minister himself tells us will be done, but it will allay the feeling of any man in any other railway if that is put in, who fears now that he will not get any consideration for the period of service.  It does not make it mandatory to give him full credit for it.  It definitely asks that he shall be given consideration for some service he had other than with one of the amalgamated companies.  I hope the Minister will accept it.  He has indicated that it would be done, and it would allay the anxiety of the people who at present are not sure of their position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that it will allay any suspicion.  Let me put it this way: The Senator seeks to bring into clause (c) a phrase indicating people who have been employed in the service of a railway company which has carried on business or discharged functions in Ireland.  He grafts on that new clause period the wording of which is &ldquo;may&rdquo; be increased. That is to say, it is weaker than the present position of the people under the Bill, because if that phrase is not introduced here the people referred to in the amendment will come in under the sub-clause (d), where the word is &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be reckoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us differently.  He said they would be treated under sub-clause (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I say certain people who go in at an age beyond the period at which railway service begins, but I am speaking now of people employed in the service of a railway company who carried on business or discharged functions in Ireland.  That would apply to amalgamated or absorbed companies.  The <Col N="577" /> terms of the amendment would cover it.  The amendment the Senator has put down would apply to an absorbed company.  It is clear that if it applies to an absorbed company it defeats to a certain extent the amendment moved and accepted by Senator Bagwell. That clause has in it the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo; It is mandatory, and the other clause has &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  I do hold the clause as it stands will include the type of service the Senator has in mind, not with an amalgamated or absorbed company, but some company previously in existence and brought in under a previous amalgamation scheme, and that those employees would have their years of service with that company brought in and reckoned as a period of service with the present company.  It is going to one of the amalgamated or absorbed companies, and is going to be looked after.  I suggest to the Senator that his amendment is weakening the position of men whose position is very definitely assured to them under sub-clause (a).  I do not think he makes any addition to their strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>So that the position is not as contemplated by the Minister under sub-clause (a).  Every man is bound to get full credit for the period of service with any amalgamated or absorbed company.  That is plain. It is not a voluntary or permissive arrangement. It is a mandatory arrangement. This is to cover the case of men received into the service of the company late in life, it does not matter whether an absorbed company or otherwise, and who want to get credit for more service than they had with the amalgamated or absorbed company&mdash;I am referring to men from the Great Northern, or any other non-amalgamated or non-absorbed company outside, who have had previous railway service, and who under the Bill had been getting credit for it only by permissive arrangement.  This is merely that the permissive arrangement shall apply to them.  They have no right here under an amalgamated or absorbed company.  I do not think the Minister realises that. I am not referring to men previously absorbed in Ireland, for they must get credit for their full service.  What is set out here is to give credit for full <Col N="578" /> service, though part of it was in a non-amalgamated or non-absorbed company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator and myself have the same consideration for the men referred to, but he has one way of doing it and I have another. I am putting my way in opposition to his.  There are two classes of men concerned. The men employed on a railway company now being absorbed, and let us take them as an instance.  Such men are covered by sub-section (a), if nothing else is put in to weaken sub-clause (a).  With regard to men who have had service not with any other amalgamated or absorbed company we hold these men are covered by (c) as it stands.  The Senator, evidently being anxious to allay suspicion in these men, seeks to make explicit what I hold is implicit.  Therefore he brings in the reference and uses a phrase which must be interpreted to cover men that served in an amalgamated or absorbed company, and those men who had previously occupied a strong position under clause (a) will now have two sections referring to them, one of which says &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and the other which says &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  It does not do any good for these men.  It really weakens their position and strengthens the position of no one, because he seeks to strengthen the position of people whose case is absolutely covered by (c).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 52, page 35, to delete all <Col N="579" /> after the word &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; in line 62 to the end of the sub-paragraph.</P>
      <P>I hope this will not be included in the slaughter of the innocents.  The object of the amendment is to delete all the words after compensation to the end of the sub-section.  This extraordinary sub-clause provides that the basis of compensation that is to be paid is the salary that a man or woman enjoyed in the last year of service before they became redundant, but there is the extraordinary proviso put in &ldquo;unless the person receives promotion one year before the 3rd April, 1924, in which case his remuneration and emoluments shall, for the purpose aforesaid, be taken to be the annual value of the remuneration and emoluments of which he was in receipt immediately before such promotion.&rdquo;  One year is taken out of all the years, that is, the 3rd April, 1923, to the 3rd April, 1924. Any man who gets promotion in that magic year is not to have the promotion count for compensation purposes, but any promotion before that period or after that year will count.  I know the object of this.  The Government felt that the companies would have taken advantage of this amalgamation scheme in order to put up favourites and to give them promotion, and if rendered redundant they would get unreasonable and unjustifiable compensation, particularly as directors and so on.  I do not know why they should attribute <i>mala fides</i> to such responsible bodies as railway directors, any more than the British Government should, but they evidently know them better than the British Government knew theirs.  They issued instructions at all events that no promotions were to take place pending the passing of this Bill, and it is stated, notwithstanding that order, or suggestion from the Minister, that actually two or three promotions did take place in the position of officers.  But in that period hundreds of promotions must inevitably have taken place in several grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are seven classes of station masters and six classes of clerks, and in the ordinary working of railways, vacancies will occur.  A man is promoted from a job carrying £200 a year <Col N="580" /> to a job of £230 a year.  That man may have been waiting for years for some one to die or to be moved, and now because he gets it in the magic year, no matter when redundancy takes place, he will have to go back to his salary before April, 1923, to have his compensation fixed.  This was intended to stop unfair promotions, but it has turned out like the story of Charles Lamb of the Chinaman who burned his house every time he wanted to cook his dinner. They want to burn the whole railway people in order to cook these individuals. The extraordinary thing is that the individuals who wanted to make these promotions of an undue character could have held them over until April, 1924.  I hope the House will not allow this to remain.  If there had been undue promotions, if there were a few officerships coming vacant that were filled and should not have been filled, they might be dealt with, but it is hardly fair for a fireman, say, who may be promoted to engine-driver, or a porter who might be promoted to guard after waiting for years, if, five or six years hence he had to go back to the salary he had before the 3rd April, 1923, to assess the basis on which his compensation is to be calculated. I know that the draftsman intended that this should only apply to promotion of officers.  But in railway grading promotion from one class to another is called promotion, and will be so interpreted if the Schedule remains as it is, and that is why I move the deletion of these words.  Such a clause did not find its way into the British Act, and it is an extraordinary thing to try and penalise hundreds of the staff to meet the case of a few individuals unless it can be alleged that people got promotion to qualify for compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Senator has saved me from all these burnt offerings of railwaymen being presented to me.  I have no intention of any man's rights being defeated. This clause is a very difficult one.  We had it argued at every stage of the Bill, but the point was not put so clearly as it has been put by Senator O'Farrell. He has quite rightly stated the object. <Col N="581" /> A certain warning was issued to the railway companies by the Government that the railway amalgamation was to take place and the companies were warned that any appointments to permanent official positions should not be made after the Government's warning. Now certain appointments have been made and the object of the clause is to get rid of these appointments.  But it might go too far and much too far. It would, apparently, as interpreted cut out clerks who progressed from one class to another in the ordinary course of promotion or a fireman who is promoted to the position of engine-driver and there is no intention to include that kind of case at all.</P>
      <P>If the Senator would think an amendment would meet the purpose by putting in words such as these: &ldquo;Other than promotions within the agreement as to rates of pay and conditions of service arrived at between the railway company's representatives and the railway trades unions.&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, some phrase which would safeguard ordinary promotions or promotion in the ordinary course of events&mdash;if an amendment of that type were acceptable I could consult the Senator as to the terms of it.  I am quite agreeable to bring in such an amendment on the Report Stage, after the terms of it have been approved of by the Senator and myself.  If I can not get a phrase to suit his point of view I will bring in one of my own and let him argue his point on the Fourth Stage.</P>

      <P>It has been stated by Senator O'Farrell that an official promoted during the year prior to the 3rd April, 1924, would be debarred from this privilege, or that he must go back to his previous year's salary.  That is the specified year, the year ending the 3rd April, 1924.  There may be opportunity taken to promote during that year persons in this service for the purpose of enabling them to get the extra benefit of pension.  I take it that the clause as it stands would not debar the person promoted after the 3rd April, 1924.  That date is passed now, and a person promoted to-day and receiving the higher salary would rank for pension. The clause as it stands only applies <Col N="582" /> to persons promoted during the year ended 3rd April, 1924.  That period is passed, and any persons promoted since that date would rank for pension and for compensation on the salary they were receiving at the time the event happened.  I presume that is the literal interpretation of the clause as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion of the Minister goes a good way to meet the case except that it would still, I am afraid, involve an injustice to certain sections of men.  For instance, there are the staffs of the solicitor's department, the secretary's department, and the general manager's department, who are exempt from the agreements negotiated by the trade unions.  Almost invariably they are members of a trade union, but the union does not act for them in a trade union capacity except for legal purposes and so on.  Any promotion governing them&mdash;many of them clerks &mdash;in these departments would not count.  I do not know whether it would be considered fair, where an officer gets promoted to another job to which he was absolutely entitled by his services or merits during this particular year, that that would not count also.  However, although some of these officers are members of the association of which I am secretary, I do not want to press the case on their behalf.  I see that there are people here who are their colleagues, and they have not spoken on their behalf.  If they do not choose to do so, I do not think it is part of my duty to act for them, beyond pointing out to the Minister that in my opinion it is a great injustice that they will be deprived of the benefit of any promotion they got in this particular year, while any man promoted since the 3rd April this year will get the benefits of that promotion. As I have said, however, the trade union does not act for them, and as some of their colleagues here have not thought fit to speak for them it is their look out.  I agree with the suggestion of the Minister to withdraw this amendment and consult with him as to what would be the best form of amendment on Report.</P>

      <Col N="584" /> The object of this amendment is to ensure that a solicitor who has been employed by any of the railway companies shall be entitled to the same compensation as if he had been a whole-time officer.  I understand that some of the railway companies employed solicitors and paid them the ordinary rates.  They were not employed on a salary but they were practically whole-time officers of the company and were paid fees instead of a fixed salary.  The object of the amendment is to secure that a solicitor employed by a company and paid fees shall be entitled to compensation. Some of these solicitors were doing a little private practice as well, but dispensary doctors engaged in private practice although they are paid officials of the local councils, if disturbed in their positions are entitled to compensation.  In all these circumstances, I think the amendment is a reasonable one and should be accepted.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, I have been asked by Senator Dr. O'Sullivan, who has an amendment down immediately succeeding this one, to inquire whether Senator Farren would agree to amend his amendment as follows: after &ldquo;absorbed company&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;or a committee of a county council working same.&rdquo;  That would make the clause read &ldquo;For the purpose of this Schedule, any solicitor who for the period of five years next before the date of the passing of this Act has been continuously retained by an amalgamating or absorbed company or by a committee of a county council working same.&rdquo; That is to take the place of amendment 55, which immediately follows.  If you turn up Section 54 of the main Act&mdash; that is the Act defining baronial railways, which are vested in the county council&mdash;sub-section (a) says: &ldquo;The shareholders for the time being of the company to which such undertaking properly belonged immediately before the same became the property of the grand jury or county council, shall be deemed to be the proprietors of the said railway.&rdquo;  I think I am correct in saying there are only two of these light railways which were taken over by the county council and which are worked by a committee of the same. The main Act provides that where that <Col N="585" /> has taken place, the shareholders of the company shall be still deemed to be the proprietors of the undertaking.  If the company, while it existed, had a solicitor, as soon as the line ceased to be vested in the company, and was vested in the committee of the county council, that solicitor became their officer and unless this amendment is accepted, any such solicitor will be completely deprived of compensation.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister deals with this proposition, perhaps with the permission of the House I might be allowed to say a word in favour of some consideration for these gentlemen, owing to my long association with the members of the solicitors' profession.  The position is peculiar in this respect&mdash;that some of these railway companies employed solicitors who were bound to give their whole time to the duties of their office, but in the majority of those cases these gentlemen are or were members of a firm, and they were able, therefore, to give their entire time to the business of the particular railway company, while their partners in the firm were carrying on the general business in which they also had an interest.  While they were giving their whole time to the duties of the railway company, their firm at the same time was carrying on business of a general kind.  In some cases the solicitor was not in a sense paid a salary, but he was paid the usual fees.  For all practical purposes, the distinction was very little, and the number of gentlemen who would be affected by this amendment if it were passed would, I understand, certainly not exceed ten.  I do not know whether I am rightly instructed or not, but in a letter I have received from one of them that is the statement made to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would involve about ten persons.  One of them has served a railway company for fortyone years, his father having served them for thirty years previously.  The second one, who also has written to me on the subject, has served for thirtyone years consecutively as solicitor to one of these amalgamated companies. I think their case is one that deserves some consideration.  I am not now talking of pensions.  I am not talking <Col N="586" /> of compensation, but these are persons who ought to receive some consideration at the hands of the Government. What form it should take would be a matter for the Government, but I do not think their case ought to be ruled out merely on the ground that they are not whole-time officers, because, as I have pointed out, whether they were whole-time officers or not, they would still have carried on their ordinary business through a partner or through the firm.  In one or two cases the persons concerned, on being appointed salaried officials, sold their interest in the business.  That came practically to the same thing as if they had allowed the money to remain with the firm and received profits in the ordinary way. I think the case is one that is really deserving of sympathy on the part of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I think the Government might consider this matter favourably, or, at any rate, in a friendly spirit.  I think there is a good deal in what the Senator has drawn attention to.  I know at least one case which I think is a case of hardship and which this amendment would relieve. I do not suggest the steps the Government ought to take in the matter, but I think that possibly something might be done on Report to meet what undoubtedly, in my humble judgement, is a case of hardship.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the solicitor who has had the 38 years' service in a particular railway company, and who has written me a number of letters corresponding to the 38 years' service, must also have written a considerable number of letters to members of both Houses.  He has succeeded in putting his case on an entirely wrong footing.  He has changed his ground several times. First of all, he insisted that there were absolutely guaranteed rights of his which were being defeated under the Bill.  When that contention was proved wrong, he came along with an <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal and insisted that his number of years should be taken into account.  I have not seen any argument yet advanced why I should seek to make provision in the Bill for a man <Col N="587" /> who has had a very good client for 38 years from whom he has received full fees.  I get back to my old contention that pension is deferred pay, and if this solicitor had come along and based his appeal on the ground that he had made arrangements for being attached to the railway company and that in the hopes of pension afterwards he would accept fees lower than his ordinary professional charges, he would have been on stronger ground.  I do not know if he would not have brought himself within the grip of the Incorporated Law Society by so doing.  But he received the full fees for 38 years, at any moment of which his services might have been dispensed with by the particular railway company or at any moment of which another solicitor might have been taken on to act in conjunction with him or the work might have been divided up amongst a number of solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because a man has been fortunate enough to enjoy a lucrative form of employment for 38 years, he puts it to me that I should add to that great stroke of luck and give him a gratuity.  There are no cases known to me where anybody will come under the Bill because he is a member of a firm, that firm being attached to a railway company. The only case catered for under the Bill is that of an individual who has been a whole-time solicitor to a railway company.  His rights are properly looked after under the Bill.  We do not intend to compensate a firm or a member of a firm who have been acting for a railway company, and if that appears to be a provision of the Bill we will see to it that it is changed.  There are, I think, three railways affected by the point raised by Senator Barrington&mdash; railways taken over by county councils&mdash;the Tralee and Dingle Railway, the Schull and Skibbereen Railway, and the Donoughmore Extension.  That is a minor point.  Whether the man is a solicitor acting for a Committee of Management which has taken over a railway company or whether he is a solicitor to a county council which may have to run a railway, or whether he is solicitor to a railway company does not matter.  They are all on the same footing.  They have been paid full fees for services rendered.  They <Col N="588" /> have got adequate remuneration for their services, and there is no necessity to give them anything further in the way of gratuity.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that while a solicitor may not nominally be a fulltime officer, the railway company have first call on his services and must occupy a considerable amount of his time. His ordinary business must necessarily be neglected, and I think there is a case for sympathetic consideration.  There is really something worthy of consideration in the amendment.  All these solicitors have not had 38 years service.  Some young solicitors have given the best years of their life to the railway companies, who had practically a monopoly of their services.</P>

      <P>The real difficulty is with regard to the full charges and fees which have been paid to these solicitors. Although the payments are made by fees, are they of the full scale, or is there any working arrangement between the solicitor and the company by which the company agree to give him their business at reduced fees?  If the Minister is right, and if the solicitor is paid the full scale, as if each bit of business was fresh business, I think the Minister has made practically an unanswerable case.  If, however, there is any agreement between the company and the solicitor, because of their giving him all their work there is a reduced scale of fees, which would lessen his remuneration, there seems something to be said in favour of the amendment.  I would like, however, to hear whether there is anything of that sort in existence.</P>

      <P>I do not think that there is any half-way house between a salaried solicitor and a solicitor who receives the ordinary statutory fees.  I doubt very much if any arrangement, such as that suggested, would not be in violation of the principles upon which solicitors run their profession.  I think that any such <Col N="589" /> agreement as has been referred to would be regarded as a breach of professional etiquette.  What I had in my mind was this: these gentlemen who are not paid salaries but fees, were it not for the actual introduction of this Bill, would, in the normal course of events, have continued to earn those fees for the remainder of their lives. This Bill, however, cuts across that, and whether their remuneration was greater than if they received whole-time salaries, the Bill has deprived them of what, in the ordinary course of events, they would have enjoyed in time to come.  With regard to a whole-time solicitor, I am satisfied that in every case in which his firm are carrying on business in the ordinary way, he dissociates himself, so far as the business is concerned, from doing anything else than carrying on the business of the company, but when he is a member, or partner, of a firm carrying on business, he will be entitled to his share of the profits.  There seems to me to be very little distinction from that point of view between the merits of the two cases, but I thought that I would bring the matter before the House, so far as my own experience would help them in considering it.</P>

      <P>In this respect I do not think the railway companies have any objection to paying compensation, or at least I have known none. We have been told that this is a private enterprise and that there should be no undue interference on the part of the State as to what they should do. To that extent I do not think that we should come between the companies doing what they consider fair and just by their employees.  It is really a matter whether a man is employed on ordinary employment or piecework. <Col N="590" /> Some companies have one way of doing it, and other companies have another. The net result is that a man is deprived of income to which otherwise he would be entitled and which, under normal circumstances, he would enjoy for the rest of his life.  The question whether it is salary or fee is immaterial so far as the man is concerned.  The Minister stated that a solicitor might make arrangements with the company to get a pension.  That is not correct, as he could not so arrange, unless he became a salaried officer.  I think that if the companies themselves, weighing up all the circumstances, decide that they should make some sort of compensation to the man we should not come between them in doing what is an obvious act of justice.</P>

      <P>To come to Senator O'Farrell's point, if the company which employs a particular solicitor wishes to compensate him, that company can do so before it is amalgamated, and while it is an amalgamating or a company about to be absorbed it can do whatever it likes with its employees. If the company is well enough disposed to a solicitor to grant him a pension well and good.  The Senator stated further that if a solicitor were entitled to a pension he would have to be compensated, and it is on that point that I split with him.  He is not entitled. I know of one solicitor who is a solicitor to a railway company, and he will continue to be employed.  He is at present employed by one of the amalgamating companies, and there is every likelihood that he will continue to be so employed.  No solicitor, except a whole-time one, is entitled to a pension. There is no whole-time solicitor known to us who is a member of a firm. In every case it is an individual.</P>

      <P>I am glad of your previous assistance, sir.  With reference to the question raised by Senator Jameson, I had put it the other way, that I do not think a man could agree to take lesser fees than his ordinary charges without coming under the control of the Incorporated Law Society.  Full fees to our knowledge have been paid, and that is why I hold <Col N="591" /> there is no case at all.  I cannot imagine that a barrister who has been fed with briefs by solicitors for 38 years, after enjoying those briefs should come to them and say, &ldquo;I am getting old and did good work for you.  Why not compensate me now for your failure in the future?  I am getting weak and in my old age.&rdquo;  I think that would be ludicrous.</P>

He says there is nothing which prevents the company compensating these people.  In the case of the railways, take the position of a committee of the county council. There is legislation for that.  If they compensated the man who has lost his job the county council would be surcharged. The point of the matter is this: a solicitor is appointed by a resolution as a solicitor of the company.  If his salary is according to the amount of work he does, or at a certain fixed sum, I do not think it matters at all.  The county council is prevented from paying him by the operation of the ordinary law.  Why a provision should not be put in which would entitle him to compensation under this Bill is more than I can understand.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the Tenth Schedule to insert at the commencement of the Schedule the words &ldquo;31 and 32 Vict. ch. 119, the Regulation of Railways Act, 1868, Section 34.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment of the Earl of Kerry, and he aims at the removal of an existing evil.  This Schedule in this Bill that we are considering provides that certain enactments shall not apply to the amalgamated company, and it is sought by this amendment to add to that list a certain amount of the Regulations of the Railways Act of 1868.  So long as that part of that Act continues to apply to the amalgamated company that company would have to supply a shareholder's address book to any shareholder who applied for it at the price of 5s.  There would be about 36,000 shareholders in this amalgamated company, and I think that it is obvious to this House that 5s. is a totally inadequate price to charge for that book.  Perhaps a few dozen would be asked for in the course of a year, and they could not be sold at anything like 5s.  I do not know what the price would be, but I suggest it might quite well be in the neighbourhood of £20 or £30 a copy.  The cost is large.  If the amendment is passed, no real harm will be done to any shareholder of the amalgamated company.  He would be in the same position as the shareholder of any ordinary commercial company, and such shareholders are protected I believe by Section 10 of the Companies Clauses Act of 1845, which gives them the right to read the list of shareholders' addresses, the right to persue the address book at any time they like, and obtain a copy of part of it they like at the rate of 6d. a hundred words. That was considered a reasonable charge in 1845, and if it were a reasonable charge then it could not be considered an excessive one now.  The amendment is simply directed at the removal of what is an abuse, of what is of no real benefit to anyone and which involves a waste of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where I do not find it acceptable.  Because if 40 had been moved it definitely did substitute for the address book provided under a particular clause of the Companies Consolidation Act a card index, and it went on to say that the charge would not exceed the sum of £10.  I had intended accepting that amendment if it were further amended so as to have it reduced to £2 10s. or £1, according as the Seanad thought <Col N="595" /> fit.  If we take this amendment do we leave it to the amalgamated company to charge anything they like for these address books?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. BAGWELL Mr. BAGWELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I would like to explain that it is not intended to have the amalgamated company put in a position to charge anything they like, but to charge at the rate of 6d. for each 100 words.  What that would work out at in the case of a shareholders' address book of 36,000 names and addresses, I am not in a position to calculate at the moment.  It would be a very considerable cost.  I claim that this amendment is not depriving anybody of any rights of real consequence. Any shareholder of an ordinary company can obtain all the information he desires by perusing the book, which at any time he has a right to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You see, my difficulty is that the only amendment I have before me is to insert a certain Act in the Schedule, which is to a certain extent a repealing Act.  There is nothing about a charge of 6d. per 100 names or whatever it may be.  If this amendment was brought in to have this particular Act included in the Schedule, and have in substitution for it, some amendment corresponding to amendment 40, which was not moved, then the two taken together would be acceptable.  But to bring in an Act which would, in effect, allow the amalgamated company to charge any price they like for a list, is not acceptable.  I have expressed my point of view with regard to amendment 40 and this amendment.  Amendment 56 is acceptable, and amendment 40 is acceptable taken with it, if the sum of £10 be made either £2 10s. or £1.  I think there is a lot to be said for amendment 40.  I understand that in one railway in Ireland the full cost of the address book came to £250 for printing, and they sold ten copies, for which they got £2 10s.  That is what the sale came to.  That was obviously not right, and if the whole Bill were amended by some such amendment as 40 and 56 both taken together it would be acceptable, but <Col N="596" /> this latter amendment alone would not be acceptable.</P>

    <Title>SEANAD RESUMES. - FINANCE BILL, 1924.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> Question proposed&mdash;&ldquo;That this Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that this important Bill will have to be discussed in the absence of the Minister for Finance who, I understand, is indisposed. Although the Seanad has no specific power over finance, still it has a very important duty to discharge in criticising and reviewing, and, if necessary, recommending changes in matters of finance.  Because in finance, reason is very powerful, and any wrong course pursued would undoubtedly bring its own penalties and those very swiftly.  Now, I wish to take first this question of income tax which occupies a distinct section in the Bill, and which deals with a very important question.  I do not propose to press the general question that we are taxed too highly. I think that is generally agreed.  But the whole issue must be dominated by the fact that the Minister must balance his Budget, and it is far better to have our Budget balanced than to have low taxation; that is to say, the balancing of the Budget must predominate.  Necessarily, reduction in the expenditure is the only other alternative to high taxation if we are to balance our Budget, and is the course we should prefer.  On the question of income tax this country is unfortunately situated, owing to the fact that a large amount of money bearing income tax is invested outside the country, and is liable in the first instance to deductions for taxes in the country abroad, and is taxed in both countries.  The result is that it is necessary to go through very complicated regulations in order to get relief.  I am not saying that the Government have not done all they could to mitigate this hardship, but the hardships undoubtedly remain, and they have very prejudicially affected the taxpayers in this country.  I go so far as to say, as to income tax regulations at present, it is not double taxation we have, but a treble tax.  For investors, except in matters of the simplest character, will have to seek expert advice in order to secure any relief.  That is an imposition on the taxpayer, who in <Col N="598" /> many cases will have to seek bank accommodation to tide him over the period during which he is seeking to recover money overpaid already.  For this accommodation he has to pay, because the banks do not lend money for nothing.  In addition, there is the tax itself.  I cannot help feeling that with goodwill on both sides&mdash;and I have no reason for saying that there is not goodwill on both sides&mdash;the matter can be very much simplified by establishing something in the nature of a clearing house or one office by which all these recoveries of income tax could be dealt with at the same time and adjustments made, and avoid having to go to two separate Departments in two separate countries to obtain this much-needed relief.</P>
      <P>On the question of income tax generally, and of the possible change in income tax policy leading, perhaps, to the reduction of either income tax or super tax, it is very difficult to put forward any reasoned criticism on account of the absence of satisfactory figures.  We have got items of income tax set out in the returns with no reference as to what years those receipts cover, what proportion of the receipts constitutes arrears, and what proportion arises out of the current investment for the year under review.  In that respect I would call the attention of the Government to the delay in issuing the report of the Revenue Commissioners. It is a companion volume to the Appropriation Accounts.  We have had the Appropriation Accounts for the year 1922-23 but we have not yet had any report from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>It is from the Revenue Commissioners' report that you get information in relation to income tax and certain data on which you can criticise income tax policy.  I hope the Government will speed up the issuing of that report, which is very important at the present time.  It will show what the tendency is with regard to investments. Some of us fear there is a very considerable migration of capital from this country, due largely to these vexatious income tax regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I pass to another matter.  I will go into further detail in regard to it on the Committee Stage.  It is a <Col N="599" /> somewhat technical matter, and if the Seanad will allow me I would like to prepare the ground.  Under the Bill, what was hitherto known as statutory allowance for repairs has been withdrawn, or very considerably modified. It is in Section 2 set out that where a tax is charged in respect of a house or building or parts of a house or building, no allowance or reduction shall be made under paragraph (b) of sub-rule (1) of rule 7 of No. 5 of Schedule A of the Income Tax Act, 1918.  I only mention that to show you how complicated this is; yet this is the sort of thing that people anxious to recover income tax have to deal with.  The phraseology is similar to this.</P>
    <P>The section goes on to read: &ldquo;of Schedule A of the Income Tax Act, 1918, or under Section 24 of the Finance Act, 1922, unless it is proved to the satisfaction of the Special Commissioners that the whole of the property in respect of which the tax is charged is <i>bona fide</i> let by the landlord or immediate lessor.&rdquo;  I only quote portions of the section to show you how involved it is.  The Minister for Finance bases his argument for this change on the fact that the annual value, which is the basis of assessment in Ireland, bears no relation to the true value.  I challenge that here and now and specifically.  In the case of old valuations that may be true, but in the case of houses recently built it is not true.  I had the misfortune to build a house recently and I claim my valuation is the full letting value, yet I am now to be deprived of the statutory allowance for repairs.  That is one-sixth, and I would get that if I chose to let the house to a tenant.  I say that is inequitable.</P>
    <P>This goes further.  There is the case of residents in the country who occupy houses&mdash;you might call them demesnes or big houses&mdash;where the expense of upkeep is very great, and where the attendant expenses outside are also very great.  The expenses of living generally are very great, even though they may be of an exceedingly unselfish character. The owner has to support a large number of employees, partly because he considers it a public duty.  The hardship of those country residents has been <Col N="600" /> admitted for a long time.  Mr. Lloyd George, in the days when his pet aversion was Dukes, went out of his way to admit that the country gentlemen were entitled to special sympathy in the matter of taxation.  He went so far as to introduce a provision to the effect that all the money spent on repairs, and not merely the one-sixth statutory reduction, should be allowed as a set off against income tax.  That is also in No. 5 of Schedule A, and in sub-section (1) of sub-rule (8) it is set out that if the owner of any land or house shows that the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management, according to the average of the preceding five years, has exceeded in the case of land one-eighth or in the case of buildings one-sixth, he is entitled to a reduction of assessment.</P>
    <P>Without any reference whatever to this in the Dáil, and under cover of an innocent and limited amendment, the whole of the benefits of rule 8 have been taken away.  I speak for a shattered remnant.  They are people who, I claim, have done their duty by remaining in the country when they might have spent their money elsewhere on their own personal amusement. They have had to bear very heavy charges in connection with the upkeep and attendant expenses of their houses.  It seems cruel that those people, after all they have gone through, both under the Land Act and other kinds of legislation, are now without any word of explanation going to have the benefits, the liberal and almost radical benefits&mdash;the Chancellor for the Exchequer gave them&mdash;taken away. I do hope, before the Report Stage is reached, the Government will reconsider this matter and see whether they cannot by some form of words, at least allow those statutory deductions to continue to apply to the residents on big estates who are doing their duty under very great difficulties at the present moment.  I would further add that the same class has been hit by another measure.  Those who have had to shut up their houses, who have been unable to continue to live in them, have now, under the Rent Restriction Act, to pay rates on empty houses.  Of course, the Government may say that these people <Col N="601" /> are not much of an asset, that they do not produce much in the country, that all the tendency is for them to go away, and a little more or less now will not keep them from doing so.  If that is their policy well and good; some of us claim that they are the greatest civilising influence&mdash;such as remain&mdash;in our country life to-day.</P>
    <P>We notice in this Bill a departure from what I might call the traditional fiscal policy of Free Trade.  Now, this is a very big question, and for my sins I have waded through, perhaps not too scrupulously, the debates on this matter in the other House.  I assure you that I do not intend to follow a certain example that was set there of examining this matter in excessive detail.  I would, however, point out that this policy of Protection, which the Government classes as an experiment, is not supported by the conclusions reached&mdash; I will not say the recommendations made, because they made none&mdash;by the experts the Government appointed to examine the problem.  It is a very complex problem, and I have no doubt that there is room for honest doubt on both sides.  However, I wish to make the case that this country is an exporting country, and that as trade is a matter of exchange the more we can sell the more we can buy, and the volume of this trade is the measure of our prosperity. The more costly our products the less the volume of commodities we can receive in exchange and also the lower standard of living in consequence of our lower national wealth.  That is, roughly, the case.  When you come to examine that from the point of view of agriculture, which is our main industry, what do you find?  Anything that will increase the cost of production of agricultural produce will decrease the buying power of our agricultural exports, which are our main, almost our only exports, and as a result our volume of trade will shrink.  We, agriculturists, allege that this policy of Protection is going to increase the cost of living.  It has increased the cost of living already, and the cost of living affects the cost of our production.</P>
    <P>High labour costs, high cost of the farmer's own personal living, high costs of his own raw material, including boots&mdash;very much an item of the farmer's <Col N="602" /> raw material&mdash;will all go to increase the farmer's cost of production, and the farmer will do either of two things.  He will either get less in exchange for what he produces, because it will cost more, or else he will cut down his working expenses, produce less, and turn his land back to grass, throwing his labour on to the unemployed market.  Therefore we say that on the balance of advantages this policy of Protection, although it may be only the thin edge of the wedge, is wrong.  I know that it is argued that if we get an industrial population within our shores we can sell our food to them. We say that during the time you are trying to set up these industries within our shores you are increasing the cost of living and prejudicing our main industry, which is agriculture.  That is, crudely, so far as I can put it, more or less the pure and theoretical argument; but there is another, perhaps a more important argument, and that is the human or Party argument.</P>
    <P>If you are going to have tariffs at all, and you can make out, no doubt, a theortical case for tariffs, it is essentially a scientific matter.  It is an endless problem, and if it can be dealt with at all, even to a limited extent, it should be dealt with scientifically by people divorced altogether from the hurly-burly of party politics and of various things that operate between parties, and I submit that this policy of Protection is rendered doubly difficult by these public discussions on the hustings, and even in what we call a democratic assembly.  You open the door to all kinds of party bargaining, pull, and influence of every sort and kind, log-rolling and vote manipulation of every conceivable kind, whereas if you stand firmly on this doctrine of Free Trade you know where you are.  You at least cut out all that, and you have your duties for your revenue purposes only, although I know some people who will argue as to what are revenue purposes. It is pretty hard to define them. Still, broadly speaking, it is generally agreed what revenue duties are and what protective duties are.  I cannot see what the present inhibitions really are on the development of industries within our State.  I see that Arthur Guinness and Sons, in the face of open <Col N="603" /> competition of the world, with big competitive interests on the other side, have built up a very satisfactory business, and they never wanted Protection.  I see that Jacob and Co. have done likewise. They have to import certain of their raw materials.  They seem to be in a very satisfactory and flourishing condition.  For the life of me I cannot see, if these two businesses have prospered, why other people cannot do the same.  It is due rather to what the Minister for Agriculture referred to the other day as the feeling of insecurity, which is something intangible, something that cannot be exactly described. There is a hesitation on the part of people to start business in Ireland, and I do not think they are going to get over the hesitation by what I might call even artificial stimulants.  You will get over it by low taxation, by reducing your income tax by two or three shillings, as we fondly hoped we would have been able to do in our new State. Also you must, if you are going to get industry to return, have a solicitous regard for the rights of property different from that seen in legislation since the creation of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill for precisely the reasons that Senator Sir John Keane finds fault with it.  He has told us that this country must rely on its predominant industry, agriculture. It so happened, unfortunately, that owing to the illness of a relative of mine I had to go to Cheshire about 20 or 25 times last year, and I was convinced in my views by the destruction of cattle owing to foot and mouth disease. I would ask Senator Sir John Keane to consider what the effect of such a visitation on this country would be.  If there were anything at all comparable to the destruction in Cheshire this country must almost inevitably have gone bankrupt.  Agriculture is a very great and important industry, and I have no doubt it will continue so, but if we should be so one-legged as to advocate a policy which will make us dependent on an industry which is subject to such a visitation as that to which I referred, it is, to my mind, a very grave matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> Of course, anything that adds to the cost of production is a disadvantage in trade.  For that reason every tax of any kind or sort is bound, to some extent, to limit the effectiveness of the producer in the foreign market.  In my recollection we have always had taxes on tea, sugar and other articles which we do not or cannot produce.  Inasmuch as these taxes are on articles which we do not produce and cannot produce, that taxation increases the cost of the article which we produce here.  In this measure an attempt has been made to put a tax on the articles which are capable of being produced here, and inasmuch as we produce the articles here we retain in the country the wages paid in the production of these articles even though the cost of them may be a little more than we would have to pay for them to a person outside.  Let us look at the alternative.  There are men employed here on the articles which are taxed, but if we repeal these taxes these men must become idle, and then they get what, I think, is commonly called, but, in my opinion, incorrectly called, the dole.  Is not that, I ask, a tax on production?  It is the most vicious form of a tax on production, because it is a tax for paying men who are willing to work and paying men to do nothing.  I would ask the Seanad to consider these proposals from that point of view and to look at the circumstances in that light.  I have the pleasure of knowing the Committee of Experts appointed by the Government to enquire into this matter.  As Senator Sir John Keane remarked, this Committee of experts made no recommendation, but they certainly came to some conclusions and gave some arguments and pointers for their faith in what has been described as the traditional Free Trade policy.  It so happens that the one industry that they suggested might be protected with advantage happened to be the industry in which one of the members of the Committee was engaged in at one time himself.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary the wisdom that comes from a little practical experience. The condition of affairs, apart from the suggestions which the Committee made, that obtains in the country to-day is the outcome of the great <Col N="605" /> war which devastated Europe in men, money and material.  It was that, that for a number of years recently brought about the extraordinary condition of affairs all over Europe that we have had experience of.  In many areas you had large potential machinery for production, while in other areas you had a large demand but no machinery to supply that demand.  I am addressing myself now to the conditions that obtained in England and in Germany.  In England you had an enormous supply of raw material and an enormous variety of plant for the manufacture of articles for which there was a great demand in Germany.  Owing to causes, which I certainly could not understand, currency and exchange went to such an abnormal pitch that there was no basis of relation to the exchange between the supply in England and the demand in Germany.  I have taken England and Germany as an illustration, but the same condition of affairs would be true to a great extent of every other country, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>During the war I exported produce to France, while, in the ordinary course a few years ago, I bought from France.  In the same way I exported to Canada, while for many years before I bought from Canada.  The whole condition of economic affairs was abnormal all over the world, and if we are to continue to attach ourselves pedantically to what has been described as the traditional Free State policy, I think we would be doing wrong.  This, at all events, is an interesting experiment which, I think, might be very carefully and widely increased.  I support the Bill as far as this experiment is concerned. I regret the extra high taxation which cripples production, and in as much as it cripples production, it cripples you in the market, where you have to compete with foreigners.  We know that very regrettable things have occured which make that position for the present, at all events, inevitable; but it is desirable to balance the Budget, and it is that that accounts for the present high taxation.  As far as we can maintain the promotion of industry and wages in this country by the protective suggestions in this Bill, I think the measure is one that is deserving of support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no pretentions to be an economist or to have any experience in industrial affairs, but I do think that the introduction of the principle of protection in this Bill is so important, and I feel so interested in it, that I feel bound to say something about it.  The great fact to be remembered is that this country is now a predominantly agricultural country, and there are many reasons why, in my opinion, it will always remain so.  One of these reasons is that it is perhaps the finest cattle-producing country in the world.  It has great natural advantages in that direction, but it has not natural advantages as an industrial country; rather, it has very marked disadvantages.  Everyone in the country gets his living from agriculture in some form or another.</P>
      <P>If I thought that a measure of Protection in this country were likely to cause certain industries to arise here, and that it would be sufficiently healthy and full of vitality to enable a really flourishing export trade in manufactured articles to be created, I would say that there was a great deal to be said for this Protection, but I do not think that that is at all likely to happen. What is likely to happen, and what is already happening on a small scale, is this, that the more Protection we have and the more we see of it, the more the great majority of the inhabitants of this country are going to pay for many of the necessaries of life.  I have one qualification to make on this subject.  During my life I have changed my mind many times on the question of the relative merits of Protection or Free Trade.  Now that I have got a little older and perhaps wiser, I feel certain that in the case of Ireland the interests of the nation as a whole will not be served by Protection, but that they will be served by Free Trade.  The great fact we have got to remember is this, that our big export trade is in cattle, and these cattle are sold in a country outside of our control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very tempting invitation, but I do not propose to accept it, to enter on the controversy of Free Trade and Protection in the course of our discussions on the Finance Bill.  The question is a <Col N="607" /> very big one, but the Seanad in its present numbers does not seem to be disposed to discuss a question so complicated and so abstruse.  This is the first Budget which we have had which gives us any indication as to what may perhaps be the future fiscal policy of this country, and therefore we cannot allow it to pass without saying something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice, by the way, that the English Chancellor of the Exchequer, the day before yesterday I think it was, at a meeting of the Cobden Club, had some very hard things to say about Protectionists generally.  I was surprised that the English Chancellor of the Exchequer should say such unkind things about anybody.  However, I shall leave our tariff reformers in this country to deal with him, and probably they will give him a Roland for his Oliver.  The only remark I would like to offer on this Bill is that it gives us a rather interesting indication of the lines upon which the fiscal policy of this country may proceed in the future, and I am not at all sure that the lines upon which the fiscal policy will proceed are those which are accepted by the people who superficially investigated this Budget.  We are certainly in the experimental stage in all these matters.  Most of us have not made up our minds, and certainly the country has not considered the question at all.  It is very interesting, and I think very useful, that certain experiments should be made from time to time, and the Finance Minister is the person to do so, so that we may discover in which direction lies the real fiscal interests of the country.  I do not think we need frighten ourselves with bugbears about the effect that a certain amount of protection of Irish industries may have upon Irish industries as a whole, or Irish employment, or upon the Irish financial position. We are beginning quite newly to discuss our own problems from our own point of view and the only way we can arrive at the proper solution of these various questions is by experimenting upon them, and so long as the experiments are not very drastic and do not go deeper than is necessary, I think we should welcome these experiments as <Col N="608" /> to what we as a nation want, born of our own experience.  What is called Protection in the scheme of the Budget is consistent, I think, and extremely well devised.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I would like to refer to is the question of income tax.  Most people have come to the conclusion that this income tax question is an unmitigated nuisance, and I am certain that the Finance Minister is strongly of that opinion.  We must expect in the beginning of our work of national self-government inconvenience and troubles of this sort, but it comes to this, that this question is a matter of regulation between the two Governments.  It is not a question on which the outside public can do very much, except to grumble at the incidence of this taxation, but I do say that it is time both of these Governments came to some rational arrangement, and to the inevitable amendment of the law in relation to this matter on both sides of the Channel.  After all, it is very hard lines on people who have money invested in British securities or other securities that they should have to pay 4s. 6d. to the English and 2s. 9d. to the Irish Exchequer, that is, something over 7s. out of the £, and most people in Ireland are not millionaires.  When they are told the income tax will eventually come back they will not thank you for the information.  All I want to say is the sooner the two Governments can arrive at an arrangement on this matter, and the sooner the two Governments can agree to amend the law in relation to the incidence of income tax, the better for them both, and certainly the better for the unfortunate citizens who have to pay income tax.</P>

      <P>I propose to ask the Seanad, after we have disposed of the Bills under discussion this evening, to dispose of the Lausanne Treaty, and probably after that it will be time to call upon Senator McLoughlin to move his motion on the adjournment, of which he gave notice.  But before that, and preliminary to it, I would like to go through the Bills down for Second Reading, because the <Col N="609" /> majority of them, I think, will be noncontroversial, and at any rate I think we ought to advance them a stage so as to be able to take them in Committee next week.  If that course is adopted I do not think there would remain sufficient on our agenda to form a working day to-morrow, and I suggest to the House that the more reasonable thing to do would be to adjourn to-day until Wednesday next at 11 o'clock.  I do not see any reason for losing half a day on Wednesday, because we will have at least two days' very heavy work next week.  I shall now go through the Bills down to Second Reading Stage, and if no Senator wishes to discuss any of these on Second Reading, or if there is no desire expressed for discussion on any of them I shall put the Second Reading Stages through.</P>

      <P>Before we resume the debate on the Finance Bill I think we might take the final stage of the Gárda Síochána Bill.  It has been discussed in Committee and on Report, and it is down now for Fifth Stage, and I imagine the House will be agreeable to let it go through now.  There is some urgency, I understand, about the Bill.</P>

      <P>It strikes me that the discussion on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill is bound to be more or less a barren discussion. We have no power to refuse a Second Reading to it, and it is merely to register their opinion I suppose that Senators have made short speeches upon this Bill.  I wish at any rate to record my opinion, which is that the fiscal <Col N="611" /> policy which has been followed in this country for about 80 years cannot show such results as would justify the continuance of that policy now when we have the power to adopt a fiscal policy suited to the needs of the country.  Our industries, or mose of them, are ruined and our population is reduced to one half.  Some of the Senators who spoke from the agricultural point of view expressed an opinion not dissimilar to that which formed the leading point of an article in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; of the 12th June, and which contained this passage:&mdash;&ldquo;For all practical purposes, during the lifetime of the present generation at any rate the Free State will have only one industry and only one customer.&rdquo;  I cannot think that Senators would be voicing the opinion of the country if they were to endorse that statement, and yet the continuance of the fiscal policy that has obtained in this country until the passing of this Bill in the Dáil must have resulted in the way described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our industries, or many of them. were in a decaying condition, and as to the single customer to whom we were to send our agricultural produce, we must recollect that we have not now for agriculture that protection for our live stock which we had for many years, until the admission of store cattle from Canada on the same conditions that affected store cattle in this country.  I am told they are likely to be dangerous rivals; at any rate it must diminish the demand for our store cattle.  As to increasing the supply of beef cattle, that is not likely to take place without some considerable help from the Government, though we are informed by the Department of Agriculture in their journal that no crop that we can produce under present conditions will pay the cost of production. That means the falling off or decay of tillage and with the decay of tillage it means the creation of more unemployment. If industries are to be allowed to go it means that there is no outlet for our surplus agricultural population except to cross the Atlantic; that surely, from the point of view of the welfare of the State, is not a desirable end, and therefore I have held always and continue to hold that industries in this <Col N="612" /> country must be encouraged and strengthened if necessary by means of protective duties.  Otherwise the State is ill-balanced resting on one leg only, and that is agriculture, and our produce, which we sent to England, is that which gives the least employment, that is cattle off the grass.  There is a statement made by Senator Sir J. Keane which he did not attempt to prove by figures or facts.  He suggests that owing to the very limited measure of protection afforded by the Government in the Finance Bill that the cost of living had increased.</P>
    <P>I have had reports from industries that came in for a measure of Protection that that is absolutely opposite to the fact.  I have particulars as regards two industries, the only industries that really have been so far much affected. One is the boot industry.  We must bear in mind also that the amount of boots that were dumped in this country previous to the duties coming into operation amounted to practically six months' supply for the country.  It would be rather difficult to judge the effects of Protection when 536,000 pairs of boots were dumped in the brief interval between the fixing of the duties and their coming into operation.  I have a letter from one firm of bootmakers, the Lee Boot Manufacturing Company, which states: &ldquo;My firm are turning down no orders that come along and are not behind time in their deliveries. I have sent orders amounting to 2,000 pairs per week since Protection came into being.&rdquo;  Not only are they meeting this demand, but they are prepared to extend their present factories, and should extra trade warrant it they will make still further extensions. That is merely one firm.  As regards the confectionery industry, I had a statement from Williams and Woods, and it is only one of twenty manufacturing companies in connection with the confectionery trade.  &ldquo;Since a measure of protection has been afforded to the confectionery trade we have been extremely busy, and have increased our staff of workers by 150, between reinstating hands who were out owing to slackness, and new hands.  Our building contractors are making considerable additions to our new works.  We are <Col N="613" /> installing new machinery, and expect to considerably increase our output with consequent addition of employment.&rdquo; As regards the soap industry, 1,212 tons of soap, four months' supply, were dumped in this country previous to the duties coming into force.</P>
    <P>In the bottle trade, 200 tons of foreign bottles in the case of one company alone were dumped here.  That shows that manufacturers under these protective duties have not had a fair opportunity of extending their works, but it may be a satisfaction to know that so far none of these trades have increased their prices.  How these protective duties which were made merely as an experiment can be said to have increased the cost of living, I fail to see.  Perhaps when we come to the Committee Stage we can get information on the point, more information than I have been able to get, but I think it well as I have this information in my possession, I should give it to the House.  The principal object of these changes is to provide employment. That is mainly a question concerning labour.  It affects the general taxpayer, because if there is no employment these unfortunate men who are failing to find any means of living must be supported by the State in the form of the dole.  Therefore, whatever measure the Government has introduced in the form of protection, and I am merely speaking of such protection as is afforded by the duties in this Finance Bill must be to the benefit of the country at large, as it does not increase prices, and it provides employment.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the Seanad by a long dissertation on the comparative merits of Protection and Free Trade; both are merely shibboleths. We have no such thing as Free Trade, and never had, nor had England.  Free import is all Free Trade means.  There is no freedom of trade between different countries.  As to agriculture wanting protection, I suppose no industry in the country gets more protection than agriculture.  If you take the Free Trade policy, this <i>laisser faire</i> policy, what justification can there be for the millions now spent in the protection of agriculture?  It is being done by the acquisition of land <Col N="614" /> and the distribution of it, by the improvement of stock, and in the teaching of agriculture.  That is not at all in conformity with the principles of <i>laisser faire</i>, so that for the agriculturists to say that they object to Protection or assistance given to other industries seems to me an inconsistent policy.  I do not wish to do more than to draw your attention to the fact that the resolution which was proposed by Mr. John Milroy, who spoke as President of the Irish Protectionist League, was debated by the Dáil.  It is not suggested that it is committed to an all-round policy of Protection, and if you recollect, the terms of it were as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that the Government, in considering fiscal problems, should have regard not merely to the admittedly restricted view of the matter taken by the Fiscal Enquiry Committee as indicated in the final report, but should examine the problem in the broadest possible aspect, due regard being taken to the factors affecting the general welfare of the Saorstát.&rdquo; That is a matter we all agree with.  The general well-being of the Saorstát is what we are concerned with, and as a means of promoting that well-being I do not see how we could adopt any other method than a limited measure of protection.</P>
    <P>We have this evidence from a well-known English economist.  Mr. John A. Hobson, than whom there is no more robust Free Trader, is responsible for the following statement in one of his most recent publications, &ldquo;The Evolution of Modern Capitalism,&rdquo; page 100:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It must be generally admitted that English industries would not have advanced so rapidly without protection, but as we built up our manufacturing industries by protection, so we undoubtedly conserved and strengthened them by free trade; first, by the remission of tariffs upon the raw material of manufacture and the machine making, and later on by the free admission of food-stuffs, which were a prime essential to a nation destined to specialise in manufacture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think most people in the country assume that when we can control our own destinies the first object to which <Col N="615" /> the efforts of the Government could be devoted would be to build up our industries, and, as you will recognise from this quotation, the industries of England were built up under Protection. Personally I can see no other way when you are dealing with industries that are capitalised in other countries. Industries in this poor country should have all the assistance the Government can give them to develop.  We know that mass manufacture, as it is called, is the only way in which the cheapest boots can be produced.  We are faced with the difficulty that with the exception of one or two industries such other industries as we have are not highly capitalised.  They are producing on a small scale, and their expenses must be greater, but the only way, so far as I can see, to keep the crisis within bounds is to give our industries a chance, and the more produced, the cheaper will be the cost of producing the goods.  As I have already pointed out, it has not followed on the adoption of this limited measure of Protection that the cost of goods has been increased in this country or what is supposed by political economists is bound to take place, that is, the duty being added to the price and the consumer paying it, has not taken place. Therefore, I have every reason to believe that instead of following the experience of other countries the protection of our industries does not mean increasing the cost of those goods. Naturally, I can only express an opinion, but that opinion is based on the experience of other countries and the very limited experience we have so far of the effect of protection upon our own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. YEATS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not competent to give an opinion on the great issue of Protection versus Free Trade.  The Government, however, is engaged in certain experimental measures, and that justifies me in bringing before them one particular industry in this country. When the Fiscal Committee was meeting various persons, engaged in the making of stained glass, brought before them a proposal that they should get Protection.  I shall deal in a moment <Col N="616" /> with the argument why they need that protection.  I think the Fiscal Committee, or certainly some of its members, were exceedingly sympathetic towards that proposal, but as the Committee decided to report in favour of Free Trade they were unable to put anything in the Report on the subject.  The position of the stained-glass industry in Ireland is this: It is purchasing now some of the very best glass in the world and it has been faced for some years past, except one short interval, with the competition of the most inferior stained-glass which is produced in Germany for Irish use, especially produced for the bad taste of Ireland.  It is impossible that our stained-glass can compete against the mass production of Europe.  Under no circumstances whatever can it do so, because an artist producing fine glass cannot supervise more than a very limited number of assistants. The moment you increase those assistants beyond a certain point, the quality of that glass and the design deteriorates. You cannot get the same qualities of colour.  The mass manufacture of glass will always be inferior. There was a short period during the war when our Irish stained-glass had not to face that competition.  They at once found an exceedingly fine market at home, and it was the finding of that exceedingly fine market which helped them to establish them in their great artistic pre-eminence as creators of that beautiful glass.  Then, with the Armistice came the old competition of Germany in a much worse form, but owing to the depreciation of the German coinage, the Germans were able to import their glass much cheaper than ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not ask the Government to put on such a tariff as would exclude German glass produced under these circumstances. They would have to put on an absolutely prohibitive tariff, probably 300 per cent., but I would ask the Government to consider the advisability of putting a tax of say 50 per cent. on German glass, until the money market becomes normal between England, Ireland and Germany.  Nobody connected with the production of glass in Ireland desires to have a tax against English glass.  I think I am right in <Col N="617" /> saying that there is not one person in Ireland connected with the making of glass that desires such a tax.  The reason of that is that they are artists, not manufacturers.  They recognise that Ireland and England are now producing the best glass in the world, and that it would be an unfair thing for Ireland to seek an economic advantage against English glass.  They believe that it would be to the advantage of this country, and its reputation. if the Government were to protect it against the very inferior quality and products of other countries that are made to be consumed in this country and this country only.  It requires a firm Government to say certain things are fine and certain things are not fine and should not be encouraged.  The Government has shown great courage in many ways and I suggest it should show enough courage to support what is fine in the arts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>In bringing in a Bill of this character I think the greatest need so far as the Government can fulfil that need, is to relieve unemployment and to encourage enterprise in the country.  The general principle underlying a Bill of this sort, so far as the industries or the potential industries of this country are concerned should be to foster industries that are natural to the country.  That does not touch the broad question of Free Trade versus Protection.  These policies may be desirable, but are only to be commended according to the conditions of the country.  The Australian colonies had at one time no industries, but they had raw materials in the shape of wool and timber.  There was a necessity for very considerable shipping capacity in order to transport that raw material, particularly at certain seasons to England. It paid to send vessels to these colonies and to load them with any class of merchandise in place of ballast that would pay the running expenses. The ordinary ballast that would have to be put into these vessels and dearly paid for was replaced by any class of merchandise and that was dumped into Australia.  The vessels then brought back profitable cargoes of wool and timber. These were conditions that would sterilise the possibility of setting up any industries in the colonies.  Owing <Col N="618" /> to the wages that prevailed in the early days in Australia in mining and other pursuits it would be impossible to set up an industry and pay the high wages that the workers received in the early days of colonial life.  Some of the colonies in time adopted a measure of Protection in order to encourage the setting up of industries.  Later, they threw off these protective measures and became Free Trade colonies.  The industries that were established are now flourishing.  That is the natural law.  A tender plant requires protection before it can stand alone.</P>
      <P>Here we are side by side with a very great industrial community.  Every industry, almost, that we can engage in is long established there and has progressed.  In fact, there is mass production in England to-day of every article that we could possibly hope to produce here.  The little infant industry that we could establish through our enterprise here is met at once by fierce competition.  If you set up a measure of Protection here it cannot be effective, owing to the proximity of England.  It will relieve unemployment.  Prices will always be controlled owing to proximity with the other side of the Channel.  What is happening here is that when you establish a measure of Protection by a tariff, if no other industries are set up, and if it is anticipated prices will be raised by local manufacturers, those who have been in possession of our markets will see the margin that this country offers and, I suppose, will establish a branch of their industry here. In that way they would stabilise prices. Men on the other side who are in possession of trade here for a number of years are watching this country very keenly.  If a margin of profit is here they will come here to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Customs and Excise, Part II. of the Bill is really the part that concerns the masses of the people, as it touches their lives more closely than any other part.  In the other parts, dealing with income tax, death duties, and corporation tax, the masses are not very interested.  They are important where capital and wealth are concerned, and it is only right and fair they should bear an extra share of the needs of the State.  I speak now more <Col N="619" /> in anticipation of an industry that is trying to get a footing, the dressed meat industry.  That is a very vital consideration for the Government, as it would mean the giving of a good deal of employment.  From the killing of a beast like the ox some forty kindred industries arise.  These industries have been specialised in at the other side of the water, where everything that can possibly be got from the ox is manufactured and dumped into this country. If we engage in this dead meat industry against these people it is possible it might not survive.  Possibly it would make a struggle, but if we associate with it other things, subsidiary industries, would arise and become in time a profitable source of employment.  I have only risen generally to voice the view that the Government should bear that in mind in any future legislation that would lead to the establishment in our midst of industries that are natural to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusIrwin" hpid="Mr. IRWIN Mr. IRWIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. IRWIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill as far as Part II. is concerned. But to my mind the Government have not gone far enough in protecting those industries that we have amongst us, and particularly I refer to the tillage farmer.  In the matter of tariffs on imported produce, the tillage farmer would derive very considerable assistance without any injury to the community in general.  Take, for instance, if a bounty were given to the dead meat industry to which Senator Kenny referred. That industry has been established on a small scale in Wexford for the last 10 or 12 years.  Everyone knows that that industry has suffered very severely from want of the necessary aid which might be given by the Government, especially in the direction of transit.  It is a new industry in the country, but because it is a new industry there are difficulties in getting expert knowledge amongst the employees. It also suffers from want of proper railway facilities and proper shipping facilities, for the handling of the product in the proper manner. These are matters that could be dealt with and should be dealt with by the Government.  Then, next, if you take the pig rearing industry amongst the <Col N="620" /> small tillage farmers and the agricultural labourers, this is an industry that requires a certain amount of protection. I think the Government should impose a tax on the import of American bacon.  That might appear to some as a proposal to make food dearer, but eventually that would not be the case.</P>
      <P>Economists tell us it is not what you spend, but it is how you spend it that is true economy.  I hold that even though it might appear that Irish bacon is dearer in price than the imported bacon, it is not in reality so, for in point of value it is the other way.  We know that American bacon is dumped into this country and is not sold on a commercial basis.  It is sold according to the market variations in America, which have nothing whatever to do with the ordinary commercial relations or the cost of production, and when the market here gets flooded with American bacon, the tillage farmer is severely hit.  The result of that policy will be a very serious one for this country.  The effect will be to completely ruin the pig rearing industry. And the rearing and feeding of pigs has long been the backbone of agricultural industry in this country.  When people get out of the habit of feeding and rearing pigs, they will not return to it in a hurry.  Because it is a hard and almost slavish task, if people get away from it, they are not so likely to return to it.  There are other trades to which the Government might have extended their protective arms.  Recently a circular came under my notice that was sent out by a German firm of printers.  This firm canvassed for printing in the Free State, and they offered to have circulars and booklets printed and posted in Germany.  The circular set out that because of the high postage rate prevailing in Ireland, and the low postage rate in Germany in comparison, and also because the exchange rate was so favourable to Germany, they could do the work, and post the circulars to Ireland at one-fourth of the cost at which an Irish firm could do it.  That advantage is derived from the rate of exchange. Sometimes we lose sight altogether of this side of the question, which is a very important one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> A country abroad might appear to be a Free Trade country, but in reality it could be a severely protected country, because of its exchange.  To-morrow Germany could throw its doors open to the world and invite the world to send in whatever stuff they like, but it could rig its exchange in such a manner that there would be no competition at all.  Unfortunately, as I say, because we have no currency of our own, we suffer from the disadvantages through the exchange.  While we have got a great measure of freedom in the political sense, still, I say there is no true freedom if a country has not economic freedom, and there is no economic freedom while we are tied to the wheels of England, because England will suit her currency to her own needs.  If England wants to have the exchange in America in one direction she adopts one policy, and if she wants the exchange another way she adopts another policy.  At present, I hold, it is ruinous to us to have the same exchange as England, because there is a difference in the exchange with America of something between 2s. and 2s. 3d. in the £, and that gives an advantage to the importer of American bacon.</P>

      <P>I think it is only natural that on the one or two occasions on which general financial policy can be discused by the Seanad a fairly lengthy debate should take place, and I should rather join issue with the Senators who have suggested that because the Seanad can not immediately enforce its views or hold up for nine months the Finance Act, therefore, it has no power in the matter of finance.  If, as does not seem at all likely at present, the Seanad were to have a defined policy of its own, there are many ways by which it could enforce that policy, although it may not be in a position to amend the Finance Act.  I think, therefore, it is of considerable importance that the Seanad should assist the Government <Col N="622" /> in trying to make up its mind on the question of the financial policy generally.  I do not often find myself in complete agreement with Senator Sir John Keane, but with very little exception I agree with the whole of his speech, which I think was well put together and well reasoned out.  I speak now because I think there are one or two points of view which have not been expressed, and which I hold, and would like to express to-day.  In the first place, I think it is a mistake to refer to Protection or Free Trade as if either were an end in itself, or as if either Protection or Free Trade should of itself represent the financial policy of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think either the Dáil or the Seanad is going to gain very much by going into abstract questions affecting the problematic effects vaguely of a Protectionist policy or of Free Trade policy, except in so far as you may discuss the particular effect of Protection on a particular industry, or a particular commodity, and discuss what the effect of that would be on policy generally. Personally, the fault I had to find with the Bill, and with the speeches when it was introduced, was rather that it did not seem to foreshadow any clear definite financial policy for the State as a whole, and by that I mean that we have not been told how far the Government have got a clearly defined trade policy.  Listening to the discussion to-day, I have very little idea, with one or two exceptions, as to whether the Senators are in favour of developing Ireland as an export country trading with as many countries as possible, and building up a trade for export with countries in Europe and with America, or whether it is desired to make Ireland a country that will feed its own people and make enough goods for its own people, with the hope that we may increase the population and make the country a desirable place to live in.  It seems to me if the former is to be our policy, then we must take the various commodities which we make, or believe we can make, and discuss them scientifically on their merits, and consider whether or not a certain measure <Col N="623" /> of Protection would be desirable for these particular industries, and if there is a prospect of their success in Ireland. If, on the other hand, we are to say in advance we must have Protection, and that industries are to be started here, believing all the time they will be protected, and if they make and sell at prices to Irishmen because they would be protected against competition, then I see little future in this country in the development of a general export trade.  I totally disagree as a general principle with Senator Sir Nugent Everard when he stated that Protection does not increase the cost of living.  There, again, vague considerations do not lead us very far.  He has stated that the price of boots has not been increased following the introduction of a 15 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> duty. At the same time he told us the reason, which is that a six months' supply had been brought in before the duty. Whether this six months' supply was brought in or not, I am not certain, but I am satisfied that what I consider to be a very serious blunder on the part of the Government was made.  If you are to have a duty in force at all it ought to come into force immediately the resolution is passed.  A period of eight days elapsed, and whether we approved of it or not those connected with the boot trade were obliged by circumstances to buy as much as they possibly could.  Sir Nugent Everard states because he has a letter from a firm which makes 3,000 pairs of boots a week and that they have not increased their price that therefore the price of boots has not increased, though he tells us that the supply for six months is 574,000 pairs, and I venture to suggest that 3,000 for three weeks would not go a long way to meet the requirements of Ireland.</P>
    <P>If, as I am satisfied, there is not a sufficient number of firms supplying the requirements of the Irish trade there will be an increase in price until all Irish requirements can be made at the same prices as in England.  My own point of view with regard to the boot tax is, that it is a risky and very doubtful experiment, without any definite arguments <Col N="624" /> or reasonable proofs that you are going to increase the manufacture of boots by putting an <i>ad valorem</i> duty on all boots, shoes, and slippers in Ireland, irrespective of whether they are made in Ireland or not, or whether there is a prospect of making them in Ireland. I think it is generally recognised that the firms making boots in the Free State make only a comparatively small portion of the class of boots required, while the cheaper class of boots worn by the poorer classes generally are not at present made in Ireland, and the result is that an extra cost of 15 per cent. is required, and there is also the carriage for bringing them into the country, which would make an increase of 16 per cent. or 17 per cent. in price, as soon as the present stocks are depleted, which I assume will be in a month or two. It is inevitable that that will increase the cost of living.  I am willing to concede this, if there had been any assurance given here or in the Dáil in the matter, that there was reason to believe that factories would be started to make the classes of boots which are not at present made in Ireland, and supplied from other countries, particularly England, it might be worth while to increase the cost of boots in order to get these factories started.  If that is the case, and if it is based upon scientific knowledge and research, then I am not going to criticise the duty of 15 per cent., because I believe that if we develop a general export trade we would find it inevitable to avoid Protection, because of the increased cost. But at the same time I recognise that a country like ours may find it advisable, in the absence of other means, to encourage the setting up of industries by putting a certain protective duty on commodities for a number of years until the industries can get on their own feet.  I really believe that the Trades Loan Bill is far more likely to help us in the starting and encouraging of industries than any experimental duties which may be introduced.  Personally, I totally dislike the suggestion that you should experiment on one or two commodities without any reason given, but if you say you are experimenting on Protection for the purpose that you hope to turn some theoretical <Col N="625" /> protectionists against their policy, something may be said for it, but I am not looking at it from that point of view.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to another duty which some people, judging by the speeches of some Deputies, now regard as a protectionist duty, that is, the duty on motor cars.  I cannot quite understand the policy with regard to the duty on motor cars coming into this country, because if that duty were, as a commencement at any rate, reduced or abolished as far as motor parts are concerned there seems to be little doubt, and I am speaking with some knowledge, that a considerable number of cars would be partially manufactured and assembled here; and if cars, for instance, such as the Morris Oxford, which sells in quantities next, I think, to the Ford, were assembled in Dublin, it would give a certain amount of employment.  There will be no use in sending a recommendation from the Seanad upon that matter; it was definitely rejected in the other House. What I cannot understand is whether this is a tax for the purpose of revenue or for the purpose of protection, and what it is protecting, or whether it is put on in the hope that some of the manufacturers will build cars here, and by that means we will have an Irish car and a new Irish industry.  If that is the expectation, and based on reason, then I should hesitate again to criticise, but we have no information given us to go upon that.  My contention is that you run the risk of increasing the cost if you put on protective duties.  It may be found wise or necessary to do so, and may be well worth the increased cost, but it should be the result of a definite policy after research and not merely just an experiment to see what will happen.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of trade development, because I believe it is in the development of the trade whether it be found advisable to have protective duties or not that our hope for the future lies.  I believe myself that a very considerable extension of our trade with European countries could and will take place, if a wise policy is adopted, and in that connection I should like to refer briefly to <Col N="626" /> a discovery I made the other day and which I find in the Estimates.  I found that we had certain trade representatives abroad, representing the Saorstát, and expected to develop a trade of this country, and that they are paid salaries between £300 and £750 per annum, and that on these sums they are expected to represent Ireland, and to do it well.  I personally could see something to be said for having no representative.  I could see a good deal to be said, but having a strictly limited number of representatives abroad, I could see nothing to be said for a policy of sending men abroad, with salaries of from £300 to £700 a year and expecting them to represent Ireland in a foreign country in Europe knowing what is expected there from representatives of a country. If that is our trade policy abroad, I, personally, have little faith in it. I mentioned that as one instance. I believe by close co-operation between the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Finance, and also the Ministry of External Affairs, that within a year or two there are very considerable openings in Europe, and a very considerable amount of trade could be developed to our advantage.  Let me urge those strongly in favour of Protection that they should consider the effect that duties would have upon the possibilities of our trade, and that they should be extremely cautious upon the experiment to be adopted.  There is one other matter that I would like to refer to, and that is, that I would like to support Senator Sir J. Keane in his reference to the case of the repairs of houses. I hope he will introduce in Committee such a recommendation, which can be sent to the Dáil upon this important matter.  We need not go into the question of the hardship or otherwise of persons living in some of the larger houses.  What I suggest is that it is very much against the national policy that the remaining houses which are fairly large should be allowed to get into disrepair and that every encouragement should be extended to the persons living in them, and whether living in them or not, but particularly if living in them, to keep them in a <Col N="627" /> state of proper repair, and I think this refusal to give allowance for repairs is a retrograde step and will have a very bad effect, particularly upon those who have larger houses and who in the national interest ought to spend money partly from the view of employment and partly for the purpose of keeping them in a reasonable condition. Such a recommendation should be sent to the Dáil, and I hope that the Senator will introduce a recommendation on this matter and that it will be carefully considered.  Finally, I do not think the Government, in some respects, are spending enough money. It is an excellent thing to balance the Budget; as a policy it is not enough.</P>
    <P>My own feeling is this, that together with a policy of retrenchment, and with a policy of trying by hook or crook to make your annual income correspond as near as possible with your annual expenditure there ought to be at the same time an amount of capital expenditure by means of borrowing, which I believe would in itself yield a very considerable return in confidence and prosperity and in the yield of income tax.  The other week I had an opportunity of attending a conference in Belgium and I was astonished to find out that nearly the whole of the damaged areas of Belgium had been rebuilt, and that unless you go out of your way you cannot find any of the destroyed war buildings, except a few which are retained as show places for tourists. Can we say that of Ireland? I asked several Belgian Ministers what was their policy, and they said that as soon as the war was over they knew they could borrow.  They borrowed to rebuild because they said it would put spirit into the people again.  We have had the question raised recently about the rebuilding of the Four Courts, and we have had other places that are absolutely essential to rebuild.  I believe the Government could do a great deal towards stability by borrowing, not for the purpose of spending more money on expenditure of a recurrent character but for the purpose of non-recurrent expenditure, such as the rebuilding of the Four Courts, and I believe that such money <Col N="628" /> spent wisely would yield in income tax considerably more than the cost of the money borrowed.  I have, perhaps, spoken rather longer than I intended, but these are my feelings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with nearly everything the last Senator said, and I entirely agree with regard to the matter that he and Senator Sir John Keane raised about houses.  I think it is an entire mistake for the Minister to say that the rating of houses is out of all comparison with the rent.  I myself happened to live in a house where, if you add the valuation to the rates, it came to rather more than the rent I am paying, or was before I bought it.  It may occur in many cases, but it certainly does not always occur.  With regard to the question of Free Trade, I know enough about the arguments on this matter in favour of Free Trade. They were arguments which could be quite easily overthrown logically.  The original Free Trade doctrine was to buy at the cheapest market.  That was the doctrine put forward and that really lies, now, at the basis of that argument. About the year 1879, the price of agricultural produce had suddenly fallen all over the world.  In Ireland people were on the borders of starvation and there was a sort of revolution.  People could not pay rent and they were passing through terribly difficult years.</P>
      <P>I would like Sir John Keane and people who take that view of things to imagine what would occur if that happened now or in a more accentuated style.  Ireland could not produce agricultural produce at the same price as it is produced in the Argentine.  Would that mean that Irish people would have to shut down their agriculture and, having no manufactures, would have nothing at all to do except to sit down and die for want of food?  They would not have money to buy food.  There would be nothing to live on but agriculture, and you could not keep the agriculture going.  These sorts of logical schemes are absurd.  They do not fit in.  You must apply this economical situation to the facts of the case.  What suits one country does not suit another, and what suits England does not suit Ireland.  That is why we are to adopt a situation of our own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to delay this debate more than a minute or two.  Although there have been quite a number of speeches, the debate has been confined to a restricted field of operations, mainly to the question of Protection overseas.  Free Trade is a subject on which one might speak for hours, and end where he started.  I agree with Senator Douglas that the Government should not be too desperately anxious to balance their Budget at this particular period.  The policy of the Government is very largely that of an enterprising business man who is afraid to launch into any capital expenditure because he has not sufficient confidence in his own abilities to make it pay or in the abilities of those with him to trust to make a profit of it. This generation has done a great deal towards political and economic independence, and it has been recently stated it is only fair that part of the burden should be passed on to posterity. If we expect in those trying years to balance our Budget I do not think we will make much progress by way of trade or development.  Historians have agreed that the period of Grattan's Parliament was a prosperous one for Ireland, yet at the end of that period the National debt was over £28,000,000, or at an average of £5 3s. 6d. per head of the population.  The value of money then was greater than it is at the present time.  That average would probably be equivalent to £15 or £20 per head now.  Yet we are told that Ireland was prosperous in those rosy years of Grattan's Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day we have only a debt of ten to thirteen millions, and there seems to be a great disinclination to indulge in borrowing for the purpose of building up civic institutions such as the Four Courts, the Post Office, the Custom House, and others of that character. I would like to support what has been said by Sir John Keane regarding Section 2 of the Bill&mdash;Allowances for Repairs of Houses.  I think there was some impression in this respect in the other House that it was applying to wealthy people owning large houses. Everyone knows that in recent years owing to the house shortage, a number <Col N="630" /> of people have been compelled to purchase houses by getting loans from societies and banks at a high rate of interest.  Owing to the exigencies of the situation they are now being mulcted to the extent of this section of the Bill.  I think it is an unfair impost to place upon them.  While I suppose it is impracticable to ask for a reduction on postal rates, one may at least ask for a reduction on postcards. It is absurd to charge 1½d. on a business card.  That discourages the sending of them, and a far greater amount would be sent if they were only charged at 1d. each.  That is one case where the Government might consent to charge only 1d.</P>
    <P>The Protection experiments in the Bill are, of course, merely experiments to show what the effect will be, and so far, I think, it is quite impracticable to say what the ultimate effect will be, except that one may assume one of the results will be an increase in the cost of living.  While trying those experiments, I think there is a certain amount of complaint as to the manner in which those experiments have been tried.  It is a peculiar thing to place a tax on imported boots.  That is not a new industry.  It is an old degenerate industry as far as Ireland is concerned. If there is one industry in which we should be able to compete with other countries it is in the boot industry. We have the raw material here, but yet the manufacturers do not show any desire to meet the requirements of the age.  The number and variety of the fashions of foreign manufacturers as compared with Ireland are very great indeed.  There is no attempt here to give a variety of boots and shoes, or a variety of fittings.  They make one plain, solid type of boot or shoe, and you must take that, as there is nothing else.  There is little or no art about it, and they do not cater for the fancies or the tastes of male or female.</P>
    <P>We are told that an Irish boot factory could only make one pair for every 15 required.  If that is so it would take them a long time to meet the general requirements of the people. Also they will have to make great progress in the type of boots they turn out. As a sort of set-off against those imposts, <Col N="631" /> there has been a reduction in the duty on tea from 8d. to 5d., and, again, in order to set off that, an increase on the tax on cocoa which, I believe, is healthier than tea.  Then there is a tax on soap to encourage people to wash.  The excess duty on playing cards is taken off to encourage people to gamble.  I do not know whether that is going to encourage a new or an old industry, but I do not think it is going to be a huge one. Those who have been urging those imposts are in the main urging the protection of inefficiency in order that they may not be compelled to keep pace with the requirements of this particular generation.  Senator Keane has instanced a case of firms like Messrs. Guinness and Jacob, who have been able to hold their own.  Not only have some of those firms been able to hold their own, but they give the best terms of employment, and I think it is mainly that spirit of enterprise that has enabled them to succeed where a less enterprising people have been afraid to indulge in capital expenditure.  They have been afraid to purchase machinery and introduce improvements that would enable them to keep pace with their foreign competitors.</P>
    <P>Another reason is the lack of technical education.  There is a lack of expert craftsmen in this country, and that is the way in which the Government could improve industry by encouraging expenditure on technical training.  We are told in a recent book that Denmark last year spent one-fifth of her total income on education of various kinds, particularly developing the culture that is necessary in an agricultural country such as Denmark is, and which is equally necessary to a country like Ireland.  We are told that agriculture is depressed.  It is safe to say that no other industry could succeed if it were mismanaged and bungled in the way agriculture is.  I have come from a farming family, and I do not know of any industry that has been carried on in the lopsided way that agriculture is throughout the country. I certainly do not believe that any other industry could survive if it was carried on with such a disregard for scientific arrangement.  Until Irish agriculturists <Col N="632" /> begin to educate themselves in their own industry I am afraid we are not going to be able to compete with those up-to-date countries such as Denmark.  Agriculturists themselves will undoubtedly have to protect themselves by becoming a little more educated in the industry in which they make their livelihood than they are at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to make a few remarks as regards the Finance Bill generally.  In the first instance, of course, one recognises the enormous height our taxation is rising to, by Clause 1, which keeps on the 5/- income tax as the first of these imposts. I take it for granted that in keeping these figures the Government had to adhere to the principle that they must balance their Budget.  I do not agree with Senator O'Farrell that they could borrow instead of balancing their Budget.  They cannot borrow at anything like reasonable rates unless they have the reputation of keeping a sound financial house and that they can show in this country they can make ends meet and are able to pay their way.  Then they will be trusted and they will get at reasonable rates so much money as they will require to spend.  I agree with Senator O'Farrell about all these things which can be met by borrowing.  If that policy is to be carried out they must balance their Budget.  Therefore, the criticism as to the height of these taxes had to be very guarded, indeed, because the Government alone can know what savings can be effected and whether anything more is possible in that way. Owing to the absolute necessity of keeping taxation at a very high level for a little time at least, we have to be very reticent in criticising the Government on the subject of these high taxes.  Undoubtedly one can say in looking to the future that the fact that the Free State should have income tax higher than either Northern Ireland or Great Britain is a desperate handicap on everybody in the Free State.  I have no doubt the Government recognises it, but I think in criticising the Finance Bill, it is wise to draw attention to that and to the necessity of the Government <Col N="633" /> keeping before them in future Finance Bills, the desirability of bringing taxation of that sort down to the same level as Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  In regard to that matter there was one point that Senator Sir John Keane referred to&mdash;the double taxation problem.</P>
      <P>In the banking world we know the enormous amount of trouble, difficulty and loss which the present state of affairs in regard to the settlement of taxation between individuals in regard to the taxes they have to pay to the two countries involves.  It is nearly impossible for any ordinary individual to know how to put his affairs right in regard to this taxation, or for a big company to know how to pay their shareholders their dividends, and that such state of affairs should go on for any length of time seems to reflect no credit on the British or Irish authorities. I do happen to know that our Irish authorities have done their utmost to put the matter right, but undoubtedly it is a loss to the Free State. Roughly speaking, in a great many cases you pay your 4s. 6d. of the British tax; that is deducted at the source; when you lodge the dividend in the Irish bank you are charged 5s. tax, so that you get 11s. 6d. out of your £1. Then you have to go through a most elaborate system to recover your money both from the British and the Irish Free State authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be an enormous number of individuals, especially women, who cannot understand the matter and who suffer a genuine loss, and I think the Government should do everything possible to invent some method, a clearing house or something else, that would put an end to this confusion, because it has a very bad effect indeed both on our investments and on British investments.  There is not a single good thing to be said for it, and the two Departments should certainly be able to put an end to it.  In respect of the remission of super tax, that is an effort to try to get our rich people to come back and stay in the country; it is an experiment.  As far as I see the man who has an income of £11,000 a year will have to pay the same tax as across the water.  If you get an income above £11,000 a year it would <Col N="634" /> pay a person to stay in Ireland.  That is more or less a theoretical thing, but so far as the Government have been enabled to embody it in the Bill, I think it is quite a wise thing.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that Section 2, making an allowance of one-sixth for repairs, seems a wretched thing to do.  I believe it is the policy of the Government to try and see that our empty houses are inhabited.  As a rule some employment is given by a man who lives in one of these big houses.  I cannot see the point of putting such a thing into the Bill.  It is a poor class of thing to put in.  Undoubtedly it will tend to many houses falling into disrepair and towards people trying to get out of them.  It is certainly no encouragement to anyone to come and live here.  I do not propose to go into a discussion regarding Protection or Free Trade.  There is, undoubtedly, one industry you cannot protect, and that is agriculture. As a Senator stated, there must be free admission of foodstuffs, and our agriculturists have to face the competition of the world.  I know of no measure of Protection that has not increased the cost of the article that is protected.  As people employed in the main industry of this country cannot be protected to that extent, agriculture will be injured.  I do not know if such a measure would relieve unemployment.  Any such measure would have to be carefully watched. People will have to make up their minds if they choose Protection in order to encourage certain industries, that they will have to pay for protecting them.  Whether it is wise or not, I do not know.  Most of us think a scheme of that sort will require a good deal of criticism, in view of the fact that the Dáil has the settlement of money matters.  If they are going to put on protective duties, that the ordinary taxpayers of the country will have to pay, I think they will have to be sure that the taxpayers will be willing to do so.  That is the gist of any Protection I have seen.</P>
    <P>We are in a peculiarly dangerous position in this country to begin a policy of that kind, in view of the fact that the mass of the people make their living from an industry which, as far <Col N="635" /> as I can see, cannot be protected.  There are things that could be protected, such as those referred to by Senator Yeats, for which our people have a peculiar aptitude.  The fine arts could be encouraged judiciously, and also the cottage industries, such as those at Killybegs and in Connemara, where our people are producing good articles. The Minister for Agriculture and Lands, I am sure, could assist such industries by helping them to get markets and by having lectures delivered, showing the people how to improve their methods.  Money spent in that way will be well spent.  That is totally different to the general protection of industries which, as Senator O'Farrell says, ought to be able to fight their own battles.  There has undoubtedly been an expression of opinion that the Government want industries established.</P>
    <P>I saw that they did away with the Safeguarding of Industries Act.  It was a very doubtful experiment.  I am very sorry to see that the Government have kept on the Corporation Profits Act.  It is admittedly a desperate tax upon industry.  If industries are to be established in this country it seems to me to be a mistake to keep on that tax here, especially when it has not to be paid in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain.  I suppose the Government cannot do away with it at present.  As a tax it is economically unsound, and it is doing a great deal of harm to our industries in comparison to those in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  It is one of the taxes that the Government should, as soon as possible, do away with.  We had the Excess Profits Tax.  It was an abominable tax, but it was put on during the war.  It did not hit the people it was meant to hit.  The Corporation Profits Tax is an extremely bad tax, and I hope that the Minister for Finance, as soon as he possibly can, will follow the example of sound financiers on the other side of the Channel, by putting an end to it.</P>
    <P>The experiments made in Protection I do not propose to criticise.  No doubt the Government had very good reasons for making these experiments <Col N="636" /> with a view to educating the people and educating themselves.  They do not, I think, matter very much financially, and if they teach us something I do not see why we should object to them very much.  I hope they will not be treated in such a way as to lead to the adoption of any root policy of that sort without extremely careful inquiry.  From what the Minister has said, I have no doubt whatever that there is an idea to use them as a stepping-stone for what would be a policy of Protection.  I think that is the way practically everyone views the matter. I do not think we have before us at present the great questions of Protection or Free Trade.  Generally this Bill balances the Budget.  The Government have now, probably, balanced their accounts, and I must say I think it reflects the very greatest credit on them.  One can talk now in a very different tone to what one could a year or a year and a half ago.  Economies have undoubtedly been effected which required very great bravery on the part of those who have carried them out.  Although one criticises the Bill and these taxes, the general tone of the whole thing is influenced by the fact that the Minister for Finance is now able to hold up his head amongst the countries of the world and say he is able to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the grip that gives him in the money markets means that when we do want money we will be able to get it to advance our industries, if we think it wise to spend money on them, and as Senator O'Farrell says, get money to carry out great schemes.  In borrowing money we must remember that we have to provide both for interest and sinking fund.  It should be quite possible for the Government to borrow without crippling the country with taxes.  It might, with judicious borrowing, spread the burden we have to bear judiciously and wisely on our successors. On the whole, I have no word except praise for the Budget.</P>

      <P>In rising to speak on this Finance Bill, I would wish first to say that if anything could fill me with diffidence it would be having to criticise anything appertaining to <Col N="637" /> finance.  That is one thing that fills me with diffidence, and the diffidence is increased as I grow old.  At any rate I have a suggestion to make&mdash;or rather I am taking advantage of an opportunity to call the attention of the Revenue Authorities to an idea that is not altogether my own idea.  My diffidence is increased by the fact that when I approached some members of the Government they suggested to me that the best method of having the matter settled would be to get a question asked in the Dáil on the matter in the hope of drawing attention to it.  I suppose it is merely a matter of drawing attention to it with a view to getting them to make an announcement. The point which I wanted cleared up was&mdash;the position of an outsider, such as an American taking up his residence in this country.  At present the method of assessing him for income tax and so on, is obscure.  I am aware of one American who bought a house here for £11,000.  He had everything signed, but on account of the uncertainty of his position as regards income tax and as to the amount on which he would be taxed&mdash;whether it would be £40,000 from America or his outgoings in Ireland, he would not touch the thing, and this house, like hundreds of other mansions, has since become derelict.</P>
      <P>I feel if the Government would make a definite statement with regard to the status in this respect of anybody taking a mansion in this country, it would have a very good effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>France has an annual revenue from American holders of villas of three hundred million dollars.  France may have something to offer them.  But we have a great deal more.  At any rate we can give an American something to point to.  We can present him with a pedigree by having a holding in Ireland. That is something important. The method followed in France is this: The valuation of the villa in France is multiplied by five, and he is taxed on the multiple of the holding.  They merely tax him on the multiple of the valuation of his holding.  The maximum income in money to the country can be gauged by the prosperity of France.  In our country we might multiply the valuation by ten, because <Col N="638" /> our valuations are low.  By doing this we would do something to prevent the decay of any houses in Ireland except thatched houses.  We do not look forward to a country with thatched residences, because neither intellectually nor on the social level would they be very elevating to the people.  This is a moment, too, when Labour is intelligent enough to realise that you do not get employment from paupers.  This would be doing something to help the return of wealthy people to this country.  One of my ideas is that I would scrap the super tax altogether.  We would need, perhaps, to have penalising laws against incoming Jews if that were done.  But when we realise that the remission of super tax is only benefitting thirty people in this country who pay the 7s. 6d. tax, it shows that the experiment might be extended, particularly as I see that Labour is in a position to realise that the expenditure of wealth in this country can do something for the country.</P>
    <P>Here is another idea&mdash;the bank rate has, I understand, been higher here than in England.  I do not know why the Government cannot avail of this, and pass on that extra point in taxation of bankers.  There is another matter that is of importance to me.  I have been prompted by the opinion of the financial brains beside me, and it is why is it that the Government are afraid to borrow for non-recurrent expenditure such as rebuilding of the Four Courts and the Custom House? That is an expenditure that will not be recurrent.  It seems to me that to borrow money for work like this is a sound thing, and the work should be done immediately.  Before I sit down I would like to reiterate one question, and that is the point I raised as to the taxes that should be paid by an American, say, who took a house in this country.  I would like to have that stabilised and the position ensured as to what his taxation would be so stabilised, and he would be able to compare the conditions of living here with the conditions of taxation in any other country.  There are many advantages to people living in Ireland, and there are many inducements to people of wealth to settle down here.  Already <Col N="639" /> there are people who have taken over masterships of hounds in this country, that is to say, people who have come from abroad.  These people who pay tax over 7s. 6d. in the £ benefit the country. I think anybody from, say, America, with an income of over £2,000 might be guaranteed the remission of taxes for five years on setting down, and taking a house in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN GRIFFITH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid what I have got to say will not be of so great interest, or as amusing as what we have just listened to.  But I did rejoice to hear Senator Sir John Keane propound the idea of a Clearing House to disentangle our difficulties as regards income tax in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I have not a shadow of doubt that a very large number of people lose large sums of money by the present arrangements. These are so complicated and so troublesome that many people cannot face the difficulty that has been raised by them, and I should welcome anything in the shape of the suggestion of Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Jameson, that something in the nature of a Clearing House should be adopted.  Now, as regards the question of duties, having been brought up in a hot-bed of Free Trade and with all its prejudices and so forth, it perhaps seems strange that I should support this Bill, in its endeavour to protect the industries in this country, by small duties. I rather welcome it as an experiment. I think we can learn a little by it, and I am not a bit afraid of the result.  I should like to disabuse the minds of the Senators, if I possibly can, of the idea that Ireland cannot be an industrial country.  I think we only have to examine one country in Europe, with which I am very familiar, to see that that is not so.  That country is Switzerland, and there alongside of the agricultural industry you have the beneficial industries of a manufacturing character, which have been carried out there to a most marvellous extent. That little country is one of the most industrious and one of the largest exporters of finished articles.  I see no possible reason why Ireland should not <Col N="640" /> follow in the footsteps of Switzerland if we are able to introduce cheap power into this country.</P>
      <P>That has been the secret of Switzerland's success, and we have the opportunity if we can only rouse ourselves to introduce cheap power, which will not reduce wages, but will facilitate output, and it is only by increasing output that we can hope for any material advancement.  For those reasons I shall support the Government in their Bill.</P>

      <P>Two technical points have been raised in conjunction with a lot of general points in the discussion of the Finance Bill of 1924. One is on the question of double income tax.  A suggestion has been made of a Clearing House system, which would afford relief from the annoyances from the double income tax system, which are well known. There is annoyance about the collection of any income tax, but there is extra and increasing annoyance about this double and increasing income tax. Negotiations have gone on, as Senator Jameson pointed out, for considerable time to see if any relief can be afforded to those affected on both sides of the water.  As to this Clearing House idea, there are objections to it.  I can go no further, but it has not been decided against.  The whole matter is under consideration.  I do not know if the Seanad would want to put any further pressure upon the Minister for Finance by making a recommendation such as that, but I wish to throw out to the Seanad that this particular remedy has not been lost sight of.  It is under consideration at the moment, but rather overwhelming objections so far have been taken to that scheme. The question of relief from the annoyance of payment of double income tax is a matter of great concern to the Government.  They realise fully the annoyance to which the people are subjected to under this head, but it is a matter of great difficulty to get a remedy.  The second technical point is the question of assessment under Schedule A of the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has been raised here that householders in this country are about to suffer decided grievances under the terms of this Bill.  Let those grievances <Col N="641" /> be understood.  There is a certain grievance, but it is not that the deduction allowed in England is being taken away.  What is happening is totally different.  The assessment under Schedule A is made under the poor-law valuation, which allows a certain amount for repairs.  In England the assessment for Schedule A purpose is made on a direct rental, and no allowance originally was made, but later on they arrived at a sum on which duty was to be paid, and allowances made in certain other columns.  Then, when that legislation was carried over into this country, the additional allowance was made on that poor-law valuation, although that poor-law valuation already included an allowance for repairs.  So in this country there were two allowances for repairs&mdash;first, on the poor-law valuation, and, secondly, by carrying over the English allowance, which was based on the gross rental value.  If the people here are going to suffer, they are going to suffer by their allowance being reduced to what it was always in England, and they are going to be prejudiced by the second allowance being removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>So far, yes.  The forms of assessment now being compiled will, of course, proceed on the basis of this Bill, but any assessment made so far has always been on the basis of poor-law valuation of the house built, so up to this year the poor-law valuation takes into account allowance for repairs.  Although there is a grievance, they are not put in a worse position than the people in England, but they are in a worse position than if the old arrangement had remained, but that was a position of preference compared with that in England.  While a certain amount of comment has been made on these two technical points, the tendency of the fiscal policy shown in the Finance Act has been commented on, some criticising it, and others being in favour of it.  Those in favour generally objected that the experiment has not been spread sufficiently <Col N="642" /> wide, and that it should be extended in its operations.  Senator Sir John Keane, however, raised the point that we are an exporting country, that our exports are agricultural produce, and that anything which tends to raise the cost of production in our agricultural produce lessens the purchasing power of our exports, and consequently lessens the national wealth.  That is quite sound in theory, but the application of that to the facts is difficult.</P>
      <P>Has the cost of production of agricultural produce been increased by anything in the Finance Bill of 1924? There is a tax on boots, but that is offset by a remission of a certain amount of the duty on tea.  It is understood these two would balance, and as a matter of fact my own Department at one time made up the ordinary Budget which we make for the purpose of assessing the cost-of-living-figure.  We took this Budget under the old conditions and under the new conditions, with the increase on boots and the remission of duty on tea.  There was a slight fraction against the householder under the new conditions, I think it ran to something like .05 of an increased charge on the cost of living, which was raised by only this fractional point, so that it was equivalent to saying that the one was a complete offset against the other.  Senator Sir John Keane suggested that the cost of production was increased to the farmer, and if the purchasing power of these goods became less, the only thing for the farmer to do is to go back to grass.</P>

      <P>It is one of the things he is likely to do.  There again, that is a quite right warning, but the question is, are those the facts established, or are those the facts to be brought about by the present proposal of the Finance Bill?  I do not say that will be the case at all.  I do put it this way, looking at it from another angle, that we are a country in this position that all our eggs are in one basket, that the bottom of that basket is in a very flimsy state, and that any slight <Col N="643" /> shock will shake the bottom out of it, and we will lose all our wealth.  If it does mean some extra burden on the farmer, he should bend his shoulders to the burden, and take it up in the hope that five or ten years hence, there will be a remission of the taxation in the burdens which he is suffering under.  We must make a change somewhere; we cannot go on as at present. We are told by the Minister for Agriculture, and by farmers generally, that they are in a very depressed condition, and cannot live under present circumstances. There must be some change; there is no standing still in the agricultural world.  That is worse than useless, and it means in a way that the farmer will go out of production and will go back to grass.  That leaves our second state worse than the first.  This is a big experimental point in the present Bill.  It is an experiment, at any rate, which seems on the theoretical basis not to be likely to do any harm. It may do good.  It at least does this good, that it gives reliable facts and figures and statistics upon which to base the policy of the future, and these are the main features and virtues of the present experiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to Senator Sir John Keane that Denmark is a country from which we can draw many excellent examples, no doubt, but research into the conditions of Denmark shows this, that there comes in, even in a country in such a highly developed state as Denmark, a saturation point when agriculture cannot employ more than a certain number.  That figure is high, but there comes that saturation point. As Senator O'Farrell said, agriculture is run in a haphazard and happy-go-lucky way in this country; still, if we find ourselves with agriculture, and agriculture alone, as our industry, the saturation point would quickly be reached, because emigration, which used to relieve unemployment somewhat, has stopped, and a certain number of people are now remaining at home, for whom employment must be found, and if we find ourselves without those highly developed agricultural conditions that prevail in Denmark, then agriculture will not support the population in this island.  We must <Col N="644" /> look ahead and get some industrial occupation for our young men.  No one wants to look forward to an encouragement of emigration as a means of relieving unemployment, but it is one of the things that must be taken into consideration.  Most of the men out of the Army came from unemployment, and they are now simply being returned to unemployment, from which they came.  There is no great hope for a number of years&mdash;no great hope in confining ourselves to agriculture, so that we find, finally, that some industrial activity must be stimulated in this country.  It is not the case with us as it is in England or in Europe.  We are not in the same condition as the people there in these countries were. In Europe a certain amount of productive machinery was disturbed.  In England the consumer or customer was brought almost to the point of bankruptcy. They had the goods in the shops and they had the customers awaiting them, but the customers could not buy at the prices the goods were offered.  That was their problem.  We had an entirely different problem.  It was not so much with us the setting up of industry destroyed during the war, but it is the necessity for starting industry which we never had here. And for that purpose an experiment in Protection is good.  Our conditions are such that an analogy with foreign countries may be of some use to us, but it is not going to be a complete answer.  We have got to get the experiments started.  Senator Douglas said we should have the experiments after research.  That is quite right. The best thing is to get the movements set up here, to watch the movement and the reactions for a year, and perhaps it will be extended over a year before we can form a proper conclusion; but we can get some information this year, even though the experiment may not be completely successful, as to how things will be in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, just what the Senator has mentioned, and many other things.  For instance, it will be necessary&mdash;and I do not want to draw Senators on the Labour Benches on the point just now&mdash;to see how far the workers behave towards protected industry. We did see the Labour Party at their General Congress showed themselves divided on the question of Protection, but one thing they were all united on was this, that the benefits of Protection must be passed on to the workers.  Of course, that is sound from the Labour point of view. It is sound from the Governmental point of view, that the reasonable demands of Labour should be satisfied, but there must be a certain amount also to go into the welfare of the country, and not merely to the workers engaged in the industry. There are numerous points to be inquired into.  There is one question that I might allude to: A convinced Protectionist like Deputy Milroy says it is indefensible to make a statement that a protective tariff represents an increase in connection with the articles protected.  Other people hold it to be axiomatic that the cost of the article is increased.  I had my own idea on that, and I may be wrong, but may be, like Senator Gogarty, I may feel I may afterwards have to adopt a different attitude towards myself. Senator Dowdall alluded to the foot and mouth disease danger in England, and to the very distinct danger of carrying on simply as an agricultural community.  That is a definite danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we got foot-and-mouth disease into this country we might have gone bankrupt.  It was a tremendous danger, and it was very close to us, and it was not merely close to us, but it is likely to be close to us in years to come.  Senator Dowdall alluded to the dole.  It was rather incidental to his argument, and I allude to it in order to get a proper outlook on the thing. There is no dole as such in this country, and that should be adverted to. There is no dole in this country no more than a business man would admit that he was getting a dole because of advances made to him by his banker. There is money advanced to the workers here out of a fund built up <Col N="646" /> by payments from the State, the employer and the employee.  The fact is we pay out a certain amount before the employee has paid in, but with the full compliance of the Government, who have accumulated three-quarters of a million of money, which will be cleared off in three or four years.  So we are merely advancing to the worker a certain amount from a fund to which he him self will subscribe, and the employer also will subscribe.  Senator Dowdal said it was better to pay this dole rather than to advance it as a payment to men to do nothing.  I may be getting away from the Finance Act, but I do think it is legitimate to deal with this matter here.  There is no payment to men to do nothing, or to a man because he is doing nothing, but you are paying men who happened to be doing nothing, and as Senator Dowdall put it, men who are anxious to do work have to be paid for a time.</P>
    <P>I do think this comes in in a Finance Act discussion, and I shall have to allude to it later in discussing what is asked for here on a statement of general policy.  Senator Bagwell announced he had changed his mind several times on this problem, and he seems now to think that in his present state he has made up his mind again, but not finally, so far as this question is concerned. That is exactly the point of view, perhaps I should not say exactly, but, at any rate, approximately the point of view of the Government.  The Government has not made up its mind on this question of Protection, but they are trying Protection, and whether it would be a proper basis on which to found this policy.  It is making the experiment this year, and after a year or two years it hopes to have the facts on which it can give a definite decision. That is the point Senator Sir Thos.  Esmonde alluded to when he said the experiment is useful because information is required. This country is sadly in need of information upon the points regarding Protection.  There is a particular Bill, though it had to be dropped this session, dealing with the census of production, and when that is passed we shall be in a position to acquire a certain <Col N="647" /> amount of necessary information. That would give us a certain amount of evidence of it.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir Nugent Everard asked me if it were considered that the fiscal policy followed in this country for the last eighty years has been approved by its results.  I do not know if anyone here will say that it has been approved by its results.  The same Senator said the effect of the Protection experiment could not be tested, because in the interval before the taxes came into operation, a certain amount of dumping took place.  I agree with him there, but I think the delay was due to the question of staff.  It was not possible to recruit immediately a staff for this purpose.  The whole attention of the staff had been strained by the setting up of the frontier on the 1st April previously.  It was difficult at first hand to get a body of men trained.  To throw on the staff at once the additional <Col N="648" /> burden imposed by those taxes would have meant that goods would have got in and we would have been throwing sand in our own eyes.  There has been a delay, but the delay was excusable, and was due to the question of staffing. The delay has to a point weakened the value of the experiment.  That can be borne in mind when at the commencement of the next financial year the Government again consider this. Senator Sir Nugent Everard referred to this as a remedial measure against unemployment. Unemployment is one of the many items which I had in my own Department to tackle.</P>
      <P>Almost every Government has this problem at the present time.  It has to be approached from many angles. There is the bringing forward of certain utility work.  That is an extravagant approach to it, because you get work done, not under the best conditions, but by unskilled labour.  Then you have measures which go to the basis of this industry, such a thing as where you contemplate schemes to provide cheap power in the country. The Bill alluded to here, the Trade Loans Guarantee Bill, is one of the bigger approaches to the whole question of unemployment, and this item was pressed hard by my Department and the Finance Ministry as one means of tackling the unemployment question. It is not merely that you will have to have recourse to the dole only; it is a further fact that mere payment of what has been described as a dole in any country where there is a big amount of unemployment, must create a sense of insecurity which will affect men who will have enterprise in business circles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of unemployment means more than the provision that has to be made in an extravagant and unproductive way by means of the dole benefit.  It means the further thing, that if the courage and confidence of people who ordinarily would have enterprise is weakened, the credit of the country suffers.  Senator Kenny said, and I agree with him, that this measure should have a certain result&mdash; and if that result is achieved the experiment to my mind, on that point alone, would have been a success&mdash; that we should arouse again the investing <Col N="649" /> habit here.  Surely, if we can attract either by Protection or the Trade Loans Guarantee Bill, the creators and directors of enterprises, it would be an immense advantage. We have some such men, but we have not sufficient number in the country.  I think there should be no feeling of shame in admitting that there is any industrial weakness shown.  It only means that we find ourselves in that particular position from no fault of our own.  To censure us for being in our present position would be to pass censure on a victim of assassination for having died prematurely.</P>
    <P>We have to help people who are orphaned by assassination, and there are two ways of doing it.  I prefer myself the Trades Loan Guarantee Bill, but Protection can also be tried. Senator Douglas almost invited me to follow him into very difficult ground. I feel that this question of the power of the Seanad is not one I should touch on, but may I say this, that the Seanad has considerable power with regard to financial measures.  They can make recommendations.  These recommendations have to be considered by the Dáil, and are a direct way of bringing pressure on the Government. Indirectly, the Seanad can form public opinion, and can get the pressure of that public opinion to bear on the Government so that there is nothing to be gained by minimising the power of the Seanad in that respect. I was asked had the Government a trade policy.  That is a very difficult question for me to answer at the present moment.  I remember hearing from a friend of mine who at one time had to reside in Germany.  He said he had never seen a town with more weather-cocks fixed on chimneys than the town of Heidelberg, but the only one which was accurate was one in the University, which was fixed by hand.</P>
    <P>They found out what the prevailing wind was and fixed it to suit.  He said further that there was a Chinese habit that if they desired in the early days to change the wind they set the weather cock to what would suit them, in the hope that that would affect any wind that blew.  That is, apparently, what I am supposed to do here, to set up some <Col N="650" /> standard to which things generally would approximate.  I do not think it is possible to fix on any trade policy at the moment; we cannot say absolutely how we are going to master every economic circumstance.  There may be certain economic circumstances which will defy mastering and which will be beyond control.  All we can do is to collect all the information we possibly can about this country, collect all this information together and have our own point of view with regard to what would be a suitable policy in the circumstances. Until we get this research work done we can only proceed to clear the ground as much as possible.  I hold this session has been the most economic session that the Dáil or the Seanad has had.  There has been a lot of the type of legislation which is merely to fit the new machine to the new conditions.</P>
    <P>While the ground to that extent is being cleared, there are other things to come.  We have got to a point where we have measures with some economic bearing.  I have already alluded to the Census of Production Bill, which I hope to have brought in next session.  In regard to agriculture, the Minister for Agriculture has definitely introduced Bills aiming at the improvement of agriculture.  One of them was given a Second Reading here to-day.  These are his attempts to get better methods adopted by the agricultural community here and to remove these slipshod and haphazard methods to which Senator O'Farrell has referred.  Senator Douglas referred to the postponement of the time in which these duties would come into operation, and said it was a blunder. I explained how it arose.  It is a question of staff, and I regard it as having no bearing on the experiment.  It has perhaps a certain bearing, and the fact of the postponement will have to be taken into consideration afterwards. The duty on motor cars was retained as a revenue-raising operation; it brings in about a quarter million of money. Senator Douglas referred to one point about which I was rather surprised&mdash; the question of trade representatives abroad.  I feel that I should apologise in one way for the matter, because my attention has been so occupied with other things that I have not had much <Col N="651" /> time to give the attention to that question which it requires.</P>
    <P>I am not clear that any representative of ours abroad is paid a salary at the figure mentioned by him&mdash;I think he mentioned the figure of £300. I do not know of any representative who is in receipt of anything less than £600; several of them have considerably more, and have allowances in addition.  It must be remembered that the position of these men is a peculiar one at the moment.  They are rather observers than investigators.  They are really watching the flow of events, because at the moment the main effort is being directed towards what is described as the only market.  It is not the only market, but it is the main market.  When we find countries with which we are in such keen competition directing their whole attention on the capturing of that market it seems to us right that we should use our best efforts to consolidate our position in that market before we proceed to alternative markets.  It seems proper that we should concentrate on the market where we sell the greater portion of our produce.  The trade representatives abroad are more for the future than the present&mdash;not so much for the immediate future even.  I can see reasons why an expenditure of this kind on these representatives could be justified, and I should proceed to justify it later if the question was raised in the Dáil.  It must be remembered that that House looks very sharply at any expenditure for which one cannot show an immediate and direct return. I doubt very much if any question of raising the Vote for the Ministry of External Affairs so as to allow an increased payment to those representatives would meet with the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The question of alternative markets has been taken up here, as well as with our representatives abroad.  Close connection is being maintained with the Consuls abroad, as well as those here, and in that way we get a certain amount of information about the likelihood or possibility of being able to find markets other than the English markets.  Senator O'Farrell made one <Col N="652" /> remark which surprised me; he talked of a period of prosperity under Grattan's Parliament.  I at one time read the late James Connolly on Grattan's Parliament, and I understood him to be very far from convinced with regard to the prosperity that came about at that period.  If there was any prosperity he put it down to the fact that the workers were merely slaves, and I do not know whether the Senator would be willing to get that type of prosperity now.  He also stated with regard to the boot tax that the manufacturers here can only manufacture one pair in fifteen of those required. I think the estimate is, they can only produce 15 per cent. of the demand.</P>

      <P>I know there is an estimate that the production is 15 per cent. of the requirements of the Free State.  I accept, however, what the Senator has said, that the committee of experts has given the other estimate. Senator Jameson has alluded to and has praised the Minister for Finance for his determination to balance the Budget.  That is a much-abused phrase, but I am glad to find that the Minister's efforts should meet with the approval of the Senator.  I think we should get away from the technical atmosphere round this phrase, and look at the matter in the ordinary way, that the rogue and the spendthrift is not going to get any further credit once his easy-going methods are discovered.  That is the position the State is in; we had to say that we are not spendthrifts.  Although a certain amount has been done in the way of funding debt which has accumulated by reason of extraordinary expenditure, the main policy should, I think, be to strain ourselves a little bit in order to get a good, sound, financial reputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of lowering income-tax to the scale in Great Britain or Northern Ireland has been raised.  There is every desire to arrive at that position. But it is not possible to arrive at it at the moment.  No effort will be spared to have taxation brought at <Col N="653" /> least to the level of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  That matter is before the Government; it is their aim yet to achieve it.  Similarly, with Great Britain in the matter of profit taxes, we cannot afford to drop that at the moment, but it is recognised as a tax on enterprise, and a very crippling and paralysing tax, but it is a matter of what we can do.  Senator Gogarty talked of the rebuilding of the Four Courts.  This is a point that has often been raised: &ldquo;Why does not the Government proceed to rebuild the Four Courts and the Custom House?&rdquo;  The Government policy is easily stated.  A certain amount of money has been set apart for the provision of houses.  There is sufficient work in the country at the moment to keep the building trade at work for five to ten years in the matter of the burned out barracks, public buildings which were destroyed, and the necessary number of houses required to be built.  The Government supplied a certain amount of money towards the building of houses because they thought that they could get houses built to relieve congestion, and get the people employed.  They thought it better to proceed on the policy of getting houses built for the accommodation of people who wanted houses than to go on spending money on public buildings such as the Four Courts and Custom House by which you would have the Government Departments placed in a better position than they are.  The question of re-building the Four Courts and Custom House has not been overlooked.  It has been set aside for the moment, because it was thought better to set aside the money for the provision of houses in which people could live.  The question of the re-building of the Four Courts will be taken up later.</P>
    <P>As to Senator Gogarty's millionaire friends who may desire to settle in the country, I do not think I can pretend to give him an accurate answer on the question of taxes.  If it meets his point I may say this&mdash;if an American comes to this country and remains domiciled in America, takes a house here, but is domiciled in America, that man will be charged here only on his remittances sent to this country.</P>

      <P>This Treaty has been put down on the Orders of the Day.  The Treaty in question follows on in this way.  On the 5th November, 1914, war was declared upon the Turkish people.  That war actually ceased in operation in 1918.  A Treaty known as the Treaty of Sevres was negotiated, but it was never ratified.  Later on the Treaty known as the Lausanne Treaty was initiated prior to our coming into formal legal existence.  The general constitutional rule is that any treaty which is intended to have the Irish Free State as one of its parties at the initiation, negotiation, and signing of such a treaty, the representatives of the States interested should be present and should participate in the matter. In this case the Treaty was initiated prior to our coming into formal legal existence.  When we came into formal legal existence we were informed of the progress of the Treaty.  We were not represented by plenipotentiaries, nor were we invited to be at the signature. This Treaty is comprised in a big book of 150 pages.  (1) The net effect of it is to create a formal state of peace with Turkey; secondly, there is the convention known as the Straits Convention, which indicates that under certain conditions certain Powers may have to undertake warlike operations; thirdly, there is a convention which requires legislation in the various countries concerned, where a question of a contract between persons in one country and in Turkey arose that such a question should be dealt with, not by ordinary courts, but by a body known as the mixed Arbitral Tribunal. We are satisfied, so far as this country is concerned, that the only effect of the Treaty is this&mdash;There may be a doubt as to whether we are at war or not with Turkey, but the ratification of this Treaty puts that doubt at an end.  It is evidently a matter that could be argued as to whether we are or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not say that the way in which this Treaty was negotiated or signed was satisfactory to us.  It was very far from it.  But this Treaty, which took over a year to negotiate, has reached a point when it is being brought into effect, and that depends upon our agreement to its ratification, because it would be unconstitutional if ratification be made on behalf of the British Commonwealth without our agreeing to it.  It would be unconstitutional because it was initiated and negotiated on behalf of the whole Commonwealth, and as things are at present with this Treaty unratified and with the Near East in a rather unsettled state, it is in the interests of Europe and in the interests of the world that the Treaty should be ratified with as little delay as possible. Under these circumstances, and these circumstances only, it is proposed that we should acquiesce in its ratification. <Col N="657" /> We do so with very definite stipulations, such as are indicated in the resolution put before you, namely, that it is for the purpose of establishing beyond all reasonable doubt a state of peace, and that it is clearly understood that unless the Oireachtas shall hereafter undertake such commitments by legislation there are no commitments incurred by the Saorstát.  Senators may feel misgivings about the Straits Convention as to whether we are committed to the possibility of war.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out, if Senators will look at the Straits Convention, they will have no doubt or be in any doubt as to our judgment in that Convention. The expression &ldquo;Great Britain&rdquo; is used as far as the Council of the League of Nations is concerned, under certain circumstances.  The Council of the League of Nations might decide that warlike action should be taken.  If the Council decide that unanimously, Great Britain, but not the other States who are members of the Commonwealth, would be committed to take warlike action.  The only possibility that any Senator could have any doubts about would be that the Assembly of the League of Nations might, under Article 12 of the Covenant, decide that warlike action should be taken.  But I might inform the Senators that following on the statement I made here on the matter of the League of Nations Bill I wrote the purport of that statement to the League of Nations as a condition precedent to our entering the League of Nations.  That statement of mine pointed out that we joined the League of Nations following the direct legislation of our Legislature, and that we could only operate subject to our Constitution, Article 49 of which stated that this country could not go to war except by the expressed sanction of the Oireachtas.  Under these circumstances, it means that we cannot be committed to any warlike action except by the express action of the Seanad and the Dáil, which forms the Legislature of this country.</P>

      <P>One cannot read that treaty and discuss it since this morning.  We have had other things to do.  It certainly would be very unfair to ask us.  Now the Minister says it is unconstitutional for the Empire or Commonwealth to make any treaty in which every member of that Commonwealth does not agree.  Well, then, in future time there will be a great many treaties.  I have no doubt various nations are always making treaties, but the Commonwealth or Empire is never to make any treaty if every one of its constituent parts do not agree.  There will be no treaties at all in that case, because I think the Free State will certainly object to a great many treaties that will be made, and then such treaties go by the board. They cannot be made.  South Africa may object, and, if they do, the treaties cannot be made.  I do not know how it will get on, but the result will be that there will be no treaties.  It will be impossible to make treaties.  I do not profess to know a great deal about this Treaty of Lausanne.  I remember seeing it discussed in the English papers.  I remember a great lot of quarrels going on on this subject between the English Ministers and the Turks, and I read, too, that there were a great deal of quarrels between the Allies themselves.  What happened was, there was a Treaty of Sevres, in which certain Powers divided Turkey amongst themselves.  They left the Turks a little spot in the centre of Asia Minor.  The Turks did not approve of that and proceeded to fight. England succeeded in occupying Constantinople. She got herself a pretty safe footing in Constantinople, where she wanted to remain, just as she remained in Egypt, slipping in and keeping up whatever pretext might be made.  It was a very nice little scheme, and has very often succeeded, I must <Col N="659" /> say, in the past.  On this occasion it did not succeed.  The French said, &ldquo;Very well, you made an alliance with the Greeks and prevented the Turks coming to the Straits.  Now we will join the Turks.&rdquo;  The French joined the Turks and supplied them with ammunition and arms.  The English backed the wrong horse.  The Greeks were beaten, and the Turks went to Constantinople and captured it.  The English got into a nice fix then.</P>
      <P>They then proceeded to arrange the Treaty of Lausanne and lay down certain terms which the Turks would not have.  Lord Curzon was there and tried to bluff them by taking a train and packing off to London, after telling them he would not have any more to say to them.  The Turks were not in the least put out and maintained their position.  As they were prepared to fight, and as the English were not prepared to fight, naturally they won, and got whatever they wanted in the Treaty of Lausanne.  All these things are so disgraceful, and there have been so many intrigues and so much dirty work mixed up with them, that I distinctly object to Ireland being mixed up in or recognising this Treaty, good or bad. Why should we be mixed up in it?  The Saorstát had nothing to do with the war, as it was not in existence at the time.  We had something else in existence then.  It was the United Kingdom or the Republic.  Not a single Saorstát soldier fought in the war, as the Treaty was entered into before the Saorstát came into existence.  Let England or the Imperial Government, or whatever it is called, make peace and make a Treaty, but let us keep our hands clear of this dirty work in which there were intrigues between the different nations. What that Treaty resulted in was a wholesale massacre of Christians. There was about one million Christians in Asia Minor.  The Turks proceeded to massacre a great many of them and drove the rest into Greece, where they are starving.  I know that there has been a good deal of twisting of words in the motion in order to try and get us out of this matter as much as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We acquiesced in the Treaty of Lausanne, <Col N="660" /> and that is a thing that I distinctly object to.  I do not think we should have anything to do with that Treaty.  It is being sought to spread abroad that if Ireland does not sign this Treaty negotiations will have to begin all over again.  Does the Minister or any reasonable person suppose that if we decline to have anything to do with the Treaty of Lausanne that the whole thing would be scrapped, and that England and the other countries would go to war to fight it out because we objected to this Treaty? That proposition is ludicrous, and is put up to induce us to sign this Treaty. That we object to and the country will object to it very much.  That is only one of those usual pleas brought here for us to swallow wholesale, and to get us to pass this.  Suppose we do not agree, what is going to happen?  Plenty of wars have been ended without a Treaty, and we can pass a resolution to end this war.  I suggest instead of this long statement in which we are trying to get out of various things and not commit ourselves we could make a very simple statement.  I propose this amendment: &ldquo;That without pledging the Irish Free State to the Treaty of Lausanne, the Seanad authorises the Executive Council to declare a state of peace to exist between the Irish Free State and the Turkish Empire.&rdquo;  It seems to me that by simply doing that we get out of all these difficulties, and get away from the Treaty of Lausanne.  Let it be understood that we are not in future to be bothered by any of these things. I think the Minister said the other day in the Dáil that this thing would not happen any more; at least I think he said something of that sort.  Does that mean that no Treaty would be made again without consulting us?  I am not very fond of these consultations, and I think the Saorstát would be better out of them.  They mix us up with all sorts of Imperial questions, and matters which are generally concerned with the getting of gold or territory, or one thing or another, from this country or any other country.</P>

      <P>I desire to say with regard to treaties generally that I think we need not concern ourselves very much with them.  We will not dominate the situation at any time, and the main or dominating interest controls the situation.  It may be said that there is not in existence to-day a treaty that existed ten years ago.  When the strain come they all fell through, and they were treated as scraps of paper. As to this particular Treaty, as far as we are concerned, we were not in existence at the time it was made. Does it now await the signatures of the various Ambassadors or Deputies for completion?</P>

      <P>We were part of the United Kingdom at the time, and we had no legal separate national existence, and in that sense we were not represented in any of the negotiations leading up to this Treaty, or the drafting of it afterwards.  Before it was completed or ratified the change took place, and the Free State was established. Now, the Commonwealth of Nations takes the place of the United Kingdom, and could we, as one of the units of the Commonwealth of Nations, object as a unit to all that has been done in the text of the document?  The Minister has given a digest of the main features of this Treaty and its purport, and as to our liabilities attaching to it.  Somebody may have a liability to go to war.  We here by Article 49 of our Constitution decided that we shall not be brought into war without the consent of the Oireachtas.  To that extent our constitutional status may be in conflict with some of the unimplied liabilities or commitments in this Treaty.  We do not know, we are not familiar with the text of the arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Minister's assurance that they also take a constitutional attitude, and that our limitations in that respect as defined by the Constitution, do not conflict in any way with some of the stipulations of this Treaty, and that there is no liability as to war or <Col N="662" /> contributing towards any wars that may arise.  It states here: &ldquo;To acquiesce in the ratification of the Treaty provided that it be clearly understood that unless the Oireachtas hereinafter undertake such commitments by legislation, the Saorstát thereby incurs no commitments other than the definite establishment of peace.&rdquo;  Why should it be clearly understood?  There must be something wanted still.  We put in that stipulation to be clearly understood.  By whom?  Is it by the parties to the Treaty?  This assent goes forward with this tail to it, and it is a question whether we can make that stipulation, or whether that is what is required or not.  I think our absolute unqualified assent is what is required, but we, of course, must put in that stipulation in order to keep ourselves within Article 49 of our Constitution.  I would rather take the suggestion made by Senator Colonel Moore.  If that would enable the Treaty to be ratified, it would be the safest course for the Saorstát to pursue.  There would be no ambiguity about the position then, and it would declare that we, as a nation, are not at war, but in absolutely peaceful terms.  That is in effect what they want to express, and if we give that assurance, and that comes from the Government, I do not think that will in any way place any embargo or put any obstacle in the way of other parties to the Treaty ratifying and completing the document.</P>

      <P>It is a question like this that makes me into what I might call a constitutional Republican, because really the status of the Saorstát is not much less than a Republic, except in a case of this kind when we are dragged at the tail of the British Empire.  As Senator Colonel Moore pointed out, if we signed this we shall be, putting it in popular phraseology, doing it under duress. Personally, I think we ought to agree to the ratification more or less under duress.  It was not, however, so much to say that that I rose as to take this opportunity of reminding the Seanad that about a month or so ago we passed a resolution making a suggestion to the Dáil that there should be a Joint Committee <Col N="663" /> of the two Houses on foreign affairs. As far as I know, that has not been considered.  It certainly has been ignored by the Dáil, and we received no reply.  I take this opportunity of reminding the Seanad that such a resolution was passed, and in so doing I may remark that this very Treaty of Lausanne was referred by the French Parliament to their Foreign Relations Committee. If we had a Foreign Relations Committee to refer these things to, possibly we should be able to discuss them with more knowledge.</P>

      <P>I am very glad Senator MacLysaght mentioned that resolution of the Seanad.  I do not suppose we could ever get a better example of the want of such a Committee to advise us on foreign affairs than is afforded by this amendment. None of us, including my friend, Senator Moore, seems to know a great deal about it, and if we had some members of the Seanad who were acquainted with the matter and could have really explained the whole thing to us and dealt with it in a practical way, we would know a great deal more about it.  Here we are now discussing what is really a great international question, perhaps with actually no knowledge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>We take it for granted that the quality of those present will make up for that.  The point I make is this: As far as Senator Moore's proposal goes it is that we should deal with the matter in the resolution which he has brought forward instead of dealing with it as the Minister has asked us to do, and as the Dáil has agreed to do, and without any knowledge that this proposal would in any shape or form meet the ideas of the Turkish Republic.  I suppose there has been a great deal of difficulty in arranging these matters, and undoubtedly the Turkish Republic has agreed to accept these terms of peace.  Whether they would consider it wise or whether they would accept the offer we make I do not know, but I can see that supposing the Dáil was to agree with the Seanad if we pass this resolution, we might meet with a very serious rebuff <Col N="664" /> by the Turkish Republic telling us that they did not know anything about us, and that they would not recognise our interference in this matter at all.  I doubt if it is consistent with the dignity of the Seanad not to take the advice of the Minister and follow the course which the Dáil has done, and agree in this instance to do the necessary thing to enable the Treaty to be ratified.  We might, in a casual way here this evening, be really upsetting something quite serious.  It must have taken a considerable time to arrange the terms of peace with Turkey, and for any of us to say we would do the slightest thing to interfere with such an arrangement would be a serious matter, and nothing that I have heard here this evening at any rate would induce me to vote for Senator Moore's resolution or amendment to the proposal of the Minister.  I do hope that the Senator will not take up an attitude that may have a very far-reaching consequence without any of us having any idea of these matters, which were well thrashed out in the Dáil.  I think it would be wise to follow that example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to say that I consider the proposed amendment by Senator Moore as absolutely impossible and unconstitutional.  I have not said anything in the resolution committing us to saying whether we are at war or not at war with Turkey. War was declared on behalf of the whole British Empire on November 5th, 1914.  At that time I was on one side and Colonel Moore was on another. I strongly felt at that time that Ireland should not be connected with such a war.  I was belonging to the Irish Volunteers that split upon that very point.  Constitutionally and internationally I think we cannot get out of the fact that in a war declared on behalf of the British Empire, internationally Ireland was recognised as part of the British Empire, and was at war with Turkey.  The ratifying machinery for such a Treaty as this is usually the Crown.  Senator Moore waves to one side as ridiculous my statement that it is unconstitutional for this Treaty to be ratified without our acquiescence. I have used the word &ldquo;acquiescence&rdquo;<Col N="665" /> very carefully.  I have not used the word &ldquo;recommended,&rdquo; and I have not used the word &ldquo;concurred,&rdquo; because I consider that the negotiation of this Treaty was done in a way which, if not absolutely unconstitutional, bordered upon it.  We, in this Resolution, state clearly our stipulation.  This is a big Treaty of 150 pages long, but we state that we will not object to the machinery of the Crown being used for the ratification of this Treaty, provided that&mdash;provided that it was provided&mdash; that as far as this country is concerned we are committed to do nothing whatsoever except where some people might be in doubt as to whether we are at war or peace now, that there might be no further doubt whatsoever about it. That is clearly set out there, and that is what we are committed to.  It is the fact&mdash;Senator Moore might wish it was not, and he might say so&mdash;but that it is unconstitutional for a Treaty negotiated on behalf of the whole British community of nations to be ratified without the concurrence or acquiescence of all the governments or states which form the British Empire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator referred to my statement in the Dáil that this sort of thing would not happen again.  What is this sort of thing?  It is that a plenipotentiary appointed by one State of the British community of nations initiated, negotiated and signed a Treaty.  Not only that cannot happen again, but the fact that this Treaty was done in such an undesirable way has brought up the whole question.  It was pointed out by Colonel Moore that no Treaty would be ever negotiated again which would take six governments to agree to its ratification.  I think it must be recognised now that the existing machinery for such an arrangement is out of date for some time.  I explained in the Dáil that although the declaration of the equality of the nations forming the British community of nations has been made, the machinery for implementing that equality was not up to date.  It must necessarily come up to date sooner or later.  This Lausanne Treaty has brought one aspect of the machinery to the forefront, and made it necessary for this matter to be cleared up.  I cannot say on what lines it will be decided <Col N="666" /> that things will be done in future.  I pointed out to the Dáil, a few nights ago, that it could be met in this way. A Treaty could be initiated say to change to a state of peace.  Six or seven co-equal members of the British community would be represented there by plenipotentiaries.  The main point is they all agree on peace.  That involves a great many other considerations, such as the limitation of boundaries and so on.  They all agree on the main features of the Treaty, but when it comes to the setting down of the clauses of the Treaty they may disagree on the various clauses.</P>
    <P>I suggest that parallel Treaties may be made agreeing in the main object of the Treaty, but possibly diverging as to the various clauses of the Treaty. In the Dáil also, a month or two ago, when I was speaking on the Liquor Treaty of America, I said I could not consider ourselves as bound by the clauses of the Lausanne Treaty, and I still cannot consider ourselves bound. We had nothing to do with the making of it, and were only presented with it at the end.  I am satisfied myself, and I think the British Government agree with me, that actually in the Treaty so far as our interests are involved, there is no vital thing except the removal of doubt as to whether we are at peace or war.  The other conventions do not affect us.  The other conventions do not affect us because the machinery cannot involve us or the terms of our joining the League of Nations or the general situation of the League of Nations, and the mixed tribunal cannot involve us because none of our nationals have been involved in practices which would have to go before a mixed tribunal.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise what the constitutional position is.  Supposing even now when this Treaty was initiated that we say we do not like the way you are going on, and suppose that had been agreed.  When it came to the ratification of the Treaty the affair would have been met at the instance of the Government of the Irish Free State. We might say we are not at war with Turkey.  The Turks might think otherwise. They might proceed to intern our people, if we have people in Constantinople and other places, to-morrow. There are certain international <Col N="667" /> ways of doing it.  A change from war to peace should be conveyed to the Turkish Government <i>par voie diplomatique.</i> It is not done by one of us sitting up here and saying we are not at war with Turkey.  My saying it here at another time did not make much difference.  Unfortunately, I was in a minority at that time.  Colonel Moore has suggested that the wording of this resolution was put for the bewilderment of the Seanad.  It is nothing of the sort.  We have a certain constitutional position to safeguard and certain rights and certain interests.  We recognise it is desirable that this Treaty should be ratified in a general way.</P>
    <P>It has been ratified by Turkey, Japan, and Italy, and it has to be ratified by England and France, and is to become operative when we complete its ratification.  I think three on the one side have to ratify it.  We recognise it is necessary in the interests of the world generally that this Treaty should be cleared away with as little delay as possible.  Its constitutional effect is that it cannot, as it stands, be ratified except we make it clear that we are not objecting on our behalf to the ratification. In doing that we must also make it clear that we cannot take for the past at any time responsibility.  We are prepared to do it as far as the definition of peace is concerned, but we cannot take over any responsibility for any arrangements made by the British plenipotentiary on the one side and the Turkish plenipotentiary on the other. We desire to have the matter cleared up.  There is no other machinery I can see at the moment for clearing it up except by the means I see here.  We agree to this, and we make it clear where we stand on this.  We make it clear that we object to the Royal Title used in this as in the Liquor Treaty.</P>
    <P>I understand that steps are being taken to have the Royal Title in accordance with the state of facts as created by the signing of the Treaty of 1921.  It is also recognised in regard to Canada, as well as to ourselves, that the machinery which has been used up to the present is not in accord with the present conditions of things nor in accord with the equality that exists. That equality, I admit, creates a very <Col N="668" /> complicated situation, and it is necessary, and I think the British Government have publicly indicated it is necessary, that at some early date consideration must be given to what machinery will be used in cases such as this and other similar cases in order that the co-equal States may work in harmony towards one end and at the same time make their mutual independence perfectly clear.  With regard to the Foreign Affairs Committee, there was a resolution passed here some time ago suggesting that a Foreign Affairs Committee should be formed and suggesting the lines on which it should go.  The matter was put before the Dáil, and the Dáil, so far, has taken no action on the matter.  I do not quite see how the Ministry can be put on Commission, particularly a Ministry like the Ministry of External Affairs which involves the receiving of a great many confidential documents and despatches that the Minister is not at liberty to publish.</P>

The Dáil has not taken any action in the matter, but if the Seanad wishes to have such a committee and to have a copy of the Lausanne Treaty, and to go through these Treaties very carefully, I do not see what is to prevent the Seanad from doing it.  So far as the Lausanne Treaty is concerned, this resolution makes it perfectly clear that the only thing we are doing is to establish that the state of peace shall be clear and definite, and shall not be doubtful, and that whatever else may be in the Treaty we accept responsibility for nothing else whatsoever.</P>

      <P>I want to say in connection with this <Col N="669" /> motion&mdash;I think that An Cathaoirleach intended to mention it if he were here&mdash; that it would be a great convenience from the point of view of the members of the Seanad that some days' notice should be given of a motion of this kind.  It would facilitate Senators considerably if a motion of this kind were circulated.  Members would then know the day on which it was coming forward and would have the actual wording of the resolution, and what is more important, amendments such as were proposed to-day would appear on the Order Paper.  I mention this matter with a view to facilitating the future arrangements of the Seanad.  I am in a difficulty with regard to the future programme.  I took it from the Cathaoirleach that it was not intended to take any of the other Bills this evening, but to postpone the other business which appears on the Order Paper until Wednesday next.  The Minister for Agriculture is interested in one of these Bills and he is willing to wait until Wednesday.  In that case, when we meet at 11 o'clock on Wednesday, we will have the remaining business left over from to-day, namely, the Second Report of the Joint Committee on the Temporary Accommodation of the Oireachtas, the Local Government (Rates on Agricultural Land) Bill, Second Stage; and the Committee Stage of the Dáil Eireann Courts (Winding Up) Bill.  There will also be the Second Stages of the Local Elections (Postponement) (Amendment) Bill, the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act (Continuance and Amendment) Bill, Criminal Justice (Administration) Bill, Criminal Justice (Evidence) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be the Committee Stages of the Finance Bill, National Health Insurance Bill, Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Bill, Unemployment Insurance Bill and Dublin Police Bill, and also the Report Stage of the Railways Bill and the Fifth Stage of the Pilotage Orders Confirmation Bill and possibly the Second Stage of some other Bill may reach us between now and next Wednesday. Senators should come prepared to sit for several days.  I want to draw attention to the fact that we have not taken the Second Reading of some Bills which were on the Order Paper <Col N="670" /> to-day.  That will mean that we may have to be prepared to take the Committee Stage immediately after the Second Reading, or it will mean a considerable delay in these Bills.  I mention that so that members of the Seanad may prepare any amendments for the Committee Stage during the interval between this and Wednesday next.</P>

      <P>I did not say it would be necessary, but I said that the Seanad is adjourning to-day without taking the Second Stage of any of these Bills.  It might be found desirable to take the Committee Stage the day after the Second Reading. I make no comment on what the Seanad will do in the matter.  I simply draw attention to it.</P>

      <P>It would be of great convenience were we to know that the order of business on the Paper might be adhered to.  If we knew, for instance, whether the Railway Bill was to be taken at 11 o'clock, people coming from the country would have to catch an early train on Wednesday morning, but if you said now that the Railway Bill will not be taken until after lunch it would be very useful.</P>

      <P>I do not think, as Deputy-Chairman, I am in a position to make that statement. The present policy of the Seanad is to put the business down on the next agenda, and not to fix any specific dates.  I think it is practically impossible to give any guarantee; probably An Cathaoirleach will try to ascertain the desire of the Seanad as to what order it should be taken.  Beyond that it is impossible for me to give any promise which I would not be in a position to have carried out.  There is no other business except the Motion on the Adjournment.  Senator McLoughlin has given notice that he would call attention to certain matters.  I ask him that he would formally move that we adjourn until Wednesday at 11 o'clock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLOUGHLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move <Col N="671" /> that the Seanad adjourns until Wednesday at 11 a.m.  I feel I should apologise for bringing forward this matter on the adjournment after such a strenuous day's work.  But, as it is a subject that is causing much uneasiness in Ulster and which involves not only the sovereignty of the country but the lives and the fortunes of the Catholics of Ulster, I feel justified, even at this late hour, in bringing it forward. I want to draw attention to the visit of Mr. Justice Feetham and to the fact that the sitting of the Boundary Commission, of which he is Chairman, has been postponed owing to the action of the British Government in referring to the Judicial Committee of its Privy Council matters which appertain to the Treaty of December, 1921.  The visit of Mr. Justice Feetham was welcome news to me until I read the official announcement that he could not enter upon his duties until the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council had decided as to his jurisdiction.  While he was on the high seas I was also startled to read a quotation from an article in the London &ldquo;Times&rdquo; of, I think, last Friday week, declaring that the construction of the Treaty depended upon a British Act of Parliament passed in the year 1833, in the reign of King William IV., and that the only time this obsolete Act had been availed of was in connection with the African Colony, Rhodesia.  I have the greatest respect for the African Dominions, and I do not want to degrade their judges, as Lord Carson did, by importing the nickname &ldquo;Timbuctoo.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen, however, that Mr. Justice Feetham had emerged from Capetown to Belfast via Dublin, and that &ldquo;The Times&rdquo; has contrasted the reasonableness of Sir James Craig with the stubbornness of President Cosgrave. All these things are very disquieting to an Ulster man.  As an Ulster man, and, therefore, one vitally interested in the Boundary Question, I wish to ask&mdash;and I am sorry that there is no representative of the Government here to answer me&mdash;whether our Attorney-General has advised our Government on the new position, which seems to refer the construction <Col N="672" /> of the Treaty to the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council, fixed apparently by the British Colonial Office.  I wish to ask whether this Act of 1833 is going to over-ride the Treaty.  I do not want to make any mischief.  I am simply asking for information.  I desire to inquire if our Government has examined the procedure which the British Colonial Office have adopted in blockading the inquiry of Mr. Justice Feetham under the Treaty, by delaying its functions, until Judges from Australia and Canada are consulted under this Statute of King William IV.  A number of Ulster men who are seriously concerned in this question have taken the trouble to submit this Act for expert legal opinion, and that expert legal opinion is, that the Act of 1833 has nothing to do with the Boundary Question, and nothing to do with Ireland or any Irish question. It simply concerns maritime questions and questions relating to appeals from the Colonies.  Ireland is not Rhodesia, as the London &ldquo;Times&rdquo; suggests, and as the late A.M. Sullivan said, &ldquo;it is not a sand-bank thrown up by the Atlantic Ocean.&rdquo;  The compliments paid to Mr. Justice Feetham's impartiality are, no doubt, thoroughly deserved, but he cannot be allowed to plough his lonely furrow, either in Belfast or in Dublin in blinkers.  Not only blinkers, but handcuffs and leg irons have been placed upon him by this provision, that the Commission cannot sit until the British Privy Council authorises him to operate.</P>
    <P>In all friendliness to President Cosgrave and his Ministry I say that their acquiescence in this situation is absolutely unconstitutional.  Why should Mr. Justice Feetham be accepted here if the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council may declare him in a few weeks to be nobody, and state that his Commission cannot sit?  The &ldquo;Times&rdquo; article praises the acquiescence of Sir James Craig in accepting Judge Feetham's intervention.  In Ulster that alone arouses suspicion.  I reject Lord Carson's aspersions on the learned Judge, but I have to ask myself the question whether, on the pretence of objecting to Mr. Justice Feetham, a plant is not being engineered to defeat <Col N="673" /> the Treaty, and hand over contrary to the wishes of the inhabitants the control of those portions of the Six Counties that have escaped the ravages of the planter?</P>
    <P>Without wishing to be provocative, I hold the opinion that Mr. Justice Feetham should not have visited Dublin or Belfast.  These cities are the strongholds of opposing opinions, and nothing can be learned in either city of the wishes of the inhabitants of the disputed area which the Treaty provides for.  In Ulster we are tired of this eyewash, and it is not to be wondered at, if the pretences raised <i>via</i> this Act of 1833, to blockade the action of Mr. Justice Feetham, to a good many of us savours of bad faith.  I ask for information as an Ulster man, and there is nobody here to give it to me.  It shows what the people in Ulster fear, the lack of interest which this Government takes in the Ulster question, although it had notice of my intention to move this motion.  I gave it personally to the Minister who has left, and although he spent an hour discussing the Treaty of Lausanne, the lives of the Catholics of Ulster are nothing to him, judging by his attitude this evening.  I want to know has the British Colonial Office devised this blockade on the entrance upon his duties of Mr. Justice Feetham, and are they, through his visit to Belfast, attempting to suppress the wishes of the inhabitants of the disputed areas?</P>
    <P>Dáil Eireann accepted the Treaty as a solution of the international problems between the two islands.  No one regarded it as a perfect instrument.  No Treaty is perfect.  Lawyers, professors and metaphysicians can always be found to discover blotches and pick holes in the work on which statesmen agree.  The gist of the Treaty is a friendly agreement between two islands so closely related.  The happiness of the two countries depends on friendship, both commercial and political.  I suggest to the Government that they should closely scrutinise this Act of 1833, and see whether it has any relation to the position of 1924.  To me it seems amazing that the Act of 1833 should control the construction of the Treaty of 1921.  As a layman I venture <Col N="674" /> to say that this Act of 1833 has as little relation to Ireland as it has to Honolulu, or may I say, Timbuctoo.</P>

      <P>As this question closely affects all of us I wish to say a few words about it.  We are all in ignorance about the present state of affairs.  I do not profess to be able to throw any light on the subject.  I would not like Senator McLoughlin to think that he is not supported in this matter.  Ireland made a Treaty with Great Britain, and we are not concerned in the least with the advice or the opinions of the Privy Council.  If the Privy Council gives the British Government advice to break the Treaty, very well.  Then we know where we are.  We have no regard for the Privy Council in this matter.  I believe there is something about the Privy Council in the Treaty.  That has no effect in this case, and I do not think it should. As I understand the position of the British Government, they have called in Dominion judges or statesmen in order that they may help and advise that Government on this question.  That is all very fine.  It seems to me to be a very cunning way of trying to break the Treaty, and at the same time get the support of the Dominions for Britain.  If they can get the Privy Council with the aid of these two Dominion representatives mentioned by Senator McLoughlin to advise them to make the Treaty inoperative we are in a delicate position.  The people in the Six Counties are between the hammer and the anvil.  Their position will be very serious.  I do not know what can be done to help them, but I do know what will happen if any tricks are played on this question.  Our position is clear.  If the Treaty is broken, whether with or without the advice of the Privy Council, our position is clear. The Treaty becomes invalid&mdash;&mdash;</P>
