      <P>The Seanad will remember that the President expressed the desire that facilities should be given to the Housing Bill; in other words, that we should, if possible, get through the Second Stage and the Committee Stage this week.  To meet his views the Second Stage was put down for to-day.  Unfortunately, owing to his unforeseen illness, the President is not able to be here to-day.  It is not at all certain that he will be here to-morrow. What I have arranged with one of his representatives, subject to the consent of the Seanad, is that we should dispose of the Second Stage to-day, and then later on in the day, when I have heard what are the chances of his being able to attend this week, we can before we adjourn fix the date for the Committee Stage.  I do not see any reason why we should not go on with the Second Stage to-day, because any observations that Senators make will appear in the Official Report, and the President can deal with them when they arise on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That this Bill be read a second time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>At the outset I must say that I regret extremely the President is not able to be present to-day, and the circumstances that have prevented him from being present.  I would very much prefer that the President should be present to hear the remarks which I propose to make on the Bill, because he is fully acquainted with the circumstances which I propose to deal with.</P>

      <P>I was anxious to accommodate you.  I thought <Col N="1058" /> that would be your feeling.  If there had been any certainty that the President would be here to-morrow we could have put off the Second Stage of the Bill, but I am afraid there is no possibility of that.</P>

      <P>That is all right.  The President, when introducing this Bill in the Dáil, intimated that the proposals were made with a view to alleviating unemployment, so far as that was possible, and to provide houses for the working classes at prices which it is hoped they will be able to pay.  Having these objects in view, it is proposed under the Bill that a sum of £300,000 shall be provided for the purpose of making grants or giving subsidies to private persons or speculators in order to encourage them to build houses or reconstruct existing dwellings.  Out of the £300,000 a sum of £250,000 is provided for the purpose of giving subsidies to private persons or speculators to encourage them to build houses, and a sum of £50,000 is to be used for the purpose of giving subsidies to persons who own existing dwellings for the purpose of reconstructing those dwellings so that they will be made habitable for the people.  The principle underlying the Bill is a departure from the usual procedure with regard to the erection of what is known as working-class dwellings.  Two years ago the Government provided £1,000,000 as a housing grant.  The local authorities in the country were given grants from this £1,000,000 to enable them to build houses.  The proportion of the grant so given was two-thirds of the cost up to £500.  In other words, for a house that would cost £750 the Government under that scheme made a grant to the local authority of £500.  When introducing this Bill the President, as a reason for departing from the previous practice, made statements to the effect that the local authorities did not avail themselves to the fullest extent of the provisions of the million grant scheme. That was the reason he gave why a departure should be made.  In the Dáil on the Second Stage of the Bill the President said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We did associate local authorities for the last two years in connection <Col N="1059" /> with the provision of housing, and I must say that when I first approached the Provisional Government with an application for £1,000,000 for housing, I did so confident that there would be a real earnest attempt made at using that money within 12 months.  Now, at the end of two years, or almost two years, it is regrettable to have to confess that only about 700 houses have been completed; 1,000 are in progress of being built, and 300 have not yet been commenced.  That was during a period when we offered £500 for every house that was constructed.  I would like Deputies to take notice that there was a real maximum effort on our part, and we were actually paying people for the love of all the necessary issue involved to take up this thing, and after two years we can only boast of 700 houses being completed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement may be true.  But, underlying that statement there is the insinuation that the local authorities neglected their duty sadly with respect to this most important question.  I cannot speak with authority on behalf of the local bodies, but I can speak with authority as far as the local authority of the Municipality of Dublin is concerned. During that period I have been a member of the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation, and I state here emphatically, without fear of contradiction, and with a full knowledge of the importance and the consequences of what I am about to state, that the reason the Corporation of Dublin did not avail itself to the fullest extent of the provisions of this million grant scheme, was because of the fact that the martinets of the Local Government Department, in continuance of the policy that they have adopted for the past ten years, deliberately set themselves to prevent the Dublin Corporation availing themselves to the fullest extent of their full share of this grant.  The Dublin Corporation, immediately this grant was announced by the Minister, availed themselves of the opportunity to push forward housing in the City of Dublin.  We prepared our plans, and we submitted them to the Local Government <Col N="1060" /> Department.  The usual policy of delay was adopted by the Local Government Department.</P>
    <P>On more than one occasion the Housing Committee sent deputations to the Local Government Department.  I was on two or three of these deputations to beg the Department to relax their efforts to prevent the Dublin Corporation from building houses.  We found that there had been a change in the Local Government Department as far as the name is concerned.  As far as the policy was concerned, however, there was no change, and the same people were in the saddle.  For ten years the people in the Local Government Department have deliberately set themselves out to prevent the Municipality of Dublin from building houses for the working class people.  I have in my hand at the moment documents to prove up to the hilt the statements I am making.  I say that the Local Government Department has continued to put obstacles in the way of the Dublin Corporation building houses.  On one occasion we went to the Local Government Ministry when it had been finding fault with the plans prepared and submitted by the Corporation.  They said: &ldquo;We have plans prepared.&rdquo;  We said: &ldquo;Give us your plans and we will adopt them.&rdquo; We adopted plans prepared by the architects and engineers of the Local Government Department, and said we would proceed to build the houses. Senators will hardly believe me when I say that when we submitted to the Local Government Department their own plans, prepared by their own officials, they held us up and said: &ldquo;You must alter the plans.&rdquo;  We had to alter their plans, and that meant another delay of a few months.  All these delays meant that the people in the city were being condemned to live under the horrible conditions that we know of.  I think if the Government are going to depart from the former practice of giving assistance or grants to local authorities to enable them to build houses for the working people, before instituting a new system or scheme, the least they ought to do is to get a just reason for doing so.  It is not fair to saddle the responsibility on the local authorities for not availing to the <Col N="1061" /> fullest extent of the grant of £1,000,000, and allege that as a reason why a change should be made when, as a matter of fact, the Local Government Department are wholly responsible for what has happened.</P>
    <P>During the two years that the scheme was in operation the Dublin Corporation built, or have almost completed, 717 houses.  Plans have been prepared and estimates secured for 197 more houses.  The plans have been approved by the Local Government Department, and everything in connection with the scheme approved of.  Sanction has been given for the first section of the scheme at Marino, embracing the building of 230 houses, which are to be completed within 12 months from the date of the signing of the contract.  For five months we have been pressing the Local Government Department for sanction to proceed with the second part of the scheme.  The contractor is prepared to proceed with the work at the same price as the other houses, and to have them completed within 12 months.  Despite the fact that these 197 houses at Marino are portion of the scheme, under which the Corporation is entitled to receive their portion of the £1,000,000 grant, amounting to £400,000, and although the roads are made and the sewers laid, we have met with no success as far as getting sanction from the Local Government Board to proceed, is concerned. Under these circumstances, I respectfully suggest that if a change is going to be made, it should not be made on the basis that the local authorities have failed in their duty.  If there is any reason why a change should be made, the correct reason should be given.  The change is certainly not due to the neglect of duty by the local authorities.  As far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned, it has not neglected its duty. Perhaps it is a little out of place to do so, but I think it is justifiable to mention another matter at this stage.  The Local Government Department have demanded that an Inquiry should be held into the performance of their duties by the members of the Dublin Corporation. I wish the Government would institute an inquiry into the performance of its duties by the Local Government Department.  I would prepare the indictment. <Col N="1062" /> I would not run away from the charges I make.  I will prove up to the hilt the manner in which the Local Government Department acted towards local authorities in connection with the building of houses.</P>
    <P>The idea in the Bill is to get houses speedily erected at a cost that will not be prohibitive.  In order to accomplish that it is proposed by the Bill that subsidies should be given to private persons to encourage them to build houses. In his statement in the Dáil the President said that under the Bill within twelve months he would get 3,000 houses.  I sincerely hope he will.  Nobody will be more pleased if he does than I will be.  Like the Scotchman, &ldquo;I hae ma doubts.&rdquo;  I have a recollection that a few years ago the British Ministry endeavoured to solve the housing problem on a similar system to this.  They offered a subsidy of £260 per house&mdash;a free grant of £260 per house to anyone who would erect a house in Dublin.  That was in operation for two or three years, but what was the result?  In the Dublin area there were 70 houses built under this grant and fifteen houses outside the city area.  For nearly three years there was a free grant of £260 to any person or combination of persons who would build a house.  The President expects to get 3,000 houses built under this Bill, with a £300,000 grant.  There has been a good deal of criticism about the local authorities.  I am prepared to bring any member of the Seanad around the city of Dublin, and I am prepared to show him houses that were built under the British grant of £260, and I am prepared to show him the houses built by the Dublin Corporation under the million grant, and he need not be an expert in building to see the difference between the two.  A good deal of talk has gone on in connection with the cost of building houses, and the Government, before this Bill was introduced, sent a circular letter to every Trade Union in the building industry and to the Employers' Associations in the same industry suggesting that they should meet with a view to reducing the cost of building.  We did meet, but we met on a demand of a reduction of fourpence an hour, <Col N="1063" /> amounting to about 16/- a week to every artisan in the building industry.</P>
    <P>The employers are quite prepared to co-operate on that basis, and to reduce the cost of living at the expense of the stomachs of those engaged in the building industry.  That was their contribution, and Mr. Good in the Dáil during the debate on this Bill was very generous.  He said that he would gladly do anything that would bring down wages in the building industry, and I quite believe he would.  That was his contribution.  With regard to the cost of these houses, there has been a good deal of misrepresentation.  I have seen on several occasions statements in the public Press to the effect that houses can be built in other places much cheaper than they can be built in this country, and I have seen comparisons made with regard to the prices which the erection of a house in Dublin costs and other places.  I have been sometimes amazed when I saw these figures that have been quoted.  I suggest that there is no use in making comparisons unless you make fair ones.  A house could be built for £250, or for £250,000. When you compare the price of a house you must take into consideration in the first place the design of the house.  In the second place you must take into consideration the materials used in construction, and in the third place you must consider the workmanship. I heard statements made regarding how well they are able to do it in England in comparison with this country. Last week I noticed in a Dublin morning paper a statement made by the Minister for Health in the British Government in reply to a query in regard to the number and cost of houses under the 1921 Act of Great Britain.  He stated that there were 63,000 houses built under that Act at an average all-in cost of £1,040.</P>
    <P>I suggest that under all the circumstances, and with all the handicaps we have here, we have done better than that.  Houses are being erected at the moment by the Dublin Corporation on the Fairbrothers' Fields area, and I think they will compare favourably with any working-class dwellings built in this country or in Great Britain, and <Col N="1064" /> the actual cost of these houses has been between £670 and £680.  If you allow the cost of acquisition of the site, I suggest that we are well within the limit of that prevailing on the other side, where the people are held up as a great example in house building.  I am using these arguments because of the fact that I do not think that it is fair or just that the local authorities should be blamed when they are not responsible. If the previous method of building is to be departed from, it is not fair to use arguments that are not correct.  During the course of the debates in the Dáil there was a good deal of discussion regarding the cost and the amount of output from the building operatives in this country.  Deputy Good was very anxious on several occasions in asking for an increase in output.  I had an opportunity a few weeks ago of meeting the Master Builders' Association of Dublin, when we discussed this question, and the spokesman of that Association stated in the presence of the delegates of the building operatives, that the employers were very pleased at the output in the past few years.</P>
    <P>When we come to the question of output, we must consider other things than the amount of work that ought to be done.  It is all very well for the theory men, the gentlemen who sit in offices with their feet cocked up to the fire, to work out in detail to half a brick, the amount of bricks which a bricklayer should lay in a day.  That is all very well, but I suggest that there are other considerations, and you cannot work it out to a nicety like that.  For instance, take a building operative who is living in a filthy slum in Dublin, and who is housed in a single room with his wife, and, perhaps, four or five children, in a putrid atmosphere.  How can you expect a reasonable output from a man who is living under such conditions? The theory men can work out what he ought to lay, but everyone will admit that a man condemned to live in a filthy Dublin room, and in a putrid atmosphere, is not physically fit to have his output measured in half bricks.  When a man is at work proper, there are other considerations to be taken into account. During the months of November, December and January last, it rained most <Col N="1065" /> of the time.  On several occasions then I went to Marino to see how the work of the housing scheme of the Dublin Corporation was progressing, I entered the field through which the workmen had to go, and before I got one hundred yards I was up to my knees in mud. The unfortunate artisans and labourers were there at ten minutes to eight in the morning.  They have to plough through that sea of mud, and a gentleman in his office can measure their output up to half a brick in theory.  Then they say the cost of building is prohibitive, and that we do not get sufficient output.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government that the methods proposed under this Bill will never solve this problem.  It is merely tinkering with it.  The only way this problem can be solved is not by giving subsidies to speculative builders, but by setting up a national housing authority. There will have to be, sooner or later, a housing authority set up in this country that will deal with this question in the manner in which it will have to be dealt with.  Tinkering with it under the methods of this Bill will not solve it. The houses that will be built under the provisions of this Bill will be built by speculative builders for the purpose of selling them.  I suggest, although everybody is entitled to proper housing, that three per cent. of the working-classes will not be able to get houses under the proposals of this Bill.  It is proposed in this Bill to give a subsidy of £100 to a builder or private person who will erect a five-roomed house on plans to be approved by the Minister. In addition to that, the local authority may make a further grant of £100.  In addition to that, the local authority has power to grant a loan equivalent to the grants under the provisions of this Bill. I suggest, with the knowledge I have of the building trade, that the houses under the provisions of this Bill will be built for the purpose of sale, and not three per cent. of the people who are most in need of houses, will be in a position to purchase those houses.  The people who will build those houses will be speculative builders, men who have not a very large amount of capital, and if they build three, four, five or six houses under this Bill, their capital is <Col N="1066" /> invested in those houses, and they cannot build any others until those houses are sold.  The person who builds those houses must have £400 to build them with.  There is an important departure in this Bill also.  It is in Section 8, where the Government propose to take powers to limit the cost of building material.  Section 8 proposes that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may at any time if he thinks fit, order a local inquiry into the cost (including the wholesale and retail prices, the transport, handling and overhead charges, and the margin of profit) in Saorstát Eireann or any particular part or parts thereof of any materials or appliances used in the building of houses, and if he is satisfied, after the holding of such local inquiry, that the cost of such materials or appliances in that area is excessive and restrictive of output of building work, the Minister may by order prescribe the maximum amount of the wholesale price or of the retail price which may be charged for such materials or appliances in that area or the maximum amount of profit and of transport, handling and overhead charges which may be included in the wholesale or the retail price charged for such materials or appliances in that area, and may at any time and from time to time by order continue, vary or revoke all or any prices or amounts prescribed by him or an appeal from him under this Section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This gives power to the Ministry practically to control the price of building material.  Statements have been made to the effect that there is profiteering in building materials.  It certainly does seem a strange thing that nearly all the standard articles required for building purposes, when applied for to the builders' providers in this city, are quoted at the same price.  Very seldom is there a difference of even a halfpenny or a penny in the article.  I will not go so far as to say that there is profiteering, but it is strange.  In London bricks are sold at £2 10s. 0d. per thousand; in Dublin you have to pay for inferior bricks £4 5s. 0d. per thousand.  Undoubtedly, there must be profiteering there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> If you go through the items required to build a house, on the average the materials required can be purchased from £20 to £25 cheaper per house.  The Dublin Corporation, a couple of years ago, in an endeavour to keep the industry going and to cheapen the cost of building of those houses, entered into a contract with the only company who manufactured bricks in this city, for a million bricks, and the price was reduced in consequence.  We entered into a further contract for three million bricks, and got a further reduction.  We made it a condition of our contract that contractors who got contracts for building houses under the Corporation scheme, had to take a certain proportion of the bricks.  A most extraordinary thing happened.  One of the contractors, who was compelled to buy a certain proportion of the bricks required out of the three million contract bricks, when he had exhausted his quota, did not buy any more from the Corporation.  He could buy bricks cheaper per thousand than the Dublin Corporation could, buying them in three million lots.</P>
    <P>That is an extraordinary thing, but, nevertheless, it is true.  So that there must be profiteering somewhere.  Under Section 8 the Minister has power to institute an inquiry into the cost of building materials, and if he is satisfied that there is profiteering he has power to purchase supplies or to manufacture them.  I am delighted to see that Section in the Bill, but I am not at all satisfied that the Ministry will take full advantage of their powers, because I have a sad recollection of being a member of a Commission that was set up by the Government to inquire into prices, and that Commission was composed of representatives of the employers&mdash;Deputy Hewat was one of the members, the wife of a Cabinet Minister was a member, as were several important and influential people in the city.  Two or three representatives of Labour were on it also, and though the Commission was not in a position to do its duty to the public properly because of the insufficient powers they had, they were unanimous in one thing, were perfectly satisfied, from all inquiries they made <Col N="1068" /> and the information before them, that with regard to a certain commodity, pretty freely consumed, there was room for a considerable reduction in the price.</P>
    <P>The Committee unanimously recommended that the Government should reduce the price of porter and stout. That recommendation was made nine months ago.  I understand that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce took some action in the matter in so far as they sent a note to the licensed traders asking them to come to see them, and they begged their pardon and asked them could they see their way to reduce their prices.  Like good and true men, the publicans said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  So that I suggest unless the Government means business there is no use in fooling themselves by putting a clause into the Bill that gives them power to do certain things, if they are not prepared to carry it out.  If they do not I suggest they should not put it in.  I have made a statement that is common knowledge, from the facts presented and the present wholesale prices, that the price of porter and stout should have been reduced many months ago, and that the Government had not the courage to tackle these people and compel them to do what they ought to do in the interests of the public, and I suggest that if they do not intend to carry out the provisions of this Section there is no use in introducing it into the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would be very pleased if the estimate of the President is realised, that 3,000 houses will be built under this Bill, but I do not believe they will.  I have some little knowledge of the building industry, and I am perfectly certain that they will not.  I want to suggest that when changes are made they ought to be made for good and sufficient reasons, and not reasons that are not correct.  With all the talk we have heard about the lack of energy on the part of local authorities and the prohibitive cost of houses that are built by them, I am not in agreement.  As I said before, when you are making comparisons, you have to compare two similar objects, and I suggest that the comparison that appeals to me when I hear people comparing the cost of houses, is something like this: Say that a gentleman <Col N="1069" /> bought a suit made by a high-class tailor, of the best material, which costs him £10, and that the same sized man bought a suit of ready-made shoddy, which cost him 35s.  You have two suits that fit the same man; one costs £10 and the other 35s.  Now, this is the same comparison as when you compare a house built for £250 and a house built for £870.  One is a well-built house, well-designed, with the best materials and workmanship; the other is a shoddy, jerry-built house, badly designed, with bad materials and defective work.  There is the same comparison as between the two suits.  I hope when people are comparing the cost of houses built by local authorities, that the people who have endeavoured to deal with this problem will get fair play.</P>
    <P>From my experience and knowledge of him, I believe that the President is sincerely anxious to do what is right. I have been associated with him in a small way for close on 20 years, and I know that he has been at all times most sincere and anxious to help to solve this terrible problem.  But I am not at all satisfied that the President is able to go into these matters as fully as he ought to.  I am perfectly satisfied that the arguments that he uses are not based on correct information supplied to him.  I remember last year the President making a statement to the effect that owing to the lack of skilled labour in the building trade it was impossible to get a greater output than 200 houses per year in the city of Dublin. It was a very serious statement, and the men in the building industry took the matter up.  We interviewed the President, and before doing so, we prepared for his information a chart, in which we showed the total number in each of the skilled trades in Dublin who were employed on housing schemes in Dublin during every week of the twelve months, and the total number of men in each trade who are unemployed during each week of the twelve months, and we proved conclusively to him that there were more than twice the number of men in each of the skilled trades, on an average, unemployed during the period, than the men who were engaged in building, and that, notwithstanding <Col N="1070" /> that, nearly 400 houses were built in the city during that twelve months; so that it is hardly fair that the President should be placed in a position such as that on information supplied to him that is not correct, and I am perfectly satisfied that most of the information supplied to him in connection with the lack of duty on the part of local authorities, has been based on wrong information. I say that the people who are responsible for the fact that the local authorities did not take full advantage of the last grant of £1,000,000 for housing, are the Local Government Department themselves.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes another new departure. It proposes, in addition to the grants, or subsidies, that will be given by the State and by the local authority, there shall be a remission of rates for a period of 19 years.  Five per cent. of the total rates will be paid in the first year, and an addition of five per cent. in each succeeding year, until the 19th year.  So that in reality those who build under the provisions of this Bill will get a grant of £100 from the State, £100 from the local authority, plus a remission of rates for a period of 19 years, amounting on a valuation of £10, with the present rate, to another £100, and in reality there will be a subsidy of £300.  I want to call attention to the fact that in the Schedule it is provided that a person is compelled to sell or let houses built under this Bill, at a certain figure up to the 25th June, 1926.  I respectfully suggest that that period will have to be extended, because if not, I am afraid there will be a good deal of fraud, as people will be compelled to pay more for the houses than is laid down in the Bill, and I suggest that if people are paying rents, and are compelled to buy houses at present, irrespective of their value, it is levying blackmail on them as far as the rents and the purchase price of the houses are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear I shall not be able to deal with this matter with the intimate knowledge of detail and with the wealth of illustration of the last Senator, but there are certain aspects of the Bill which make me somewhat uneasy, and I felt it my duty to <Col N="1071" /> table certain amendments which expressed my anxieties.  I should like to know from the Government, broadly, what is their policy with regard to this serious and important question of housing.  I think we all feel its gravity, and what the effect of a lack of houses means on the moral and general betterment of the people.  I should like to know from the Government if they think they could solve this problem by State schemes, or whether they merely regard these State schemes as in interregnum and are going to make an honest effort to get back to the basis of private enterprise.  If private enterprise is their policy how is it going to be attained? Because there are certain features of this Bill which are the very negation of private enterprise, and calculated to deter any honest effort on the part of private capital to enter into building work.  There are distinctly what I call socialistic tendencies in this measure and regarding, as I do&mdash;I have no doubt there are Senators who do not agree with me&mdash;Socialism as the greatest enemy of the State, I feel it would be necessary for us to examine these tendencies very closely, and, if necessary to amend them.  I refer first to the power to fix prices.  One is not talking in the realm of abstraction on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got recent experience of efforts at fixing prices during the war. We know it is an exceedingly complicated and difficult matter, and that it invariably tends to keep up prices. You simply cannot fix prices at one end of the scale and go to the retailer and say, &ldquo;Your prices are too high; therefore we will fix you at so much.&rdquo; You have got to go right down to the wholesaler, the manufacturer, and the supplier of raw material; you will have to set up a retail costings investigation, you will have to investigate things all along the scale to be just, and I presume you intend to be just, and to fix exceedingly elaborate schedules. The effect would be to call into being a large number of Government officials, and necessarily a large amount of Government interference. We know what Government interference means when we come to try to <Col N="1072" /> attract capital to business.  It was found during the war in the baking trade when you investigated the costs that they vary from a sum of 10s. up to a sum of 35s., as the cost of turning a sack of flour into bread, and when you investigated further it was found, of course, that the more efficient and better managed business could do it at a much lower cost, and the more old-fashioned business at a higher cost.</P>
    <P>The Government were in the dilemma that if they fixed the price too low they would drive out of business a large number of legitimate and deserving people, and if they fixed it too high they would be adding to the gains of those so-called profiteers. That is a practical aspect of the problem, as showing the difficulty, and in the end a price was fixed which had the effect of raising the cost of living. This power to manufacture is more disquieting.  Senator Farren feels that it is not going to be used.  I devoutly hope it is not going to be used, but I am afraid the harm is already done. You propose to take this power by legislation, and the mere effect of taking this power is going to frighten enterprise and deter capital.  Say what you will, capital is able to look after itself, will look after itself, and cannot be blamed for looking after itself, and if we are looking after ourselves it should be our interest to encourage capital, from whatever quarter, to come to our shores and develop our business.  I say this power to manufacture is the very way to discourage capital, and to make still more remote the day when private enterprise is going to come to our assistance in this matter of building.  I was tempted to put down an amendment to Sec-It reads: &ldquo;All materials and appli-it reads: &ldquo;All materials and appliances purchased or manufactured by the Minister under this Section shall be sold by the Minister to persons at certain prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How these people who have that mentality about business, are going to manufacture, I fail to understand. You are going into business with the determination to sell at a fixed price. The demand is for legislation to sell <Col N="1073" /> at certain prices, whatever the market value, and my amendment was going on to suggest that the public shall be compelled to buy, but I thought the Chairman would rule it out as frivolous. That is the natural consequence; if you say a thing shall be sold at a certain price you must also create a buyer, and you see the absurdity of the whole idea.  In this Section we see this delightful reference to the net cost of manufacturing in a Government establishment.  I had the honour of dealing with this question of Government accountancy some time ago, and I hope I persuaded you that from the point of view of correct cost there is no Government accounting machinery. If you attempt to arrive at the net cost of manufacturing in Government establishments you will have to recast your whole Government accountancy.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely necessary if you are going to bring Government enterprise into competition with private enterprise, and you must be prepared when you are going to undersell people to undersell them at true cost, and not at a fancy cost.  As to the allocation of grants, I should like to know from the Government how they propose to allocate the grants if the scheme is a welcome one.  According to Senator Farren there are great inducements to resell at a substantial gain.  Is there any scheme whereby the areas most requiring this assistance are going to get it, or is it a case of first come first served, because it is highly desirable that these figures should be apportioned fairly both on the rural and the urban areas. I agree with Senator Farren that there is danger in giving this power to sell within two years.  I think the Government should reserve some lien on this property if it can be sold, as apparently it can be sold, at such great advantage, and I feel it will be sold at a substantial profit, for private enterprise is not going within two years to saturate the market with houses, and as a consequence of some of the features of this Bill, I think that the scarcity of houses is bound to continue.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know how the Government propose to get the money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" /> Is the money to come from borrowing or from revenue? This interference with the local authorities appears to be very objectionable. You set up a local authority, autonomous, with responsibility, and although it is only permissive, you give them these temptations to add to an already oppressive rate.  In fact, you go further and extend their borrowing powers beyond the statutory limit.  I know that the housing difficulty is one that might require special measures, but this power given to the local authorities is a very dangerous one.  This is really a point I wish to drive home. You are faced with the fact that a large number of these local authorities are obsolescent.  The date for their tenure of office has long since passed. As I said on the Collection of Rates Bill, they have been used and largely recruited for other than bona fide local administration.  They came into being in a time of war, and there were certain very peculiar features about their personnel.  They will shortly have to face an election, and it does seem undesirable to give those people these very far-reaching powers, which will add very considerably to local burdens. I would suggest as an amendment that in any district where the rates are more than double the pre-war rates that these powers ought not to be allowed until after the new Councils have been elected.</P>
    <P>I think we might ask ourselves can this demand really be met by the free play of economic forces?  The answer, I say, largely rests with Labour itself.  On this question of labour costs and prices, I think we have got to regard facts as somewhat ominous.  The prices of three leading lines of building material in which so much profiteering is alleged, that is cement, timber and bricks, have not doubled.  They are less than double.  I do not know what the rates of wages are within those trades, but the first two, cement and timber, are trades which are subject to international and foreign competition.  You will find that all along where foreign competition can operate prices will come down.  When you come to the labour aspect of the matter we find <Col N="1075" /> that, speaking generally, with regard to the skilled trades there has been an increase of, roughly, two and a half times in the hourly rate.  The increase in the unskilled trades is higher. Further there has been a 12 per cent. decrease in the number of hours worked.  Whatever may be said with regard to the increase in rates, if labour is genuinely anxious to help forward this housing scheme I would suggest that they might contribute materially by an increase in the number of hours worked.  This attitude of labour seems to be in the nature of class selfishness.  If you look at the rates in occupations where foreign competition applies you will find that there have been very considerable reductions. If you take the iron and steel trades, where foreign competition comes in, or the coal mining industry, you will find that the reductions have been substantially below, almost down to pre-war standard, unfortunately.  In agriculture, in the same way, there has been foreign competition, and the rates of wages are down to pre-war standard. But in these pivotal trades, transport and building, where foreign competition is not felt or only indirectly felt we have these abnormally high rates maintained, far above the rates of the cost of living.  For that reason I suggest that when we use the word &ldquo;profiteer&rdquo; it applies to more people than the capitalist.</P>
    <P>There is another source, and a somewhat valuable source, that the Government might really seriously consider tapping, to deal with this housing question. As the Seanad will recollect, under the Act dealing with malicious injuries, an attempt was made to allow decrees for reinstatement to be diverted to housing schemes.  The Government only met that partially.  They only allowed it in respect to partial reinstatement. The matter has not got far enough to measure the extent of that advantage, but it would be enormously increased if the Government would allow that change to take place in relation to full reinstatement.  That is that a person who had his house burned, and who is entitled in equity to have it reinstated as it was, should be allowed, if <Col N="1076" /> he wished, to divert the full amount of the reinstatement to housing schemes. I calculate that might bring into operation possibly a sum of £1,000,000 for housing schemes.  It would really go a long way to deal with the worst features of this evil.  There are certain further matters I should like to deal with in detail on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>This question is one on which I think there has been more speeches made than on any other subject of public importance.  At the same time, one might add, it is the subject upon which the least progress has been made.  Consequently, I am not going to make any lengthy contribution to this discussion.  Senator Sir J. Keane asked an extraordinary question.  He wanted to know when the Government was going to get back to the principle of private enterprise.  In other words, when was private enterprise going to get a chance.  I should like to ask the Senator, why has the Government come into the matter at all?  Is it not because of the absolute failure of private enterprise?  What is there to prevent private enterprise now from going on with the building of houses and selling them at any price, so long as there is no Government or local authority grant? Is it not because there has been an absolute failure on the part of private enterprise to supply this all-important public requirement that the Government has to come in and actually bribe the private builders to go on with this work?  It is an extraordinary thing to have a statement of that kind made. The Senator reiterates the charge that one of the causes of the break-down in building has been due to labour, and makes certain comparisons with regard to foreign manufactured material.  I think he suggested that if wages here were as low as in Great Britain that materials could be got very much cheaper.  The fact remains that we are importing practically the whole of our building materials.  As to particular items, I find that Portland cement in July, 1914, cost £1 17s. 0d. per ton.  A year ago&mdash;there has been no reduction since, I understand&mdash;it was £3 5s. 3d., very nearly double.  Grey stone lime was £1 8s. 0d. in 1914, and is £2 11s. 3d. <Col N="1077" /> at present, or less than a year ago, at all events.  The best stock bricks in 1914, cost £1 16s. 6d. per thousand; they now cost £4 2s. 0d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there is no appreciable reduction in most of these materials.  £1 16s. 6d. for bricks in 1914 and £4 2s. 0d. now represents more than 200 per cent. of an increase.  Rainwater pipes were 11¾d. a yard in 1914, and 1s. 11d. in March, 1923.  There are numerous other items such as slates, which were £11 13s. 0d. a thousand in 1914, and £28 10s. 0d. in 1923.  These prices show that the cost of labour, as far as these materials are concerned, must, in the main, be put on the workers on the other side of the Channel.  The Senator objects to any inquiry as to prices, but I think we must assume that if there is an inquiry of that kind that justice is going to be done, and that a reasonable profit at all events will be allowed.  Unfortunately, employers here do not believe in a reasonable profit.  They are generally out to get rich quick, and have not sufficient faith or patience to work at a reasonable profit.  They would very much rather, as we know, adopt that policy anywhere else than in Ireland.  I do not know if it is that they have not sufficient faith in the stability of the State, but it is a notorious fact that our industries have been very largely ruined because of that disposition on the part of employers. Our seaside resorts are deserted because of the extravagant charges that are made by hotel keepers.  There has been a spirit of impatience and a desire to amass a fortune in a short period that has not been manifest elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for that reason I think that the Government found it necessary to <Col N="1078" /> have this very restricted form of control. It is only a very restricted form. It is only to be made locally, and evidently with the object of ascertaining whether charges for materials in any one particular district are higher than in any other.  If the charges generally are too high the Government can do nothing.  It is really a gesture made to meet a certain demand in this direction, and I believe, unfortunately, it will not be in the least effective.  It is quite true that the Bill falls short, inasmuch as it does not make it incumbent that houses shall be built where most required. The Bill falls short in many respects, because it means that houses can only be built in small numbers everywhere. The result will be that no large order can be given for materials.  Consequently the prices paid will be very much higher than if there was a huge scheme, for which large orders could be given for all kinds of material, which could be had at a lower price than will be the case when buying small consignments.  The Government has not faced this matter as I think it should be faced.  After all, if there was a danger of a shortage of water, or of some other commodity that would have a vital effect on the well-being of the people, the Government would insist that someone should start and provide water mains, and do the other work necessary, or they would do it themselves.  Housing is one of the greatest social requirements, one of the greatest social evils from which we suffer.  For that reason I agree with Senator Farren that a national housing authority would be the better way of meeting the case.  It is quite obvious that it is only by State action that the evil can be remedied even in a small way, seeing that private enterprise, for which Senator Sir John Keane pleads, has so hopelessly and lamentably failed to deal with the question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. JOHN BAGWELL Mr. JOHN BAGWELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHN BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the last Senator has said about this question, that it, perhaps to a greater extent than any other social problem, has occupied attention in recent years.  I have not sufficient knowledge of the subject to speak on <Col N="1079" /> it with authority.  Arising out of what we have heard in the debate, it would be a pity if the Seanad were to assume that private enterprise has failed in the sense that has been alleged by Senator O'Farrell.  In one sense it has failed, as houses have not been built. I suggest that if it had not been for a great deal of the legislation, for which I think the last Premier but two, in Great Britain, was largely responsible, a great many more houses would have been built.  It is because the prospect of getting a reasonable profit on house building has been very much impaired by legislation that the building enterprise has practically dried up.  An immense number of houses were built in what I might call the old days, not by professional builders, but by people who had saved money and wanted to invest it.  They found that the building of houses was not a bad form of investment.  In those days we did not hear anything like so much as we do now about the housing question. The building of houses is such an enormous thing that I do not believe the State can undertake it, except with most disastrous results.  It is a problem which, unless the community as a whole helps, will never be put right.  I believe Section 9 contains some dangerous elements that might very easily tend to make the situation far worse than it is.  It is bad enough now, and probably, and naturally so, productive of more discontent, hardship and misery than almost any other question with which we have to deal.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In sub-paragraph vii., line 42, to delete the word &lsquo;transport.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is dependent on another amendment later on.  I propose to deal with the subject matter of the two amendments, which are dependent on each other, and to state the object for which I move it.  The effect of this amendment would be to remove from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce the question of transport, and later on, I am moving an amendment providing for the establishment of a Ministry of Transport and Communications, which would deal with all transport as well as posts and telegraphs.  The present Ministry of Industry and Commerce is a combination of the old Board of Trade, and the old Ministry of Labour, and its duties are very wide and exceedingly comprehensive. The Ministry is, I believe, overworked and over-burdened at present, and it is unable to give to the very vital questions of transport and the various problems that arise out of it, that expert attention and consideration that these questions deserve.  If you speak to any of the principal officials of the Ministry they will tell you that it is quite impracticable to carry on as matters are at present.  Transport is an exceedingly important problem.  We are told by farmers, traders and manufacturers that one of the greatest drawbacks to the development of trade and industry is the expensive and inefficient transport services that are at their disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem merits consideration of a specialised nature.  I think everybody will agree that there requires to be a co-ordination of the various transport services, such as road, motor, canal, rail, and the various other methods of transport that may be developed in the future.  It is obvious that the means of transport that are available are running in direct competition with each other, and the result will probably be failure, and if you get a cheap service it will be inefficient. One or other of them must go to the wall.  If there were a proper Ministry of Transport with officials trained specially to deal with these problems, <Col N="1082" /> these services should be made to feed each other.  The road motors may be a feeder to the railways with a view to opening up regions not served by the railways at present.  It might arrange to distribute traffic between the railways and canals and to divert the heavier traffic to the canals, such as coal, iron and timber, and leave more locomotive stock available for perishable traffic that requires speedy and efficient service.  This problem will become much more important as time goes on if any sort of trade development is to occur.  A Ministry could very helpfully assist by advice and by mediation between the various forms of transport and check any abuses that now exist.  The reorganisation of the railway services within the Free State, which we understand will soon be proposed by the Government, will not be of much effect unless there is an overriding Government authority to hold the balance between the various forms of transport and endeavour so far as practicable in a national way to give the cheapest and at the same time the most efficient transport possible.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the Post Office. If there should be a Ministry for the Post Office, surely such a great question as forms of transport has far greater claim for a separate Ministry of its own.  We believe that the question of transport and communications should be dealt with by one Ministry or one Department, or, at all events, that the Post Office should be a Department within the Ministry.  There might be a good deal of co-ordination between the Post Office and the Transport services.  It would be practical to have arrangements in sparsely populated districts, where both transport and the Post Office are worked at much expense, whereby the two duties would be performed by the same set of officials and give greater efficiency and result in economy.  While transport is divided into two or three different Ministries, and while the Post Office is under another Ministry, it is unlikely that these questions will receive consideration from a broad national aspect and from the aspect of co-ordinating these various services, as they would receive if they were <Col N="1083" /> under the charge of one Minister.  It is with that object that I move this amendment.  Although I presume that the Government will not accept it, I urge them to give it very serious consideration, because if there is one question more than another in which this country differs from England and many Continental countries, it is in regard to transport and communications. You will find that difference the moment you set foot on the shores of Ireland.  The Earl of Mayo has brought it up in detail on more than one occasion, and pointed out the drawbacks there are.  These drawbacks are not the fault of one particular set of people, but are the result of circumstances over which no one in particular has any control.  We have it in our own hands to deal with in a broad national aspect, and it can only be dealt with in that way when the various services are taken into consideration with a view to seeing how they can be improved and how each department can give the best within it and serve the community in the most efficient way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in a good deal of sympathy with the remarks of Senator O'Farrell.  Possibly he has inside information when he assumes that the Government will not accept his amendment.  I suggest that the question raised should be carefully considered.  This Bill is supplementary to the executive sections of the Constitution, and lays down with considerable detail the functions to be undertaken by the Ministries.  One thing is very noticeable, especially when one considers the position in regard to the Labour Ministry in England, where there are an enormous number of posts to be filled, whereas here we have a maximum of twelve Ministers, who have to undertake the duties of many varied departments, duties which we have seen in the Schedule to the Bill, and which in a more populous country such as England are performed by a larger number of Ministries.  One thing appeals to me especially in regard to the suggestion of Senator O'Farrell, and it is this.  I cannot see why, if there are <Col N="1084" /> to be as many as twelve Ministries, the Post Office in a country of three millions should be allotted a Minister to itself.  I think it would be better if one Minister dealt with transport generally, coupled with the Post Office.</P>
      <P>I think the Post Office could be run more efficiently as a semi-business organisation. I say semi-business because, belonging to the Government, it would be difficult to interpret it in the sense that it would be usually interpreted as a business organisation.  It should be run under its own secretary, who would be virtually a managing director.  It would be under the control, but not under the interference, of a Ministry.  I think at the same time it could be run in connection with another Ministry preferably with the Ministry of Transport.  We had evidence at the Postal Commission of the enormous cost to deliver letters to any part of Ireland.  Sometimes it was only one letter which had to be delivered by the one delivery, and the cost was prohibitive.  That has to be faced by the Post Office.  There is a good deal to be said for the creation of a Transport Ministry, which would include the Post Office.  In this matter we are not dealing with the personnel or the details of the existing Ministry; we are dealing with a matter for the future.  I do not wish anything I am saying to be taken as having any reference to one Minister or Ministry.  I suggest it would be possible to divide the various Departments better than giving to one Ministry the entire administration of the Post Office, while the other Ministers have now some twenty Departments under them.  To that extent I sympathise with the amendment.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, at the Second Reading of this Bill, I think there was no one here from the Government who might, by explanation, have relieved the mind of Senator Douglas on some of the points which he pressed.  This Bill does not fix one Department to one individual. This Bill is an organising one for dividing Departments of State.  One, two, or three of these Departments may be assigned to a particular person.  Consequently, a person who happens to be nominated for Postmaster-General may <Col N="1085" /> have assigned to him another of those Departments under one of the other divisions.  The feature of this Bill is its elasticity.  It is possible to re-group Departments as regards individuals who are heads of them.  One man may be head of several of those Departments or under a later section in the Bill, it would be possible to subdivide a Department and take intact a section and put it under another Department or another Minister.  There is where Senator O'Farrell's amendment would be met in practice.  If transport were a Department that ought to be assigned to another Minister than the man who happens to have the rest of Industry and Commerce under the Bill, it can be done.  It is an elastic Bill, which will enable arrangements to be effected according to the exigencies of a particular time.  Hearing Senator O'Farrell's amendment proposed, I listened with great interest to his speech, because a similar amendment was proposed in the Dáil as the basis on which the Railway Nationalisation Bill should run.  That Bill had a short career in the Dáil.  I do not know whether Senator O'Farrell's Bill will be introduced in this Chamber.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel myself bound to oppose very strongly the amendment suggested.  I do not propose to make a long speech on the subject.  I think I can make clear the reasons that in principle such an arrangement would be in the highest degree objectionable and undesirable.  The purpose of the amendment is to set up a Ministry which either would or would not include the Post Office as well. To begin with, the Post Office is a Government Department of quite a different kind from the other.  The Transport Department would be a controlling Department rather than an operating Department.  The Post Office <Col N="1086" /> actually handles its own business, and is responsible for the money made and lost.  The other is a controlling Department, and has got to do with business run with other people's money, not Government money.  The two things seem to me not capable of being assimilated in one Ministry. With regard to there being a Ministry of Transport, I am strongly opposed to it, not without having had some experience of it.  The country had a good deal of experience of the Ministry of Transport in late years.  I believe the reason why transport is so expensive at the present time is more owing to the fact that it was under the control of the Ministry of Transport for a number of years, than to all other causes combined.  I suggest that anybody who has had an interest in cheaper transport, and goodness knows it is dear enough, may be strongly opposed to setting up a system which made it so dear.</P>
      <P>Another point I would wish to emphasise is that there must be control of certain forms of transport.  There always has been in every country.  I would remind the House that we have not yet got nationalised transport in this country.  That is quite a simple question, but this amendment touches on it.  It is a matter on which there is a great difference of opinion.  We have to consider this amendment on the lines of what we have got.  What we have got is private enterprise being controlled to a greater or lesser extent by a Government.  Nationalisation of transport may be good or bad. Personally, I think it is one of the worst things the country could have. I will not enter into that argument now.  This is something much worse, because this would be humbug of the most extreme kind.  This would be co-ordination without any responsibility. The Postmaster has got responsibility. He is controlling a Government Department which does its own business.  The Minister for Transport would have no such responsibility.  He would be controlling a business run with other people's money.  For that reason I do not think those two things should be combined at this present stage.</P>

      <P>I have sympathy with Senator O'Farrell's amendment, but I disagree with him in this, that the Postmaster-General should have anything to do with transport, for the Postmaster-General has got his own Department, and is responsible to the Government for every little letter that is delivered in the far corner of Connemara. I hope Senator O'Farrell will remember that, and that is a great responsibility. Letters are sacred things. I should like to say this, that I was very much interested in what the Attorney-General told us.  He told us the Bill was an elastic Bill.  I think it is very elastic.  It means this, that any of these Ministers&mdash;I quote his words&mdash;&ldquo;may have assigned to him a particular Department.&rdquo;  In fact the Government, under this Bill, can do exactly what they like with any Department whatsoever.  I do not know whether that satisfies Senator O'Farrell.  I do not think it does, because I did not see him nod assent or hear him say, &ldquo;hear, hear,&rdquo; when that very broad statement was made.  Senator Douglas said something about the Constitution.  I notice that he very often brings in the Constitution. I consider him to be one of the buttresses of the Constitution.  I do not intend to vote for this amendment, because I consider the Postmaster-General must be the Postmaster-General, and have nothing else to do but that; and as for nationalisation.  I do not think Senator O'Farrell has anything in his mind, or anything very subtle in this amendment, with regard to nationalisation.  He was very kind to mention my name with regard to transport, but that only refers to one particular spot.</P>

      <P>As to the shuffling about of these various duties which are given in the Schedule to various Ministers, the Attorney-General said that they could be shifted, and no doubt they can, but I take it that after this Bill has passed they can only be shifted by the Executive or by the President. I do not know.  I cannot see how either of the Houses, no matter how much they wish, could get an opportunity of altering the Schedules once we passed the Bill.  I believe that there is a provision somewhere in the Bill <Col N="1088" /> whereby they can be altered, but I imagine that that is only some provision which must be acted on, as far as the Houses of the Oireachtas are concerned, while the Bill is going through the Houses.  But how can they be reshuffled according to the wish of either of the two Houses after the Bill has become an Act?</P>

      <P>The scheme is this, that within a Ministry there will be, in some Ministries, at any rate, sections, sections of administration more or less of an intact unit, and under Section 12 it would be possible by an order which must be laid on the Tables of both Houses, to transfer a section from one Ministry to another. That, however, could not be done, for instance, in the case of an external Minister.  The ordinary course will be that when the President is elected by the Dáil he will select what Departments he proposes to have administered within the Executive Council by Executive Ministers.  These would naturally be the Departments as regards which he and his Government have a policy. The other Departments will then remain outside, and the Dáil can, by its vote on the principle of Proportional Representation, elect Ministers to hold these, and the Dáil itself may assign two Departments to one man, or one, and so on.  There has been talk of cutting down the number of Ministers, but I do not know whether that is a practical proposition in the immediate future, or in the next administration, whenever that may be.  The ordinary course would be that the President would select the Departments that he would bring into his Cabinet.  He might make more Departments than he has individual Ministers, and then he would assign two or more to a particular man, leaving the others to be dealt with in the way I have mentioned by the external Ministers.  In the constitution of the present Ministry, Local Government, Post Office and Agriculture were left outside the Executive and did not share in its collective responsibility. They are individually responsible to the Dáil.  I do not know if I have covered the points raised.</P>

      <P>I am troubled by one statement.  The only matter in this Bill that interests me very much is the National Gallery and the Museum. I understand from the Attorney-General that if the Government has no policy for any particular Department it will not keep it within the purview of the Executive Council, or within the purview of Ministers within the Executive Council.  If, therefore, the Government has no policy with regard to the National Gallery or the Museum, will it hand them over to the Minister for Fisheries to be administered by him, or by the Minister for Agriculture, as they were before, or by the Postmaster-General?</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Attorney-General to make clear exactly how a Committee of the Dáil under this Bill would be enabled so to reduce the number of Ministers, or how they would be able to assign two or three as external Ministers.  It seems to me that Section 12 is perfectly clear as to the power of the Executive Council by resolution, which will have to be submitted to or passed by both Houses, or may be annulled by both Houses, to make a certain amount of redistribution as far as the Executive Council is concerned.  But I do not see in Section 12 how the Committee can do it, except by going to the Executive Council and asking them to bring in such a resolution, and it does not seem clear whether a Committee could make the necessary adjustments.  Personally, I feel to a large extent that in the case of extern Ministers elasticity may be required. Even at the risk of upsetting the Earl of Mayo again, I shall refer to the Constitution.  The circumstances have not been exactly as we anticipated, but it is quite conceivable that you may have in the near or far away future, a number of different groups, and I think it is very important that the coalition of these groups for the purpose of stability should be made as easy as possible by making it perfectly clear that it is possible for the Committee to assign two or three <Col N="1090" /> different Departments to one Minister who is not a member of the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Attorney-General to explain this matter or tell me, at all events, if I interpret the Bill correctly.  Section 3 says: &ldquo;The President of the Executive Council shall, as soon as may be after his appointment as such President,&rdquo; appoint his Executive Ministers.  Section 11, as I understand it, enables one Minister to act for another.  &ldquo;It shall be lawful for any Minister, pursuant to any arrangement or agreement previously authorised by an Order of the Executive Council, to exercise or perform any of the duties or public services of any other Minister as agent for such other Minister, and without relieving such other Minister of his responsibility.&rdquo; Then we come to Section 12. The Executive Council from time to time prescribes the duties that these various Ministers are to undertake. Finally, there is Section 13 which, I think, is the one that Senator O'Farrell can always fall back upon if he wants to make the Postmaster-General control the railways.  It makes it compulsory that all these regulations of the Executive Council be laid before both Houses, and if they are objected to by either House within 21 days, some new appointment has to be made.  I think that is about the position, as I read it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Section 11, the object of that provision may be illustrated by this practical case which actually exists.  The Post Office Savings Bank is really, of course, a financial obligation of the State.  It is really a matter for which the Minister for Finance must ultimately be responsible, but in order to carry it on as a working proposition he appoints the Postmaster-General as his agent for the working out of the various practical details, while he himself retains responsibility for investments, fundings, and all the financial matters of a larger scale that go on behind it.  That is really the type of matter which is intended to be met by Section 11.  Section 12 is a different matter entirely.  It allows an order to be made transferring a unit of the public service from <Col N="1091" /> one Minister to another.  The President selects the Departments for which the Executive Council will take collective responsibility.  He nominates certain persons to them to constitute the Executive Council, and then the others remain outside.  I do not quite follow Senator Douglas's difficulty, because it does seem to me that the Committee of the Dáil may decide to assign two or more of the Departments which are left outside the Cabinet to one person. There is nothing that I know of in the Constitution to prevent that.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Attorney-General that I had no intention of introducing a new Transport and Communications Bill, though I could inform him that twenty or thirty members of his Party would have voted for that Bill if the Government Whips had been taken off.  Senator Bagwell evidently has not read the Bill, or he has not read the amendment.  He appears horribly frightened at the idea of a Ministry of Transport and Communications, but if he reads the Bill, he will find that the Ministry of Transport excludes the Roads Department, which is already within the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  I am not asking to give the Ministry of Transport and Communications any power that the present Ministry of Industry and Commerce have not got.  I stated reasons why I thought it was desirable that they should be in one Ministry.  Senator Bagwell evidently thought that I was suggesting that horrible bogey, the Nationalisation of Railways, and like every General Manager, he has Nationalisation on the brain.  I was not arguing at all from that point of view. I was trying to assist the interests that Senator Bagwell has so much at heart. We meet railway companies in negotiation very often in regard to wages and conditions of service.  One of the first things they put up is this: &ldquo;We would give you what you want, and would not ask you to accept any reduction in wages, but don't you see we are threatened with this terrible road motor competition?&rdquo; If there is such a menace, of which I have my doubts, I would suggest that the Ministry of Transport might use its influence without exercising direct control towards developing this road transport in areas not served by railways, and using this form of transport as a feeder of the railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise in regard to the inland waterways.  This is not a party or class amendment, but is moved in the interest of the community. I take it that if Senator <Col N="1094" /> Bagwell has that assurance he will not jump suddenly to conclusions or seek to smash an amendment which is designed to serve all sections of the community and to help towards development of trade and commerce.  That is really all that is behind it.  There need be no more interference than there is at present.  There is a Department of Transport within the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  Transport is split up in that way.  The Roads Department, that was previously under the old Ministry of Transport, is now under the Local Government Department. Canals are under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  It is desirable that they all should be under the one head, and although he may not be able to exercise local control, he would always have in view the idea of co-ordinating these services as far as practicable. He might meet the private enterprise plea, and not interfere with private enterprise.  At all events, he might reason with the conflicting interests within, such as motor traffic as against railways.  Of course, the Attorney-General suggests that these duties may be re-allocated.  But they will be re-allocated by somebody outside this Seanad.  All that the Seanad will have to say in the matter in future will be to seek to annul any re-allocation that takes place.  It cannot of itself allocate. There is nothing revolutionary in the amendment.  I will leave it to the Seanad to reject or pass it, but I want to give them an opportunity of expressing their opinion on it.</P>

The Departments of State are divided under Section 1, and at the end of each Department it is stated that &ldquo;the heads shall be known as.&rdquo;  Then in the Schedule are stated the Departments or divisions which shall be assigned to a particular Minister. It seems to me that, worded as these two Sections are, there will be difficulty in the Committee of the Dáil, other than by resolution under Section 12, in making the assignments of different Ministries, other than is provided in this Bill, as suggested by the Attorney-General. I would ask the Attorney-General to consider whether the assigning under the Schedule to actual persons, rather than the Department, and in the case of this particular Section stating that the head of this Department must be entitled&mdash;giving the name of the Minister&mdash;will not create in the present form a certain difficulty in making the re-assignments which he suggests.</P>

      <P>It should have been explained on the Second Reading, if somebody had been here for the Government, that Section 1 sets out, as far as possible, an exhaustive description of each of these Departments of administration.  The Schedule is a different thing.  It is not an exhaustive Schedule of the functions of the particular Ministers of State.  The Schedule sets out certain existing Departments, statutory bodies and statutory functionaries, and provides that their functions are to be exercised by the person who is head of the Department described in Section 1.  I want to have it clearly understood that Section 1 is the descriptive Section.  The Schedule arises by reason of the existence of number of these.  Take, for instance, <Col N="1096" /> Transport, or any of these other Departments there.  Some of them have statutory functions, and it was necessary to complete the description in Section 1 by expressly conferring the powers which exist in these various functionaries and bodies set out in the Schedule.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment, which appears in two parts, is to find out where we stand in relation to this matter, which I have often ventilated, of the power of the Minister for Finance.  In discussing this Bill we are debating something that is unreal, <Col N="1098" /> because the Minister can say that the Government can at any time do all that is wanted by Order in Council. I think that is the fact under Section 11.  I fancy that is so, as practically this Bill is giving what in reality exists now in England.  The Government will have power by Order to do what they like with regard to the administration of Government.  I really fail to see the object of this Bill being so long, because the only statutory power that is affected is that of the statutory bodies.  If the Government had taken power to abolish these statutory bodies, I think the Executive might have done the rest.  But we have to argue from what we find and know.  It is the undoubted fact that the Minister for Finance interferes extraordinarily in matters of detail, and, in the opinion of many, that interference is not in the interests of the public service.  If we are laying down duties by Statute, even if they can be amended by Order in Council, we ought to try and make them clear by Statute and avoid that evil as far as we can.</P>
    <P>Under Sub-Section 2 Departmental Ministers are allowed to appoint their own subordinates subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  That means to say that if a Minister wants to appoint a person who is a qualified Civil Servant, in grade and in every other respect qualified, and even if there is no finance involved, the Minister has still to go and ask the Minister for Finance if he can appoint so and so. I think this form of having to refer everything to the Finance Department is destructive of efficiency.  I remember asking a friend what he was doing at the War Office, and he said: &ldquo;The last job I had was to ask the Finance Minister whether we could have an extra cook in the Signalling School at Aldershot for a fortnight.&rdquo;  That is not a bad example of the height that centralisation has reached in the public service. Every detail is referred to the Minister for Finance.  If you read Sub-section 3 it provides that &ldquo;The terms and conditions of appointment of all officers and servants appointed by any Minister, shall be prescribed by the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  Surely, when they are prescribed that is sufficient.  If an officer <Col N="1099" /> is qualified there should be no question of sanction by the Minister for Finance. That point raises a bigger question than I brought before the Seanad before, dealing with the reform of accounting. Since then a report on this matter has been made public.  I refer to the report which was made by a Committee of very eminent people who went into and investigated the new system of decentralised accounting.  I take one or two extracts at random endorsing the new method.  &ldquo;We go further and say that it has been proved that by a proper system of accounting economies to an extent quite unrealised can be effected.&rdquo;  Further on, it says: &ldquo;It is essential for the proper development of administrative responsibility that decentralisation should be carried eventually to its ultimate point, namely, the regimental unit.&rdquo;  Of course, that refers to the Army.  It is the same all through.  You must decentralise.  This proposal in the Bill giving the Minister for Finance power over every detail of appointment is the very antithesis of decentralisation, and the acme of centralisation. I ask the Seanad if this Bill is of any value, which I doubt, on account of its amending provisions by Order, if we are going to accept the wording of the Bill as laying down and prescribing these powers even temporarily, that this amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I need hardly say that the Government could not accept the amendment because the control of the Minister for Finance must be preserved.  For instance, if Senator Sir John Keane carries his proposition to its logical conclusion, an extern Minister, I will not say the Postmaster-General, but say the Local Government Minister, might employ innumerable persons, and completely bankrupt the Minister for Finance.  If there is not control in the Ministry of Finance through the establishment branch, over what is necessary in the way of staffing the various Departments, of course finance could not be carried on.  This Section, I may say, is founded upon a corresponding Section of the new Ministries Act of 1919.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the view that it would be in the power of any Minister, merely because he is not tied down to every detail, to bankrupt the whole finance.  Under sub-Section 4 I have got an amendment which confines any expenditure to that passed by the Estimates.  Surely it cannot by any stretch of imagination be suggested that I am going to give any Minister power to depart from Estimates passed by the Oireachtas.  I would not accept the Act of 1919.  I fancy that is an Imperial Act.  It is the very evils going on there I am hoping will not be perpetrated here.</P>

      <P>I have expressed a certain amount of sympathy with Senator Sir John Keane with regard to decentralisation, but with regard to the detailed control of the Ministry of Finance I do not think I could support the amendment.  It seems to me that the amendment would actually make things worse.  At the present time, under the Bill the Minister has not got complete control of all the appointments, but is subject to the Ministry of Finance, which is for practical purposes the office dealing with staffs generally. Unless you substitute some other body such as a different kind of Civil Service Commission to control the number of appointments and the advancement in positions generally, it seems to me that it would be a mistake simply to put the matter in the hands of the Minister. I do not think it would be wise or fair to place in the hands of the Ministers alone all the appointments necessary to all the Departments mentioned here.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand <Col N="1101" /> what financial check Senator Sir John Keane's amendment is going to put on. In the British Parliament I imagine the Treasury would come in, and not the Ministry of Finance.  I remember we were told here that the Minister for Finance is always to be mentioned, where in Great Britain I imagine, the Treasury would come in.  Apparently, Senator Sir John Keane was going to rule out the Minister for Finance, where he is going to act as the Treasury. I do not know what he is going to put in instead.  I do not think we could expect that individual Ministers could settle the pay of all the men who work under them without the public funds being protected by someone.

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 2, Sub-section (4), to delete the sub-section and to substitute the following new sub-section therefor: &ldquo;The expenses of each of <Col N="1102" /> the Departments of State established under this Act shall be as set out in the Estimates approved by Dáil Eireann and shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again I return to the old question. Under this clause again you are putting the Minister for Finance as a sort of drawn sword over every petty act of every Department of State.  I submit when the Estimates are being passed in detail, as long as the Department works within them, the Minister is not bound to apply to the Finance Minister for every petty post he wishes to fill&mdash;even temporary ones. I know it happens in England, and I fancy the tradition is carried on here. Even if you want a temporary cook for a fortnight, you must ask the Minister for Finance.  If you saw the number of papers which go from the Finance Department to the Executive you would be appalled.  My object in putting down this amendment is to enable something in the nature of rationing to be carried out.  Once the totals are agreed upon the Minister should be allowed a very wide discretion, and should not be interfered with at every twist and turn.  This is not imaginary.  Anybody who works in a Government Department knows that there is perpetual friction over financial control.  You cannot have a business carried on in that way.  For that reason I say that the Government should be satisfied, once the Estimates are passed in detail, that that is sufficient authority to the responsible spending Minister to carry on.  Of course he is subject to audit, and the control of any supplementary Estimates. All these details should not be referred to the Minister for Finance, but the Minister should be free to carry on his legitimate job.</P>

      <P>This is a wonderfully drafted Bill, and it is not easy to deal with a particular clause, as we have an instance in the case of Senator O'Farrell's amendment. The point I am anxious to raise is with reference to the representation of the Government in the Seanad.  This particular clause enables Secretaries to be appointed who shall be members of the Oireachtas.  These are Secretaries to Ministers.  I should have preferred to deal first with the Ministers, but I cannot do so until I come to Clauses 11 and 12.  If I may be allowed a little latitude, I could raise this question now, so that the Government could consider the whole matter. For some time past we have been working to the best of our ability and discussing Bills especially in Committees, and we have had considerable difficulty in relation to our discussion except in cases where a Minister came specifically for the purpose and attended the meetings here.  The Seanad is in doubt and in difficulty very often as to what the intentions of the Government are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could have somebody in this Seanad, an extern Minister, for instance, because extern Ministers and their Secretaries may be members of the Oireachtas.  An extern Minister in the Seanad could represent the Government <Col N="1105" /> and give us their views, and tell us what their policy is.  In Clause 11 there seems to be a special provision made for the purpose, because by that clause any Minister may delegate his authority to another Minister.  I think possibly in connection with this Bill that the Government might consider this question.  It would be of great use to the Seanad if it had a representative of the Government here.  It would be quite useful to the Government itself, because very often a representative of the Government here might prevent the Seanad from having a misunderstanding with the Government.  We have had such misunderstandings, and if we had a representative of the Government here I think these misunderstandings would have been avoided.  We have precedents in other Senates; for instance, in the French Senate and in the Italian Senate you have Cabinet Ministers. There is nothing in this Bill to prevent such a thing being done.  I think the matter might be considered. With regard to merely asking questions, the objection has been raised that a representative of the Government could not answer for anybody else, but if a Minister or representative of the Government is not in a position to answer everything, all he can do is to ask for notice.  Perhaps the Seanad might like to discuss the matter a little further.</P>

      <P>I raised this question before, as to somebody being brought here to answer questions regarding matters that affect our domestic arrangements, so to speak, and all sorts of arrangements for which answers are wanted regarding internal arrangements in the Free State.  Under Section 7, as Senator Esmonde pointed out, the Executive Council may from time to time, on the nomination of the Council, appoint so many persons who are to be members of the Oireachtas. That means both Houses.  Practically speaking, there is no reason whatsoever&mdash;I am now speaking of the matter of answering questions&mdash;why one of those persons should not attend here when questions are put down and bring a written answer from the Minister and the Department to which that question is addressed.  Supposing there is a supplementary question, which <Col N="1106" /> often arises, there is no reason whatsoever, as Senator Esmonde has pointed out, that he might ask the member here to give notice, and that it should appear on the paper again.  There is no practical reason why that should not be carried out.  It will not cause any more trouble or cost any more money.</P>
      <P>With regard to the attendance of Ministers here at first there was a difficulty. Matters in this country were then in a very unpleasant state, but this session, as I said before, Ministers have attended fairly regularly.  Of course, they have to be called away, but they have attended, and, as I said before, they knew their Bills and met points from their point of view very clearly and distinctly.  I have heard many Ministers deal with Bills, and I think our Ministers&mdash;I may say this for them&mdash;knew their Bills when they entered this Chamber.  Members, especially those who live in the country, may wish to put questions&mdash;I do not mean frivolous questions about whether so-and-so has been unjustly treated for poaching by a District Justice.  After all, what will happen is, that no notice will be taken of them, and very properly so.  When we come to deal with important things, such as agriculture, which affect our lives seriously, and which are important to the country, questions should be capable of being put to the representative of the Department. I do not care who he is as long as he brings a written answer.  I hope the Attorney-General will convey that message to our Ministers.  He sees many of them every day of his life, and I hope he will see his way to make it perfectly clear that I think it is the wish of this assembly that our questions should be answered in a proper and statesmanlike manner.</P>

To delete in lines 29-30 the words &ldquo;(under the style of &lsquo;Commander-in-Chief&rsquo;).&rdquo;  I would suggest that this is an important amendment, although perhaps it is rather hazardous to stand up and attempt to criticise questions that concern the Army, but one has one's duties to perform.  In this case it <Col N="1109" /> appears from the plain reading of the Section, at least by implication, that the Minister for Defence must be a soldier, or, conversely, that a soldier must be Minister for Defence.  I do not think that is at all desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Of course I do not question that the Minister for Defence, if he is to be a soldier, should not be a soldier with subordinate responsibility, but if the supremacy of the civil power is to be maintained &mdash;and that is a constitutional matter that is of the highest importance&mdash;it will not be adequately preserved by appointing a soldier to the post of Minister for Defence.  The Minister for Defence, to my mind, should be an independent person with general administrative experience and knowledge of Government work, with a detachment by means of which he can compose military difficulties that present themselves, especially personal difficulties, which he is bound to have brought to his notice.  Moreover, I suggest that a soldier is not a good parliamentarian, and although there may be exceptions in times of crisis, it is very undesirable as a practice to appoint a soldier to the post of Minister for Defence, which is mainly a political administrative post.  I think the Attorney-General may suggest that I am begging the whole question, and that the object of this wording is to ensure that the Minister for Defence shall not be a soldier.  I confess that it is somewhat subtle.  I do not appreciate it for the moment.  It is further suggested that the danger of which I am apprehensive cannot occur, because no soldier can be a member of the Oireachtas. I do not feel satisfied even on that point, because the Minister for Defence may be an External Minister.  There is no provision in the Constitution that he must be a member of the Executive Council.  An External Minister need not be a member of the Dáil, and, moreover, although technically the officer appointed may not at the moment of his appointment be a full pay officer, he may have retired on half pay&mdash;in all practice, <Col N="1110" /> by tradition, by atmosphere and by outlook he will be a soldier, and in that capacity most undesirable for the position of Minister for Defence. Of course, there is a humorous aspect of it, too, to which I may refer.  A certain soldier&mdash;I need not mention his name&mdash;whom we all know, was chatting with a certain Prime Minister, who looked exceedingly unlike a soldier, on this very question we are discussing, and he said to him, &ldquo;You know, if you dress me&rdquo;&mdash;he was then in his full regimentals&mdash;&ldquo;in civilian clothes and a tall hat, I would look eminently suitable as the Minister, but I do not think even you would say if I dress you in a uniform that you would look very suitable as a soldier.&rdquo; That shows one aspect of the case.  If this Minister for Defence is not to be a soldier&mdash;and presumably he will have no military uniform&mdash;I would suggest that it is not desirable to call him a Commander-in-Chief.  It would reassure us if the Government is determined to preserve these words, if we can have a definite statement now from the Minister that under no circumstances is it contemplated to appoint a soldier, either serving or recently retired, to this position.</P>

      <P>The amendment is useful at any rate in giving one an opportunity of explaining that the whole scheme is a scheme for creating civil control, and as regards the Minister himself, that is secured in this way that no one can be elected to the Dáil&mdash; and no one is likely to be made a Minister who is not a member of the Dáil&mdash;who is a member of the Army. The present Minister for Defence, before he could stand at the last General Election, had to retire from the Army. That is one aspect of the matter. Another aspect of it is this, that under the Defence Forces Act passed last year, it is provided that the Command-in-Chief of and all executive and administrative powers in relation to the forces, including power to delegate authority, and so on, shall be vested in the Executive Council and exercised through and in the name of the Minister who shall not, however, allocate to himself any executive military command, and who may not be a member <Col N="1111" /> of the Forces on full pay.  So that this particular expression really completed this scheme that the Government have had in mind all through of establishing complete civil control.  The Command-in-Chief is vested in the Executive Council, and is exercised through and in the name of the Minister for Defence, who himself must be a civilian.</P>

      <P>It strikes me that is the position.  With all respect to the Attorney-General, his arguments were arguments in favour of the deletion of the words.  If it is not intended that this position shall be held by a soldier, why are the words put in?  They imply that the person who shall be Minister for Defence shall be a soldier, and shall be known as the Commander-in-Chief, and I must certainly say as a civilian and an anti-militarist, that I am opposed to the Minister for Defence having the title of Commander-in-Chief, because it appears to me to give the title of Commander-in-Chief to the Minister for Home Defence, who would be a soldier pure and simple.</P>

      <P>Humorous as that appears, there is this element of truth in it that he is the person in whose name the Command-in-Chief is exercised, that Command-in-Chief being vested in the Executive Council.  It is a mere titular appellation which prevents complications, and it is impossible for the person who holds that titular position as Chairman of the Army Defence Council to be a soldier. He must be a civilian.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Attorney-General why is he making a civilian Commander-in-Chief, for that is what is in the Bill?  Those brackets, it seems to me, are put in in a sort of furtive way, and really I cannot see the object of it.  A great many members of the Seanad have been soldiers.  I never heard of, and I do not suppose any country in the world ever heard of, making a civilian a Commander-in-Chief and putting it into a Bill.</P>

      <P>We are told the Command-in-Chief is vested in the Executive Council, that is to say, it is cooperative. It was said in the 17th Century that the devil is the body politic. The Executive Council is not called the Commander-in-Chief, but an individual <Col N="1113" /> is called the Commander-in-Chief.

      <P>I think we would be well advised not to pass this amendment, and leave well alone.  I am just as much anti-militarist as Senator Farren, but I think, knowing as many of us do, the history of the last few years, or partially knowing it; knowing the gradual development of the Army which has to be under civil control, I think it is well to assert definitely that the Commander-in-Chief shall be a member of the Executive, with complete control over the Army, and in view of that I think it would be unwise to insert an amendment of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sensibly biassed towards the civil power, but I am looking at it as a matter of business, and I think it is equally objectionable from the point of view of the Army.  If you take a politician and call him a Commander-in-Chief, you naturally give him a handle to interfere in the military sphere, and that is just as objectionable as the soldier interfering in the political sphere.  These words, as far as words ever mean anything are, I think, absurd.  All armies complain of the interference of the civilian heads, and if you take a civilian head and put him as Chairman or President of the Army Council, and then call him Commander-in-Chief, I cannot see how you can prevent him exercising the powers of Commander-in-Chief, or at least saying: &ldquo;I am Commander-in-Chief, and this is what I want done in the military sphere.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think you will have to take these words in their plain meaning.  I am very perplexed&mdash;perhaps it is only temporary, because this Bill is not law yet&mdash; but at present we have both a Minister for Defence and a Commander-in-Chief. My information is only what the public have, that an officer was recently appointed Commander-in-Chief or Commander of the Forces.  Senator Douglas nods assent when I say Commander of the Forces, but I really do not see any great distinction between the two terms.  I am inclined to persist <Col N="1114" /> in my amendment, because I do not feel that it impairs or weakens in any way the control of the civil authorities, and I think it makes the Section read sensibly.</P>

      <P>May I explain the point?  I raised a question before in this Seanad as regards the Ordnance Survey.  I notice in the first part of the Schedule &ldquo;The Commissioner of Valuation and Boundary Surveyor for Ireland.&rdquo;  The Ordnance Survey comes under the Minister for Finance.  In the forth part of the Schedule the Geological Survey in Ireland and the Meteorological Services, which more or less hinge upon the same thing, come under the Minister for Education. &ldquo;The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, so far as concerned with the Ordnance Survey,&rdquo; is in the fifth portion of the Schedule.  In addition to that, whether they admit it at present or not, the Government will find that a hydrographic survey will have to be added.  I have gone into the accounts as far as I can, and I find that about <Col N="1116" /> £160,000 is provided for these various services.  It is manifest that a lot of them are overlapping, and that the work could be done much more efficiently and economically if they were placed under one head.  I am only throwing out the suggestion to the Attorney-General, if he can see his way to advise the Government, so that economy and efficiency might be gained by placing all these services under one head.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the matter raised by Senator Barrington, the Minister for Agriculture does desire to have the Ordnance Survey heading of this Schedule transferred to the first part of the Schedule.  The reason why the Ordnance Survey is put in the first part of the Schedule is that this was closely associated with the work of the Commissioner of Valuation and Boundary Surveyor, and it was thought essential to bring the two together.  We will accept the amendment to take from the fifth part of the Schedule &ldquo;The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries so far as concerned with the Ordnance Survey,&rdquo; and put that immediately after Ordnance Survey in the first part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">

      <P>The reason the Public Trustee is included in that part of the Schedule is that in Ireland we have not a Public Trustee such as they have in England.  The only Public Trustee we have is a Public Trustee for the purpose of the Land Purchase Act, and he is so involved in the administration of land purchase&mdash;whether the office would continue to exist after land purchase is wound up I do not know&mdash;that for the time being, at any rate, it was considered proper that he should remain in his own Department.</P>

      <P>The next item on the Orders of the Day is the Local Government (Collection of Rates) Bill, 1923.  The Minister for Local Government was here recently, but he is now in the Dáil.  While we are waiting for him we could dispose of the only remaining item, the Report of the Joint Committee on the temporary accommodation of the Oireachtas. Item No. 5, Second Report of the Standing Committee on Standing <Col N="1118" /> Orders, we will allow to stand over. The Joint Committee appointed to consider means by which differences between the two Houses might be adjusted are about to complete their report. This report, if accepted by the Seanad, will involve substantial additions to our existing Standing Orders. Therefore, we think it better that this report should not come up piecemeal, and that we should postpone sending it in until we are ready to include all the amendments that we now think are desirable.  With regard to the Housing Bill, which was read a second time to-day, I have received a letter from the Government requesting me not to have the Committee Stage of the Bill on the Orders of the Day to-morrow. Although Senators will receive Orders of the Day in which the Bill is included for to-morrow, it will not, in fact, be taken up then, but will have to stand over to suit the convenience of the President.  While waiting for the Minister for Local Government we might dispose of No. 6 on the Orders of the day&mdash;the Report of the Joint Committee on the Temporary Accommodation of the Oireachtas.  Senators have the Report in their possession and in order that they may be in a position to discuss it, perhaps some Senator will propose its adoption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very interesting topic, and one cannot allow it to pass without some expression of opinion on the various issues that are raised.  I take it that the Report means that the Oireachtas is to be housed for some indefinite period here in the premises of the Royal Dublin Society.  At the outset, I would like to say that I recognise, very fully, the great indebtedness which the Royal Dublin Society has placed the Seanad under in allowing us to avail of their hospitality so long.  I am sure we would all like if the period of our enjoyment <Col N="1119" /> of that hospitality could be short, because we recognise the inconvenience and the difficulties we are placing them under so far as the carrying out of their splendid public services are concerned.  But these are not pleasant times, and one has to put up with a certain amount of inconvenience. The Royal Dublin Society, unfortunately, has to put up with that state of affairs like a great many other people.  All we hope is that the day is near at hand when we shall be able to restore the buildings and amenities to the Royal Dublin Society.  We are certainly grateful to them for their hospitality both as members of the Seanad, members of the public, and members of the Society.  I had hoped that the time was coming when we could have said good-bye to the Royal Dublin Society, and allowed them occupy their own premises, thanking them, as we certainly would do, for their hospitality during these very difficult years.  I would have thought that we might have come to some more permanent decision on this matter.  No member of the Committee will, I hope, imagine that I am finding fault with the report.  In the circumstances they could not report otherwise.  They were limited by their instructions and by the terms of reference, and could only consider the question of the temporary housing of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, and I have nothing more to say as far as the report of the temporary housing of the Oireachtas is concerned.  As far as the future development of this question goes that, of course, will be a matter for individuals to act as they think best.</P>

      <P>Am I to accept that ruling as definite that no discussion can now take place with regard to the future of the Royal Dublin Society? Is it assumed that the occupation by <Col N="1120" /> the Oireachtas of these premises is permanent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that does not arise at all.  We were strictly confined by the terms of reference to reporting as to the best location for the temporary accommodation of the Oireachtas.  In recommending the retention of the premises of the Royal Dublin Society we have strictly confined ourselves to that.</P>
      <P>In recommending the retention of the Royal Dublin Society's premises, we have done so entirely and exclusively on the basis of temporary occupation.  Therefore, any discussion on the contrary assumption, namely, on the assumption of a permanent occupation, would be irrelevant to this report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryGreer" hpid="Captain GREER Captain GREER">
      <NameTxt>Captain GREER</NameTxt>
      <P>That very much cramps anyone who wishes to discuss this question.  I quite understand the point you raise&mdash;the Committee were only contemplating a temporary occupation. It was very difficult for the Society not to look upon it more or less as a permanent one.  I believe that the Government look with sympathy towards the Society as other Governments have done.  They have been most kind and the Minister for Agriculture especially has been very kind in regard to the Society's shows and so forth.  It is unnecessary to say that even the continued temporary occupation of the building is a very serious matter for the Society as there is a danger that the Society may gradually disappear.  A large membership is required.  Very large funds are distributed every year and we have always tried to work the Society on a generous scale.  I hope that the Government with that sympathy which they have afforded the Society will endeavour to do what they can to lessen this temporary occupation of the building.</P>

      <P>Section 4, Sub-section (2).  To insert after this Sub-section a new Sub-section (3) as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3).  Any person aggrieved by an order made by a District Justice under this Section may by notice served within one fortnight after the making of such order appeal from such order to the County Court Judge or Recorder for the County or County Borough in which the tenement to which such order relates is situate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This was inserted on my suggestion, made in the course of the debate, to provide an appeal from the decision of the District Justice in any case in which he refused to make a change in the name of the rated occupier.  Under the Bill as it stands the District Justice was given power to do that himself, but no appeal was provided.  The Minister for Local Government undertook to consider and deal with it on Report.</P>

      <P>The expression used is &ldquo;County Court Judge.&rdquo;  Should it not be Circuit Court Judge?</P>

      <P>No.  This will come into law before the Judiciary Bill becomes law.  Therefore, the appropriate expression is &ldquo;County Court.&rdquo;  I would rather say &ldquo;within the prescribed time or manner.&rdquo;  However as this is a Government amendment it is better to accept it as it is brought up.</P>

      <P>The next amendment reads:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> Section 5, Sub-section (1).  &ldquo;To insert after the word &lsquo;prepaid&rsquo; in line 18 the word &lsquo;registered.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment was made in deference to an application of the Seanad to the Attorney-General.  The provision in the Bill requires notices to be served by the ordinary post.  It was pointed out that that was not sufficient in view of the difficulties that the postal authorities are in now, and that it should be by registered post.  This amendment and the following one are to carry out the acceptance of that suggestion.</P>

      <P>Section 5, Sub-section (2).  &ldquo;To delete the words &lsquo;put into the post&rsquo; in lines 24 and 25, and to substitute therefore the words &lsquo;handed in and registered at a post office.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This may establish a precedent, and suggest that we get on better with Government amendments when the Minister is not present.  What about your amendment now, Senator Keane?</P>

      <P>The Minister said he was in sympathy with my amendment, but he has not put it down as a Government amendment.  If we pass it now and the Government does not like it, it will have to go back to the Dáil.  If it is thrown out, I do not suppose it will create a constitutional crisis.</P>
