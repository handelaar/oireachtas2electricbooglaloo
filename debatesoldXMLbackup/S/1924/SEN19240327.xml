      <P>I should like the leave of the House to make a brief personal statement.  General Brennan, Chairman of the Clare County Council, asks me to repeat outside the protection of privilege, or to withdraw, the statement I made in the House that at the inquiry into local administration in the County Clare, evidence had been given to the effect that the rates had been used to defend a prisoner, and to pay the deposit of Parliamentary candidates. General Brennan has stated that these services were paid out of poundage fees which the Volunteers, who collected the rates, deducted in return for their services.  This statement I fully and unreservedly accept. I have read again the report in the local Press from which my information was derived, and I regret that my interpretation of the report was incorrect, and that I failed to appreciate and mark the important difference between payment out of rates and payment out of poundage fees.  I further regret that in my mistaken zeal I commented on the evidence without waiting for the report of the inquiry.</P>

    <P>(4)  Every male person who shall be found guilty on indictment of the offence of robbery under arms as defined at No. 5 in Part II. of the Schedule to this Act, or of the offence of arson as defined at No. 6 in Part II. of the said Schedule shall (unless the Court is satisfied that there are special circumstances in the case which constitute a mitigation of the offence, or is of opinion that, owing to the state of health or advanced age of such person, corporal punishment could not be inflicted on him without permanent injury to his health), in addition to the punishment prescribed in the foregoing sub-sections, be sentenced to be once privately whipped subject to the following provisions:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the deletion of Sub-section (2).  The sub-section seems to me to be in conflict with the Constitution on a most important issue, the right of an accused person to trial by jury.  Article 72 of the Constitution says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No person shall be tried on any criminal charge without a jury save in the case of charges in respect of minor offences triable by law before a court of summary jurisdiction.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the human or legal standpoint a minor offence, I take it, is one for which, on conviction, a minor punishment is liable to be inflicted.  If a serious punishment is inflicted, or liable to be inflicted, the offence obviously ceases to be a minor one and becomes at once a major or serious offence.  Under Sub-section (2) the whole or any of the offences mentioned in Part II. of the Schedule come within the category of minor offences triable by a court of summary jurisdiction. Is it seriously suggested that robbery under arms and arson are minor offences?  Robbery under arms was always an indictable offence, and I think arson also was.  If these offences are not minor offences then I respectfully submit that Sub-section (2) is <i>ultra vires</i>, having regard to Article 72 of the Constitution.  The Minister will probably state that it is only in cases in which there are extenuating circumstances that either of these charges will be dealt with before a court of summary jurisdiction.  That may be true.  There may be instances in which offences of this kind may be of a minor character.  But a District Justice is <Col N="1171" /> empowered under this sub-section to impose a penalty of 12 months' imprisonment with hard labour, with a further additional six months' imprisonment with hard labour.</P>
    <P>Surely offences meriting such savage punishment could not be termed minor offences, unless words are to lose their meaning?  By the common law every offence is triable by a jury and the right to have offences tried by summary jurisdiction is always created by express statutory enactment.  Several of the offences in the Schedule were never made triable summarily by law and therefore they do not conform to Article 72 of the Constitution.  If there is power to make all the offences in the Schedule minor offences, then I take it that it should be done in express terms. If that is the intention of the sub-section it should be so stated, and an amendment of some kind should be inserted boldly stating that the whole of the offences in this part of the Schedule are triable before a court of summary jurisdiction.  Will the Government do this?  If they do, where does the right of trial by jury go to?  Does not Article 72 become merely a jumble of words without any meaning?  To pursue this principle to its logical conclusion, in certain circumstances the offence of murder might by decree be made a minor offence triable by a court of summary jurisdiction.  There are offences in the Schedule which undoubtedly might be tried summarily. If that is the case, surely these can be dealt with under the common law and we should not be driven to violating the Constitution, or at least seriously encroaching upon it, for the mere sake of dealing with special circumstances that may be said to exist.  An honest desire to preserve order and to protect life and property should not in itself be sufficient to induce the Oireachtas to make scrap-paper of that Charter which is the sheet-anchor of our liberty. The Government will undoubtedly say that the end justifies the means in this particular case, but they would do well to beware of pursuing that doctrine too far.  It is the pursuit of that doctrine which has brought upon this country more tears and suffering than any external oppression could have <Col N="1172" /> brought upon it.  I earnestly commend to the Government very serious consideration of the position before they insist upon retaining the sub-section in the Bill.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was receiving the Second Reading here it was pointed out that the offences set out in the Schedule would be major or minor offences according to the attendant circumstances, and that it was a question of degree.  Senator O'Farrell quoted two offences in particular, robbery under arms, and arson, and asked if, by any stretch of the imagination, they could be considered minor offences.  Reading the definitions one is inclined to say that they could be minor offences.  The definition of arson is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Unlawfully setting fire or attempting to set fire to any house, factory, barn, haggard, workshop, or other building, or any agricultural property, food supplies for man or beast, or any other property of any nature or kind, movable or immovable, public or private, including standing trees and crops.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Going in on a man's land and setting fire to furze is arson within the meaning of the definition set out in Part 2 of the Schedule to this Bill.  Robbery under arms is defined as &ldquo;robbing, or attempting to rob, while armed with any offensive or apparently offensive weapon or instrument.&rdquo;  There again there can be a question of degree.  If a man with an ash plant threatened another man that he would use it on him if he did not give him money or property of some kind, in the strict interpretation of the definition that is robbery under arms.  I wonder would Senator O'Farrell say that was a major offence which should be tried by indictment before a jury.  I did consult with the Attorney-General on the arguments that were pressed here on the last occasion when, I regret to say, I was not able to be present myself, and I would be prepared to insert a new Sub-section (6) to that Section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A Court of Summary Jurisdiction shall not have jurisdiction in respect of any of the offences mentioned <Col N="1173" /> in Part 2 of the Schedule of this Act unless the court is of opinion that the facts proved against the accused constitute a minor offence fit to be tried summarily.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Senator was rather over-emphatic on the point that serious penalties ought not to be imposed after summary trial. Speaking subject to correction I think that under the Companies' Act a fine as large as £500 can be imposed on summary conviction.  Certainly with regard to certain offences against the Revenue very heavy penalties can be imposed on summary conviction.  No matter how carefully you try to word your definitions you will find that within any one of the thirteen definitions set out in Part 2 of the Schedule there can be very widely different degrees of guilt, ranging from the most serious crimes down to minor offences.  Each should be taken in its own setting and in its attendant circumstances.  The form of trial will depend upon whether in the view of the State it is a serious offence which should be tried by indictment before a jury, or a minor offence that might well be disposed of by a District Justice.  As I say, I am prepared to meet the views that have been urged here to the extent of adding the Sub-section I have read.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say in view of the question raised by Senator O'Farrell on the Second Reading of the Bill, and which seemed to me a most pertinent and important issue, that it occurred to me, in view of the fact that this Schedule contains two such serious offences&mdash;I mean offences that might be serious having regard to their circumstances&mdash;as robbery under arms, and arson, that it would be extremely difficult to justify the inclusion of those offences in cases to be disposed of summarily, having regard to Article 72 of the Constitution.  I suggested to the Attorney-General that the Government would be well advised to consider whether they should not insert some amendment that would make it clear that this jurisdiction in cases of offences of this character was only to be exercised summarily where on the facts the District Justice was of the opinion that it was a minor offence.  The new Sub-Section the Minister has read out for the <Col N="1174" /> Seanad seems to me to cover the entire ground in so far as that objection is concerned. I am only expressing my own opinion on the matter for the guidance of the Seanad.  It is for Senators to say how far it satisfies them.  It certainly covers, I think, the entire ground, in so far as Senator O'Farrell's objection was based on the Constitutional point.</P>
      <P>The proposal is &ldquo;To insert the new Sub-section immediately before Sub-section 6.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be an appeal in any case.  The Courts of Justice Bill provides for an appeal from any conviction by the District Judge to the Circuit Court.  That may be one of the questions raised there. To be quite frank with you, I think that is a question which the Circuit Judge would hardly entertain because he might say that the Act has left this to the discretion of the District Justice, and it is for him to say whether on the facts it is a case he ought to dispose of summarily. That would not interfere with the power of the Circuit Judge to review the merits of the case and quash the conviction if he thought fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator O'Farrell raised this issue on the Second Reading there was sympathy with him.  Many Senators felt that in carrying out what they conceived to be their duty for the last twelve months they have been passing a number of Acts containing provisions of which they did not particularly approve, but which, in view of the circumstances, they allowed to pass.  I took occasion once or twice to draw attention to other points in connection with other Acts.  Senator O'Farrell had a good deal of sympathy in the protest he made, and he may congratulate himself now on having substantially achieved his purpose.  So far as I understand the amendment of the Minister, I think it does meet the case, and it is very unlikely, in view of all the circumstances, that any District Judge will have to deal with any question summarily that appears in any way to raise any <Col N="1175" /> of these constitutional points.  I think a case of that sort will hardly ever arise. On the other hand, it may happen that some cases brought under these various clauses may be minor offences, perhaps more or less in the nature of jokes or freaks or performances of persons not well balanced in their minds, and the object of justice might be well served by dealing with such cases summarily.  I think the Seanad could satisfactorily accept the Government's amendment.</P>

      <P>I move to delete sub-section 4, section 1.  The sub-section says: &ldquo;Every male person who shall be found on indictment of the offence of robbery under arms, as defined at No. 5 in Part 5 of the Schedule to this Act.&rdquo;  I think that No. 5 there should be No. 6.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it must be an error, because it goes on to describe arson as No. 6, whereas it is No. 7.  I think the two items referred to should be Nos. 6 and 7, instead of 5 and 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>The sub-section provides that a person found guilty on indictment of certain offences shall be sentenced to be flogged.  I do not think that there is any necessity to go over the ground again which we went over on the last occasion.  This is the third occasion within nine months that we had this matter before us.  I am perfectly satisfied that this mandatory sentence of flogging is not good for the country, not good for the people who are to inflict the punishment, and it is not good for the people who get it.  I move the deletion of the sub-section because I believe it is wrong.  I believe that this horrible, degrading system of flogging is a relic of barbarism, and in a civilised community it should not be inflicted on any <Col N="1176" /> human being.  It is all very well for some Senators to say that these people deserve it.  Perhaps they do, but are you going to make them better by flogging? You are going to brutalise them, and make them enemies of civilisation. When we say our daily prayers we say: &ldquo;Forgive them who trespass against us,&rdquo; but there is not much forgiveness in making one human being stand over another and flog him.  It is not going to make a good citizen of him, and it is not going to be for the benefit of anybody.</P>

      <P>I spoke on a similar amendment on the last occasion, and I do not think that it is desirable to give my reasons again, except to say that I am of the same opinion.  I doubt very much the wisdom of continuing in this Bill, which is in many respects a modification of the last Bill, these provisions regarding flogging.  I would ask the Minister to give us his opinion as to why the Bill necessitates that continuance at present.  I rise to re-affirm my opinion and to state that I think that better reasons than those given before when we were under abnormal conditions should be given for the continuance of mandatory flogging.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only to say that I agree with all that has been already said.  I opposed this clause in the last Bill.  I do not see that it has had any good effect since.  We were told it would put everything in order and that if a few people were flogged it would settle it all.  I cannot see that that effect has taken place, and I still oppose flogging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeSigerson" hpid="Dr. SIGERSON Dr. SIGERSON">
      <NameTxt>Dr. SIGERSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had some experience as a member of the Royal Commission on Prisons, and I have been strongly opposed to physical punishment as a rule, but there are crimes which are exceptionally barbarous and require barbarous punishment, <Col N="1177" /> and that is certainly sometimes of use when other things are useless. Take, for example, that wave of garotting which a great many years ago prevailed in London, and other crimes of that class.  Nothing stopped the garotting, a most vile, cowardly attack upon individuals, until it was made by law punishable by flogging. That in a few weeks caused the garotting to cease.  These criminals are more sensitive in their skins than in their consciences, and there are crimes which have occurred in this country which are not crimes characteristic of the country, but others such as raids upon offices kept by women and attacks upon inoffensive and benevolent men which no ordinary penalty would adequately meet or certainly end.  Therefore, whilst I object to flogging in any case except a case of exceptional cruelty, I should say that cases of exceptional cruelty should be put down by any means, and as this has proved the only means successful in meeting those cases, I would support flogging where flogging is deserved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NugentEverardBart" hpid="Sir NUGENT EVERARD Sir NUGENT EVERARD">
      <NameTxt>Sir NUGENT EVERARD</NameTxt>
      <P>I think some of the Senators are rather considering the effect of flogging on the individual than the deterrent influence of punishment like that.  Of course, when one Senator, I think it was Senator Douglas, asked whether the present circumstances of the country justified a recourse to such a punishment as flogging, I think I need only refer to the Cobh outrage to show that there are inhuman wretches for whom no punishment could be too great.  Therefore, I think you should consider more the effect on the public generally as a deterrent influence than the possibility that flogging may demoralise the criminal himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think those who opposed this are not concerned only with the person flogged.  They are concerned to a greater extent with those who have to inflict the flogging. The man who has to carry out that fearful task cannot fail to have his morale degraded.  It makes him just like a soldier inured to bloodshed and <Col N="1178" /> war.  He holds human life lightly, through sheer necessity.  So also will this man engaged in this butchering task of taking the skin off human beings hold human life lightly afterwards. He must, unless he is more than human, be demoralised. Then there is a question of the deterrent effect.  The Cobh outrage, I think, is one of the best examples of that.  The punishment there would certainly be a greater one than that of flogging, and still it did not deter them from committing their awful deed.  The flogging Bill, passed last August, has not prevented robbery under arms, the principal crime for which this Bill was conceived. It is not fear of the type of punishment to be inflicted that is going to prevent a person from committing a crime.  One of the things that will prevent him is the knowledge that he will be caught.  If he knows there is a chance that he will be caught and get five, ten, or twenty years penal servitude, that will be a greater deterrent than if he knows the chances are that he will not be caught, but that if he is caught he will be flogged.  Senator Sigerson has said that flogging has purified London of one particular crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similar arguments might be alleged against any other punishment.  The galleys were a typical punishment of the past.  One cannot say that they purified the countries that adopted them.  Was it the institution of the galleys that made countries as lawful as they are to-day?  All properly civilised countries are abolishing corporal punishment, which tends to degrade and demoralise.  Punishment gives play to the elementary passions of man. These passions assert themselves in all cases where great wrongs are committed. But they do not tend to reform the criminal.  If he survives he comes out again into society and it is natural that his hand will then be raised against every man.  He will be degraded.  He will have little or no chance to get on, and will feel that fearful ignominy to which he has been treated.  If that is the effect, then this type of punishment does not justify itself, and apart from reforming a criminal it makes <Col N="1179" /> him twenty times worse.  If I thought it necessary to inflict a greater punishment for this crime I should consider capital punishment preferable.  There a criminal would cease to become a menace to society.  But when you flog him you send him out a far worse man than he went in.  Fear alone will never make a man good; fear alone will never prevent the commission of crime.</P>
    <P>After all, we have to consider the horrible conditions under which this country has existed for the past five or six years.  Education was very bad; in rural districts particularly there were little or no educative institutions and no harmless amusements to beguile the idle time of young men.  Naturally when organisations of an irregular character came along there was a tendency for these people to jump to that career of arms and that sort of pastime. The degrading circumstances under which the civil war was fought tended to develop any barbarism that there has been, and we are amazed to find the amount of it there is in the Irish nature, after all.  In these circumstances one would have to proceed along some other lines rather than mere corporal punishment lines.  You cannot make a nation by flogging; you cannot civilise people by merely punishing them.  There will be gradually, I hope and believe, a return to normal conditions, but it will not be hastened by merely providing the lash instead of providing employment for those who are idle.  The devil always provides work for idle people, and provision should be made whereby idle people will obtain occupation and not be driven to obtaining a livelihood by the gun.  The crime of arson, I think, has pretty well died out.  It was certainly a crime that was closely associated with the war, both against the British and the civil war, and it was carried into other disputes also; but I think, on the whole, it has nearly died out, as it was only natural to expect it would when these conditions ceased.</P>
    <P>But certainly the same arguments that might be advanced in connection with these crimes do not now obtain, because the reign of law is now restored to a very material and appreciable extent by the establishment of <Col N="1180" /> police barracks, by the functioning of the courts and the running of the writs of the courts, in most parts of the country at all events.  For that reason I do not think that we should degrade ourselves unnecessarily by putting in force, even temporarily, such a Bill as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>The punishment set forth in the Bill is degrading and brutalising, and I am convinced that it has no deterrent effect whatever. Criminal statistics go to show that of all the persons who are returned to penal servitude after one conviction the greater percentage is amongst people who have been flogged.  I think that is fairly clear evidence that flogging itself is not a deterrent for the crimes that are attempted to be stopped under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Farren is a sentimentalist, and I always like to meet sentimentalists.  Individually they are charming people.  I doubt if Senator Farren would still be a sentimentalist if he had been Minister for Home Affairs in this country for the last two years.  I feel that the view would force itself upon him that when you have retrogression, when you have a step back, as it were, towards barbarism, signal penalties are necessary to stigmatise particular crimes.  This penalty has been called a relic of barbarism. We have other relics of barbarism, and we have been told by Senator O'Farrell that all up-to-date civilised countries are finding that they can do without these penalties.  Very good.  The countries that can afford to do without these kinds of penalties are right to do without them.  They are only defensible on a basis of necessity; they are only defensible on the basis that the other normal sanctions of law are inadequate, and I submit that those considerations exist in this country at this time.  I never said here, or elsewhere, when the Public Safety Bill of last year was under consideration, that the mere insertion of these penalties in a Bill, the mere writing of these words with ink on paper, would cause these crimes to disappear.  I rather said that <Col N="1181" /> if they were to be at all checked, if they were to be kept within bounds, if the bonds of ordered society were to be held together at all, these penalties were necessary.  Imprisonment for one reason or another as the sanction of law has not the effect nowadays that it had in more normal times.  The kind of men who commit these two crimes have no particular fear of imprisonment. Senator O'Farrell said that fear alone will not make a man good; fear alone will not make a man obey the law.  I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But it was argued by other Senators that the certainty of arrest, the certainty of detection, was the real thing. Why would that be a deterrent?  Presumably because of something following on detection.  It would not be the mere fear of being found out, so that we ought all to be clear on that, that certain arguments which were used here with regard to these particular penalties might be used against any penalties at all.  There was almost underlying certain of the arguments a suggestion that we should simply send for these men and remonstrate with them.  The idea of punishment is either right or wrong, and without going too deeply into that, I take it to be my responsibility, I take it to be the responsibility of the Executive Council, to afford to citizens adequate protection for life and property, and to take such steps as may be deemed necessary to that end.  This is one of the steps deemed necessary to that end.  There are through the country men who will not be checked by fear of imprisonment, who perhaps will not be checked by fear of these penalties, but the number of men who will not be checked by fear of any penalty is not so great. Certain men will pause before making up their minds to go out and rob their neighbours with a gun, and will advert, to some extent at any rate, to the consequences if they are detected.  As I asked before, I ask Senators now to form a mental picture of a man sitting at home, perhaps wanting to buy some luxury, not having the money, and turning over in his mind the half-formed project of going out to rob. Will he advert to the consequences of detection, and if he does will he be <Col N="1182" /> more deterred by the penalties embodied in this Bill, or by the normal sanctions of the law for such offences? I am not apologetic about these penalties. I defend them on the basis of existing conditions.  If the country emerged out of these conditions to a more civilised, a more peaceful and a more law-abiding state of things, then these penalties would be inexcusable. They are not inexcusable when robbery with arms is almost routine in certain areas.</P>
    <P>We are trying to combine certainty of detection with stringency of punishment. The statistics of crime detection, in the city and country, are quite good.  The new Detective Branch of the Metropolitan Police is increasing in efficiency week by week, and the monthly reports of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police are a credit to the Force, and similarly with the Civic Guard.  But these crimes exist, and exist on a large scale, and from the signs of the times I will say they will continue to exist and even to grow, if you dispense with the penalties embodied in this sub-section.  We can promise no miracles.  The passing of this Bill as it stands will not cause crimes to disappear like snow in the morning sun, but the passing of the Bill as it stands, and this sub-section as it stands, will put into our hands a power which we consider necessary to grapple with the evil, which beyond question exists.  If we need greater powers, if we need, as Senator O'Farrell suggests, the death penalty, we will come to the Dáil and Seanad and suggest the death penalty.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Unless the Court is satisfied that there are special circumstances in the case which constitute a mitigation of the offence.&rdquo;  We submit that in existing conditions these penalties are necessary for the offence in the abstract.

In reply I say there is no necessity in the world for producing this Bill.  Under the existing law there is the power to inflict this punishment, and the putting of this Bill on the Statute Book is a direct order, if I might say so, to the Justices to inflict this punishment.  What is the necessity of a special Coercion Act being introduced, giving explicit direction to the Justices that they shall inflict flogging?  Of course the wording of the Section would leave it, in a sense, optional.</P>

      <P>I must confess that I do not like this idea of flogging, although I voted for the original flogging Bill; but I voted for it very much against the grain.  The Minister, I think, and I say so with great deference&mdash;I do not pretend to anything like his experience; in fact I have no experience whatever&mdash;rather stresses the difficulty of the situation in which he finds himself.  We all admit the extraordinary courage, firmness and ability with which he has dealt with the difficult <Col N="1184" /> situation so far.  I cannot help thinking that the time is nearly arriving when we might dispense with some of our methods of endeavouring to repress this social warfare.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt at all about it, nobody can deny it, that this flogging is a most barbarous proceeding.  We know perfectly well, very much to our sorrow and very much to our amazement, that there are in this country people whose existence we never suspected before, but who unquestionably are the worst kind of barbarians.  No punishment is strong enough for ruffians of the character who have gone over this country for a number of months past, and done the most hideous things.  Every member of the Seanad knows what has been happening. He knows of those brutal attacks on old, defenceless people for the purpose of robbery; he knows of this brutal intimidation of girls and women for the purpose of robbery, and he knows the brutal acts of arson committed in different parts of the country, and all those horrible things.  I do not know that we are improving our position in any way by condoning barbarism ourselves.  I say, and I always believed it, that this flogging treatment is a hideous, barbarous resource, and I do not know that the time has not come when we might relax it to some extent.  I do not, at all events, like voting a second time for a flogging Bill.  It seems to me the proper way out of this difficulty does not lie so much with the Government.  The Government are doing their best in the face of great difficulties, but the real solution of this difficulty lies, after all, with the public themselves.  If the public will set their faces against barbarism from one end of the country to the other; if they will shake off the widespread intimidation under which they apparently linger, if they will support the Government, and see that law and order are maintained in the country by doing what they can by bringing malefactors and robbers of all kinds to justice, I say that is the proper way of dealing with the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that putting these penalties into Acts of Parliament does any substantial good.  I admit that the Government is faced with very great difficulties and is doing its best to <Col N="1185" /> find its way out of those difficulties.  It has succeeded wonderfully well so far with its limited resources, and I have absolutely no doubt whatever that it will succeed in carrying out its policy. But I would ask the Minister to go slow in this matter.  He has his flogging penalty in certain conditions under the existing law.  I am not inclined to extend it.  I believe that the remedy for these troubles lies in the public spirit of the country, and once the people show that they are determined to put down barbarism, I think barbarism will very speedily come to an end.</P>

      <P>On a previous occasion I supported a similar Section in another Bill, and I see no reason for the removal of this.  The mover of the amendment points out to us what I did not appreciate before, that the power to flog is basic in our laws already.  That being so, I cannot see the reason for opposing this particular Section, which is a deterrent to men whom I am sure the opponents of the Section acknowledge to be criminals of a most serious type.  I cannot see why they would not apply themselves to remedying the existing law rather than trying to defeat a Section in a Bill which some of us are satisfied <Col N="1186" /> will have an excellent deterrent effect. I shall certainly support the Section.</P>

      <P>It is a little difficult for women to vote for this Section.  It is more difficult for them to vote for it than it is for men.  But I voted for it on the last occasion, and I found that the first ruffians on whom the penalty of flogging was inflicted were those who entered a business house where only the housekeeper and the servant slept on the premises. They beat the housekeeper until she was unconscious.  They put a revolver into her mouth and she knew no more of what happened.  She was four days in hospital before she recovered consciousness. The men who did that were the first to get the punishment of flogging.  No matter what I felt at the time on account of the vote that I had given, I afterwards felt that my vote was justified when I read of this terrible thing which had happened. I feel now that the Government would hardly ask for this penalty if they did not know that crimes such as I have referred to are still amongst us.  I also feel that if gentlemen cease committing these crimes there will be no flogging. Therefore I will vote for this.</P>

      <P>I take it that it would be proved it was stolen property before he would be called upon to say where he got it.  The Minister might be challenged to prove that he did not steal a pair of shoes.  Probably he would find it very hard to do so.  He might not have kept the receipt, and nobody might remember that he paid for the shoes in the ordinary legal way. He would then be in considerable difficulty in proving how he got them.  At all events I take it that he would like to have an opportunity of giving evidence on his own behalf.  If there is power in this Section so that a person called upon to prove his innocence would have the right to give evidence on his own behalf, and not to make a mere statement, then, of course, my amendment is met.  I want to be assured that when a man is charged in circumstances like these, to prove that he is not guilty, or to prove that he is innocent, he shall have the right to give evidence on his own behalf.  I would like to know from the Minister how many cases, if any, of this kind have been tried under the former Public Safety Act?  Has this Section in the other Act been utilised to any extent, and with what result?  Have the people involved been allowed to give evidence on their own behalf?  If so, has it been treated as evidence or as a mere statement? It is a very serious Section, as it involves an imprisonment of twelve months.  When you proceed to inflicting punishment of that kind care should be taken to give the accused the ordinary rights of accused persons.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Senator seems to think that my shoes might reasonably be suspected of having been stolen, according to the wording of lines 40 and 41 of the Section. There have been cases under the Section corresponding to this in the previous Act, but not very many.  I am not exactly sure what happened.  I take it that action was only taken where there was something amounting to a moral certainty that the property was stolen, and that the statement made by the accused person was examined and found to be unsound.  It is a principle in law that neither an accused person nor his wife is a competent witness. Most lawyers with whom I have discussed the question consider that is an advantage to the prisoner, and that its removal would be the reverse.  The prisoner under this Section will be entitled to make a statement, not on oath. I put it to the Senator that a statement so made will carry as much weight, or in a particular set of circumstances, as little weight as if it were made on oath. I mean that if the weight of the evidence is counter to it the fact that it is a sworn statement is not going to make a material difference one way or the other.  Apart from that fact, there is nothing in the nature of the particular charge in this Section to justify a departure from the ordinary rule of law. If it is the view of the Senator that a change is desirable in the law of evidence it would be more convenient if it were made in the law as a whole rather than with reference to a particular Act.  I think in England a prisoner who stands charged is entitled to give evidence in his own defence, but I think people who have knowledge of the operations, of the law, both here and in England, are of opinion that the present state of the law here is rather an advantage to the prisoner; that he gains nothing, but loses in fact by being put in a position that he can give evidence. If a prisoner can give evidence and refrains from doing so it is always naturally interpreted against him if he did not go into the box.</P>

The Section as it stands does not involve that he should be examined on oath or examined at all.  It simply provides that if he did not give a reasonable explanation of how the stolen property came into his possession, the Justice should be at liberty to convict him.</P>

      <P>Section 7, Sub-section (1), page 6, line 13.  To delete the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;may (after hearing any representations made by or on behalf of the person to whose credit the sum of money stands).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for moving this amendment is to prevent possible and probable injustice being done to innocent people rather than to suggest that the guilty should be allowed to escape.  To my mind it is preferable that several guilty people should escape than to convict one innocent person of an offence which he did not commit.  This Section as it stands makes no provision whatsoever for a person who may have money to his <Col N="1194" /> credit in a bank getting any opportunity of proving whether it is his legal property or not.  It leaves him liable, without getting any such opportunity, to an order being made prohibiting him from having the use of or transferring the money, and in the case of an innocent person, I hold that it is possible that mistakes may be made in this matter.  Every other day we learn from the debates in the Dáil of Ministers admitting that mistakes are occurring in Government Departments.  I hold that the carrying out of this particular Section is liable to cause mistakes to occur.</P>

      <P>It is that tying up of the money in the case of a person who is not really guilty that I object to.  It is to prevent such injustice being done that I introduced this amendment.  I do not know that it is the best way to prevent the said injustice, but to my mind this, or something equivalent, needs to be put in to prevent a person's legal property being held up probably for a lengthy period, but at the very least for a month.  If a man in a small business has his banking account held up for a month, he is driven out of business. That is a good thing in the case of a person who has come by the money in an unjust manner.  There is nothing here to safeguard a person who is innocent and who will not get an opportunity of proving whether he is the owner of the money in dispute or not before the money is held up in the bank.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment or to amend this Section to safeguard innocent persons from being put under an injustice.</P>

      <P>Senator Douglas has stated very clearly the objection to accepting the amendment.  I acquit the Senator moving the amendment of any desire to prevent the Section from being effective, but acceptance of the amendment would mean that.  The Section is intended to provide for the making on behalf of the State of <i>ex-parte</i> applications to a District Justice in connection with sums of money in banks, illegally obtained.  The proposed amendment would defeat the objects of the Section. Any representation persons to whose credit the money stands may desire to make, they may make.  The amendment is inconsistent with the idea of <i>ex-parte</i> applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases of the kind contemplated, any notice to persons involved would give them an opportunity to withdraw the money.  The order is a stop order pending further investigation.  Take it that we have reason to believe that there is a large sum to the credit of some person, who a year or six months ago was a man of straw, and it is in his name in a particular bank.  The only course is to go straight to some District Justice and say: &ldquo;Here is a set of facts, and we are asking for a stop <Col N="1196" /> order on that particular account.&rdquo; That being given, the individual has a month in which to prove to the State that he had a windfall from his uncle who died in America and left him £5,000, or something like that.  Action will only be taken when there is a strong presumption of guilt.  Undoubtedly the problem exists on a fairly large scale in the country, and this is the best effort we have been able to make to provide machinery to deal with it.  I can assure the Senator it would not be used only where presumption of guilt would be extremely strong.</P>

      <P>It is not strictly accurate to say that public funds would be in charge of a Minister of State.  If rates, for instance, are seized and taken, that would be a public fund which is not under the direct custody of a particular Minister.  Take the case of rate collectors being held up and their moneys taken.  The distinction there is between private property and property or funds of a public nature. Rates would be funds of a public nature though not actually State funds. Any State fund would naturally fall under the head of one or other Department of State and would be the responsibility of one or other Minister.  I think the distinction there between public funds and funds which ought to be in the custody or under the control of a Minister, or a Government Department is, perhaps, a necessary one in view of the fact that there are certain public funds that are not State funds.</P>

You have first of all to say &ldquo;any public funds,&rdquo; whether in charge of a Minister or not.  That would cover the question of rates, which are not in the charge of a Minister.

      <P>I move: In Section 7, sub-section (2), to delete in line 20 the words &ldquo;Minister for Finance&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;District Justice.&rdquo;  The discussion on the previous amendment, I think, makes the case for this amendment. The Minister for Finance can, by an <i>ex-parte</i> statement, secure an order from the District Justice impounding funds lodged to the credit of any particular person or persons.  Under the next sub-section the person concerned, who has had no chance of making any attempt to prevent the issue of that order, has to go to the Minister for <Col N="1199" /> Finance and convince him that these funds are his legal property.  Ministers are not people that are easily convinced, as a rule.  One would almost as soon go to the Minister for Finance and hope to convince him as to try to convince the Minister for Home Affairs.  Ministers have been coming here for the last fifteen months, and I do not think I have met one of them who admitted that he was convinced by any single argument advanced from any quarter of the House.  That is the type of man that the unfortunate person has to go to and convince that this money which was impounded on the statement of the Minister himself is his property.  Unless he is able to convince the Minister, after the lapse of a certain time the money is confiscated. I think it is an extraordinary thing for any Minister to set himself up as the judge in a case of this kind.  My three amendments stand or fall all together, and the effect of this amendment is that if the Minister secures the first move by getting the money impounded, then it shall be for the District Justice who made that order to say what time, in the first place, shall be given within which the person concerned must prove the ownership of the money, and that it is to the satisfaction of the District Justice he must prove the ownership, and not to the satisfaction of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is extraordinary for a Minister to constitute himself the judge, no matter what the circumstances.  The order cannot be rescinded except by authority from the Minister for Finance that he is satisfied, from the statements made and the evidence adduced by the claimant of the money, that this money does belong to him.  The evidence that would convince a District Justice, a judge or a jury, might make absolutely no impression on a Minister, because he went, in the first instance, with a prejudice in his mind, a moral certainty that the money did not belong to the person in whose name it was lodged.  Therefore, the unfortunate person is up against a very difficult task at the very beginning.  He has to remove that prejudice from the mind of the Minister. Juries are always asked to discard from their minds everything they have heard <Col N="1200" /> or read about a trial.  It would be very difficult to get the Minister to discard everything from his mind, because he is a crown prosecutor, so to speak.  He is a prosecutor in the case, and the prisoner in the dock might as well try to convince a crown prosecutor that he was innocent, instead of the judge and the jury before whom he would be charged.  It is a very big principle of law, and one which I think this House would be well advised not to endorse, because if you make provisions of this kind in one case you are setting a very dangerous precedent that future Governments can enlarge upon, and which can be utilised for the setting aside of the ordinary machinery of the law.  I do hope that the Seanad will agree with me that this amendment should be passed.</P>

      <P>I am not certain that the appeal as provided in this Section gives, at any rate, an adequate possibility of an appeal in the case of a dispute between the person and the Ministry of Finance, but I have doubts as to the wisdom of changing the words &ldquo;Minister for Finance&rdquo; to &ldquo;District Justice,&rdquo; because I think that in many cases an ordinary man would much prefer to go to a trained man in the Ministry and argue the case of the ownership of money or property rather than go publicly to the District Justice, be represented, and prove the case.  If a man had a windfall of £5,000, he would prefer privately to prove it than to go to the courts publicly and prove that he had received this legacy.  He might find that fees to solicitors, doctors, and others would go up immediately.  I think at the same time that while it is not fair to force a man immediately to go into the open, going into all personal details before a judge, yet in the case of his being unable to satisfy officials in the Ministry, for that is what I take it it means, rather than the Minister personally, it would be only right that some principle should be introduced into the Bill by which he would have an appeal.  After all, in matters of income tax and super-tax there is an appeal from the officials. A man can go further than the judgment of the official in the matter.</P>

      <P>Yes.  He has already held that, and, therefore, it might seem to put the person in an unfair position if Senator O'Farrell's only remedy was to go back to the District Justice to try and get him to alter his view.  I think whatever form this Section takes it is defective in not allowing an appeal either through a review by the District Justice or a review by the Minister for Justice.  I think it is probably an oversight, for in the previous Section, Section 6, which deals with the recovery of property actually stolen, an appeal is allowed from every order of the District Justice, and under this Section an order of the District Justice might be dealing with thousands of pounds.  Whether the review is to be made by him or the Minister for Justice, I think in either case if the decision is against the man he ought to have power of appeal.  I think probably that was intended, but I do not think it is conferred by the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Senators to the fact that this Section is distinct from Sections 4, 5, and 6, and deals with money in bank representing stolen property or funds. It deals with money as distinct from chattel property.  We more or less admit and accept in Section 4 the principle that it is a reasonable thing to ask the man to account for property which was reasonably suspected of being stolen, <Col N="1202" /> and that principle was embodied in the Metropolitan Police Act, and has, in fact, been in operation in Dublin for a great many years.  Under this temporary Bill it is extended to the country. Section 7 is different.  It deals with money in banks, on a very strong presumption that it was wrongfully and illegally come by, but no matter how strong the presumption it falls short of proof.  We may be aware of cases of men of straw, men in very poor and humble circumstances a year ago, and who have blossomed out into a remarkable condition of affluence, and we may have theories and suspicions as to how that came about.  We may know people like that who have now large balances in the bank.  Very good.  The proposal is that by applying to the District Justice we can get a stop order on that account, and that then the onus will lie with such persons to satisfy the State, as it were, to satisfy the Executive Minister, the Minister for Finance, that the property is really, properly, and legally his.  But all the time it is a question of rebutting a presumption.  As to whether it is a wise thing to try and bring the matter into Court and to ask Judges or Justices to say that a man's property may be taken from him on anything short of absolute proof that it is not his, is a question that I would like Senators to consider, and particularly the Senator moving the amendment.  This is a temporary Bill to meet a very abnormal, a very exceptional condition of affairs, when, as I say, this particular problem does exist in fairly large proportions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hold the view that it is better that it should be, if you wish an act of confiscation, confiscation after a <i>primâ facie</i> case has been made, confiscation in the absence of evidence rebutting successfully that <i>primâ facie</i> case, but if it is an act of confiscation I think it is better that it should be the act of the Executive than the act of a court. The Section provides that there must be a resort to the court for the stop order. Before that order is given, a good <i>primâ facie</i> case must be established.  In the words of the Section, the District Justice must be reasonably satisfied that these funds were wrongfully come by, whether as cash or being derived from the sale or letting of stolen property. <Col N="1203" /> But is it wise to say that in the last resort a Court must take that man's property from him?  Is it wise to establish a precedent?  We are talking here about precedents which must be enlarged disastrously.  I think it is not wise to create and foster in the public minds that idea of a Court acting on anything short of complete proof, and evidently these are cases in which complete proof will not be forthcoming, only a strong presumption, a strong <i>primâ facie</i> case, that is not rebutted. It is somewhat different even from the cases of property we have dealt with in Section 4.  It is reasonable to ask a man to account for a particular piece of property&mdash;a table, a chair, or a gilt mirror.  He must have been given it, or borrowed it, or bought it from someone. The matter of the cash in bank is a much more difficult problem, and we think in a temporary measure, not exactly an emergency measure, to meet the wholly abnormal and exceptional situation, if there is to be confiscation at all&mdash;and in the last analysis this Section is justifying and legalising confiscation in a certain state of circumstances&mdash;that it ought to be an act of State rather than a Court decision, because from the nature of the case the proofs on which a Court could and should act cannot be forthcoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the case he has stated, makes it necessary for the Seanad to balance two things against each other.  One is the right of the Executive to confiscate, as the Minister puts it quite clearly.  The Executive, no doubt, would not ask the Seanad to give them that right unless they thought it was for the good of the State.  On the other hand, such a right which can be exercised, not through a court of law, is most undoubtedly a very serious encroachment on the right of the subject.  It takes a great deal of thought on the part of anyone giving a vote on such a question as that, to know whether the Seanad would be right in giving up the clear rights of the ordinary citizen into the hands of an Executive Government, without any right of appeal to the law.  I do not know that the Minister has stated a case showing a sufficiently great State <Col N="1204" /> need for the Seanad to vote for the Section as it stands.  There may be some funds that may be used wrongly.  There may be some great State necessity.  But I should think that to ask the Seanad to give up the rights of the ordinary citizen in such a way would at least make it necessary for the Government to give us some stronger and more definite assurance.  If we are to vote for this Section it will only be to support a claim of the Government that it is required for the safety of the State. Without such a statement as that this is a Section that I could not vote for.</P>

      <P>I was going to suggest to the Government whether it would not be well worth their while to consider accepting these amendments to Section 7, provided there is inserted in the Section, sub-section (5) of Section 6, words which give an appeal to the owner of the money, the man in possession of the money, or to the Minister, whoever is aggrieved by the decision of the District Justice. My reason for suggesting that is that Section 6 deals just as much with money as does Section 7.  It deals with lands, of course, but also with money supposed to have been stolen, and the power of the District Justice to make an Order there in reference to stolen money is subject to appeal.  The appeal may be taken either by the person against whom he decides or by the Minister for Finance, if he decides in favour of the person holding the money.  If Senator O'Farrell's amendment were inserted in Section 7, and if there was also inserted sub-section (5) of Section 6, giving the right of appeal to the Minister for Finance, as well as <Col N="1205" /> to the person in the case where the District Justice decides against the person, I think that the two Sections would correspond with one another, and all the objections raised here would be met.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister why, in the definition of &ldquo;local authority,&rdquo; the District Council is excluded.  There is power to build houses in a rural area, and if a district council is excluded as an authority it would, I think, be impossible to place the cost of any grant upon the district. <Col N="1206" /> It may be very desirable to limit the area on which any cost of that kind would fall.</P>

      <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of this Section, this Act applies to a house which fulfils the following conditions&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the house shall, in respect of its site, aspect, planning, construction, sanitation and number per acre, comply with the prescribed conditions;</P>
      <P>(b)  the house shall in respect of the size and number of rooms and necessary appurtenances be in general accordance with prescribed plans or with such other plans as may be approved of by the Minister;</P>
      <P>(c)  the total area of all floors of the house measured inside the external walls shall not be less than 520 square feet, and shall not exceed 1,000 square feet, and the total area of any self-contained two-roomed flat in the house measured as aforesaid shall not be less than 400 square feet;</P>
      <P>(d)  the house shall be certified by an appointed officer to have been completed in a proper and workmanlike manner;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e)  the erection or reconstruction of the house shall be begun after the passing of this Act, or, in special cases approved of by the Minister, within six months before the passing of this Act, and shall in any case be completed within eighteen months after the passing of this Act, or <Col N="1207" /> within such further period not exceeding four months, as the Minister may in any particular case allow;</P>
    <P>(f)  in the case of the reconstruction of an existing house or building, that existing house or building shall be certified by an appointed officer to be capable of reconstruction as a house fulfilling the foregoing conditions, and except where the reconstruction is begun before the passing of this Act, such certificate shall be given before the reconstruction is begun.</P>
    <P>(g)  in the case of the erection of a new house, such house shall not be a house erected in fulfilment of a re-instatement condition within the meaning of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act. 1923 (No. 15 of 1923), and shall not be erected on or on any part of the site of a former house which has or shall have been the subject of a claim under the said Act or any other Act relating to compensation for criminal injuries;</P>
    <P>(h)  in the case of the reconstruction of an existing house or building, such existing house or building shall not have been the subject of a claim under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923 (No. 15 of 1923), or any other Act relating to compensation for criminal injuries.</P>
    <P>(2)  The provisions of this Act in relation to the reconstruction of houses or buildings shall apply only to houses or buildings situate in a county borough or urban district, or in a town having commissioners under the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854, or to a house or building situate within 880 yards of the nearest point of the boundary of such county borough, or urban district or town having commissioners, or in a town having a population according to the latest census of not less than five hundred.</P>

    <P>Section 3, Sub-section (1).  To insert after the word &ldquo;exceed&rdquo; in line 7 the words &ldquo;in the case of a <Col N="1208" /> house erected by a person who is permanently employed in the Civil Service of Saorstát Eireann for his own use and occupation, 1,500 square feet, and in the case of any other house.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is to enable Civil Servants to take advantage of this Bill and to extend the area permissible in their case.  There are special circumstances, I think, we all will admit, in connection with the officers of the Civil Service and the amount of exemption would be very limited.  We feel that it is only reasonable that they should be enabled to build rather larger houses than are provided for in the Bill.</P>

      <P>There are certain obvious objections to this amendment. First of all this Bill is mainly for the working classes and it is necessary to restrict the size of the house for that reason.  We have gone very carefully into this matter however, and as the main object is to get houses built and to encourage private enterprise in building, we are willing to accept the amendment. This amendment, I suppose, can be considered in conjunction with No. 14.  I do not think it will be necessary to introduce that amendment because it is a Departmental matter rather than a matter for legislation.</P>

To add at the end of sub-paragraph (e) the words &ldquo;provided always that all time during which work is stopped on account of industrial disputes shall not be reckoned when calculating the period within which the erection or reconstruction of any house must be completed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is obvious. It is to exclude in the calculation of the period within which a house must be built the time lost on account of industrial disputes.  The words of the Bill are very positive.  &ldquo;The house shall be completed.&rdquo;  Of course you may reach a state of affairs where a house is half finished and then I do not know what would happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The position the Government has taken on this is that provision is made in the Bill for 3,000 houses.  The construction of these houses is most necessary, and we cannot take into consideration for a single moment the possibility of industrial disputes or anything of that sort.  If it was going to take one month, two months, or three months to settle disputes we might as well make up our minds that the housing question is not going to be settled.  Having regard to the circumstances of the case I do not think there will be such unreasonable conduct on the part of the two parties concerned with housing construction, employers and employees.  If there be, then it is evident that there is no sanity, business or constructive methods whatever in this country, and we must admit a bankruptcy of ideas and of effort.  I do not think that such a thing need be contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we put in these safeguards we set <Col N="1210" /> a headline for a possibility to which, I think, no sane person is going to give any consideration.  I take it that it will take something like twenty years to relieve congestion throughout the country. It may be said that we have had considerable interruptions in business or commerce through industrial disputes. I think, even if one does look with a most unfavourable eye over the last twelve months or two years as regards these conflicts, it will be admitted that during that period there has been a real effort on the part of both parties to the disputes to end them as quickly as possible.  In view of that, we would not agree to the insertion of an amendment such as this, as people would say it does not matter when the house is built, the money from the Government is safe.  We want the two parties to see that such a condition of affairs will not be tolerated by the ordinary people of the country.</P>

      <P>I do not think the President seemed to grasp the point that Senator Sir John Keane wished to make.  The Senator wanted to know if a man who put money into the building of a house would run any risk if the building was held up.  If a man is not positively certain that he is going to get his house, and that through the question of time he may lose the money, well, he will not build the house, even with the promise of the Government grant.  I have been looking through amendments put down by Senator Sir John Keane, and they try to make it perfectly clear to everyone who has got money, and who wishes to go in for building, that there is a certainty of carrying the thing through, and getting the benefit that the scheme conferred. I think Senator Sir John Keane was perfectly right.  He wanted to know if <Col N="1211" /> the building was held up, not only by a strike of workmen, but even by a railway strike, over which he had no control, what would be his position?  Such a man will be very slow to put his money into building, if the Government make any conditions by which he would be deprived of the benefits of the Bill owing to a strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that the original time limit in this Bill was twelve months, but we extended it to eighteen months, to which four months were added, making twenty-two months in all.  Now, with regard to the interruption of business, the Seanad will recollect that Mallow Bridge was destroyed in July or August, 1922, and it was completed by the 15th October, 1923, although we were not in full possession of Cork until perhaps a month or two after the bridge was destroyed. Steel was brought to Cork, but it had to go back to Glasgow, and was sent again from Glasgow to Kerry, and then to Mallow.  These were extraordinary interruptions and extraordinary operations, but yet the work was completed within fourteen months.  We are asked now to give time for the completion of houses.  If those houses are not started within two or three months, this Bill will be out of date, and a new measure will be introduced within twelve months. Unless people look alive in the matter there is no use making experiments. We will have a new Bill possibly within less than twelve months, and unless people are going to start now, this Bill will not be of much use.  Surely twenty-two months provide a sufficient amount of time to indulge in strikes or interruptions of that sort if people want to indulge in them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>As we have already passed one amendment here in regard to houses being erected by civil servants, I take it that <Col N="1212" /> the idea is that it is desirable that they should have a better class of house than that contemplated in the Bill for the ordinary artisan, and that persons erecting such houses are prepared to put in an amount of money out of their private funds to supplement the grants available under this Bill.  It has been pointed out that if any obstacle arose it would mean that the man would lose his money, that enterprise of that sort would be checked, and also that civil servants will not very lightly embark on the erection of such houses.  I would suggest that it might meet the case and meet the objection raised here if, instead of this amendment applying generally to all houses contemplated under this Bill, it should only apply to houses where the individual man was prepared to supplement the grant by investing his own money in constructing a larger house than that contemplated in the Bill.  If the amendment were confined strictly to houses built by civil servants, who expend portion of their own money, and if there were such a strike as has been outlined here, people would easily realise that they would not lose money.  If we do not insert something of that sort you check such enterprise.  The great desideratum is to have houses of every size and reasonable construction and to encourage outlay in bricks and mortar, and if you can guarantee to civil servants who enter on enterprises of this sort, which will mean additional employment, that they will not incur risk of losing their money, I think it would all be in the right direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Seanad and the President that my object in this amendment is not to obstruct the Bill.  I am anxious that houses should be built, but I am afraid that under this Bill a man who builds houses must have great faith in the harmony amongst the various parties engaged in the industry.  An industrial dispute need not occur within the country to cause delay. Certain articles that go to the making of houses are not manufactured here at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two cardinal points against the acceptance <Col N="1213" /> of the amendment.  First, it practically ensures the parties engaged in disputes against loss during the period of a strike.  That is most inadvisable.  No one is going to lose, and the longer they hold out the less likelihood there is of a settlement.  The second point is that a man loses his money.  That goes by the board, because a house built under this Bill is limited to be sold for a certain sum.  Take away the limitation, and the man will get money for the house allowing that there is no grant from the Government.  If you build a house for £600 under the Bill it must be sold for £450.  There is a market for such houses.  Therefore, a man does not lose his money by putting it into bricks and mortar.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost, on a show of hands, 10 voting for and 16 against.</P>
      <P>Question: &ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>(1)  A house in respect of the erection or reconstruction of which a grant is made under this Act shall not at any time before the 26th day of June, 1926, be sold or leased at a price, fine or rent exceeding the approximate price, fine or rent specified in Part I of the Schedule to this Act:</P>
      <P>Provided that in the case of a reconstructed house to which the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923, applies, the rent shall not exceed the rent allowable under that Act, but the percentage increase allowable under sub-section 1 (a) of Section 8 of that Act shall be calculated on the amount of expenditure referred to in that sub-section, less the value, to be determined by the Minister, of any assistance granted under this Act in respect of the reconstruction.</P>

      <P>I beg to move in Section 4, Sub-section (1), &ldquo;to delete in line 55 the figures 1926 and to substitute therefor the figures 1936.&rdquo;  The object of this Section is to prevent any <Col N="1214" /> exploitation of the public with regard to traffic in these houses.  I can conceive a case where in June, 1926, a person who has built a house and received a grant can sell that house at a profit. A good deal depends on how the market for houses goes.  The same individual receives a free grant of £200, as he can under the Bill, and having built a house for £500 if he sells it for £500, he is getting a substantial benefit. Even if he sells at £400 he makes £100 on the transaction.  He has only put £300 of his own money into it.  I suggest to the Government that the matter might be considered either in the form I suggest or the Government might retain a lien on the house for a certain period after completion.  I do not think it is desirable in view of the possibility of houses improving in value that it should be within the power of any favoured person who does secure a grant to profit after June, 1926, by the sale of such a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection to this amendment is based on much the same considerations as the previous one. The calculations in regard to the cost and selling prices are based on the most intimate knowledge of the housing problem.  We have had an opportunity during the last few years of observing how prices go from one end of the country to another.  We have been able to get an exact curve as to the downward trend over that period.  They have gone down from £700 to £590.  There are parts of the country where a slight alteration in prices took place.  The price mentioned in the Schedule, taking into consideration the grant by the Government and the amount subscribed by the local authority, is calculated so that the speculative builder has just got the margin of profit. Fixing this date beyond 1926, to a certain extent stereotypes the present high cost of building and the tendency ought to be in the other direction.  Another peculiar feature of the Bill,&mdash;I regret I was not here when the Second Reading was on because it would have been a better opportunity for going into every phase of it&mdash;is that it is like a delicate piece of mechanism, any cog of which, if removed, disturbs the character of the whole machine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> In this particular case extending the time from 1926 to 1936 postulates two things&mdash;one, high cost of building; and two, that we are not going to do anything in the future.  We who are engaged in the housing problem are endeavouring to resurrect&mdash;if that be the correct term&mdash;the speculative builder.  He has been out of the building trade for a number of years, and his absence is a serious one to the community. It is with a view to bringing him back and to supplying as little money as possible out of public funds to bring him back that the Bill has been framed.  It is not a vital matter, but it would appear to us that it vitiates the general proposal of this Bill: trying to increase the yearly output of houses, and trying to minimise the present high cost, and trying to assure people that if they build now they are not going to lose by it.  At the same time the facilities provided by this Bill will not be handed down during the next ten years.  They will not extend to that time.  In other words, if a man says, &ldquo;I will wait two or three years until prices are going down,&rdquo; we are not going to give him the same terms then that we are offering now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to hand in a similar amendment to that of Senator Sir J. Keane.  On the Second Reading I expressed the view that a Bill fixing the 26th June, 1926 as the date up to which the houses could not be sold at a greater figure than that laid down in the Schedule leaves a danger of doing what the President wants to avoid.  I speak for the City of Dublin.  Owing to the enormous demand for houses, and the scarcity of houses, I believe if prices are not controlled beyond June, 1926, there will be profiteering in those houses.  A man can buy a house that cost £500 or £600 for £400.  The Bill provides that the person who built this house may get a subsidy of £100 from the Government and another £100 from the local authority for a five-room house.  He is bound under Sections of the Bill to sell the house at a figure not greater than £400.  I know there is a scarcity of houses, and I believe that owing to that there is a danger of a fictitious sale between <Col N="1216" /> the date of the completion of the house and June, 1926.</P>
      <P>When we remember that from the date of the passing of this Bill a person is entitled to a period of eighteen months to build a house and you have something like six months for the expiration of the time at which he is compelled to sell it at a certain figure, I am afraid there will be the danger of further profiteering in those houses.  I do not say that it is the people who build them will profiteer because I do not think these people will be in a position to hold them.  The President says he wants to resurrect the speculative builder.  They were not men of large capital.  They were generally speculative artisans themselves who started to build houses.  All their capital would be sunk in the houses they build. These men will be compelled to sell those houses because all their available capital will be sunk in them, but people may buy them under this Bill for £400, although they may be worth about £600 after holding them for a couple of years.  After June, 1926, people who build them may sell owing to the great scarcity of houses because people are compelled to pay more than the value of the houses at the moment.  I believe that houses are being bought to-day at prices far beyond their value because people are compelled to pay prices beyond the value of the houses. If the President insists upon fixing the date at June, 1926, there is a great danger of doing what he wants to avoid, that is, charging exorbitant prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I am coming to the question of sale.  Holding for six months means a certain loss. If the houses are empty there is so much capital held up, and Senator Guinness, for instance, would understand the foolishness of holding up £500 or £600 capital and getting nothing out of it. The necessity of getting back the capital and the uses to which that could be put, are reasons which prevent me <Col N="1217" /> agreeing to this amendment.  Suppose for a moment that a person started to build twelve of these houses.  He puts something like £5,000 worth of capital into them.  When they are built he has got this contemplation in mind: Will he hold them for six months, sell them at perhaps, a higher price, or will he sell them now and make a smaller percentage on his capital, and invest again.  I believe that the latter suggestion would appeal to him, because within six months there is always a danger of something happening.  A fire or anything else may occur.  It may not be a suitable time to have them on the market. What we want is persons with capital to build 10, 15 or 20 houses, to sell them quickly and to see that there is money in falling in with our ideas in connection with this particular scheme of house construction.  For this reason, owing to the necessity of inviting somebody to start on this scheme, I would like, while securing that nobody is going to make money out of it, to attract as much money into it as we can.  It is a perfectly sound proposition.  It would require a pretty considerable amount of capital, and there would be no loss.  There would possibly be a gain, but because it is nobody's business it will take some oiling of machinery to get people to start at it, and for that reason I am against restrictions that might make the whole more water-tight, but will not make it more fool-proof.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I differed from the President on the last amendment, but I am certainly with him on this amendment. The fault of this Bill, to my mind, is that there are a number of things in it to prevent people from going on with building.  In this case we will get houses built and if, two or three or four years hence, somebody makes £100 out of a house what on earth has that to do with us?  That is the business of the man who buys the house.  The real fault I see in this Bill is that it goes too far in cutting down profits.  If people can make money let them make it.  Under this clause, in June, 1926, a man will get his money out and have it ready to make another bit out of it.  I have no objection to somebody in the year 1927-28 making <Col N="1218" /> £50 or £100 out of a house, if he can get it, and the man who buys it will only pay what he considers the value of the house.</P>

People should not be allowed to get a profit in these cases and make money out of them when the taxpayers are putting down £200 each for these houses.</P>

      <P>As one who always favours a maximum profit in private enterprise, I am rather interested to hear that the State should also assist the private individual in securing profits. But there is another aspect that occurs to me.  I hope I do not take a very low view of human nature, but what is to prevent this happening&mdash;a person building a house and holding it up deliberately until June, 1926, without putting a tenant into it at all.  I do not think you can forecast prices, and what is going to happen.  After all, I am afraid you will have to admit the fact that as long as people can make money legally the national point of view is a minor matter to that of personal gain.  I can quite see circumstances in which a man might calculate, rightly or wrongly, that it will pay him to keep these houses unoccupied until June, 1926, and then sell them. They would be also free from rates.  He might do it and gamble for a profit. The public are suffering in the meantime, and the accommodation is not available.  However, the Government appear to be firm on this matter, and that is all I have to say.</P>

      <P>It is not so much the speculative builder as the speculative buyer that has to be guarded against.  The man who builds a house may sell it to some person who may be speculating.  A man might buy half a dozen houses, and hold them until June, 1926, and then sell them, and he might even make £100 on each house without having done anything to produce <Col N="1219" /> the houses at all.  I think that he is the great danger, and not the man who builds the house.</P>

      <P>The innocence of the supporters of this amendment is positively amazing.  The last argument I was interested in was, if a man built a house in a hurry and sold it to a speculative purchaser he could start building another house.  You are turning out houses all the time, and the more houses there are available the less opportunity there is for speculators to make money on them.  If this thing stood alone and it was an evil in itself there might be something to be said for it.  But in view of the fact that there are enormous numbers of people who will be getting a small amount of money for nothing, it is not an undesirable thing in the circumstances.  The more houses built the less opportunity there will be for speculative men to get unreasonable opportunities for making money.</P>

      <P>I move in Section 4, Sub-section (1), to insert after this Sub-section a new Sub-section (2) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The materials to be used in the construction of houses under this Act shall be of Irish manufacture, except in cases where the persons erecting or reconstructing such houses shall satisfy the Minister that Irish materials cost 7½ per cent. more than foreign materials.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I propose this amendment is because of the great unemployment there is in the country; it is absolutely necessary that all the materials we can possibly manufacture should be manufactured in Ireland.  In connection with this amendment, I was thinking particularly of cement, bricks, doors and windows.  There are in this country a number of things that we would be able to manufacture and procure&mdash;stone, lime and bricks&mdash;and there are a number of things we cannot manufacture, such as glass and ironmongery.  We have a cement works in the Free State, and doors and windows should be made here.  I do not necessarily mean that <Col N="1220" /> the timber would be produced here, because we have no suitable timber, but for a great number of years a number of doors and windows, manufactured in England, have been used here, and I think that any money expended on doors, windows and cement under this Bill should be manufactured in Ireland. For that purpose I would give a preference of 7½ per cent.  There might be a difference of opinion about that, and 5 per cent. might be considered sufficient, but you must have some preference, and I put down 7½ per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment which I find it very difficult to resist, but which in the circumstances of the case I fear I am bound to.  In the first place, we have estimated, as I have said before, exactly what the cost of these houses is and what the cost is likely to be, and the introduction of such an amendment as this would certainly impose on us the necessity of reviewing the Schedule at the end.  I will go so far as to assure Senator O'Rourke that the Local Government Department of Dáil Eireann, which has to a large extent, I think, carried out some of the proposals which had been for many years advocated by the late President Griffith and the Industrial Development Association, have started central buying, and as a result of that they have been, I think, in a position to enable some new industries to be founded in the country, and to maintain some of the existing ones.  In this case I regret to say that from the information submitted to me there are some particular industries affecting the supply of building materials which are not in such a state of efficiency as would warrant the inclusion of an amendment of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been in consultation with some of these suppliers, and it was not in a moment that we managed to get some of the industries I have mentioned started by the Local Government Department. But I would undertake that within the ensuing twelve months we will go further into that matter and endeavour to help the production of material for building to as great an extent as Senator O'Rourke recommends.  The supply of building materials of Irish <Col N="1221" /> manufacture is a matter about which I addressed an industrial conference in Cork 13 or 14 years ago, so that I am not absolutely a child in the matter. Times have changed very much since then, and at this conference I have mentioned, two out of three of the persons who were present asked for a Government subsidy to enable them to supply materials at much the same cost as they could be imported at.  It raises the whole Fiscal problem, and it raises it in a way in which we are at a great disadvantage.  We cannot afford to pay higher prices for goods than the world markets can supply them.  We ought to be working towards producing as efficiently as other countries these particular commodities.  If we start on this particular uneconomic proposition&mdash;namely, housing&mdash;to impose a further blister, I think that it would be almost impossible without an expenditure of very considerable sums of public money to make this housing problem a success.  I would wish that it were some other problem than this of housing that the extra cost would be entailed on, but this particular one, in view of its uneconomic position at the moment, cannot, in my opinion, bear any additional burden.  Senator O'Rourke mentioned cement and other things; some of these commodities are at the moment engaging the earnest attention of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, with a view to seeing what steps are necessary to help these particular industries.  I would ask the Senator not to press this particular amendment now, and I assure him that we are impressed with the case he has made, and see the necessity for doing whatever is possible to revive the industry of building materials.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 6:&mdash;&ldquo;To insert after this Sub-section (2) a new Sub-section (3) as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;In the case of any local authority whose rate for 1923-24 was more than double the rate for 1914-15, the provisions of this Section shall not apply until after the next Local Government Election.&rsquo;&rdquo; This amendment is put in in the interests of a class that are very hardly pressed by local burdens at present. Moreover, these burdens are not evenly distributed.  In some counties the increase of local rates has been almost, you might say, surprisingly small in relation to the index number.  In other cases it has been abnormally high. In four counties, or more, the rates are three times pre-War.  If the President will not mind my saying so, there is a very ugly spirit in some of these counties, and a very disturbed feeling which is expressed at the Farmers' Union owing to the burden of these rates.  I do not wish to say that there is any strong movement to anything unconstitutional, but there is a distinct sense of grievance that these heavy rates are due to the abnormal circumstances over which the ratepayers' representatives have not had a full control, and that the full burden of these rates should not be borne by the local authority. They view with great alarm the additional burden that may be placed on them under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The further fact must be faced that <Col N="1224" /> these Councils at present are not really representative of the ratepayers; they are obsolescent, and the period for their renewal has long since passed.  When they were elected, they were elected in the special circumstances not mainly with the view to efficient administration, but with the view mainly to political action.  These obsolescent bodies, or their personnel, in many cases are not acceptable to the ratepayers, and power to put further burdens on the ratepayers and to remove the limit of borrowing is a measure that the farmers view with great uneasiness. In order that these provisions should operate more or less equitably this amendment seeks to exclude powers to make grants in these counties whose present rates are double those of 1914-15, but only until new and, we hope, representative councils, have been elected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a member of a local authority during the period of the Great War, and at that time I recollect the British Government refused to allow the Local Government Board for Ireland to sanction the borrowing of any money by local authorities for housing.  The Great War started in 1914, and this particular restriction commenced to operate about 1915.  Down to 1922 scarcely any housing whatever was done by local authorities, with the exception of Rural District Councils.  In their case I think a sum of £1,000,000 was made available about 1914.  I mention that to show, in the first place, that during that period there had been a very remarkable restriction on the output of houses, and unfortunately during that period the cost of providing houses increased by about 300 or 400 per cent.  At that time I recollect a case being made by the Dublin Corporation for permission to borrow money to build houses.  I recollect discussing the matter of housing with a gentleman who had very strong Imperial views, and he helped me with regard to the case we were making at that time.  I said to him, &ldquo;What about other local authorities; if they are in the same position as the Dublin local authorities, what about them getting money also?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;If the other local authorities have as good a case as <Col N="1225" /> that of the Dublin Corporation, then there is a case for the provision of these houses.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was at a time when the money markets of the world were restricted to a very large extent.  Although I suppose he would have preferred to have concentrated upon the winning of the war at the time, his views with regard to the necessity for providing houses were none the less strong by reason of that fact.</P>
      <P>This amendment puts out of court the area of a local authority which is unfortunate enough to have been, we will say, financially damned by the particular class of persons who constituted the Council of that area.  It is not a fair case to exclude or to prevent an area from being provided with houses because during the last eight or ten years a number of incompetents have managed the business of that particular local authority.  If there has been mismanagement that is one thing.  If there be money to spend on anything there is no better service upon which it could be spent by a local authority than upon housing.  Take the Dublin Corporation, for example.  Even if the rates were 25/- in the £ in Dublin I would still say that there is a case for putting a 1/- in the £ on the valuation in order to provide houses.  The very first time that I canvassed a ward in the city for election to the Dublin Corporation I made up my mind that under no circumstances if elected would I ever take part in a social function by reason of my position owing to the horrible conditions under which I saw people living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something like 100,000 people in the City of Dublin live under conditions which practically condemn them to death within a few years.  If one examines the census returns he will find that, although the City of Dublin has a very great number of children, only 62 per cent. of the people are Dublin born.  The supply from the country to keep up the population is enormous.  We are draining the country of its life-blood in order to maintain cities like Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Waterford.  Anyone who has studied the problem of social reform will tell you that the real matter which has to be remedied is the housing conditions. <Col N="1226" /> I noticed in leaded type in the paper the other day a statement of the Medical Officer of Health for Dublin.  I went round with the Medical Officer of Health six or seven years ago through what are called the common lodging-houses in Dublin, and saw the awful conditions under which the people live. I ask the Seanad to say whether, even if the rates in Dublin were 25/- in the £ as compared with 10/- ten years ago, that is a reason why those people are to be allowed to live in the present conditions, and that the Corporation should not be asked to contribute its quota towards an improvement in the housing conditions.  I admit at once that an increase of 100 per cent. in rates is entirely unjustifiable, but I do say that if it is allowed to any local authority to commit an extravagance that extravagance ought to be in providing houses.</P>

      <P>I quite appreciate the point of view that the President takes up, but one has always to keep in mind in dealing with the burden of local rates that we farmers take the point of view of what we can afford to pay.  The other side take the point of view of the essential services that must be kept up.  What we say is that already the burden of local taxation is inequitable.  Too heavy a burden is placed on the local authorities. If these services, as we admit, are essential, they should take the form of an increased grant from the Central Fund.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I cannot accept the suggestion made by Deputy Gogarty, but I will be as brief as possible.  The object of the amendment is clear.  It is an effort to relieve the increasing burden on the local authority.  They say that the last straw breaks the camel's back.  I think the camel's back is very nearly broken.  Here we have the power of forcing on the local authority the obligation to remit rates. These bodies are supposed to be autonomous.  They are democratic and although I may be open to the charge of inconsistency in adopting this attitude, I feel that in this case there is no ground for interference by the Central Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is also a case in which we have endeavoured to distribute the burden as equitably as possible.  For two years we contributed towards the construction of houses by local authorities two-thirds of the cost.  That proposal was entertained by us at a time when the State was not burdened with the enormous costs and liabilities of the last two years, and when there was not in contemplation such an enormous burden on the taxpayer.  Here is a case in which the State does what never has been done in this country before.  In the first place, it gives a subsidy; in the second case it enables a local authority to give a subsidy, and in the third place, the local authority, having had the money spent in each area, benefits by increasing the valuation of that area.  We asked that the rates on houses&mdash;an almost uneconomic service just at the moment&mdash;be reduced by 95 per cent. the first year, by 90 per cent the second year, and so on until at the end of 20 years the local authority will have in its area a very valuable property, bringing in rates and benefiting the entire community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case the State comes in with £100 towards the cost of a house, comes in also with machinery, with its help and assistance, and asks the Local Authority for a similar contribution. It provides the Local Authorities, one might say, with decent habitations and does not impose on them any extra liability.  Take the case of a particular area in the City of Dublin where if you put up a couple of hundred houses upon what was virgin soil, what is the actual cost?  What is the burden placed on the Corporation of Dublin by an addition of 200 houses?  You have still got the Town Clerk and Medical Officer of Health and the various other officials' services, so that the actual additional cost by reason of these extra houses to the City of Dublin is scarcely a burden at all.  The case is then that the State comes forward with a contribution of £100 and gives the local authority the entire benefit of any building activity that would result.  I do not think it is an unfair burden.  It is scarcely a burden at all to ask the Local Authority to <Col N="1230" /> give this remission in rates.  For a great number of years, under at least one of the Local Authorities, persons in occupation of houses valued at £8 and under got a remission of valuation if the houses were kept in good order. That might not be the case throughout the country.  This is a case in which this particular service, owing to the increased cost of production and the high cost of materials and other incidentals which have come about from the war, such as the increase in the cost of money, cannot be rendered now unless there is co-operation from every person engaged, employers, employees, the State, the Municipality and all interested in the provision of houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>Co-operation by all means, but I suggest this is coercion. The only thing I would say is that I gather that an additional cost will very often be put on the Local Authority by reason of these new houses.  You have to provide approaches to the houses, sewers and public drainage and other services.  Surely these will mean an additional cost.  I suppose if the Government are going to insist on it there is nothing more to be said.</P>

      <P>I move: Section 8.  To delete the Section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Section is an attempt to introduce the principle of diarchy, or dual control into business.  We all know, after the recent experience in the European War, how fatal that is.  I have reason to believe, or I surmise, that the Government do not intend to apply this, and that it is merely intended to act as a scarecrow.  I can say that if that is the idea it will not only act as a scarecrow against profiteers and such pests, but against the fertilising qualities of capital and those who could contribute to the result we all require. The first thing we have to ask is what is the meaning of the word &ldquo;local&rdquo;? Does it mean an inquiry within the area <Col N="1232" /> of the local authority?  I do not see anything in the definition to explain that.  You may make a province or any large area the subject of a local inquiry. I wonder if the Government realises what an inquiry of this kind, if going to be effective, means?  You would have to inquire into the cost of timber, and many people who have not a knowledge of timber think that is very simple.  When you go into an inquiry in which you are going to fix prices you have a multiplicity of grades and qualities all of which would have to come under review.  If there is to be any equity and effectiveness in it your inquiry must be very extensive and must go into considerable detail.  I do not know if the Government appreciate that a merely general inquiry will serve no purpose at all.  You could not fix prices in business without a knowledge of the various grades and qualities that have to be taken into account.  What are the powers of this body?  We have had experience of inquiries and of the Commission on Prices where it was generally agreed the whole thing was a farce, as there were no powers.  I cannot see under this Section that there are any statutory powers to call upon parties to produce books and give evidence on oath.  I may be wrong.  Is the fixing of a price to come into operation from the date of the order or is it going to be retrospective and to affect undertakings and contracts made prior to the order?  That is also dealt with in an amendment in the name of Senator Haughton which, with the permission of the Seanad, he has asked me to move on his behalf.</P>
    <P>Then there is the power of varying and revoking.  I am glad to see that the Government have kept that in because you could never fix prices unless you had power to vary and revoke. How that power would affect the head of a business firm who has to make a contract, I fail to see.  Then, again, under this Section, and also under Section 10, within what period must an appeal be made?  That fact will also affect the operation of Sub-section 2, Section 10, but mainly I think the Seanad ought to be somewhat concerned about this.  Even though it is only intended as a sort of bogey, it puts <Col N="1233" /> a new and dangerous principle on the Statute Book.  It may not do much harm in a Bill of limited operation, but once it is on the Statute Book it is almost a precedent for legislation of a most dangerous nature, and one that will deter a free flow of capital and enterprise which is the only way in the long run that houses will be built.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wholeheartedly in favour of this Section.  It is a notorious fact that standard articles required for the erection of such houses as we contemplate are all quoted at the same price.  I know from experience that if you go to all the builders' providers in Dublin, and ask tenders for these standard articles, you will invariably get an estimate which will be the same for every article.  That proves conclusively that there are rings in the supply of building material.  Somebody fixes the price and everybody must sell at that particular price.  We all know that in some establishments the overhead charges are greater than in others, and in some the costings are greater than in others, and that the business of one concern may be run more cheaply than that of another, and that it can sell more cheaply than others.  Most of the articles, such as flooring, boards, etc., which will be used in the constructing of these houses are standard articles, and they will all be obtained at the same price in Dublin. Therefore, I think there is a necessity to protect the public.  There have been rumours that there are building rings and building profiteers who make exorbitant profits.  If there are not such rings, they need not be afraid of this particular Section.  I think the Government would be wise to include this Section in order to protect people who will be compelled to build a house according to specifications laid down by the Ministry, whose engineers will see that these specifications are carried out.  I hope if the Government will get the power that they will exercise it fully.</P>

      <P>I understand there are two Sections in the Bill which would make it work the way Senator Farren prophesies, namely, Sections 8 and 9.  Section 8 says that &ldquo;the Minister may at any time if he thinks fit.&rdquo; If a man makes a contract to build a house and he makes a sub-contract for material the Ministry may come in and start a local inquiry which will upset all his arrangements.  That seems quite unworkable.  Who is going to accept contracts under such conditions?  Of course we trust the Government absolutely not to give grants for houses that will cost too much.  It should not be done in the way provided here in the Bill.  Before they pass a contract or give a grant the Government and their advisers know what the house should cost, for any of us who are building to-day know exactly what a house ought to cost.  I may mention that we had a contract before us the other day which showed that a building was going to cost at least 30 per cent. over and above what it could be done for on the other side of the water and what we thought we would get it done for here.  There is no question about big prices prevailing. There will be great difficulty in getting cheap houses in this country, and we will want the Government, who are putting public money into houses, to be careful about the prices at which these houses are to be built.  This Section gives power for interference at the wrong time.  If the Government are going to interfere, let them interfere when the contract is made.  Let every contract be subject to Government approval as it is in the Bill, but do not let them pass a single thing unless the prices of the houses are what they ought to be.  Once they agree as to the prices and the grant, let there be no further inquiry.  Otherwise they will upset the contract, and they will get no one to build.  I wonder has Senator Farren noticed that there is no interference with wages in the Bill?</P>

I say that they are perfectly right, as they would get into trouble if they did interfere.  If this Section is kept as it is, and if the Government keep a right to interfere and hold extremely expensive inquiries into such minute things as Senator Keane has referred to at any time they please after the contract is placed, they will undoubtedly damage the value of the Bill greatly, and prevent any decent contractor from taking contracts for these houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Jameson is not very often wrong, but he seems now to have got the wrong end of the stick.  The object of this Section is to protect the contractor who decides to build a number of houses.  He has got to buy material for those houses.  The very moment there is any sort of development in those houses up goes the price of material by speculators and manufacturers, simply because of the big demand for it.  It is to protect contractors, who decide to build houses under the terms of this Bill, from any undue fluctuation of the price of materials. To prevent the people who sell to them from charging exorbitant prices is the object of the Bill.  The only people it could embarrass in any way are those rapacious profiteers who are trading on the public requirements by seeking undue profit through the operation of the Bill.  I do not see how he can argue that the contractor who is going to build is to be interfered with. It is to his interest to get things as cheaply as possible.  Otherwise you are going to leave the contractor at the mercy of those rings and you frighten away men anxious to build houses, instead of encouraging them.</P>

      <P>I do not at all suggest that the whole Section should be cut out, but that is the amendment.  In speaking to the amendment I did point out that the Section as it stood was an interference with the contractor by the Government, and that that interference was put in at the wrong place.  If this inquiry was made before the contract was let, it would be all right.  A contractor cannot have his price run up against him.  He must be sure of having his materials at certain prices before he makes his contract.  It is said <Col N="1236" /> the Government is going to protect him. How will it protect him?  He has got his material and everything of the kind, and he has then put in his contract price and that has been accepted. Once that has happened the Government should not come in and begin holding inquiries.  I do not see, if they come in after the contract has been let, how they are going to protect the contractor, and I do not see how making him liable for a penalty of £50 is going to be of assistance to him.  Perhaps the President will explain this further.</P>

      <P>As one who has had a considerable amount of experience in this work, perhaps you will allow me to say a few words.  I think there is a vast amount in what Senators O'Farrell and Jameson have said, but from my experience of contractors I do not see how the object which everybody has in view will be gained by Senator Jameson's proposal.  I am aware that the suppliers guard themselves by a clause that they are to supply at a certain rate.  Suppose what Senator Jameson said is correct, that the contractor has satisfied himself, and arranged the tender for certain goods.  He will find when he comes to consider those prices he has got that the suppliers have guarded themselves by a condition that those prices are to vary under certain circumstances.  If what Senator Farren fears happens, then the prices will go up and he will not be protected.</P>

Within the last week I had a case brought under my notice.  Senator Farren is quite correct in saying that rings are not confined to Dublin.  They exist all over the country. In certain districts you find the same prices quoted to you for the same articles.  If you go outside that ring you find that prices vary enormously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> In a certain district, which shall be nameless, timber was quoted at the same price.  Everyone in that district quoted within a few pence of the same price.  On going outside that ring the same timber was got at 30 per cent. less.  I cannot imagine any Section which should be more advantageous or necessary than this one.  I do not know how this will be amended.  Whatever Section will be drafted the Government will have great difficulty in enforcing it.</P>

      <P>I think a great deal of the difficulty will be met by giving the Minister credit for having a little commonsense.  There is nothing in Section 8 to force him to interfere.  If he does not think fit, he is not to set up this elaborate inquiry, and Senator Jameson's difficulty will be met as well as the difficulty supposed to overhang the contractor.  I think a Section that gives the Minister power to think fit is essential to any Bill, inasmuch as the contractor always puts in a proviso that some imaginary posterior material will not become dearer for him.  That is the method of making it difficult for a man to be disturbed in the middle of his work.  With the Minister's discretion presiding over and controlling, it will be possible to some extent to avoid sudden profiteering and opportunism. I, for one&mdash;perhaps I am in a lonely position&mdash;always regard the Government as having a presiding intelligence over the country.</P>

If investigation shows that the man is charged more than he is entitled to be charged, and that his claim is justified, what is the use of the Section at all?</P>
      <P>If a man enters into a contract for the supply of goods and he is satisfied that he is not getting the goods at the proper value, and he acquaints the Minister, or it comes to the knowledge of the Minister and the Minister decides to hold an inquiry into that allegation and finds that undue profits have been made, then there would be no use in holding such an inquiry if the findings of the inquiry would not deal with the specific complaints that were made regarding the price charged.  I see Senator Jameson laughing.  When I said the Section would be no use at all I should have said that the inquiry would be no use. I think the profits allowed should only be a fair margin.</P>

      <P>I move to delete Section 9.  I am sorry to have to return to this.  Really I do think that this Section is of great importance, much more than the last, because I do give the Government credit for not attempting to enforce the last one.  But I think there is a great danger that they may be tempted to operate under this.  The Government takes power to enter into the building trade, and with unemployment and these demobilised soldiers to be provided with work, there is a great temptation to start some factory or enterprise which would solve unemployment.  What would be the effect of that?  What has been all down the ages, as far as we know, the effect of Government competition on private enterprise?  It simply drives private enterprise out, and Government operations, being proverbially extravagant by virtue of a lack of incentive, by the exclusion of all prospect of profit or gain, cut right at the root of these qualities which make for enterprise and develop initiative, resource and the running of risks.  If the Government is really seriously going into trade, other people will get out of it, and the field will be left to Socialists. I am not now speaking against Socialism.  I regard it almost as a sin <Col N="1240" /> against nature, in that it destroys those great qualities of virility which nature expects the human species to possess. I come now to the curious wording in Sub-section (2), that materials should be sold at a certain price.  I wish the Attorney-General was in the House, or that we might have legal opinion as to what is going to happen in these cases.  Supposing the Government sell, as every business man has to sell, at what they can get, surely it is common knowledge that you cannot make your price unless you also chose to force the purchasers to buy.</P>
      <P>The Government find that they have got the stuff on their hands and the market has gone against them.  They have then got to hold it indefinitely, <i>saecula saeculorum</i>, or until a new Bill is passed.  Otherwise what are they going to do, because they have not power to set it?  I do not know what are the rights of the citizen as against the Government, but I suppose that, by Petition of Right or by some other means, one could proceed against the Minister if one so minded.  But I think if a body is going into trade it augurs very badly for their success if they go on the supposition that they can sell at their own price.  If everyone could sell at their own price we would all be in a position of affluence. Then also, I am not at all satisfied that the Government possess the necessary accounting machinery, and I might also say that unless they recruit from the accountancy profession the necessary accounting skill to record in proper form these transactions and to ensure that the cost is the true cost, we could not know the real position.  There is nothing more elusive than true cost. I have other amendments, if the Section is to remain, in which I hope to develop that point, but I think I have shown in the broadest grounds the reasons why I consider this Section dangerous and unacceptable.</P>

      <P>It is quite evident that Senator Sir J. Keane has got a bad attack of Socialitis.  I presume he is thanking his stars that he is not living in England, where there is a Socialist Government in power.  He attacks this Section mainly on the lines that it is Socialistic, but for that matter the <Col N="1241" /> whole Bill is Socialistic, because it is providing State funds to subsidise a number of speculative builders to build houses in the public interest. We were told on the Second Reading that very much of the material that is required for building houses is not manufactured in Ireland at all, that we are very largely, to that extent at all events, at the mercy of combines and rings outside this country. If that is the case, the incentive would be for the Minister, if he decided at all to enter into the manufacture of building materials, to do so in connection with these commodities that are manufactured outside this country, and consequently there will be no question of driving private enterprise out of business.  The Section provides for a profit of five per cent.  Evidently Senator Sir John Keane thinks that it is a scandalously low amount.</P>
      <P>I think that the ordinary manufacturer, if he is able to make five per cent. on his money, is not very badly treated, but he thinks that any manufacturer who is confined to that amount will inevitably go out of business altogether. That is an indication of the very high profits that are being sought, and the amount of profiteering that must inevitably ensue.  As to the wording of the Section, I am not concerned with it; I had nothing to do with the drafting of it, but it is with the principle that I am concerned.  What we want is to build houses, no matter who they are built by or by what means, to remedy this great social evil.  There need be no anxiety as to the State entering into private enterprise, where private enterprise has absolutely failed. The State must not allow private people to speculate upon public requirements and to try to make a profit out of social evils.  The arguments against this Section are of an utterly selfish character.  They are unpatriotic in my opinion, and are only calculated to check or to obstruct the steps that are being taken to remedy one of the greatest social evils with which this country is faced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite take that for granted, but I should hope that that is not in the minds of the Government. It never dawned on me to impute that the Government were going to embark on the manufacture of things in this country which at present private enterprise is not able to manufacture; that the Government should think of using a Section in a Bill of this sort to start manufacturing. I take it that in all the Sections they are putting into this Bill they are simply keeping before them that value is to be got for the £300,000 they are putting up for housing.  Therefore, I look at the Section quite differently, but honestly looking at it as it is drawn, I cannot see how it is going to act.  I can see very considerable trouble for the Government itself.  Take the one question of how they are going to get the money alone.  Taking it for granted these factories are to be established because the makers of the articles which are to be used in the building of these houses are going to charge such a price that the houses cannot be economically built, the Government are going to manufacture so as to produce them more economically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, will they try to get timber cheaper than it could be sold at now?  And they will probably manufacture bricks.  As people know, those who are engaged in those trades are not making fortunes.  I do not know if the Government think they will get such things any cheaper than at present. The people engaged in those trades at present are not making money.  If the prices seem too high and the Government come in, make bricks and deal in timber, certainly we might lose a great deal more than the £300,000 unless they employ experts in the business.  The <Col N="1243" /> Section says: &ldquo;It shall be lawful for the Minister, whenever after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce it appears to him expedient for the purpose of facilitating the building, reconstruction, or repair of houses (including as well houses to which this Act does not apply as houses to which it does apply) in Saorstát Eireann or any part thereof, to purchase or manufacture, store, transport, and sell any materials or appliances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, of course, will cost money. Then how is he going to pay for it?  Look at sub-section 3&mdash;&ldquo;The expenses incurred in the purchase or manufacture, storage, transport, and sale of materials and appliances under this Section shall, to such extent as shall be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is not called in at the beginning of the proceedings at all.  The two other Ministers start.  They go ahead and establish factories and everything else, and when it comes to pay their bills they come to the Minister for Finance. He may say, &ldquo;I do not approve of your proceedings at all.  I cannot face the Oireachtas and ask them to pay for this speculation.&rdquo;  It seems quite plain that the Minister for Finance could come in and render it quite nugatory, and refuse to pay for the undertaking entered into by the two Ministers in the first paragraph. If it is meant that under this small Bill the Government are to manufacture on a large scale, it would seem as if it was the case the things are not to be sold only to the builders of these houses.  They are to be sold to people in Saorstát Eireann, and it does raise the suspicion that the Government are intending in this Bill to bring in a clause enabling them to start factories.  I do not believe it is so, but the Section implies it as it stands.  It seems to me to give them full power to enter into it; it gives two Ministers full power to make bargains without the consent of the Minister for Finance, and it gives the whole three Ministers power to pledge the credit of the State with the consent of the Oireachtas to that expenditure.  I think the Section is wrongly drawn, and I cannot see the necessity in a <Col N="1244" /> Bill of this kind to bring in all these enormous questions.  I think that the Government could have quite enough control of the situation without bringing in such huge things as seem to be implied in the Section.</P>

There will be no necessity under this Section for the Government to build factories, for most of the supplies of building materials required in this country are not manufactured here.  What the Government can do is, if the people who handle the goods on this side are not prepared to deal fairly and get reasonable profits for handling the goods, the Government can just as easily order a cargo of timber from Norway and a cargo of cement from Belgium.  They can order them in grosses.  We do not need this tremendous amount of accountancy work to do that.  They simply order them the same as the providers do, and they have not wonderful counting houses.  All the Government require is a store at the port, where the people who are building the houses under this Act can get their requirements, the same as the providers.  The Senator told us all about what the Minister for Finance would have to pay out, but he did not read the last line of the particular sub-section, where it says, &ldquo;The proceeds of the sale of all such materials and appliances shall be paid into the Exchequer.&rdquo; The Government, I think, can get as much credit as builders' providers. They do not pay on the spot for their cargo of timber, or for their cargo of Belgian cement.  They get cargoes on three months', and sometimes six months' credit.  The State, I think, has as good a credit as the private provider.</P>

      <P>The people who buy the stuff pay, and the person who handles it makes a good thing out of it.  It is not proposed in this Section to set up factories, though I wish the Government did set up a factory to make bricks.  I hope they will consider the possibility of erecting a factory for making bricks, and that they <Col N="1245" /> will adopt a newer and more modern method of making bricks, and not have people engaged in the making of bricks go through the inhuman conditions of to-day.  I would suggest to the President that he should consider the German system of making bricks.  For an outlay of from £3,000 to £5,000 you can get machinery for making bricks under human conditions, and the bricks can be turned out at one-fourth of the present cost.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the Government seriously intends to set up factories, but this Section gives them the power to make the people who are handling the goods required for the building of houses deal fairly with their customers.  I take it that is the object of the Section.  The Government do not propose to go into competition with anybody, but they wish to have power to protect the people who are prepared to deal with this vital necessity of houses so that they will not be fleeced and prevented from availing themselves of the advantages which the Government propose to give under the Bill to people who will build houses.</P>

      <P>Section 9.  To add at the end of this Section the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that this Section shall only apply to the purchase or manufacture, storage, transport, and sale of materials or appliances to be used in an area in which the Minister, after a local inquiry under Section 8 of this Act, is satisfied that the cost of any materials or appliances in that area is excessive and restrictive of the output of building work.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is drawn on the supposition that Sections 8 and 9 were both really meant for the same purpose, which Senator Farren believes the Government are going to use them for, that is to say, to take care that the prices charged for materials are not excessive. If the Government use Section 9 without having an inquiry such as is prescribed in Section 8, and use the powers for dealing with any persons and manufacturing materials without selling them to contractors, undoubtedly Section <Col N="1246" /> 9 does go outside of the purposes of the Bill, as it has been explained to us.  If we were certain that the Government would not use its manufacturing and selling powers until they had an inquiry into the costings, and had satisfied themselves that there was profiteering, then we would know where we were.  The amendment simply means that Section 9 should only operate where there has been an inquiry and where the Government find that the need for such action exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Seanad will not accept the amendment, because it would unnecessarily restrict contractors in purchasing supplies from the Government which the Government had purchased at a low rate, and were prepared to sell at a reasonable profit.  Section 8 is a very weak Section, as it only provides for a local inquiry. If there is a local inquiry into the cost of building materials and it can be proved that the prices in a particular area are the same as are charged all over the country, then I take it that the Minister cannot reasonably fix any lower price.  In other words, if the &ldquo;ring&rdquo; is sufficiently large to cover the whole country, then this Section is inoperative. That being the case, as the Minister is unable because of the extent of the combine, to cut the prices in any particular area, then to carry this amendment would mean that the Government were ham-strung, and could not protect the contractor against the rapacities of the building profiteer.  I hope, therefore, the amendment will not be accepted, because it neutralises Section 9 altogether.</P>

      <P>I cannot read into the amendment the conditions which Senator O'Farrell applies to it. It seems to be a most reasonable amendment. Nobody, I think, desires to see this Government getting into the position that the British Government got into during the war, of manufacturing and providing materials at an enormous cost, without any regard to their real value, and which had to be afterwards sold by a special Commission at a frightful loss.  As long as this Section 9 is only to apply to people who are charging too much, I see little objection to it, and I think that this amendment <Col N="1247" /> will meet that object.  I do not see any reason why the Government should not accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether this exact amendment is accepted or not, I think the Government ought to consider some restriction in the working of this Section, because it seems to me, unless it was held that the Act having lapsed the Section also lapses, that we are giving power to do trading of this kind, quite apart from the Bill, if at any time any Minister wishes to carry on trading in building materials.  I think there should be some restrictive clause, restricting it either to the period of this Bill or the operation of it.  Between this and the Report Stage, I think the Government ought to consider whether they would not approve of some such restriction.  I also doubt if Section 9 will come into operation unless a supplementary financial provision is made. Otherwise you might quite conceivably, under Sub-section (3), have a loss through stock not being sold or through a change in the price.  I venture to suggest to Senator Farren that these very profiteers whom he wishes to protect us against may be the people who will take advantage of the circumstances of the Government and force them to sell at a loss.  Reference was made to Belgian cement.  To purchase Belgian cement at the rate of exchange of the franc a month ago is a very different thing to purchasing at the present rate of exchange.  Even with a perfect knowledge of the value of materials, you cannot possibly have a knowledge of the fluctuations of the exchange, and it is conceivable that private traders would purchase large quantities owing to a reduction in the value of the franc for the purpose of leaving material on the hands of the Government.  Some sort of check, therefore, on the amount which could be charged to the State should be provided, and I suggest that the working of this Section should be limited to the operation of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would undertake to look into this before the Report Stage, but on the face of the objections I would like to say a few words.  In the first place no money can be spent in respect of this Section, not a penny until the Oireachtas has passed a Vote, an appropriation.  It is not within the power of any Minister, extern or intern, or of the President himself, to spend sixpence without the consent of the Minister for Finance.  That is the use of a Minister for Finance.  You would not entertain the luxury of such a Minister if he had not got some use. That is his use.  However the Section may be worded or whatever infirmity there may appear to be in the terminology, the fact is you do not lessen in any way the grip of the Minister for Finance, nor do you impair the privileges of the Constitution or the rights of the Dáil or Seanad in any way.  So far as this is concerned these two Ministers can enter into any conspiracy they wish, and all they can do amounts to nothing without the consent of the Minister for Finance.  With regard to the particular part in brackets, that was inserted deliberately.  We are undertaking a very considerable expense under the Damage to Property Act for the reconstruction of buildings, mansions and houses.  It is not the intention of the Government to allow builders' providers to profiteer.  It is costing the country a pile of money, and we are going to see that for any money the State or the country is committed to full value will be given for it.  We are not going to allow even persons who <Col N="1249" /> talk about restrictions on capital &ldquo;a free puck&rdquo; any more than we are going to allow other people whom they criticise for having &ldquo;a free puck.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the particular Section in question was closely, seriously examined I think it would be found that we contemplated some little control over what I would call the opposite to capital, transport and so on.  All these things come within the purview.  They have not told us: &ldquo;We will send all the labour out of the country if you do this; labour is a very ticklish things, very coy, and you are shaking confidence in the State, and then you people with capital will have to build houses for yourselves.&rdquo;  Should it happen that there should be, let us say, a strike on the part of those supplying building materials in a certain area, we cannot allow the construction of houses to be held up, and will have to come in. In that case Section 9 would be required, irrespective altogether of the amendment.  I will undertake to look into the amendment and see if I can meet the views put forward by Senator Jameson, while in no way detracting in this particular Section from any of the powers we have asked for in it.  As I said, if these powers have to be exercised in the way of manufacture or purchase the matter will come before the Oireachtas, and a case must then be made by the Minister for Finance or by the Ministers concerned before the appropriation will be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has offered to look further into the amendment. From what he has said, if he adheres to the purpose of applying the manufacturing powers under this Section to a different kind of trading than is mentioned in the Bill, we cannot meet him.  You could not give an undertaking which would make Section 9 only applicable after inquiry, because it is stated earlier that it really applies to supplying materials to persons who are not building houses at present, and to the building of houses that are going to replace others, or be built under a totally different Bill to this one.  It is as well to recognise the actual facts of the case.  This Section is far bigger than I contemplated.  It is undoubtedly taking power under this Bill to establish <Col N="1250" /> Government factories, Government trading, and Government purchasing of materials in a way that I did not contemplate. It is as well to know that. Whether it is a wise thing for the Government to take these powers in a small Housing Bill I do not know.  I think if the Government want powers to manufacture they might have dealt with the matter in some other way.</P>
      <P>It may be that they are right and will get their powers.  If that is so, I would rather they took them under a Bill of another kind.  This is undoubtedly a case where the Government, under a small Housing Bill, are taking powers for trading and for establishing factories that the average individual who read the Bill never thought were included in it.  Certainly I did not think so.  As to the President's statement that the two Ministers cannot spend a farthing without the consent of the Oireachtas, as it is worded the Bill states if it is passed it is lawful for the Ministers to do so-and-so.  Mention of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Finance only comes in at the end.  The three Ministers undoubtedly have power to purchase and to pledge the credit of the State before asking the leave of the Oireachtas.  I may be wrong, but that is how the Section reads to me.</P>

If the Government will only try this Section, I do not think they will try many other of these experiments in future measures of a more far-reaching character.  In the event of its being tried we want to be sure the trial is a fair one.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Farrell hopes to induce people to go into trade on a 5 per cent. basis, but would any man go into business on such a basis, when he could buy 5 per cent.  Loan and go round the world or else stay at home and smoke his pipe in peace?  No doubt many people lose by looking for more than 5 per cent.  As there is a danger of Socialism being put on trial we want to give it a fair trial, and you can only give it a fair trial by arriving at true costs.  It is difficult to arrive at true costs unless you include overhead charges.  If the Government wants to go into competition it must be fair. Private enterprises must support offices and all kinds of services, which it is quite possible the Government might provide, but not show in the account. It is to have these items included that this amendment is put down.</P>

    <P>I am encouraged to ask for a further concession, and that is that a commercial form of account be set up.  I know that the Government do not use a commercial account.  The ordinary form of Government account is a Cash Account, in which there is no difference between Capital and Revenue.  You cannot make any comparison between expenses and costs as shown by the Government accounts.  If the Government are going to trade they should be compelled to have a commercial account, that is a double entry account terminating in a profit and loss account and a balance sheet.

      <P>My melancholy duty is to move a motion which I feel certain will meet with the approval of all the Seanad.  It is a motion with which I am glad to say all Ireland is in absolute sympathy and it has reference to a sad occurrence which took place at Cobh.  The motion is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Eireann at this its first meeting held since the occurrence, endorses the statement and action of the President regarding the brutal and cowardly crime committed at Cobh on last Friday, resulting in the death of one and the serious wounding and maiming of several other British soldiers and some civilians.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Eireann tenders its sincere sympathy to the relatives and comrades of Private Aspinal, the wounded and their relatives and comrades, and sincerely trusts the murderers will soon be brought to justice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think, Sir, I am required to say very much more on the matter.  I do not suppose that in the annals of crime there has ever been a more cowardly or a more repulsive crime committed in any country, and it is sad to think that we, as Irishmen, have had to admit that it occurred in our own land.  I sincerely trust that the assassins will be brought to justice.  It may appear strange that they have not already been caught, but one must remember that there are practically no military posts between Cork and Co. Waterford on the coast line now, except a small one at Youghal, and these men had a motor car with a machine gun on it, and it will possibly take some time to hunt them down.</P>

      <P>I second Senator Love's motion.  I hope that in what may be the long experience of this Seanad it will never again have such an evil crime to speak about, or ever again have to pass a vote of condolence with the relatives of murdered soldiers, such as we are dealing with now.  I do <Col N="1258" /> not suppose that with the exception of the few scoundrels who did it, there is a single soul in the Free State of Ireland but has felt how bitter and horrid it is to think that such a thing could be done in our country.  A few friends who were together at the week-end felt it so deeply that they thought it better not to talk about it.  I endorse every word in the motion.</P>

      <P>I wish formally to associate myself with the motion.  This has been a very bloody, cowardly deed, which tends to bring dishonour and discredit upon all sections of the community. But one consoling feature of the tragic incident is the fact that it has utterly failed to accomplish the foul purpose for which the crime was committed. The deed has been condemned by all Parties in the State, and from that point of view alone, it has done one good thing in demonstrating to the world that all Parties in the country, no matter what their differences on other points may be, are, at all events, united in condemning cowardly and atrocious acts of this kind.</P>

      <P>I wish to associate myself with the motion referring to an appalling tragedy.  It is a sort of crime that is entirely foreign to our nature and our race, because it has the very worst elements of criminality.  It was a premeditated, callous, inhuman act.  Defenceless men, women and children were fired upon, without any opportunity of making any resistance.  In the whole of our history there has never been such a cold-blooded, inhuman act as that, and under the circumstances in which we are it was particularly unfortunate, because the nation, as it were, was pledged under the Treaty to a truce in these matters.  So far as the crime has any political significance or intention, which I suppose it had, it is, as I say, particularly unfortunate in that respect.  It takes on itself the aspect of a national crime, and causes national shame, national humiliation, and national sorrow.  We only hope the miscreants will be brought to justice quickly.  They put themselves, I should say, entirely outside the pale of civilisation and Christianity, and almost of humanity, because their act was utterly <Col N="1259" /> and absolutely inhuman.  It has been suggested by Senator O'Farrell what their purpose was, but it will not be served.  They will not succeed by that act, or a succession of such acts, in creating a rupture between the two countries.  We are bound together by an honourable Treaty, entered into by the majority of the people of this country with their will and approval, and it is not in our history or our record that we have ever broken a Treaty, although we have been the victims of deception in matters of that sort.  But inasmuch as we have put our hands to this thing, and have so far honourably carried out all its conditions, I am glad to say that the English nation, if we may judge by the Press <Col N="1260" /> comments and reports, appreciates that, and will not be aroused to act in any vindictive way as a result of this appalling tragedy.</P>
