      <P>There is a report from the Joint Committee on Standing Orders dated 8th July intimating that no notice of appeal from the report of the Examiner of Private Bills in the case of Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock, Dalkey Corporation Bill, 1924, has been received within the prescribed time, and that the Bill is accordingly deemed to have been read a first time in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>There is no action required on that.  I am in a difficulty about the Second Stage, because under the Standing Orders it is necessary to move formally the Second Stage.  At the same time I wish to move the postponement of the Second Stage until October next, and I will briefly explain the position.  The Standing Orders provide a certain limit of time in which the Second Stage must be moved.  Of course, as the members of the Seanad understand, I act on behalf of the promoters in moving the Second Stage.  It is clearly desirable, and the promoters have definitely asked me, to move that this Bill be postponed until October, owing to the fact that the Government have appointed a Commission on local administration in Dublin City and County, and it is, I think, hardly desirable to go on with a Bill of this character until we know a little more as to what action that Commission is to take.  I beg formally to move that in view of the appointment of a Commission on local administration in Dublin City and County, that the Second <Col N="918" /> Reading of the Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock, Dalkey Corporation Bill, 1924, be postponed to Wednesday, 22nd October next, or, if the Seanad be not sitting on that day, on the next day thereafter on which the Seanad shall so sit.</P>

      <P>If that is possible I am quite agreeable.  It is one of those cases which have arisen for which there is no proper provision.  I am really acting on behalf of the promoters, but I am obliged to act in both capacities. I suggest that the Seanad allow me to move formally the Second Reading and then the postponement of the Second Reading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, though apparently a simple, unimportant and harmless measure, introduces a principle which should be very carefully considered by the Seanad.  I understand the object of this Bill is one with which every member of the Seanad, and probably every member of the Dáil, agrees.  It is to enable universities and medical schools here to continue to train men successfully who will be sent across or who will be able to find positions on the other side as doctors.  I am told by a leading doctor that a very large number of our students go across to the other side, and I am quite certain it is not the desire of <Col N="920" /> the Seanad, certainly it is not my desire, to do anything which will make it difficult for such students to find places.  At the same time, I think this Bill as it at present stands, is one which should not be passed.  In the first place, I am satisfied that it does not do what it is intended to do.  In the next place, even if it did, I think the principle underlying or involved in the Bill is one which it is extremely doubtful, constitutionally, we should be able to pass.  In the Bill we give powers over persons and over matters connected with the profession to a committee or body which is appointed in England, which is directly and absolutely subject to the British Parliament, and which would have to obey any law which might be passed at Westminster in spite of the fact that our Constitution provides that the Oireachtas is the only body which can pass laws for the good government of the people of Saorstát Eireann.  That being the case, it seems to me extremely doubtful whether it is right to give a body which is directly subject to another Parliament, powers which you would not give to that Parliament itself.  This Bill gives to the General Council, which, I understand, is called the General Medical Council of the United Kingdom, certain powers over medical practitioners and their customs and practices, and it gives certain lesser powers to a body called the Irish Branch Council.  Now, it seems to me that the difficulty in this matter would be met if the Bill were so amended&mdash; and I intend to raise the matter on the Committee Stage, but I am raising the general principle now&mdash;as to give the actual power to the Irish Branch Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they, in their wisdom, decide to obey an order of the General Council because it is convenient, and in the interests of the medical profession here, I am perfectly certain we will all be pleased, and will have no objection to it whatsoever.  I think a way out of it may be found.  But I would like to point out that if you give all the power that this Bill proposes to the General Council, I am not satisfied that you are giving the guarantee to future members of the medical profession <Col N="921" /> which we want to give, because you leave them absolutely at the mercy of the General Council, and if at any time they choose to make different regulations for our schools from those of the English schools there is nothing in this Bill to prevent them, and there will be no check other than new legislation. I suggest that if such a step as that were taken it would be almost impossible to get the reciprocal, friendly arrangement that I believe could be got now.  I have consulted some of my friends in the medical profession, some of the most eminent, and one prominent doctor told me that he was very doubtful, indeed, as to whether this Bill would be really satisfactory.  He stated that what was wanted was something that would carry over the temporary period until a reciprocal arrangement between the two Medical Councils could be made, which I am perfectly certain can and will be made after some time elapses, if it is made clear that the Oireachtas is not prepared to hand over complete power to a body which has no control over persons in Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is quite so, but it is my desire to keep strictly within the Standing Orders.  I have not gone into what I propose to move on the Committee Stage, which I believe will give something better.  As it stands, I think the Bill is objectionable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate that.  I have been informed that under this Bill doctors who would infringe some of the regulations will have to go to Westminster to answer their case. However, the main point I had was that I feel it would be a mistake to allow the Bill to go through the Second Stage without some protest, and on the Committee Stage I propose to move an amendment which will raise the whole <Col N="922" /> principle of the way in which it could be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to point out when you intervened, sir, that this Bill was of a temporary character.  The Minister, I think, emphasised that point in introducing it, but at a later stage, in response to a statement by a Deputy, he expressed the hope that even after the expiration of one year no change might be necessary, and that it would be merely necessary to carry on the provisions of this Bill by another short Bill.  Nobody wants to interfere with the freedom of the medical profession in deciding what Council or Society they will belong to, but I think it is desirable that statutory power should be given to the Irish Branch of this Medical Council to discharge all the functions that the General Council has hitherto discharged.  I believe that it will be within the powers of the General Council to make such arrangements as will comply with such statutory powers.  We had on the Railways Bill a suggestion that certain Boards would be recognised, and one of the objections made by the Minister was that they were people living outside the Saorstát and catering for areas outside it.  He expressed the opinion that to give them recognition would be raising a big constitutional question which, under the circumstances, it would not be desirable to raise.  The very same circumstances apply here.  The General Council, to which the Irish medical profession is attached, has members all over Great Britain and Ireland, and, nevertheless, it is to be given statutory recognition by this Bill, so that there seems to be some lack of consistency in the arguments that have been adduced on the debate during the Railways Bill, and in connection with this. Probably the Minister may have some very good line of difference to draw, but I fail to see what it is, and I should like to know where the difference is now, as compared with the position that arose in connection with the Railways Bill.</P>

      <P>I desire to support Senator Douglas's point of view in this matter.  Personally, I am very <Col N="923" /> much afraid of these temporary Bills. They have a way of becoming more permanent than we like, and as we are discussing the Second Reading of this, perhaps there is no harm in saying something about the general principle. What is really wanted is a reciprocal arrangement, as has been pointed out. This exists already between South Africa, Canada, and Great Britain, and also between certain Continental countries and Great Britain, and is provided for in the Medical Act of 1886.  Under such an arrangement the British Medical Council can register any person belonging to those countries and desiring to practise in England without his passing any examination, and on the payment of a nominal fee.  While I recognise that something has to be done of a temporary nature, I am afraid that this Bill may become permanent, and, therefore, I shall support Senator Douglas.</P>

      <P>Is not the chief object of the Bill to get something done to bridge over this difficulty which affects medical schools here more than medical practitioners?  The medical schools in Dublin are supposed to be the best in the world, because they attract to themselves the greatest doctors, and they have a great reputation.  But if the students who work in them cannot practise in any other country but Ireland, it will stop the flow of students coming in, and the schools would then disappear.</P>

      <P>I think it ought to be clearly understood that doctors are not at all agreed on this matter.  If one is to judge from some of the propaganda that is going about it would be supposed that the medical profession were unanimously in favour of the Bill. That is altogether untrue.  A certain number of them have been writing letters to the Press pointing this out.  One very eminent doctor, who was a member of the Dáil, but who retired from it, had a letter of a column and a half in the <i>Irish Statesman</i> strongly opposing it, and, as Senator Douglas has stated, a number of other doctors, whose names are very well known and <Col N="924" /> who are most influential in the profession, are also against the Bill, and think that in its present form it ought not to go through.  We are all agreed that some arrangement must be made as to the government of the medical profession and as to the future of the persons who want to go abroad and practise in England or anywhere else, but this Bill in its present shape does not meet this problem, and I, for one, shall vote against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Douglas has urged certain objections to this Bill, and he prefaced these with a very brief outline of the urgency of the matter.  The urgency is as he stated, but it is something more than that.  He stated quite vaguely that a number of our students go abroad.  Of those who obtain their medical qualifications in this country 65 per cent. do not practise in this country.  That is the normal thing.  Sixty-five per cent. practise outside the Twenty-Six Counties.  The fact that has emerged recently as regards medical practitioners is, that it was thought on this side that a certain article of the Constitution, plus the Adaptation of Enactments Act passed in the earlier period of the Dáil, did carry over the General Medical Council with its powers and with the privileges which it gave to Irish practitioners. It then became clear that, on the other side, certain action had been taken which really knocked out of gear and disturbed the whole Constitution and the whole power of the General Medical Council.  The position which then faced the medical profession in this country was that students who had thought they were registered since 1922, were, in reality, not registered, and something had to be done immediately to validate the registration of those qualified and supposed to be registered since the date of the passing of the Treaty.  It was obviously unfair that students should be deprived of their professional privileges simply because something unknown to the people here had happened on the other side, which had defeated the whole Constitution and the whole purpose of the General Medical Council which was a United Kingdom body, and which, remember, we purported to carry on in this country under the <Col N="925" /> Adaptation of Enactments Act.  It is said that in this Bill we are doing something new.  We are not.  We are simply doing by positive act, by a special piece of legislation what, it was thought, had already been done by the cumulative effect of the Constitution and the Adaptation of Enactments Act. The position, therefore, is that certain students qualified and believed to be registered since 1922 find themselves not legally registered under the General Medical Council and with no registering authority in this country to give them any power.  We are faced with a further addition of students qualified this Spring and about to qualify in the Autumn, and there is anarchy in this country with regard to the registration of medical practitioners.  There is no time to set up a separate council. There is no use in doing what Senator Douglas suggested&mdash;taking advantage of the Branch Medical Council, because whatever objections apply to the General Medical Council apply equally to the Branch Medical Council.  There are nominees of the Privy Council on one as well as on the other.  The constitution is under the Medical Acts which we purport to carry over here, and any objection urged against the General Medical Council can be urged against the Branch Irish Medical Council. Are we going to take some steps to register or validate retrospectively the qualifications of those who passed examinations since 1922, and to continue it for a year until a decent solution can be found for this problem? That is all that is required in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas urges that the General Council is directly and immediately subject to the British Parliament. That I question.  The General Medical Council is not a Government Department. It is a sort of public authority. It has been given certain rights under English legislation.  These rights have disappeared.  We are now continuing as far as we can and as far as our legislation operates, these powers in the Free State by our legislation, and the British propose this week to introduce some sort of corresponding Bill reconstituting the General Medical Council as far as they are concerned.  The General Medical Council is one of those composite bodies which will have <Col N="926" /> powers over the Free State, Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  We, on our side, say we will admit this composite body to be given certain privileges here, and to have certain rights here, and they say they will do the same with regard to Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  We say, on the other hand, the bargain is that we get representation on that General Medical Council, and that they get representation on that General Medical Council.  It is to be noted&mdash;the figures I can give later on&mdash;that whereas, according to the basis of medicals qualified over a large number of years, we would be entitled to about six per cent. representation on that General Medical Council, we have, in fact, somewhere in the neighbourhood of thirty per cent. representation.  That body which the British set up, is to be the only body to have the power to pass judgment upon the medical qualifications not merely of Saorstát doctors, but of doctors of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and on all those Colonial doctors who come in under the provisions of the 1886 Act.  We now, who are an independent country, are given, as far as British legislation can do it, power to sit on a body which will be the compulsory body to register British doctors. That is the <i>quid pro quo</i> in this instance.  They give us that right as regards their doctors, and we give them the rights over our doctors that they have over their own.  It is not right to say that this body is directly and completely subject to the British Parliament.</P>
    <P>As far as these two Bills&mdash;the British Bill to be introduced soon, and the Bill we are now passing&mdash;are concerned, that body will be completely and directly responsible under both measures. If we want to wipe out the powers of that body, we can do it by withdrawing this Bill.  It is further to be remembered, and I hold that it is the best argument&mdash;that this is to be an emergency measure, and that we are merely doing by a positive Act, by a specially directed piece of legislation, what we had purported to do by the cumulative effect of the Constitution and the existing legislation taken over under the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  It is further stated that the powers of the General Medical Council <Col N="927" /> might be altered in some way unknown to us, and that we might find ourselves left without possibly any representation on the General Medical Council, and that the Irish end or the Saorstát end of the General Medical Council might be weakened considerably, and that we would have passed a Bill, the full advantage of which might be taken away in some way later.  I am not disposed to argue here whether or not that could be done.  I do not believe it could be done.  When corresponding legislation on both sides is passed by agreement, we have to rely on the honour and honesty of the Medical Council that no changes will be made; that when they undertake to continue the General Medical Council's rights and duties for the period of a year, they will certainly not go out of their way to take anything from those powers without our consent.  Senator Douglas said: &ldquo;Why can we not get some measure which will carry over for a limited period until final legislation is arrived at?&rdquo;  He said later that it was a pity a little more time was not given. The Dáil, when I introduced this Bill, hoped to adjourn to-morrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill the doctors are given a year in which to work out a final solution.  The whole essence of this Bill is the urgency of it.  We in the Dáil had expected to rise to-morrow.  The Seanad will, I presume, rise very soon.  The British Parliament proposes, I believe, to rise somewhere in the beginning of August. If this legislation is not carried through, all our doctors since 1922 are without proper registration, and we have no registering authority in this country.  We cannot set up one in the time.  This is really carry-over legislation for a period of twelve months until the doctors have time to hammer out a final solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has been raised here, and it does definitely show up the weakness of the situation.  The position is weak to a certain extent.  Senator Douglas said disciplinary cases may arise and Irish doctors may have to go to Westminster, and their cases will be adjudicated <Col N="928" /> there.  That is quite true.  That is the thing which we are giving in to in this Bill, just as we are giving in to having a nominee of the Privy Council on this body.  If it is said that that is derogatory to our status, I admit it&mdash; certainly, for the time being.  But this is limited to a period of twelve months, and something must be done in that twelve months' period.</P>
    <P>The last clause, I think, answers the only objection Senator MacLysaght has to the Bill&mdash;that temporary Bills had a tendency to become permanent. This measure cannot become permanent without definite action by the Oireachtas.  The Bill will expire in twelve months.  The Bill says that on its passing it &ldquo;shall continue in force for twelve months thereafter and then expire.&rdquo;  The case for urgency cannot be made twelve months hence.  If it is urged then, most of the force will have gone from it.  The doctors will have had twelve months to consider the situation and to put their house in order.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell asked me where is the consistency in my attitude in objecting to the setting up of a body under the Railways Bill to have representation of an area outside our jurisdiction and setting up a body such as this.  My attitude is not completely consistent, but if I were bringing in a final Bill to set up a General Medical Council and giving it power over Saorstát doctors, then I would admit the charge the Senator has levelled against me.  But we are doing this for twelve months only, as an emergency measure. If in the end we do get full reciprocity from the British, and they say on condition that a composite and joint body be set up, you will be given these powers, and we will have these other powers given under this Bill, that is, by agreement.  Under the Railways Bill it was a case of doing something by way of a bait to the others to come along.  My answer to the Senator is that this measure is for twelve months to meet a sudden emergency, and I have no other answer than that at the moment.</P>
    <P>Colonel Moore referred to the fact that the medical profession are not unanimously in favour of this Bill.  The medical profession are almost unanimous <Col N="929" /> in holding that something must be done in the next seven days to get medical people registered and to set up some registering authority.  If any other registering authority can be set up&mdash;if Senator Moore or Senator Douglas can show me how any other authority can be set up in the next seven days and assent got to it before the British Parliament dissolves&mdash;all I can say is that I will see what can be done in the matter.  I do believe this is the only course.  It is not sure that assent will be given to certain clauses of this measure.  It has been pointed out to us that we are purporting to legislate in this Bill for England, and certain clauses are objected to.  Then I am told, here, that what we are doing is not legislating for the Free State so much as legislating to give Great Britain power in the Free State.  That is a sort of Kilkenny-cat argument.  I will let one argument swallow the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that two wrongs do not make a right, even in the case of Kilkenny cats.  I have to thank the Minister for his very full and frank statement on the question, and I think it is probably better to postpone further consideration of the points until the Committee Stage comes up.  The issue really hangs on the question as to whether the Irish Branch Council, being given the power, would not meet practically all the desires of the medical profession and meet all the points raised by the Minister without, at the same time, having a somewhat unsatisfactory principle introduced.  I further believe that one of the dangers of this Bill is that despite differences of opinion amongst the Medical Council, at the end of the year we shall find that nothing has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be regarded as such an extreme Nationalist that I am opposed to co-operative arrangements between different countries.  Exactly the opposite is my view, but I do believe that where you have arrangements of this kind the respective Parliaments should give power to their own Branch Committees, allowing them to consult and co-operate, so far as the central body is concerned.  My case <Col N="930" /> briefly is that it is our own Committee and the members of it who are subject to this Parliament and subject to its laws, and no matter how they are nominated, that is the body to which I think the powers ought to be definitely given. The Minister believes that there is no difference between the two bodies, and that any argument against the General Council is an argument against the Branch Council.  My answer to that is, that if an Act dealing with any question of the medical profession were passed through the Parliament of Westminster, it would be binding on the General Medical Council, as far as the vast majority of its members are concerned, whereas an Act passed here would not be binding on the vast majority of them.</P>

I do think the Minister has made it perfectly clear that we will do a great deal more damage, without knowing what we are about, by refusing to give a Second Reading to the Bill, than if we passed it now and discussed these matters more in detail when we come to the Committee Stage.  I have not heard a single word said that would induce me to give a vote against the Second Reading of the Bill.  Without having much knowledge of the subject, I think Senator Lady Dysart was perfectly right when she said that we would probably do much injury to a great many students who have got to a certain stage in their examinations if we refuse to give a Second Reading to the Bill.  If they are held up for another year, the Seanad may be injuring some of the most intelligent young men in the country, without gaining anything whatever for the medical profession.  I do not see why we should not pass the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Executive on this Bill, and I do not want to offer any hostile criticism of it.  I think it is a necessary Bill and a good Bill.  There are just one or two points I would like to be clear about. Section 8 of the Bill deals with the question of remuneration in regard to pensions, and I would like to know if the receipt of unemployment benefit by one of these discharged soldiers would interfere with his pension under the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say, offhand, that it would not, but I am afraid it is a law point.  It was not intended that it should interfere.  I take unemployment benefit to mean £1 per week.  If the Senator looks at the schedule he will find that £100 is the initial sum in respect of which deduction is made.  It starts them with a deduction of 5 per cent. of the pension. In any case, whatever deduction would be made it would be in respect of the pension it would be made, and not in respect of whatever benefit one would derive either from employment under a local authority or under the Government. A man at present in receipt of, let us say, £100 per year, would be entitled under this Act to £60 a year.  The deduction is in respect of the £60.  He still retains his full salary.</P>

      <P>I would like to know what is the implication of Section 4 (1) which reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may with the sanction of the Minister for Finance and subject to the provisions of this Act grant to any person to whom the Minister shall have granted a certificate of military service under this Act a military service pension commencing as from the first day of October, 1924, or the day of his discharge from the National Forces or the Defence Forces of Saorstát <Col N="932" /> Eireann, whichever of those days shall be the later, provided however that no person shall receive any such military service pension unless money for the payment of such military service pension shall have been voted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I understand that the moneys will be voted by the Oireachtas, but does it mean that at any stage the Oireachtas may discontinue any pension, or will the pensions of each individual be open to discussion on each occasion on which the Vote is discussed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It would mean that the Oireachtas would have to pass money each year in respect of this service and in respect of any liability that the State is under, under this Bill.  As to the other matter mentioned, &ldquo;whichever of those days shall be the later,&rdquo; refers to officers and men at present serving in the Army&mdash;that they would be able on leaving the Army to make application for a pension if they were so entitled.  It was considered that unless that section were put in, the Bill would apply only to those who were at present out of the Army, and that, in consequence, men who are at present serving might elect to leave the Army in order to get the benefit of the Bill.  It was considered fair that it should not only refer to those who had resigned or had been demobilised, but that it should apply in respect of persons who are at present serving.</P>

      <P>Yes, but there are conditional periods.  There must be pre-Truce service and there must be service in the National Forces.  Granted these conditions, every man in the Army maintains his claim.  But he will not get the pension while serving in the Army.  He is entitled on demobilisation or resignation to make a claim.  Claims are conditional upon (1)  pre-Truce service in certain periods, (2) service in National Forces or Defence Forces since 1st July, 1922.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask what is the position of a man whose case has been brought to my notice.  He is a Technical Instructor with nearly ten years' service.  He resigned his position on a County Council which recognised the old L.G.B., and went to the Limerick Corporation, which refused to recognise that Board, and was carrying on his technical instruction work under a grant from Dáil Eireann.  In 1920 his services were dispensed with because of military necessities, the school being taken over by the British military.  By resigning his original position under the old British L.G.B., he seems to have sacrificed his legal right to a pension.  From a moral point of view the Government would hardly think that, as he had resigned to take up a post under a body financed and approved by Dáil Eireann.  As those who actually worked under the old Local Government Board and resigned because the Limerick Corporation refused to recognise that Board are getting pensions under this Bill, it would seem rather unjust to this man if he were left without a pension.  At present I understand he has a temporary post in a Government Department, but his applications to be placed on the established staff have been repeatedly refused, notwithstanding promises made to him to that extent.  I would like to know from the President if it is possible to meet a case of that kind.  He is in a very precarious position, because he may be dismissed at any moment, and he gets no pension under this Bill, while people who acted in a more selfish or less patriotic manner are fully protected under the Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask if the President would explain on what principle the people mentioned in this Bill have been selected.  I know some <Col N="934" /> of the people in the West of Ireland who are put down here for pensions for life, while others whom I know have suffered at least equally and have got nothing.  I do not wish to go into personal questions, but I am puzzled to know on what principle these people are selected, while others who have suffered equally are getting nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain how this particular matter has arisen.  It is well known that in the year 1920 a conflict arose between what has come to be described in this country as the British Local Government Board, functioning at the Custom House, and the local authorities throughout the country.  As a result of the conflict, certain officials refused to obey the instructions of the Dáil Department of Local Government or of their local authorities.  In consequence a number of them either resigned or were dismissed.  The British Local Government Board fixed the pensions of those who resigned or were dismissed under either Section 8 or Section 10 of the Act of 1919.  That particular Act was a Criminal and Malicious Act, but its main clause dealt with the rights of these officials of local authorities.  The rights were put forward by representatives of these officials about 1919, immediately prior to the Local Government elections which took place in January, 1920, and May, 1920.  These officials had apprehensions that if the new councils were of the same political complexion as those returned at the General Election of 1918 their rights would be prejudiced and their offices might be terminated. In order to safeguard them a clause was put in entitling any officer of a local authority who resigned with the sanction of the Local Government Board to have a pension fixed for him by that Board, with an addition to his service of whatever number of years the Local Government Board thought fit up to forty years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the majority of cases dealt with here the officials are going out with two-thirds of their salaries and emoluments. In respect of those who have less than ten years' service, it was arranged that they would get, I think, <Col N="935" /> up to five years' purchase of their annual salary and emoluments as a maximum sum, which would run somewhat like this: one year for each year's service, and a half-year for every subsequent year of service, making in all not more than five years' purchase.  A number of these officials, whose names are in the Schedule, were dismissed or resigned, and had their pensions fixed by the Local Government Board.  The local authorities refused to pay the pensions in the majority of cases, and, after the Treaty was signed, when negotiations took place between the Provisional Government of the time and the British Government with regard to grants withheld, the British Government generously restored all the money that had been withheld from local authorities, or which had been spent by that Government in paying decrees that had been obtained by persons under the Malicious Injury Act. As far as the local authorities were concerned in respect of the period from 1920 up to the date of the signing of the Treaty, they came out of the war&mdash;if it can be called such&mdash;without the loss of a single penny.  All their money was restored.</P>
    <P>At the negotiations the British Government put it up to the representatives of the Provisional Government that we should discharge our obligations to the officials who had resigned, or who had been dismissed, and to whom pensions had been awarded by the Local Government Board of the time.  We undertook to discharge these obligations, and for the past two years we have put it up to the local authorities that they should discharge these obligations.  In some cases they did so, but in other cases they objected. In the cases in which they did, they accepted the bargain we had made, just as they accepted the money we got back for them.  In other cases they objected.  I must say there was some reason for the objection, because in certain areas the burden which would have been placed upon local authorities by reason of this agreement was much greater than it was in other cases.  I think it will be observed from the Schedule that certain counties <Col N="936" /> escaped altogether, and they were in the struggle to keep their money safe just as much as any other county.  In other counties the amount is very large, and I should say, to the credit of the Dublin Corporation, that although the amount is very considerable they undertook to discharge their liabilities and actually did so in the cases referred to.  Others did not.  An agitation sprung up, and we came to the conclusion that this was properly a national charge.  It has been spread now over the entire country.</P>
    <P>During the period that these moneys were being disbursed, some in respect of decrees and some in respect of other liabilities, the Local Taxation Account got very much complicated.  An official of the Local Government Board, who had experience of auditing, was directed to regulate this particular Fund. With characteristic financial perspicacity he lodged the whole of the sum available on deposit receipt, and, as a result, £20,000 or £30,000 was earned in interest.  In respect of that interest there is no proper claimant, and we are disposing of it in this manner, by paying some of these liabilities and apportioning the liability in respect of the remainder over the whole of the Local Taxation Account, so that no part of the country can say it is bearing more than its own share.  I think that is rather a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>What appeared for a long time to be a difficulty has been arranged.  With regard to the case mentioned by Senator O'Farrell, I admit that there is a hardship there, but the circumstances were a little different to what I have described.  About 1918 an official was appointed by the Limerick Technical Committee to the position of head of the Technical Institute.  This official had been engaged in some operations against the Government of the time, and his appointment would not be sanctioned.  The Technical Committee adhered to the appointment, and the result was the Department refused to furnish moneys.  Subsequently members of the Corporation came before Dáil Eireann and explained that this was a case where a man had served his country and would not be sanctioned.  They <Col N="937" /> asked for some money to enable them to carry on the schools so that they might not be placed in what they considered would be the humiliating position of having to annul the appointment and appoint another person. About £2,000 was given by Dáil Eireann to enable the Corporation to carry on the schools.  As will be seen by the Bill, a number of the officials resigned and asked to have their pensions fixed. Other officials remained on, but in the case mentioned by Senator O'Farrell the man actually resigned his appointment, I think in Sligo, and came down and took up duty under the Limerick Technical Committee.  After some twelve months difficulties also arose there.  A scheme was not put up, I think, within twelve months or two years, to Dáil Eireann to carry on the work of the technical institute, and this man, with the other officials who remained loyal to the local authority, found himself in the position of having no occupation.  He is now in the service of the Government.  I do not know that the Government can be charged with having let him down.  If a promise was made to him that he would be made permanent, I believe it was made by some person who had no authority to make it.  If he has a case against the Limerick Technical Instruction Committee or the Government, it is a case in which I think some of the responsibility must rest upon himself. Officials like him have done nothing. The officials mentioned in the Bill have done something&mdash;they have made my life very uncomfortable for a considerable period, I should say from 1920&mdash; and now they have achieved some purpose. They did something positive, but this man and the others affected have done nothing.  I do not know if they have applied even to the Local Government Department or the Department of Agriculture to see that justice would be done to them.  Unless they make a move in that direction, I do not think they can call upon me to sponsor them.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are carrying out the pledge that the representatives of the Provisional Government gave to the British Government in good faith.  The British Government discharged their liabilities, and although belated we are <Col N="938" /> discharging ours.  A question may arise in connection with the pensions granted, that they were exorbitant. Some of the officials mentioned in the schedule had only twelve, fourteen, or sixteen years' service, and, I think, with one exception, the Local Government Board of the time, which was the authority responsible for fixing the pensions, added a sufficient number of years to make the period up to forty years.  In our negotiations with the British we put it to them that that was an extravagance which we ought not be called upon to bear.  The British Government undertook to bear any sum which a committee we have set up considers is in excess of the amounts that should be equitably awarded. With that explanation I hope that the Seanad will be satisfied that we have done our duty in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Motion, there is a matter in connection with this Bill that I desire to raise even though the Bill is now in its final stage. The Greater Dublin Reconstruction Commission were considering, some days ago, the question of getting expert evidence before them that might be considered necessary to enable them to arrive at a true and useful finding. They found it was not in the power of a Commission appointed by the Oireachtas to subpoena witnesses before them.  It was suggested at the Commission that in this Bill, which is now about to pass, there might be inserted a provision giving power to the Commissions appointed by the Oireachtas to subpoena witnesses and administer oaths just the same as can be done by a Committee of the Oireachtas itself or in a court of justice.  At that time the Commission was not aware that the Bill had reached its Fifth Stage, and I do not know whether the sponsor of this Bill will be able to make any statement in connection with the matter or whether this insertion could not be made in the Dáil seeing the Bill was initiated here and is going to the other House.  It might be possible to insert a provision to the effect I have described in the Bill when it goes to the Dáil unless it raises too big a question with regard to the calling of evidence and so forth.  I would like to know from Senator Douglas, who sponsored the Bill here, whether he is able to say that it would be possible to insert such a provision and whether it would come within the Preamble of the Bill to insert such a provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a matter of some doubt whether the Preamble of the Bill, as it stands, would open it to a provision such as is suggested by <Col N="940" /> Senator O'Farrell.  Apart from that, I think there are excellent reasons why in this Bill no such provision should be made.  I may say that this matter, as well as some other matters of a kindred character, were considered by the Committee, at least they were taken up by some members of the Committee.  There is a strong feeling on the Joint Committee that this is one of the matters that will have to be dealt with in a later Bill, but that it will have to be dealt with after very careful consideration. I would like to point out in connection with this Greater Dublin Reconstruction Commission that even if this provision that is suggested were inserted in this Bill it is very doubtful if it would apply to this Commission, which is not composed of a joint committee of both Houses.  It is a very doubtful question whether a Commission appointed by the Government could have power to subpoena witnesses, and it is an even larger question than the question of the powers of a Committee of both Houses to get the attendance of witnesses.  The feeling of the Committee, and I may say also of the Parliamentary draftsman, is that we require some large and perhaps intricate Act dealing with the question of the privileges of members and their rights and the privileges of committees and their rights, and this question of the right to subpoena witnesses before committees will have to be dealt with in such a Bill.  One of the reasons why we brought this Bill in in this simple form was because we had the assurance of the Attorney-General and of the Parliamentary draftsman that they are going to consider this matter in the autumn and to bring in a larger Bill dealing with this whole question.  You cannot simply put a clause in a Bill of this character giving power to subpoena witnesses unless you put in some restriction as to the conditions under which witnesses may be expected or may be forced to attend. You cannot give, I think, to every member of either House the right to bring before any committee any witness that he wants, and this is a matter that requires a considerable amount of care.  I give that as an instance of the difficulty of the matter.  For my part, I hope, while I have no doubt it <Col N="941" /> is a matter for the Chairman of the other House to decide whether a provision of this kind should be allowed in under the Preamble to the Bill, that no attempt will be made to bring in such a large question into this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. SIGERSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of the Seanad it is urgent that the Government shall take effective measures this year to promote the re-afforestation of Ireland in order to stimulate rural industry and to increase the production of fuel and fruit and of timber for wood-workers, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This project comes also to meet the demand for employment.  There is ample opportunity and great urgency for this measure, because first with regard to fuel, this country is subject to a wet period during which the ordinary fuel of the country, peat, is injured. Now the rain which injures the peat fuel would increase the growth of the wood fuel.  Then, besides, let it be remembered that all over the Continent nations subsist largely upon the effects of wood fuel.  In France, Spain, Italy, Germany and elsewhere, wood is the common fuel.  In Ireland that also should be the case.  In ancient times Ireland was &ldquo;an island of woods,&rdquo; and was well wooded, but subsequently the invaders destroyed these woods partly owing to exploitation by adventurers, who sold the wood as staves to England and made fortunes from the ruin of the forests of Ireland.  All the fuel would appear not merely in the form of sectional pieces of branches and of young trees but also in the form of charcoal, of which large quantities are furnished, for instance, in France and elsewhere, to the cities, and as a consequence the air of these cities is clearer than that of those which burn only coal, and, therefore, more healthy.  In the woods, such as in the Black <Col N="942" /> Forest of Germany and in the woods of Norway, local industries are carried on.  Wooden toys are made in the houses of dwellers in the woods, and in Norway a great output of artistic wooden utensils takes place.  These things, if made, would succeed in Ireland, for of old the Irish were famous for their woodwork, and Irish emigrants to foreign countries, such as to France, carried with them that power and Irish woodwork was famous all over the Continent.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the next point, that is fruit-growing, that has been strangely neglected all over this country. In some counties, such as Kilkenny and Wexford, there has been a temporary improvement within recent years, but it has been very little encouraged in other parts.  There are large portions of the country well fitted for the growth of fruit trees, but they are totally neglected.  With the growing of fruit I would include also such articles as nuts and so forth, to which portions of the South of France are largely given up, and to which large portions of Ireland might with profit be adapted.  Not only should we consider fruit as valuable for man, but also as valuable for birds.  On the Taurus Mountains I was struck with the rowan trees on the roads and on the hillsides, which I was informed were specially for providing fruit for the birds, and that was not merely to feed the birds out of philanthropic notions, but to prevent them from preying upon the crops. That was a matter of good economy and should not be neglected in this country.  I have opened the craws of wild pigeons, and I have found them completely filled with fruit from those weeds instead of with corn.  The wild pigeons in the woods near Bordeaux, which are treated as articles of commerce, find their food in the woods and in the neighbouring hills there.  Then again you have to choose the right kind of trees because certain trees are more suitable for fuel than others.  Then there are the great pine forests which furnish in certain cases turpentine and that not merely by bleeding the trees, as is generally done, but by driving steam through them, as is done in the forest near Bordeaux.  Formerly that territory was largely a waste, and the <Col N="943" /> population generally had to go on stilts because the soil was not serviceable for pedestrianism.  Now these places are sandy, and there are sand-hills which are still called dunes, where the sand blew inland and covered the wastes.  I have been there and found that that is all completely reformed and that the sandy hills are changed and grow furze and small bush plants, and on other grounds, they grow pines and trees of that sort.</P>
    <P>You have there flourishing forests which were formerly nothing but waste.  It may be of interest to know that in these forests there is a compliment to Ireland, because there are vast avenues cut through them in order to prevent any fire from running through the woods, and one avenue receives the name of Avenue Corrigan from the late Sir Dominick Corrigan, an Irishman of note abroad as well as at home. These woods now flourish where, as I say, there was complete waste.  I think there should be some effort made to test the possibility of growing certain medicinal herbs and trees in this country besides what nature provides, and nature has provided a number of very important ones, such as the <i>digitalis</i>, which are not used in this country.  We buy from foreign lands what we might grow and use at home. There is the eucalyptus tree, known as an Australian tree, growing in the Campagna at Rome for the purposes of sanitation, and I have seen it growing in the demesne of the late Mr. Richard Mahony at Dromore, near Kenmare. It flourished there in the winters which sometimes killed it elsewhere.  In ancient times every physician had his <i>lúb-gortín</i> or herb garden.  Medicinal herbs were cultivated throughout the country and were known, but now, of course, chemistry has superseded the cruder products by obtaining the minuter alkaloids and the essential medicinal ingredients and they have become more advantageous and more acceptable.  That could be done by science in Ireland.  That nearly concludes all I have to say upon this subject with this exception, that it is, I think, extremely important that effective measures should be taken this year to prepare and plant such forests.  I <Col N="944" /> have seen in the North of Ireland in Innishowen, on the Swilly side, large tracts of sand such as I have seen near the Gulf of Gascony.  I have also seen them on the west coast of Donegal and Connaught, notably in the Louisburgh peninsula from Clew Bay to the Killeries and also off the coast of Kerry at Inny strand.  There are large tracts of sand there, of which we have some specimens not far off, which might be cultivated quite as well as the sands on the Gulf of Gascony or in the Bay of Biscay in the South of Bordeaux.  If this is left over for this year it means the loss of another complete year and, perhaps, the loss of two years.  Therefore I would suggest that the Seanad do accept this motion and declare that it is considered urgent that such measures to promote the replantation of Ireland shall be taken this year.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion.  I think one of the most dreary characteristics of the greater part of the Irish countryside is the almost treeless character of the landscape. This is particularly true of the parts of the West of Ireland like Connemara where the land is eminently fitted for forestry.  In the wooded areas, the position has become exceedingly disimproved since the war.  The scarcity of timber, particularly imported timber, and the high prices obtained for it, caused a wholesale onslaught to be made on the woods in this country.  In Connemara something amounting to vandalism has taken place in the cutting down of trees and nobody seems to bother to plant trees in the place of those cut down.  The Ackland Committee appointed by the British Government in 1917 on afforestation gave a series of interesting figures one series of which went to show that Ireland was the worst wooded country in Western Europe.  In England and Wales the percentage of the total area under wood was 5.1, in Scotland, 4.5, in Sweden, 47.6, in Russia, 37, in the German Empire, 25.9, Norway, 21, France, 18.2, Belgium, 17.7, Denmark, 6.3, Portugal, 3.5, and Ireland, 1.4. Only 1.4 of the total area is under timber in Ireland, and that notwithstanding <Col N="945" /> the fact that there is so much waste land and moorland, eminently suitable for forestry.  The effect of forests upon the appearance of the country as compared with stretches of barren land is incomparable.  Their effect upon the climate is very great as Senator Dr. Sigerson pointed out some time ago, and their effect upon the national wealth of the country is something that could hardly be calculated. This was found with great effect during the period of the war when it was so difficult to get imported timber particularly owing to the submarine peril and the huge demand there was for timber during the war. At present there is a growing demand for timber per head of the population. In 1851 the normal demand for timber was 3.5 feet per head of the population per annum, and in 1911 it had grown to 10.5 feet per head of the population per annum.  That with a growing population makes it necessary that the world's supplies of timber should be on the increase.  The war had its effect upon the forests in Norway, Sweden and Russia just as here. There was a great demand for timber, prices were high and labour was somewhat scarce while very little discrimination was used in the destruction of these forests so that it will take a considerable time before they are back to their pre-war value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the timber required in Great Britain and Ireland eight per cent. is found at home and 92 per cent. has to be imported.  More is imported from Russia than all the other countries combined. If chaos obtained in Russia it is inevitable that the timber supply in this country would be affected.  The Committee, in 1917, to which I have referred, recommended that efforts should be made to improve the forests. They pointed out that whereas the forests in Great Britain and Ireland produce 15 cubic feet of timber, Russia produced 53 cubic feet, and Baden produced 90 cubic feet, showing that Irish and British forests are inferior to other European forests.  That Committee also recommended that the State should look after this question of afforestation. Here is one extract from the report: &ldquo;It has only been within the last few years that forestry education has advanced <Col N="946" /> sufficiently to impress on owners the advantages of modern methods.  In this respect the absence of well-managed State forests has proved a great drawback, since the private owner has had no ideal towards which to work and has had to seek abroad his information on scientific management.&rdquo; Speaking of the improvement effected in the forests of Dean and Tintern since they have been taken over by the State, the report adds: &ldquo;A visit to the woods which we have referred to should go a long way to disarm the criticism of those who doubt the ability of the State to conduct successful schemes of afforestation or provide effective management.&rdquo;  If that is the case in Great Britain, I think it should be also the position here.  There is no very great incentive for the private individual to embark on afforestation, because the income on it is very distant, and, as is stated in the report, he has no particular ideal to work for.  The Irish farmer has certainly very few ideals in this respect.  I know that where a few trees did exist, they were cut down to make ladder poles or firewood, or were thrown into gaps.  Far from the number of trees being increased, I believe in recent years they have been considerably reduced.  In the estimate of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I was pleased to learn that something like 40,000 trees had been planted during the last year.  This is a large number, but it is negligible as compared with the requirements, and I sincerely hope that the Minister, whose functions it will be to deal with this matter, will deal with it quickly, as has been asked for by the mover of the motion.</P>

      <P>With reference to Senator O'Farrell's remark about the planting of 40,000 trees, as contractor for two counties, Clare and Tipperary, I may say that a quarter of a million trees were planted there each year.  Compared with that, the planting of 40,000 is negligible.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Farrell has pointed out that the forests are decreasing. They are decreasing to my knowledge, and have been for a number of years.  Practically all the forests of Ireland have been planted by <Col N="947" /> large landowners in former times.  They may have been accused of many iniquities, but one of the things the landowners did do was to plant the trees. When they sold their lands the trees were cut down and not re-planted. That was to a great extent the fault of the State.  When the State purchased an estate to divide up amongst the people, instead of preserving the lands, they would give no price for the trees. When the landowner asked the officials how much he would get for the trees, the answer was, &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;  They thought land was more valuable without <Col N="948" /> the trees.  What happened then was that the owner naturally cut down the trees before he sold his land, and sold them himself.  Where he did not do that, I have seen the people near-by deliberately, for fear anybody else would take them from them, go round and ring the trees so that they would be no use.  It is protection as much as planting that is required&mdash;protection of all trees.  Going down to any of the stations in the West of Ireland, you will see piles and piles of trees being taken away.</P>

    <P>I understand that under those Acts, quoted in the resolution, it is possible that the powers given under the Electricity Commissioners (Transfer of Functions) Order, 1924, give power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Electricity Acts to make an Order empowering local districts and other bodies to create an electrical supply in their districts.  It is because an Order has been made under those Acts by the Minister that I propose this resolution.  I understand it is urgent in the matter of Thurles, because a certain amount of employment would have been given but for the delay.  I may mention that I am informed that in this Order and in the other Orders, concerning which I have further resolutions to move, the provision has been inserted that if any central or national supply shall take place these towns will be obliged to take electricity from the national supply providing that it is given at a cost not exceeding that at which it is able to be made locally.  None of those orders will be taken in any way as interfering with any national scheme that might possibly take place in the future.</P>

    <P>I understand that this order is somewhat different in its character to the last, owing to the fact that it is really the extension of an order obtained by the Blackrock Urban District Council in 1921, through the British Parliament. While they do not intend at the present time to carry out the order, it is considered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the order should be maintained in force because if it was allowed to lapse it would mean a very considerable expense to the ratepayers of that district if they had to seek powers again later on.  That is the case for the order.</P>

      <P>There may be some misunderstanding about this matter, and I should say that the reason for the postponement is certainly not, on my part, or on the part of the members of the Committee, any desire to postpone <Col N="951" /> a decision on the matter indefinitely. It is due to the fact, as the report points out, that it is not simply a question of saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  It is a matter for reasoned discussion, and it cannot be dealt with hastily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I think it is quite right that we should look at this matter carefully.  It is because Senator Douglas speaks as he has spoken that I think the Seanad should postpone the matter.  If you look at the report you will see that undoubtedly the report does ask the Oireachtas to deal with the matter, and unless it was the Chairman of the Committee who had recommended that the Seanad should not deal with it now, I do not think we should put it on one side as hastily as we seem to do.  But when the Chairman of the Committee tells us that it requires consideration, we all see, of course, that at this late date in the Session we cannot give it the consideration that it requires, and that, therefore, it may be wise to postpone it.  I do not think, however, that we should lose sight of the fact that the Oireachtas has got to make up its mind upon this subject, and that that has been stated clearly in the report; and, if we are to postpone it, it should not be for an indefinite period and we should have an assurance that the matter is going to be brought before the Oireachtas when it does meet again, and that the Oireachtas should then be in a position to give its opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present state of affairs is most undoubtedly, extremely unsatisfactory, and it is a situation which the Oireachtas should make up its mind to deal with and decide on one way or the other.  It would be quite wrong for either the Seanad or the Dáil to decline to do so and to leave the matter in its present most unsatisfactory position.  Of course if it is clearly understood that we are acting as we are only because of the late period of the Session and that we have not now time to go into the matter, and that we are not expressing in any way the opinion that the Seanad should not deal with it and should not have it brought up properly as soon as possible when time can be given to <Col N="952" /> its consideration, then I think Senator Douglas' idea that we should postpone it is perfectly correct, but only on that understanding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad of what Senator Jameson has said.  I should have mentioned one point and it is this: that provided the matter is dealt with promptly when we reassemble there will be no actual delay because no committee could meet in the meantime; and it is with the knowledge that although there has been a good deal of regrettable delay in the consideration of the matter a postponement now will not involve any additional delay that I propose that the consideration of the Report should be adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may be allowed to emphasise the fact that this matter cannot be indefinitely postponed.  In view of our Standing Orders it is essential that at some early date, at any rate, a decision one way or the other should be arrived at by the Oireachtas in reference to these Bills, because they are standing on record at present and it would be the duty of the Committee as well as of members of this House to see that opportunities are given for their discussion. Therefore this motion is for a mere temporary postponement, because it is perfectly plain that when we reassemble a decision one way or the other will have to be given by both Houses as to what is to be the future of these Bills.</P>

      <P>Before we adjourn, I wish to mention I have been informed by the President that he expects to get the Appropriation Bill passed in the Dáil to-morrow, and he is then moving the adjournment of the Dáil until the 1st August, when it is supposed, and hoped, that all the Bills will have been dealt with by us, and in so far as they have to be again considered by the Dáil, they can be considered on that date.  That raises the question as to what date the Seanad would like to fix for the discussion of the Appropriation Bill, which is practically all the business that will be left to us, because in regard to the other Bills those of them that were in any way contentious are not to be sent up to us until October.  I refer to the Local Government Bill, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, the Dairy Produce Bill, and the Live Stock Breeding Bill. There are two other Bills, the State Harbours Bill and the Drainage Maintenance Bill, which will pass through the Dáil to-day, and then there is one other Bill, the State Lands Bill, which it is hoped will pass through the Dáil to-morrow.  I want the views of Senators as to what date they would like to be fixed for the discussion by this House of the Appropriation Bill. It will be very inconvenient for the President, who is very anxious to be here when the Bill is being discussed, if this is not taken before Wednesday <Col N="954" /> next.  It would be open to the House, if they are prepared to do it, to sit on Saturday next for the purpose of discussing this Appropriation Bill, or Monday, or Tuesday, Saturday or Monday preferably for the convenience of the President.</P>

      <P>Many members have regarded Wednesday as the day for starting our week.  That is, more or <Col N="955" /> less, a fixed day, and Senators make arrangements to be elsewhere during the earlier part of the week to do some of their business.</P>

      <P>We make no change by adjourning now until Saturday.  It is part of our present week's sittings.  It would be a little out of our usual course to sit on Monday, but when you are approaching the end of a session, as you are doing here, formal and regular procedure has to be modified to meet the situation.</P>

      <P>There is another matter to which I wish to direct the attention of the Seanad.  I think we ought to realise the necessity of securing suitable and decent accommodation now that the entire of Leinster House is to be taken over for the accommodation of the Oireachtas. I think we ought to be alive to our needs and our rights in regard to that matter.  We have an existing Joint Committee to look after the internal arrangements, and later on I think it would be desirable that that Committee should undertake the task of allocating the particular apartments that may be given to us under the new arrangement. I would suggest to the Seanad to consider, between this and Monday, whether, in regard to the actual allocation of premises, it would not be desirable that a small special committee should be appointed, and that it should be a joint committee.  In other words, that we should appoint our representative upon a joint committee and ask the Dáil to unite with us in appointing their representatives on such a joint committee.  That is a matter that might be considered between this and Monday.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what you have said, I happen to be a member of the Joint House Committee, and we had a meeting this morning after our inspection of the rooms.  We were informed by the Chairman of that Committee that there is little possibility of the Dublin Society being able to give us possession of these premises on this side of Christmas, and it is, therefore, rather premature to discuss the allocation of premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not proposing to discuss the allocation at all, but I think we should be prepared beforehand and have a small committee which would be there on the spot when the occasion arises, and before any conclusions are arrived at.</P>
