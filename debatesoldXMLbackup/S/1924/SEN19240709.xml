      <P>I beg leave to introduce a Bill to enable each of the Houses of the Oireachtas and any Committee of either House, and any Joint Committee of both House, to administer oaths to witnesses.  I might briefly state that this Bill is being introduced on behalf of the Joint Committee on Standing Orders for Private Business. It was found by them that the existing legislation dealing with the administering of oaths and affirmations to witnesses before Committees examining into Private Bills was not applicable to Committees appointed by the Dáil or the Seanad or by both Houses.  Consequently, Senator Brown kindly drafted the Bill which has been approved by the Attorney-General and which I am now asking leave to introduce. Perhaps I might remind Senators that of course a Bill is not printed or circulated until leave has been given to introduce it.  If leave is now given the Bill will be circulated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg leave to introduce a Bill to make provision for the awarding of costs in proceedings in relation to Private Bills before either House of the Oireachtas or a Committee of either such House or a Joint Committee of both such Houses, and for the taxation of such costs.  The remarks I made in regard to the previous Bill apply also to this Bill.  I should also like to state that we consulted both the Attorney-General, and the Parliamentary draftsmen, and it was deemed desirable to introduce this Bill as a temporary Bill in order to adapt and to apply to the Saorstát the code of British Acts which deal with Private Bill Procedure.  A number of questions have arisen, and the Committee were acting on the procedure as it has been adopted, but for which it is doubtful if there is proper legal sanction. It is essential that a Bill of this character should be passed, particularly before the three Bills dealing with electricity supply are examined in the autumn.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of the Attorney-General, at the request of the Joint Committee on Private Business, to introduce at a later stage a Bill which will set up some different procedure, in some respects, to that which has been adopted at Westminster and which will really repeal this Bill which I am now asking leave to introduce.  I think it will be reasonably obvious to Senators that it would take considerable time and care to draft and prepare a Bill dealing with all the intricate questions affecting Private Business. We felt that the best thing to do was to adopt the existing procedure, which is known to solicitors and others, and carry that on for the next autumn. The Acts which require to be applied and which will be dealt with in the Bill are:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Immediately before Section 7 to insert a new Section 7 as follows&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>7.&mdash;Paragraph (c) of the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the Principal Act (which relates to failure to fulfil the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit) shall be amended by the addition at the end thereof of the words&mdash;&ldquo;or at a rate of wage which, having regard to the duration of the employment offered and the <Col N="682" /> cost and inconvenience of travelling or removal to the district, would not constitute a reasonable recompense.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of the amendment is this: In the principal Act men in receipt of unemployment benefit here who were offered employment in another district and refused to accept employment in another district were disqualified from receiving benefits.  This amendment is not put forward in the interests of people not prepared to work.  The amendment is put forward to protect the ordinary worker who is unemployed through no fault of his own from being disqualified from benefit for refusing to accept work in places where it would not be worth his while to do so.  The point is this: a person unemployed and in receipt of unemployment benefit when his claim is accepted might be offered employment in another district at wages that would not pay the worker to go there.  I will admit that for years there was an unwritten law or procedure acted on by the officials who administered the Unemployment Insurance Act that, generally speaking, married men with families were not disqualified from benefits because of their refusal to travel to employment which they were offered elsewhere, and that portion of the Act was fairly well administered without prejudice to the workers.  A new departure was created some months ago when members of the building trade in Dublin were offered employment in another district at rates much below rates which were paid in Dublin.  The men would have to pay their own train fares, and they had no guarantee that the employment would be of any duration. They refused to accept such employment, and their claims for benefit were disallowed and they were disqualified.</P>
    <P>With regard to that particular incident the employment that was offered was in Dundalk, where the rate of wages was at least 12s. less than the rates that had been paid here. In addition, the men were expected to pay their own fares going there, and they would have to pay their fares back again when the job was finished. The position in regard to unemployed men travelling to these districts made <Col N="683" /> it pretty awkward.  In the first place men having families in Dublin and keeping houses in Dublin, could not bring their families to the place of their work.  The usual procedure in the case of men sent by contractors to country districts to work is, that they are paid the Dublin rates of wages, plus an additional allowance for country money to meet their lodging expenses. Their train fares are paid when sent to a job and when returning, but in this case, where employment is offered through the Labour Exchange, it was made known that the men would have to go at a wage lower than Dublin, and would have to pay their own fares to the district.  These men would have to keep their homes in Dublin and their families in Dublin, and consequently the thing was not worth while.  They would have to make two divisions of their reduced wages, and it is not fair to expect them to accept employment under these conditions. The object of my amendment is that the principal Act would be amended so that men would not be compelled to go to jobs under these conditions, and that if they refused to do so, they should not be disqualified from receiving benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>It varies in certain districts.  In some districts the wages are 25s. below the Dublin rate, and the point is when a man pays his board, which cannot be got for less than 30s. a week nowadays, it is not worth his while to go.  He has not sufficient left to give anything to his family.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>On this amendment possibly I may be able to satisfy Senator Mrs. Wyse Power <Col N="684" /> without going into the detailed figures which she has asked for.  This amendment was before the Dáil in the Committee Stage of this Bill, and was there rejected, but was to be brought on on Report Stage if sufficient examples were provided me by Deputy Johnson, who raised the point, to show that there was considerable hardship in the actual working out of the Unemployment Insurance Act.  When the matter was raised again on Report Stage, I myself called attention to the fact that no amendment had been introduced, and I pointed out that I was up to that period without any example showing hardships, and Deputy Johnson said that before the Bill came to the Seanad he would provide me with cases of hardship, and these cases I am still without.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the amendment was proposed in the Dáil it was argued in this way; that there was a clause in the main Act which seemed fair upon the face of it and which had been fairly worked up to recently&mdash;I think this is the contention&mdash;but that for some time past it is worked in a particular way, and the result of that working was that men were offered employment which it would be quite profitless for them to take.  They are then considered to have refused suitable employment, and they are precluded from the benefit of the Unemployment Insurance Act&mdash; that is the contention.  My advice is quite to the contrary, that the Act has been so far worked that the majority of the cases decided by an umpire and referee are in accordance with what is now moved.  It is not considered advisable to accept this amendment for two reasons.  First, that it would do away with a reasonable amount of elasticity, which we think should be left to those who administer the Act, particularly when the final court of appeal is an individual who is apart from the employer, employees or the Ministry; there is an independent arbitrator. And the second thing is that, apart from the case urged, there does seem to me to lurk in this amendment a definite enlargement of the right to benefit, and it was not considered that such enlargement to the right to benefit <Col N="685" /> should take place in a Bill which is admittedly a very provisional and temporary one, drawn up simply to tide over the exceptional circumstances in the present time.  If there is going to be an enlargement of the right to benefit, that right to so enlarge can be argued when a more permanent measure takes the place of this admittedly temporary one.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Wyse Power asked with regard to the conditions.  Section 7 of the Principal Act of 1920, lays down the conditions, and this amendment is to proviso (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 7.  Section 7 lays down generally the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit by an insured person. There are five conditions.  Twelve contributions shall have to be paid for him, but that disappears under the present Act.  The applicant for benefit must apply in the prescribed manner; he must prove that he is capable of and available for work, but unable to obtain suitable employment; there is a provision that he has not exhausted his right to unemployment benefit; and there is a further provision that if he has been required to attend at a course of instruction that he duly attended in accordance with the requirement.  The main thing is that he is &ldquo;capable of and available for work, but unable to obtain suitable employment.&rdquo; There is, however, a limitation of that:</P>
    <P>A person shall not be deemed to have failed to fulfil the statutory condition by reason only that he has declined&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an offer of employment in a situation vacant in consequence of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute; or</P>
    <P>(b)  an offer of employment in the district where he was last ordinarily employed at a rate of wage lower, or on conditions less favourable than those which he habitually obtained in his usual employment in that district, or would have obtained had he continued to be so employed; or</P>
    <P>(c)  an offer of employment in any other district at a rate of wage lower or on conditions less favourable <Col N="686" /> than those generally observed in that district by agreement between associations of employers and of employees or, failing any such agreement than those generally recongnised in that district by good employers.</P>
    <P>Now, it is sought to amend that third item that I have spoken of by adding the words &ldquo;or at a rate which, having regard to the duration of the employment offered and the cost and inconvenience of travelling or removal to the district, would not constitute a reasonable recompense.&rdquo;  My answer to that amendment is that it simply states the practice.  For instance, if a man were offered employment for, say, two weeks in a town 50 miles from his own town, and at a rate of wages which would barely give him anything over and above the cost of his expenses to and from that place, that obviously would not be profitable employment for him, and his refusal of such employment would not be considered unreasonable, and would not preclude him from the benefits of the Unemployment Insurance Act.  I do hold that the decisions of the Umpire and of the Court of Referees are definitely along these lines, and I have got no evidence of cases where hardship is proved to make me change my mind on this particular point.  The amendment does seem to imply that the condition has been interpreted and worked in an unreasonable fashion, but I am informed that that is not the rule of the Department working it.  Remember that the Department's regulations and the Department's working of it are subject to revision by the referees first, and by a final independent arbitrator.  I submit that the provision there is an ample provision, and that the rights of the employees are secured.</P>
    <P>The rule is, I am told, that where a claimant is offered and refuses work  a district, not the one in which he resides, at &ldquo;a wage not lower than  on conditions less favourable,&rdquo; his benefit will be stopped unless three exceptional set of circumstances arise. The first is, that there are domestic conditions which would make it difficult for him to leave home; his own state of health, for instance, or the state of health of his family would be <Col N="687" /> taken into consideration, and have been taken into consideration, when deciding whether or not the benefit should be stopped where employment has been refused on wages not lower than or on conditions not less favourable than those obtaining in the district where he ordinarily resides.  The second item that is taken into consideration is the type of work offered.</P>
    <P>The type of work offered in another district might not suit the claimant's physical condition, and it might be such as to prevent him from taking it up. A man, for instance, ordinarily employed on clerical work might be offered employment on roads, and obviously his refusal to take up work of that type would not preclude him from the right to insurance benefit. The third condition is where the post offered is likely to be of such short duration that, having regard to the amount of wages he could earn at the standard rate, the cost of travelling, and the cost of living in the district where the employment was offered, the transaction would not be a profitable one for him.  The decisions on that third condition in the set of circumstances I have referred to are definitely so favourable to the worker that I see no necessity for this amendment at all.  These things are all taken into consideration, the probable duration of the post offered, the cost of travelling to and from the place, and the cost of living in the place where the employment is offered, and when these things are all taken into consideration and a decision come to, that decision is subject to revision by two bodies, the final body being an independent arbitrator, who is quite apart from the employer, the employee, or the Ministry.</P>
    <P>On two grounds I would urge against this amendment.  The first is that if it means what it appears to mean on the surface, that is to say, that it seeks to amend an unjust and harsh interpretation of the working out of the clause in the Principal Act, then I say it is unnecessary, because of the way the Act has been interpreted and that there is provision for an independent arbitrator. If, on the other hand, it means <Col N="688" />&mdash;and I think there is some indication that it may mean that&mdash;that there is a definite attempt to enlarge the rights to benefit, then that is not a proper contention on an admittedly temporary Bill.  This whole question of unemployment insurance will have to be reconsidered and adjusted quite soon. This was an Act brought in for a highly industrialised country, England, and it was applied here.  The whole question of unemployment insurance and the conditions under which unemployment insurance benefit should be given will have to be revised in this country when we reach more normal conditions.  At that time an enlarged right to benefit may properly be argued, but it should not be argued now on what is admittedly a temporary Bill.  The whole object of this Bill is to revive artificially contributions which have been exhausted.  That is a considerable amount of justice.  It is only justice, however, to the unemployed, but it is considerable justice. It is not right, I suggest, to attempt to amend in a temporary Act the permanent provisions of the main Act, and I accordingly urge against the amendment on both grounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I cannot follow the logic of the Minister's statement.  The Minister read out a clause in the original Act which stated definitely that A could be disqualified for benefit for refusing to accept employment in another district where a lower rate of wages was being paid.  He stated that no hardships have been inflicted.  I am prepared to give him cases in support of my contention. In the month of April this year members of the Dublin Operative Builders' Society, the Operative Plumbers' Society, and Amalgamated Society of Wood Workers who were in receipt of unemployment benefit were offered employment in Dundalk at a rate of wages at least 12/- a week less than the rate they were in receipt of when working in Dublin.  They would have to pay their train fare to their employment in Dundalk, and when finished they would have to pay their train fare back, and no guarantee was given beyond a few weeks' employment. Because of their refusal to accept <Col N="689" /> employment under these conditions, they were disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit.  Their case was brought before the Court of Referees, and the Court of Referees decided in accordance with the Act, that there was no alternative but to disqualify the men.  The Minister need not tell us about the independent arbitrator, because the umpire and the Court of Referees must administer the law, and the law, according to this Act of Parliament read by the Minister himself, gives room to disqualify a worker who refuses to accept employment in another district where the rate of wages is lower.  There is no use in the Minister saying there is an attempt to increase benefit.  The object of this amendment is to prevent a recurrence of what happened in April when men in the case I have pointed out were disqualified. It is in order to prevent a repetition of such a thing that the amendment is brought forward.</P>

On this specific question Mr. Johnson, speaking, said: `We had conferences to discuss this matter, and I had complaints time and again from many parts of the country, and amongst those complaints this is one of the most insistent.&rdquo;  I drew his attention to that.  If there had been any numerous complaints they certainly would have come to the officials of my Department in the first instance.  The proceedings would have to start with them, but there has been no body of complaint.  There may be cases.  I presume the case referred to by Senator Farren has reference to more than one man.</P>

If there are any individual cases of hardship brought to the Department's notice, then we will do what we can before the Referee.  We cannot have anything to do with the final court arbitrator, because he is entirely apart from us.  I do not say that this was an attempt to enlarge benefit.  There is no attempt to enlarge the pay, but there is an attempt, I believe, to enlarge the right to benefit. I do say this is an attempt to prevent workers being moved from one district where skilled labour is being paid a high rate of wages.</P>

      <P>Well, it would operate in that way, and that is the reason why I do not accept this clause. I argue that there is no hardship against any worker by not accepting this clause, because I hold, despite what Senator Farren says, that the practice is in accordance with the amendment.  There may be individual cases, but it would be a mistake to bring in this clause, which could be interpreted in the way I described, and prevent the movement of labour from a district where wages are high to a district where wages are low.  That would not be a desirable practice.  I do not think Labour Senators will urge that there is any attempt to lower wages by movement of skilled labour in this way. Senators would admit that it is better to have men temporarily removed from a district where wages are high to a district where wages are low, rather than to have them drawing a still lower rate by unemployment benefit.</P>

To-day we have had a number of Bills before us that we really had no opportunity <Col N="692" /> at all of reading.  If the Government had carried out the promise they made over two months ago here, to introduce a number of these Bills in the Seanad, they would have been through and on the Statute Book before this time. They have not done that and the result is now that we are compelled to swallow those Bills wholesale.  I am convinced that when these Acts come to be administered very serious defects and flaws will be found in them.  Therefore I want, for the sake of the Seanad, to put in this word of caution, so that if we do help the Government in the present emergency and rush these Bills through, and faults are afterwards found in them, the blame may not be left upon this Seanad.</P>

There are Senators absent who might desire to have amendments made on the Report Stage, and I think it would be better, instead of taking the Report Stage now, that Senator Farren should hand in notice to have Standing Orders suspended so as to take the Report Stage and the Fifth Stage.  In that way, members of the Seanad who are absent would have notice, amendments could be made, and the Minister would be met by having his Bill passed tomorrow.

      <P>This is an amendment which, with several others of the same type, such as Numbers 7 and 8, is rendered necessary by the date of the year at which we have arrived.  This clause which it is now sought to amend had reference to the final date for the settlement of amalgamation schemes, for submission of agreed schemes or for preliminary schemes, and as we viewed the situation when framing the Bill, the 31st July seemed to be an appropriate and reasonable date.  Under the present circumstances, it is thought fit to ask the Seanad to change July to August, so as to allow the railway companies to get notice served on those interested and on those who really own the lines. So far as this particular amendment is concerned, it will have the effect of making the 31st August of this year <Col N="694" /> the date on which an agreed amalgamation scheme may be submitted to the Minister.  I ask the Seanad to accept this amendment, taking into consideration the period of the year at which we have now arrived, and the fact that we have still this Stage and the Fifth Stage to go in the Seanad and the further Stage in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The consideration I have given to it is shown in the next amendment, which really is my suggestion.  It incorporates what I said here when Senator Westropp Bennett moved the amendment down in his name.  I pointed out that in the event of his amendment being carried, as it stood, remuneration might be paid twice, even though remuneration came from two distinct sources.  It was agreed generally in the Seanad, in considering the Senator's amendment, that a proviso limiting the remuneration to one of the two sources and limiting it to one payment would be desirable.  I think my amendment covers the point.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Immediately after the word &ldquo;office&rdquo; in line 46 to insert the words &ldquo;or who resigns office consequent on his being appointed a standing member of the railway tribunal, but in the latter eventuality his remuneration as such standing member of the railway tribunal shall be taken into account in fixing the amount of any such compensation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not think that the agricultural community will be satisfied with this amendment.  By virtue of the composition of the panel there is a distinction between commerce and agriculture, and that must have been in the mind of the Government. If you are going to exclude agriculture, that is, to exclude anybody experienced in agriculture in its fullest sense from being a member of the tribunal, it will be very unfair to our main industry.  Could not the Government see its way to introduce some form of words which will give a suitable person who has experience in the whole field of agriculture the right, if considered fit, to sit on the tribunal?

      <P>I would like to support the amendment.  I think it would be an exceedingly dangerous course for the House to follow to give no indication as to any qualifications on the part of two members of the tribunal.  It was pointed out, after we carried this previously, that it will be open to the Government to make political appointments irrespective of qualifications. <Col N="698" /> There is evidently a conflict between agriculture and commerce in this House, and I think that is the reason that that amendment was introduced first without serious thought being given to it.  Surely it is within the region of possibility that a man having a knowledge of commerce would also have a knowledge of agriculture. I imagine that in this House there are such people.  In respect to the work which the tribunal will have to do, I fancy that one of the persons appointed will have to have a knowledge of accountancy, and I think that that is one reason why commerce was mentioned.  He will be more or less a chartered accountant.  If it is practicable for him to have a knowledge of agriculture all the better, but it might not be very likely that one will get an accountant who is also an agriculturist. He will, at all events, have a fairly general knowledge of agricultural affairs, and I think the amendment is fairly general in its character, and it is absolutely necessary if we are to prevent the tribunal being recruited from people without qualification.</P>

The word &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; does not do that, because everyone who has a knowledge of business is to that extent commercial.  If the amendment as now proposed is accepted it will not preclude anybody prominent in agriculture from serving.</P>

      <P>I spoke before of the judicial character of this tribunal.  It is suggested now, I think, as the result of the Minister's view that all that is required is that he ought to be an experienced chartered accountant, versed in accountancy in every branch of industry, and possibly in large agricultural concerns, and that he might fill the requirements better than any other. You have here one member who is to be a judge of the Supreme Court, the High Court, or the Circuit Court.  You have here a member who has to be a practising barrister of twelve years standing.  What is the idea of that?  It is that in the range of his experience he will possibly have adjudicated on matters touching every branch of industrial activity in the country, so he will have an all-round acquaintance with these matters.  Now, the chartered accountant of at least twelve years' experience will probably have had cause, in the course of his practice, to become familiar with the details of the working of matters concerning every branch of industry that will be brought before that tribunal.  If you wish to preserve the judicial character and to get away <Col N="700" /> from the attitude of the bias or partisan element, as far as you can humanly, I hold to the view, seeing that there is a difference of opinion here as to whether a commercial man has agricultural knowledge, that the chartered accountant is more likely to have a general and detailed knowledge in matters of accountancy upon which the decisions of this tribunal will largely hinge and be regulated.</P>

If I could conceive of any other interests, say the medical interests, I would put them in so that we can in a roundabout way arrive at the abolition of the clause.  There have been many sham combats in this country, but this sham combat produced in the Seanad is really of the greatest mock character.  It is not the intention of the Government to go down a list of names of suitable men for this tribunal and say &ldquo;so-and-so is a likely man, but he has a taint of agriculture about him.&rdquo;  That seems to be the attitude of the Seanad towards the agricultural interest when the members of the tribunal are being made up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President and I explained recently that the person really looked for was an accountant.  It was not thought well to say so, because if you can get a man, a specialist in accountancy, and who has a knowledge of commercial matters, including agriculture, that is the man for the post.  This is a tribunal of three men, a legal man to have experience in legal matters, a railway man who knows railway matters, and a man who knows accounts. Those are the three things.  It is not a question of representation.  There is not to be a fight in the tribunal, or two men against one.  They are to be three men placed in a judicial position to decide on certain matters that come <Col N="701" /> before them.  The question of representation only comes in on the panel. The conflict, if there is a conflict, can be fought out on the panel.  This is the tribunal that you want these three types of men on.  We believe that we can get a man with a knowledge of accounts under the description of a person with experience of commercial affairs.  If you alter this amendment, I suggest that we add medical men and university men.  They would be very fine representatives, but eventually we would arrive at the abolition of the clause.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is to provide that there shall be an appeal from the railway tribunal on a question of law, but not on a question of fact.  In the Committee Stage there was a mistake in the typing of this amendment; a few words were left out at the end which defeated its purpose. As I pointed out on that occasion, the majority of the tribunal will be non-legal. There will be one legal member, the chairman, and two non-legal members, and the majority decides any point.  It is quite possible that the two non-legal members may outvote the judge or the barrister who will be chairman of the tribunal, and I think it hardly safe to legislate for making the findings of these two non-legal men absolutely binding, and that there shall be no appeal from their decision to the Supreme Court.  The points in support of it are pretty obvious, and I move the amendment.  It states that &ldquo;No appeal <Col N="702" /> shall lie from any order made by the railway tribunal on a question of fact.&rdquo;  That assumes, of course, that there may be an appeal to the Supreme Court on questions of law, and I think it is extremely desirable that there should be, in view of the fact that the proceedings of this tribunal are equivalent to Private Bill legislation.</P>

Part I. of the Bill has reference to the amalgamation and absorption schemes.  I want to refine this down a little further to show exactly the difference between the Senator and myself.  The method of submitting these schemes, or of having the schemes agreed, is set out in Schedule IV., provisions relating to the submission of schemes.  Meetings have to be called in a certain way.  If a meeting is not called in a proper way the meeting is an illegal one, and nothing done at it can be approved by the railway tribunal.  If the meeting is properly called, them the rules applying to such meetings will hold.  If anything has been done contrary to law, there is the ordinary appeal in such a course in the ordinary way, so that the preparation of these schemes is protected in two <Col N="703" /> ways, and the meeting must be called in a proper fashion, otherwise it is completely illegal.  If the meeting be called in a proper fashion, and if the rules regulating such a meeting are broken, then there is an appeal against the breach of such rules in the ordinary way, so that for the submission of schemes in accordance with Part I. there is ample provision for protection on points of law.</P>

      <P>Well, then, this is a very roundabout way to do it. Senator O'Farrell will pardon me for saying so, because if you look at Section 22, it says that there is to be no appeal from any decision of the railway tribunal under any other jurisdiction on a question of fact, and as I understand, what you want to provide is that there shall be an appeal under Part I. on a question of law, but not of fact.  What I want to make clear to you is that it has been decided on the highest authority that words which negative an appeal on a question of fact do not imply that an appeal is given on a question of law.  You have expressly to say that there is to be an appeal on a question of law.</P>

      <P>I am arguing against this proposal to give a right of appeal on a question of law arising out of the jurisdiction conferred on the tribunal under Part I.  Indeed, I say that the Senator goes a little bit further, because he takes away the proviso, not in Part I., of any question regarding the <i>locus standi</i> of any person appearing to be heard before them.  I do not think that the Senator is very anxious about that.  It simply comes in incidentally to his amendment, but I am arguing against what I believe to be his main proposal, that is, to give an appeal on a question of law from an order of the railway tribunal in exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on it by Part I.  Part I. deals with certain limited things, amalgamation and absorption schemes.  The provisions for the application of these schemes are defined in the Schedule.  If this Schedule is taken in relation to the general body of law it will work out this way, that if a meeting be illegally constituted then nothing it does can be approved by the tribunal.  If a meeting be legally constituted but that something illegal is done, then there is a right of appeal under the general body of the law.</P>

      <P>Is that quite clear?  This thing has been the subject of constant litigation, and I am anxious to have it made quite plain. I am not at all clear that Section 22 will give the court power to entertain an appeal grounded on an allegation that they had exceeded their jurisdiction, because they are exercising their jurisdiction even if they exceed it.  A <Col N="705" /> man may exceed his jurisdiction in the exercise of it.  I am inclined to think that the court might probably hold that this Section prevented them from going into an allegation of excess of jurisdiction, and I would recommend you to put in these words:&mdash;&ldquo;No appeal shall lie from any order made by the railway tribunal save in the case of alleged excess of jurisdiction.&rdquo;</P>

However, it is not really for me.  I only wish to facilitate you as far as possible in making this section watertight.  It does not seem to me to be watertight at present.  Is it really intended that an appeal should lie in every case where the railway tribunal exceed their jurisdiction, because, as I pointed out, you may exceed your jurisdiction while you are at the same time exercising it?  You may exceed it in the exercise of it, and the courts may hold that they cannot go into these cases, because the Act says that there is to be no appeal from anything done in the exercise of their jurisdiction.

It strikes me, reading through the provisions, that the amalgamation and absorption scheme is most involved and very complicated. I may be imagining, but it strikes me that questions of law may easily arise, and in that case what would be the objection of the Government to improving the Bill?  I do not think that the Minister has answered that.  He gave an appeal in all the other Parts, but the Government seem to have some fundamental objection to giving an appeal on a point of law under Part I. If it applies under the other Parts, why should it not equally apply under Part I.?  A legal point might as easily arise under Part I. as under any other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not answer that because I had not concluded my argument.  Senator O'Farrell wants to give an appeal on a question of law under Part I.  I had got so far as to point out that Part I. was limited to absorption and amalgamation schemes, and as far as the agreed schemes were concerned, I think the stockholders are perfectly protected in the Fourth Schedule. <Col N="707" /> As to anything beyond that, Senator Sir John Keane asks what is the objection to an appeal on a point of law.  My answer is a very simple one.  I do not want an unnecessary appeal in these schemes, either the agreed or the compulsory ones, and Senator O'Farrell said it will be two laymen in opposition to one legal man on this tribunal. That is perfectly right, and it must be borne in mind, in weighing this amendment, that I did not seek to minimise that difficulty.  But I do say that two laymen on a tribunal of three, the third of which is a legal man, would certainly be very much swayed by the legal man's opinion on questions of law.  They will be pretty well subservient to his point of view, so that while there is a danger that must not be lost sight of that you could have two stiff-necked and arrogant laymen on this tribunal who might become objectionable towards the legal man, and simply oppose him, that is a risk that must be run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge against that that it is a contingency that is not likely to happen. On the other hand, if you put in a clause of this sort you must recognise the situation with regard to this amalgamation scheme, and you must recognise that, just as in Private Bill procedure, the door is open to all sorts of obstruction to the carrying through of a proposal in a private Bill, so if you put in an amendment of this sort you open the door for all sorts of obstruction to the carrying through of the amalgamation and absorption schemes in time, and time is very much the essence of this Bill.  I urge against the acceptance of the amendment on the ground that it is possible that it will lead to unnecessary delay.  So far as the interests of stockholders are concerned in an agreed scheme, they are protected in the Bill under Schedule IV.  I do not like to set up here a legal opinion that I have got privately, but I have been advised by the Legal Adviser of the Government that this section is watertight in so far as it was sought to make it watertight.  I cannot say that all the points raised here were put before the Legal Adviser, but the advice he gave <Col N="708" /> to me was that this section was as watertight as he thought it advisable to have it.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite see what the Minister urges.  The intention of the Government, and the Dáil has, apparently, agreed to it, is that there shall be no appeal of any kind when the railway tribunal is acting under Part I, so long as the railway tribunal complies with the conditions of their jurisdiction.  At the same time the Minister says the Government do not wish to prevent an appeal when they fail to comply with the provisions which are attached to the exercise of their jurisdiction, and, therefore, it seems to me they have failed to accomplish that, or they may have failed to accomplish it under this section.  They would make it quite plain by putting in the words &ldquo;save where they acted in excess of jurisdiction.&rdquo;  If that is the intention of the Government that would express it.  I think that as the section stands at present when a court comes to construe it they will say, &ldquo;even though they have exceeded the jurisdiction they have done so in the exercise of their jurisdiction, and, therefore, we cannot entertain the appeal.&rdquo; That is a point that is worthy of consideration.  I put it forward for your consideration, and if you think it is necessary you can alter the Bill in the other House.</P>

Probably not being able to understand the lawyer he will decide for himself, and probably in a non-legal way.

      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 22 merely provides that there shall be an appeal from the decision of the Railway Tribunal not on a question of jurisdiction, but an appeal on some decision made by them acting under jurisdiction.  The Minister's argument is one of expediency as against one of justice.  I do not think the House should legislate in that spirit.  It may be desirable and it is no doubt desirable that this Bill should come into operation at the earliest possible date but in order to facilitate that desirable end I do not think it is right to run the risk of an injustice being inflicted on a number of people and that there should be no appeal against such an injustice merely in the interests of expediency.  The British Act provides for an appeal and if it were not for that fact thousands of people would have suffered a grave injustice in respect of future superannuation matters.  Already appeals have been lodged against the attempted action on the part of two of the groups and decisions have been given against the companies and so far as I understand, against the findings of the Amalgamation Tribunal as it is called in Great Britain.  If there was no appeal it would be impossible to remedy this injustice and the only real argument put up against this is that it might cause unnecessary litigation and delay.  Litigation instituted for the purposes of obstruction is a very expensive matter&mdash;any form of litigation is an expensive matter&mdash;and I do not know that there are people in this <Col N="710" /> country sufficiently wealthy to go out for the mere fun of the thing and to go to the Supreme Court with appeals from the decision of this tribunal. Apart from that there seems to be no real argument at all against this amendment.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with the Senator that apart from the question of delay and obstruction there is no real argument against the amendment, but it is on that point I take my stand.  He says he does not think there are individuals wealthy enough in this country to take appeals for the mere fun of the thing.  That is not putting the situation fairly.  I am not sure there are individuals wealthy enough to do this, but remember it would not be for the fun of the thing appeals would be brought.  It would be for the definite object of blocking the passage of this Bill.  It has not been blocked in its passage either in this House or in the Dáil, but it might be blocked outside by individuals who may be obstructionists, by interests who are represented in this country and who would be obstructionists. The British circumstances were not at all equivalent to ours.  Here there are very definite interests in conflict with the whole principle of this Bill.  There is a particular point of time to which we must work in this Bill.  The results must be shown quite soon or the whole amalgamation scheme fails.  The 31st August is one date, the 1st of January of next year is another.  Between these periods any delay occurring might defeat the whole purpose of the Bill. The danger is quite clearly there. What is the danger on the other side? The danger, according to the Senator, is that certain interests of certain private people might be prejudiced. That is to say, stockholders, I presume.</P>

He has urged his point on that very clearly at the previous Stage. He has been met to a certain extent. The only interests under this particular <Col N="711" /> section which could be prejudiced are the interests of the stockholders, and I hold that, reading that section with the Fourth Schedule, it shows definitely that the stockholders are very adequately protected.  It is simply a balancing of two dangers, and I believe that the danger to the whole Bill is much bigger, and much more to be taken into consideration, than the very unlikely prospect of danger to the stockholders or the employees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurJackson" hpid="Mr. JACKSON Mr. JACKSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JACKSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the new Section 26 inserted in Committee.</P>
      <P>The section referred to reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>From and after the passing of this Act every station in the Saorstát where through rates do not now operate shall enjoy the through rates operating from the nearest station to it from which through rates do operate or may subsequently operate, at an addition to such rates not greater than the local rate between the outlying station and the station nearest to it from which through rates operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons I wish to put forward for this amendment are as follows: In the first place, I think the section will be quite inoperative, as all through rates are practically put into force by the British railway companies, and there will be no power, even by the tribunal here, to compel the British railways to issue a through rate.  There has never been a case of a through rate being put into force that has not been put into force by the British railways. What has occurred in practice is that, wherever a sufficient volume of trade was passing, applications were made and through rates would be granted if it could be shown that the business would be sufficient to warrant it.  The number of through rates in existence are very numerous, and I should think that, even if we had the power, we would find it very difficult to get the consent of the British railways to go on issuing indiscriminately through rates to every part of the country. <Col N="712" /> What I would suggest is that people can send goods from out-of-the-way places to the nearest station where the through rates operate, pay the local rate, and all that would be needed would be an agent, or some representative in the town or place where the through rate operates, to have the goods re-booked.  In that way people would get the advantage of the through rate by only adding the local rate.  I think this section is unnecessary, and I move its deletion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLove" hpid="Mr. LOVE Mr. LOVE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LOVE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great attention to the Senator, and he has practically stated exactly what I endeavoured to get done.  The only point I differ with him on is this, and it is the great crux of the whole thing: The object of my amendment is to help people who, perhaps, would not have the same knowledge of railway rates as the Senator or I myself might have, and who do not know how to take advantage of the opportunities to increase their production by marketing their goods at a cheap and reasonable rate.  In England at present there is a great furore about the impossibility of big places, even like Grimsby, being able to carry on business because of the rates charged, and the rates in England are only 50 per cent. over pre-war.  In the Free State they are about 150 per cent. over the pre-war rates, and in Northern Ireland something like 75 per cent.  It is for that reason that I wanted this section inserted.  Perhaps the Government could see their way even to go one step further to remove the difficulty which would exist, even if the suggestion of Senator Jackson were accepted.  If a man at an outlying station sends goods at the local rate to the nearest station from which there is a through rate, some arrangement might be made by the railway companies that the goods sent in that way would be booked through to their destination in England.  That would settle the whole thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I urged against the acceptance of this amendment on the Committee Stage, and consequently I am now both logically and after further consideration, in favour of the amendment proposed by Senator Jackson. The effect of the section has to be considered in its relation to the local traffic.  Great complaint is being made at the moment as to the preferential rates for through traffic.  That preferential rates for through traffic.  When a through rate is given, it is given after having taken into consideration all the peculiar circumstances as between the two points from and to which the through rate operates.  The effect of the section is to extend indefinitely, without any regard to circumstances, a through rate which has been established by agreement between two bodies after a definite consideration of the particular circumstances.  It would have a further repercussion on the whole Bill.  Standardisation of charges is one of the objects set out in the Bill, and that includes the doing away with the numerous exceptional rates which have got to be a grievous hindrance to traffic and a great source of annoyance to traders.</P>
      <P>If this section is left in the Bill it is going not merely to set up further exceptional rates, but it will increase and enlarge the difficulty arising from the exceptional rates.  It is going to multiply indefinitely what really are exceptional rates.  That is going to be done, as I say, without adverting to the particular circumstances that operated to bring about the exceptional rate in a particular case.  As has been pointed out by Senator Jackson, it is going to insist on a thing being done which really in practice requires agreement, and I do not see how it is going to be operative.  If it is operative it is going to be at the expense of the local traffic and to give the preference to the cross-Channel traffic.</P>

It is going to say that so far as Ireland is concerned you are going to graft on to that a through rate to one particular point by simply adding the local rate.  That is going to extend exceptional through rates by simply adding the further addition of the local rate.  That is also going to be prejudicial to the local rate.</P>

      <P>We were told that this rate question was a very complicated one, and having heard this I believe it.  It is very well known that certain places do enjoy exceptional through rates owing to the competition of sea routes, and that they get special rates by water.  It seems hard on an inland town, somewhere near such a place, that people should not be able to have goods booked at the through rates.  I hope if that is the fact that the Seanad will refuse to accept the new amendment, so that inland districts may be given the advantages of rates from ports, or other favourably situated points.</P>

      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with people in the inland towns in the Free State, where the rates are unfortunately so high, but, if you were to compel the railway company to have through rates indiscriminately all over the Free State, it could not exist.  To begin with, the reason the through rate is so low, comparatively speaking, is, first of all, that when goods are brought from towns, say, near Liverpool, the shipping company has also to get a share for carrying them from Liverpool to Ireland. Heavy charges are incurred at the port.  At Liverpool it costs 7s. a ton for traffic brought from the railway station and put on board the steamer. A steamer can carry anything from 500 tons to 5,000 tons, and can be worked with comparatively little labour and at considerably lower cost than a railway.  I have every sympathy with the amendment, and I would like to assist agriculture by lowering rates, but, at the same time, I think it would be unfair to the railway companies to compel them to carry the bulk of their traffic on rates based on water competition. It is simply impossible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LOVE</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat once more that there is no attempt at compulsion.  The only attempt is to make the rates of greater advantage to the country.  For example, if you take &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B.&rdquo;&ldquo;A&rdquo; lives at an outlying place, while &ldquo;B&rdquo; lives at a place to which there are through rates to England.  All I want is to give &ldquo;A&rdquo; the advantage of the through rate from &ldquo;B&rdquo; if he books his goods forward.</P>

      <P>From and after the passing of the Act every station in Saorstát Eireann where a through rate does not now operate shall enjoy a through rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is compulsion, and must be recognised as such.  There is no getting away from that.  It really turns on a question of book-keeping.  The Senator <Col N="716" /> has just described what he has done and what everyone could do.  Traders could book from an inland town to a port from which a through rate operates.  What the Senator seeks is to have one booking and save trouble and re-booking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLove" hpid="Mr. LOVE Mr. LOVE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LOVE</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to save trouble, but to save the enormous cost.  The old rate was five-eights of a penny for goods on passenger trains, such as fish. If they were booked at the local rate to the next station where there is a through rate, they would get to England at one-third of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>By agreement with England.  There are two points now involved.  There is the question of booking and the question of the lower rate, and both of these depend upon an agreement which is to be entered into with the corresponding companies on the other side.  You cannot put on the amalgamated company the responsibility even to do the booking.  Let us take the booking alone.  It is a simple thing.  A man wants to book to a town in England and he receives a document common to both the Irish railway undertaking and whatever English railway is concerned on the other side.  The division of that receipt will be done by the Clearing House, but that division will only operate on the basis of an agreement. You cannot insist that the English company will do something on a new route, because they have done something on the shorter route.  You cannot say to them simply &ldquo;Will you take what you had agreed to take out of this on the shorter route and we will take the rest?&rdquo; If they did that the same thing could operate on the other side, and the railway company here would be compelled to carry things back from all sorts of places in England to Ireland under that arrangement, although agreement may not have been previously reached by the two companies concerned as previously arranged.  On the question of expenses, I see a further difficulty.  It is going to penalise the local traders at the expense of the cross-Channel traffic.</P>

      <P>Section 42, sub-section (1), to add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;provided also that no livestock shall be carried by the amalgamated company upon other than the company's risk conditions.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. BAGWELL Mr. BAGWELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter upon which I would like to say a few words.  It is the usual practice for railway companies to have two sets of rates in respect of a number of traffics&mdash;the company's risk rate, which is higher, and the owner's risk rate, which is the lower.  This amendment seems to make that practice illegal in respect of cattle.  It seems to make illegal a practice which is the result of generations of experience. I suggest that such a step should not be taken by the Seanad.  We cannot here give adequate consideration to a matter of this kind.  The railway tribunal set up under this Act is clearly a very much more suitable body than we are to consider a matter of this sort.  They can hear all the arguments for and against at length.  They can incur all the necessary delay to obtain all the facts which are pertinent to enable a sound decision to be arrived at.  We cannot do any of these things here.  But quite apart from the railway tribunal being a very much more proper body than the Seanad to deal with a matter of this kind, on the merits I should like to express my view, that this amendment, if accepted, would affect a most undesirable change.  It seems to me that if there is any traffic in respect of which it is desirable and legitimate that there should be two sets of rates&mdash;a company's risk rate and an owner's risk rate&mdash;it is this.  As a matter of fact, practically all cattle are carried at owner's risk rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with traffic which consists of inanimate objects, any damage that is caused in transit is liable to fall on the railway company.  It may not <Col N="718" /> be the result of deliberate negligence, but at all events it is more or less under their control.  In the case of cattle they are not inanimate objects, and they are not under the control of the railway company, as some other objects are.  Cattle carried in trains very often come from a fair.  Anybody knows who has been at fairs that cattle are really kept together in fairs by being beaten.  That is not the fault of the railway company.  In addition to that, once they start in the train, and actually while in the train, they can commit all sorts of offences against each other which the railway companies cannot prevent, and they must suffer thereby.  They are completely out of the railway company's control when they go from the train to the steamer or to their destination, which may be the farm.  Claims may be made after all that is over, and it is absolutely impossible for the amalgamated company or any other company to take care to prevent the cattle being damaged in transit, and therefore I submit on the merits, it is very undesirable that a change of this kind should be made in the law such as is proposed by this amendment.  If any change is to be made in the matter of owner's risk and company's risk, it should be made after very much more deliberation than is possible in this Assembly.</P>

I am reading from the Official Report:&mdash;Senator Counihan said: &ldquo;If the Minister would leave the matter open he can make his mind clear whether the prevailing rate is company rate or owner's risk rate.  I am still of opinion that the prevailing rate is company's risk rate.&rdquo; Later on, when the next amendment was submitted, the Senator said that the effect would be if the previous amendment was inserted, the words would naturally go out.  I remarked that the previous amendment was left over for the Senator's consideration, and not for mine.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 53, sub-section (1), immediately after the word &ldquo;standard&rdquo; in line 27 to insert the words &ldquo;and exceptional.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment raises a point which I confess is rather involved in its consideration. If the House will turn to Section 53 they will see there that it is contemplated to fix the standard revenue as revenue solely or mainly with regard to standard charges and without consideration to exceptional charges.  To a layman that looks as if it would involve very great difficulty. I do not know that the railway company themselves exactly know&mdash;of course, I speak subject to correction&mdash; what percentage of their revenue comes from exceptional charges.  But it is a very considerable portion.  Seventy-five per cent. of the tonnage is carried at exceptional rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now it is proposed to fix the standard charges on which the standard revenue depends without any regard to the exceptional charges whatsoever. The Minister will reply that the exceptional charges in the future are going to be very much reduced in volume because owing to the re-classification you are going to embrace, or going to absorb, in those new classifications which I believe will rise to 26, a number of the exceptional rates.  But I do not think it will be denied that the exceptional rates will still continue and to what extent is problematic.  Now let us picture to ourselves the position that <Col N="720" /> may arise.  I say that may arise for the reason that I am speaking without an intimate knowledge of the matter. I am also speaking with diffidence because the railway company themselves are obliged to have super-experts on these questions of rates and the ordinary railway man is somewhat at sea about them.  Under this Bill exceptional charges disappear on the &ldquo;Appointed Day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is interesting incidentally to notice that the &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; in England has not yet arrived although the Act is in operation three years and also that a whole array of counsel have been engaged, in view of the &ldquo;appointed date&rdquo; on the question as to what is standard revenue.  That is an indication of what is to happen on a smaller scale here.  Exceptional rates will disappear except those not less than 5 per cent. below the standard rates and any that are continued by agreement between the traders and the companies. Well, now, it strikes me that that may operate very hardly and to the prejudice of the ordinary users of the railways who are not in a position to get exceptional rates.  I cannot see anything to prevent these powerful corporations with big traffic of every kind to offer going to the companies for a continuance of the exceptional rates. In England they have continued the exceptional rates by agreement; that is my information but of course I am open to correction and I see nothing to prevent a large number of powerful corporations getting the exceptional rates fixed favourably for themselves. After all it is a business arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The companies will want to increase business and to get customers.  The result will be that these powerful interests will get exceptional rates fixed unduly favourable to themselves, and the tribunal will be met with the fact.  Here is a definite volume of revenue fixed, and tied up under exceptional rates which are outside our purview altogether, and we will have to fix standard rates in regard to what is left.  Naturally, standard rates will reduce the standard revenue unduly owing to the fact that <Col N="721" /> exceptional rates have been given unduly favourable.</P>

I feel the only way is to raise the question, and I submit that the only way to settle it is to bring the whole of the exceptional rates within the purview, in fact the whole rates, both standard and exceptional, within the jurisdiction or competence of the tribunal that is to determine the standard revenue.  I do not know whether I can make the matter any clearer other than as the case strikes me, and I shall be glad to hear from the Minister if fundamentally my argument is at fault.</P>

      <P>The particular criticism of Senator Bagwell is very pertinent to this point.  It would put such a volume of work upon the tribunal that if this work came before it, the work of the tribunal would never be completed.  As to what Senator Sir John Keane said, I have only this remark to make, that is, that an earlier section than Section 53, but later than the one he made reference to, has a bearing on this section, that is 35 (2), and I think that will meet most of the points raised by Senator Sir John Keane.  It is: &ldquo;If the Minister is of opinion that the amalgamated company is granting new exceptional rates in such manner as prejudicially to affect any class of users of the railway not benefited by such rates, or so as to jeopardise the realisation of the standard revenue of the company, he may refer the matter to the railway tribunal, who may, after giving all parties interested an opportunity of being heard, take either or both of the following courses:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) revise the standard charges;</P>
      <P>(b) cancel or modify all or any of such exceptional rates.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> He told us incidental to his remarks that the bodies in England had not yet begun to deal with these exceptional rates and later on he said there had been difficulty in connection with them.  I wonder does he mean difficulty before the Tribunal because my information is that the British Railway Tribunal has not yet approached the question of rates.  Its operations so far have been confined to dealing with standard revenue.  The Senator is quite right in stating that there is an unwieldy proportion of exceptional rates at the moment but this Bill sets out to cut these down and it does cut them down by the operation of Section 34.  Section 35 refers to the future.  The granting of any exceptional rates is in the proviso which shows that this matter may be raised by the ordinary class of user who might be prejudiced, and on both these points with regard to new exceptional rates there is the provision in Section 35 (2), and then with regard to the present, we do start off under Section 34 by cutting out the operation of the rates which do not follow within the rather narrow limitation laid down there.</P>

      <P>Before we rise for the luncheon interval, I would like to get the views of the Seanad as to whether they would like to take on at any time to-day this question which is on the agenda, with reference to the temporary accommodation of the Oireachtas.  The matter was postponed, as the Seanad will recollect, for a fortnight, in order to give the Senators who are interested an opportunity of seeing the Reports with reference to the precautions against fire.  The matter, therefore, is now ripe for discussion. Those reports have been in the office of the Clerk and, I think, were accessible to Senators.  I notice when the question was raised the other day in the Dáil that the President stated that he would like the matter adjourned, as he wished to bring certain Estimates before the Deputies of the Dáil.  It occurred to me that perhaps it would be more convenient if we knew what took place with regard to the discussion, and knew what these estimates contained before we came to any conclusion on the matter.  Of course, we can proceed to-day or to-morrow independent of any action taken in the Dáil. But as it is the intention, apparently, of the President to bring some new figures to the attention of the Dáil, I thought that perhaps the Seanad would permit further discussion on this matter to stand over.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Senator the Earl of Mayo is not in his place to-day, because he misconstrued what I said on the last occasion when speaking against another amendment. I had referred to two special bodies mentioned&mdash;the Wages Board and another Board of Appeal, and I said these might disappear.  I was taken by Senator the Earl of Mayo, and reported in the newspapers as having said, that trade unions might disappear.  I do not suppose it is necessary to make it clear that I said nothing of the sort.</P>
      <P>Senator the Earl of Mayo's amendment follows later, and I had held out objection to any amendment so phrased that individual employees would have to make individual contracts where they were not members of a trade union, as this would preclude them from appointing anybody to represent them.  On consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the numbers of such individuals who would not be members of trade unions, and with whom individual contracts would have to be entered into, is likely to be small, and that in order to preserve the power and responsibility of trade unions, it would be better to waive that objection, and to let an amendment of that sort be made.  I prefer Amendment 16 to Amendment 17, and I presume it will be moved in substitution of the latter one.  It is quite acceptable as it now stands.</P>

      <P>I was in hopes that the mover of the original amendment might possibly see some force in my observations and modify her proposal, but if not, I should be prepared to move some form of amendment. I hope the necessity may not arise.  If examinations are held under the present conditions, it may possibly happen that there will be more vacancies at the disposal of the amalgamated company than there are candidates to fill the posts.  At this moment&mdash;whatever may happen in the future&mdash;there are not a large number of men in the country who are properly conversant with the Irish language.</P>

    <P>It might well be that there would only be five candidates who could talk Irish, and they would get the vacancy no matter what their other qualifications were, while the remaining vacancies would not be filled.  In ten years time, when Senator Mrs. Costello succeeds in educating the youth of the <Col N="728" /> country in the Irish language, we might have an abundance of candidates.

If he attended one of the Irish plays recently in which nothing but Irish was spoken, he would have seen the theatre filled with a crowded audience.  Many years ago Irish was made compulsory in the National University, and it was then argued, even by our own bishops, that the University would be ruined. The University was not, however, ruined, and there have since been plenty of students.</P>

      <P>There has been one statement made here to which I should refer.  Senator MacLysaght has said that this amendment on Committee drew the remark that a knowledge of Irish might mean only a knowledge of tá and níl.  I am responsible for that argument, but it arose on a previous amendment, providing that 15 per cent. of the marks shall be for a knowledge of Irish.  I pointed out that it was so loosely worded that a knowledge of tá and níl might get that 15 per cent., and that was wide of the section.  I would like to agree with what Senator Mrs. Wyse Power has said.  When I was a student at the National University the question of compulsory Irish arose, and it was held that its introduction would lessen the number of students.  In the Dublin College of that University, so far from compulsory Irish lessening the number of students, it has within the last five years more students than Trinity College, so that the compulsory knowledge of Irish has not prevented students from coming to it.  If you take the three Colleges together, Galway, Cork and Dublin, and if you were to add Maynooth, which is a recognised college, in all four of which Irish is compulsory, the number would be in relation to Trinity, as five is to two. There has been no opposition, and there has been no question whatever raised with regard to students keeping away because Irish was insisted on as compulsory for matriculation in the National University.  I am not clear that what Senator the Earl of Wicklow has stated is likely to happen, and that there will be ten vacancies and only five candidates with a knowledge of Irish.  I have examined on many Boards where Irish was a compulsory subject, and I do not remember having ever been up against that situation that there were more vacancies than candidates, and that candidates were ruled out because they had not Irish.  I do not think that the Senator's fears are likely to be realised.</P>

        <Col N="730" /> Senator the Earl of Wicklow need have no anxiety on the point.  I have had experience in this matter in railway and other institutions, and I know that there is no difficulty in getting young men to go up for examinations in Irish. Apart from the compulsory aspect of the case, I think that most young people take up Irish, because they are anxious to learn the language, and it is no trouble to them to pass the examination. So far as the railway that serves the Senator's district and mine is concerned, he will be glad to know that without compulsion we have a number of Irish speakers in the employment of the company, and some of them are extraordinarily able Irish speakers.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that it happened on the present occasion, but previously some gentlemen were eloquently violent.  Kildare, the county from which I come, was the first of the counties to lose the Irish language, and in recent times we have the authority of those prominent in the language movement for stating that it has become one of the foremost counties in the restoration of the language. A few years ago we had only a few dozen people who could speak the language, but now we have the people all over the county speaking it, and they compose all classes of people.  A discussion will come on later here on the same question, and I trust that the same attitude will not be taken towards <Col N="731" /> it as has been taken heretofore. A lot is owed by supporters of the Union to Ireland, and if it goes abroad that members of this House who were upholders of the Union, are now opponents of the Irish language, it will create a very bad impression, and much of the confidence of the country in this House will be lost.  I strongly oppose any change in this amendment that was inserted on the last occasion.

I think it is a pity that this should be brought into a question of party politics.  Frankly, the reason I am opposed to this is&mdash;it may be a bad reason, but we in the minority have a duty to perform&mdash;I feel that a very valuable asset, a thing that is rare is brains, and the best brains will not submit to those compulsory measures, and will simply leave the country.  That is my view, but I may be wrong.  Brains are exceedingly scarce.  What we want above all in the rejuvenation of our country is brains.  I feel that people will not learn a language which, in their opinion, is of no value and they will rather leave the country.  That is my view.  It may be materialistic, lacking in sympathy, perhaps.  I may be of a materialistic mind, but there it is, and it is my duty to state it.  As to the general question, I am not sure that the views of the last speaker represent the views of the country.  I should be very satisfied to see this whole question of compulsory Irish becoming the subject of a referendum, and I think, if it does, its most warm advocates will have a surprise.</P>

It may be perfectly true that there are a number of young men in this country who have <Col N="732" /> enough knowledge of Irish to present themselves for examination.  My friend in front of me tells me that is the case, and I believe it; but may I point out that there is a large section of the population of this country, amongst it young men, who are not conversant with the language, a good section loyal to the Free State, and in bringing in a resolution of this kind you are banging in their face the door which would admit them to the service of the amalgamated company.  These young men cannot present themselves for an examination in Irish.  Is it fair to do this suddenly?  You will drive those young men to seek employment over the water.  It will be competent for the Oireachtas after a few years have passed to insert some such provision in a short Bill.  I submit it is an unfair action to insert a compulsory provision of this kind suddenly, in such a manner as to affect detrimentally a large and deserving section of the nation.</P>

Another way in which the language can be fostered, to a great extent, is to have an arrangement by which a fairly high percentage would be given to those who <Col N="733" /> took the trouble to learn Irish.  None of us care for compulsion.  If some amendment could be put in in that way it would be better than to have the examiners allotting a small percentage of marks, and the students might learn only a sufficient portion of the language to qualify.  If there was a high percentage of marks given for the trouble they took to learn the language, it would be better.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 58, sub-section (2).  Immediately before this sub-section to insert a new sub-section (2) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) The amalgamated company or any other railway company in respect of that portion of its undertaking situate in Saorstát Eireann shall not abolish or unduly restrict the railway services, facilities or conveniences upon any portion of their railways, whether by reason of financial loss upon such portion or otherwise, without the prior consent of the railway tribunal; and before giving such consent the railway tribunal shall have regard to any representations made by any representative body of railway users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put this amendment on the Order Paper to try to remedy what I ventured to point out on the Committee Stage was a danger affecting the poorer railways. As I said then I fear that the amalgamated company may find that certain portions of the railway under their control do not pay to work, and may, therefore, cut down their services to such an extent as seriously to inconvenience the public.  It strikes me that although economy is the object aimed at by this Bill, it may very well happen that in their desire for economy the amalgamated company may cease to work services which are really almost essential in the public interest, and the object of my amendment is to secure that no services shall be abandoned without the leave of the tribunal and without those people who are particularly interested in the service in question having a <Col N="734" /> right to appear before the tribunal and be heard.</P>

      <P>This amendment was first raised without notice in Committee, and I said that it was my intention to have the matter looked into to see if the danger feared by the Senator was a reasonable danger.  It is my contention that the position of the railway users is amply safeguarded as it stands, and if we were to tie the hands of the amalgamated company in their efforts, which we are trying to make compulsory on them to make all possible economies in order to reduce the present outrageous rates and fares, then we would by passing this amendment really be preventing their attempts to coincide with our aims.  It is not in the power of the amalgamated company to abolish services because there are certain Parliamentary regulations with regard to the running of trains and with regard to the running of trains at certain rates which are taken over in the general clause whereby we take over the rates, duties, and liabilities of the companies.  With regard to particular trains or a particular train, I think that should be left to the management of the amalgamated company, subject to the safeguard provided here under Section 57.  The second portion of the section states that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The railway tribunal may, on the application of any body of persons representing any such interests, by order require the amalgamated company or any other railway company in respect of that portion of its undertaking situate in Saorstát Eireann to afford such reasonable railway services, facilities, and conveniences upon and in connection with its undertaking as may be specified in the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think with a proviso of that type that the Senator's fears ought to be lessened, and I urge definitely against this amendment that it would unduly restrict the power of the company to make the reduction in their rates and fares which we are urging and pressing on them, and which, if they are not carried out, may lead to some other <Col N="735" /> measure being passed to deal with them.</P>

      <P>It is provided so forth and so forth.  The Senator wants to secure that any person or body of persons who think themselves aggrieved by restriction of any facilities they have enjoyed shall have a right to appear before the railway tribunal. The section gives him that, and unless it can be proved by the railways that the carrying out of the suggestion of the people aggrieved is one that seriously affects their financial stability or their reasonable economies or things of that kind, unless the company can convince the tribunal on that point the tribunal orders them to give these localities or persons such reasonable facilities&mdash;the same facilities as they enjoyed before.</P>

Where you have got an uneconomic section of line it will be perfectly possible for the railway company to point out &ldquo;we should like to provide you with the service you ask for, but we cannot do it without prejudicially affecting our stockholders.&rdquo; I have heard nothing from the Minister or from Senator Sir Thos.  Esmonde to show me that the people living on non-economic sections of lines are safeguarded under the Bill.</P>

That is the last proviso. Nobody can say that I am halting at anything that could be said, and I think it answers the Senator's arguments.</P>

      <P>On your suggestion that I would consider the question between the Committee and Report <Col N="738" /> Stages this amendment was, by leave of the House, withdrawn.  On looking into the matter since, I find that the Railways (Ireland) Act of 1851, has a special clause&mdash;Clause 3&mdash;referring to this.  Clause 3 reads:&mdash;&ldquo;The clauses of the Land Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, with respect to the purchase and taking of land otherwise than by agreement (except Section 16 and Section 17 of the said Act) shall not be applicable or in force with respect to any railway or portion of railway in Ireland to which this Act applies.&rdquo;  So that the 1851 Act set out by a special clause deliberately to exclude the provisions of the Land Clauses Consolidation Act of 1845, from application to any railway undertaking in Ireland, and I found, therefore that I was following on the lines of the 1851 Act in leaving out the special provisions of the 1845 Land Clauses Consolidation Act with reference to the serving of notice in a particular way.</P>

      <P>Once in the <i>Dublin Gazette</i> and once in each of three successive weeks in some one and the same newspaper circulating in the county in which the lands are situated. I may say that there was a clause later which was explanatory to the procedure set out in the 1845 Act, that where you could not get the person interested all you did was simply to paste up a notice on a tree or on a wall on the lands, and you left it for anybody to come along and read it.  That was a sort of alternative procedure in a particular Act, and I think that this provision that public notice be given is the fairest, in all the circumstances. This is, of course, making the better provision, but I should state that it is not necessary in the circumstances to insist that all the persons interested&mdash; which is a very wide phrase&mdash;would have to be sought out and notice served on them personally before you could proceed to acquire any land.  The provision with regard to the public notice seems to be an equitable one in the circumstances, though it seems better to have some provision for publication in newspapers, once in the Official Gazette and three times in a local paper.</P>

      <P>The position of Ireland at present differs greatly from what it was in 1851.  In those days the land of Ireland was divided amongst a certain number of landed proprietors who had different means of finding out what any public notice was.  Now it is divided up amongst an immense number of very small proprietors who never read the &ldquo;Dublin Gazette&rdquo; and who do not read a Dublin paper more often than once a week It seems very hard that some small man in Connemara, or some place like that, should suddenly find his land snapped away from him before he knew anything about it.

There are objections to that, because the clause is a very long <Col N="742" /> one and certain portions of it would have no bearing here at all.  I do think, however, that it will be necessary to have some insertion made in either sub-clauses 1 or 2.  It would be better, perhaps, in sub-clause (2) to incorporate the principle of notice in three successive weeks in the newspaper circulating in the locality.

He told me he would look into the matter and suggest something on the Report Stage.  The Minister did not say whether agricultural <Col N="744" /> societies would be considered as a body of traders, and I want to know if such societies will get power to make representations when these agreements are put forward.</P>

      <P>The Senator did raise that point on an earlier section, on an amendment to Section 42 which had been moved by Senator Counihan dealing with the carriage of live stock at other than the company's risk. Senator Bennett then raised this question as to co-operative societies.  I said I would inquire whether the word &ldquo;trader&rdquo; should be made to include such bodies as those to which the Senator refers.  I put the matter before the Attorney-General, and I am informed that the word &ldquo;trader&rdquo; must be held to include the type of bodies to which the Senator made reference, and for that reason I did not bring in any amendment.</P>
      <P>I apologise to the Senator for not having given him an explanation earlier when we were dealing with Section 42.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Immediately before Section 67, to insert a new Section 67 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;67.&mdash;When repainting their premises and rolling stock the amalgamated company shall replace all public notices and signs (including names of stations) which are now painted in the English language only by notices and signs in both Irish and English, and shall within one year from the 1st January, 1925, submit to the Minister a scheme for the printing of their Passenger Card Tickets for journeys within the Saorstát in both the Irish and English languages, and the Minister shall, unless he is of opinion that the adoption of the scheme would jeopardise the standard revenue and result in increased rates and fares, order the amalgamated company to put such scheme into operation.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that existing stocks of tickets shall be used until exhausted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> In moving the amendment standing in my name I may say that it has no relation to any of the public notices. The amendment as it appears now was drafted by persons of experience in the railway office, and I understand it is actually accepted by the Government as satisfactory.  I may say that it is only as a compromise that I accept it. It does not give all that I want, but nevertheless it is a step in the right direction.  We have had a long debate on the general subject about Irish and I do not want to start it again, particularly as I believe that this amendment is not likely now to cause any argument.  There was, however, one statement made during the debate on the Committee Stage of this Bill, and on this very amendment which, I think, ought not to be allowed to pass without some reference to it.  It was made in these words: &ldquo;I think the brunt of the fighting and the greatest exertion were borne by men who did not speak a word of the Irish language, and that the experience of those who knew most about the fighting was that the idealists of the Gaelic League and the Gaelic language were very little good as soldiers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I may say this, that personal friends of my own, members of the Fáinne, were killed in the fight which led up to the Treaty.  The rank and file, and even prominent men such, for example, as General Mulcahy and Cathal Brugha, were leading figures in the language movement.  The list of prominent men in the fight who had a knowledge of the Irish language would be too long to recite here.  I think it will be sufficient if I say that the two outstanding men in the fight, Pearse of 1916 and Collins of 1921, were both enthusiastically for the Irish language.  Griffith, while he worked all his life in that particular cause, if he did not know the Irish language himself, at least his two children got the Fáinne last week.</P>

      <P>Senator Jackson's amendment is quite unacceptable altogether.  I did not alter in any way the amendment as drafted by the Government people, because I thought it much better not to touch it.  As regards Senator Jackson's amendment, as far as I see, it will be a dead letter altogether, because it would simply result in the notices required by Statute to be exhibited in the Irish and English languages.  I understand that already these are required to be in Irish and English by Statute, and as far as I see all that Senator Jackson's amendment aims at is to have the notices that are required by Statute to be in Irish and English to have them printed in these languages.  In that way I do not think his amendment is necessary at all. What I am aiming at is to have the names of the stations, indication signs, and so forth, not required to be exhibited by Statute in Irish and English, printed in these languages.  As regards the opening of the new Section that I propose with the words, &ldquo;When re-painting their premises,&rdquo; I am not responsible for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it it is only fair that where the State intervenes to help materially an organisation of this character that some little thing might <Col N="749" /> be expected in return from those who are interested in the railways.  I go farther and put the thing on a rather higher plane than that.  So far as the subject matter of this amendment is concerned, the mover of the amendment has a perfect right, and every Senator who stands up here has a perfect right to speak for all the citizens of the Free State.  The Senator has a perfect right to put forward this amendment, and not only to appeal in favour of it, but to demand that these printed notices be printed in Irish. That is a Constitutional right.  He has a right based upon the Constitution. Irish and English are set out and defined there as being the official languages of the Free State.  In fact, clause 4 of the Constitution gives Irish pride of place as being the official language, and supplementary to that is the statement that English also shall be considered an official language.</P>
      <P>There are many citizens of the Free State who know nothing whatever of the English language&mdash;who can neither read nor write it.  They know nothing whatever of it.  These railway lines run through certain districts in the Free State where the English language is not known.  There are districts where many of the citizens going to the railway station might as well look upon a notice printed in Greek or Hebrew as in English.  They would have to go to an interpreter or, perhaps, to the railway porter, to find out when the train would start for a certain place.  These people may be relatively few, but still they have a Constitutional right and they are entitled to have public notices printed in Irish. I think where the State intervenes and comes to the rescue of organisations of this sort, trading communities, they should insist on these rights being observed; that is, if it is the policy of the State to revive the language and foster it, to give the citizens every facility for using it as a spoken language and reviving its spoken use.  If that is the policy, I think the State and the Government where they intervene should lose no opportunity of inserting clauses which will further that policy.  The time is ripe for testing the actual feeling of the Seanad in this matter of the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> This question will be cropping up periodically in the legislation introduced here.  It is better that, here and now, we should understand what the attitude of the Seanad is to be towards the language movement.  If this language movement has any good in it. if this priceless heritage, as it has been described, is not to be lost it will require the greatest effort on our behalf. If we are not prepared to lend our aid and do our part in giving that revival help then it is simply a matter of mathematical calculation as to how many years with so much decay each year will see the end of the Irish language as the spoken language of this country.  If that is to be the fate of our language, it would be better that we should cut this thing here and now and get on with something else.  If it is dying and if we are a party to that, every man who stands up in this House and gives halting support to this movement is doing his part in facilitating the decay. If the language is to be allowed to die, it is better that we should know here and now and get on with something else.  But would it be a good thing to know and feel that we in this Seanad, who had hitherto a better reputation in these matters than the Dáil &mdash;although we are supposed to be more conservative&mdash;should have responsibility for this?  Would it be a good thing that instead of taking pride in being Irish, a pride in our past, in the traditions that have been handed down to us and in our own most priceless possession of all, we should allow these things to fade away and allow our language to die out?  Would it be a good thing for us and our children, when they travel abroad, that they should have to hang their heads and admit that their ancestors dissipated their heritage?</P>
    <P>If we allow our language to pass away and to decay we become merged and submerged in the great commonwealth of European nations.  We will be no longer a distinctive race; we will have lost the hall marks of nationality. We are all Irishmen here and we have to face facts.  We are not going to go back to where we were before the fight.  We are now Irishmen <Col N="751" /> with our own fate in our own hands, and I think, above all things, we ought to try and preserve the traits and characteristics of our race and be very jealous to guard what we still preserve&mdash;our distinctive nationality. Much has been written and spoken recently about the danger of losing by the accident of fire or otherwise some of the ancient treasures and relics in the Museum here.  One can understand that if these things by any chance were to be destroyed, some evidence of our past civilisation would have disappeared. I am surprised that those who advance these arguments for taking every care of our national treasures, should have a different outlook with regard to the most priceless treasure of all&mdash;the national language, which, if destroyed, cannot be replaced.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here in a former discussion that a railway ticket should not be made a text-book of the Irish language.  Those of us who are students of the language go as often as we possibly can to the text books. Our point is that if you have public notices in the Irish language you have always an open page before you.  As you go along the street, you have an open page in every direction you look. You are constantly brought into touch with the language and it is borne in upon you that you still have a national language.  When other railway companies in other countries were confronted with the same problem, they were equal to it.  They did their part in preserving the language.  Instances were given by Senators here of what has been done in other countries where the same difficulty presented itself and the same question was raised. In those other countries they surmounted the difficulty by the railways, in a patriotic spirit, rising to the occasion and, I suppose at some extra expense, falling in with the public view of the matter.  If there is one thing we ought to try and foster and guard more than another it is our language. It harks back to the very earliest days.  It has been evolved by the civilization that has been spoken of &mdash;our early civilization.</P>
    <P>It is the only self-contained and complete language in Europe.  It is built <Col N="752" /> from its own materials and it has been constructed on its own foundations.  It has not borrowed from any other language. In fact, the most ancient languages in Europe have borrowed from Irish.  That has been told us by very distinguished philologists from different parts of the world.  Senator Doctor Sigerson and Senator Mrs. Stopford Green could speak on this matter.  It is this beautiful language which these eminent men thought fit to travel from distant parts to study in this country that we are now concerned with.  It is a sort of turning point in the fate of the language. If the Seanad takes a strong stand, I think we will impress upon the Government that it is our view that this question of the language is a most important thing from the purely national point of view and that we are determined to conduct our affairs here from that point of view.  If we can succeed in impressing that upon the Government and if the Government will in every branch of its administration let it be known that it is their will to Gaelicise every Department of State, that disposition of the Government will permeate every official and we will have every reason to congratulate ourselves that we have done a very good day's work.</P>

If there is this powerful impetus and national feeling behind all this, why have not any of these proposals been introduced in the more democratic House.

      <P>I do not think, on the amendment we are discussing, that it is necessary to allude to the vast importance of the Irish language as a whole.  We have on more than one occasion in this House by a vast majority declared that we believed Irish is the language of this country and that we believe it ought to be more and more the language of the country.  With these facts, I think we know where we are as regards the feeling of this House on the matter.  We are dealing with a body to be set up by the Oireachtas.  We have, so far as this House is concerned, urged the necessity for the Irish language being part of the equipment of the clerical staff of that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we ask in this amendment is that the matter set out be done as far as practicable (amendment quoted). There are ample loop holes.  I really think the amendment, as proposed, is a very modest one, and I feel certain that no member of this House will vote against it.  As regards the broad question of Irish, there is no doubt at all that you will have a number of people in the various parts of the Saorstát who will be able to read those notices in both languages, but there will be a certain percentage who will be able to <Col N="754" /> read them in one language, but not in the other.  For that reason, I think it is essential that in a country like ours, this modest amendment should be adopted.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2)  If the Amalgamated Company act in contravention of Section 10 of the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, as varied by this section, they shall be liable for each offence to a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds, which shall be recoverable, and applied in the same manner as penalties imposed by the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, are for the time being recoverable and applicable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in lieu of an amendment which stood in the name of Senator the Earl of Kerry on the Committee Stage.  It is modified with a view to meeting the views of the Government in the matter. I do not propose to give either the arguments as to the unnecessary waste incurred and the hardship involved in having to buy shareholders' address books at a price immeasurably below the cost of production.  I want to refer to the meaning of card or <Col N="756" /> other indexes.  If a shareholder wants, say, part of a list of the shareholders, he can get the part without having the whole production.  That is the reason for that part of the thing.  The other two amendments follow on the first one.  The cost proposed does not represent more than a tithe of what the cost will really be, but it renders more remote the frivolous and unnecessary applications for shareholders' address books involving the amalgamated company in a liability.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Third Schedule.&mdash;Page 34.  Before the first paragraph (line 34) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every person who on the 3rd day of April, 1924, was for a period of less than five years an officer or servant of any amalgamating company or absorbed company, and who shall not, prior to the amalgamation or absorption of such amalgamating or absorbed company, have voluntarily retired or have been removed from the service of any such amalgamating or absorbed company by reason of misconduct or incapacity and who does not become an officer or servant of the amalgamated company, shall be entitled to a gratuity calculated on the basis of one-sixth of the amount of his annual salary and emoluments for every completed year of his service.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment would be that employees of not less than five years' service who may become redundant as the result of the operation of this Act shall be entitled to a gratuity calculated on the basis of one-sixth of the annual salary and emoluments for <Col N="757" /> each year of service.  The maximum any employees could get who had less than five years' service would be eight months' salary.  That would be for an employee of four years' standing.  An employee of three years' standing would get six months' salary, and so on.  I think that is reasonable.  It was generally accepted on the Committee Stage that in the case of a man in the clerical staff who had to prepare himself for an examination, when he was turned out of employment he should get something in the way of a gratuity to enable him to tide over the time necessary to get a new post.  It might be impracticable to give them a pension even of a very small amount, because of the difficulty of book-keeping and so forth, but I think this proposition is a reasonable one, particularly in view of the fact that railway directors, irrespective of the time that they are directors, will get compensation although they may have less than five years' service, seeing that they have to be re-elected year after year.  I think in the case of the ordinary employees it is not fair to turn them out owing to the exigencies of the service without giving them some compensation to tide over a difficult period which they will have to face before they get employment, particularly in view of the position of the unemployment market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has said in his remarks that this did apply more particularly with regard to the clerical staff.  When this point was raised previously in the Dáil and even here in the Committee Stage, the amendments were so designed as to cover all employees, but the whole argument proceeded on the basis of the injustice done to the clerical staff. As I remember, the argument was that a man had entered by examination in some competitive way, and went into the service with reasonable hopes of permanency.  That would apply to the clerical staff, but not to the ordinary permanent waymen or other grades.  It would not apply to anyone save the clerical staff.  I know the Senator has put down an amendment which covers all employees.  Even while putting this very comprehensive <Col N="758" /> amendment he is certain that his remarks were particularly directed towards an injustice done to the clerical grade.  The amendment is quite acceptable with reference to the clerical grade, but I would like to see some reason as to why a man who has no hopes of permanency and who would leave and change his employment should now be brought under this and entitled to a gratuity calculated on a particular basis.  I think the amendment is reasonably justifiable as far as the clerical staff is concerned, but not as far as others are concerned.</P>

      <P>I merely stressed the case of the clerical staff because they had a particular training to get in order to qualify for entry to the service, but I would not admit that there is not an exceedingly strong case for the other grades also.  The Minister has not got the correct impression when he says that people enter the railway service with no idea at all that they are to be made permanent.  Every employee who enters the railway service does so on the understanding that it is to be permanent provided he does not misconduct himself.</P>
      <P>In fact, one of the arguments against the high rate of wages is the permanency of the railway service.  In that respect the permanent way-man is just as permanent as the clerical staff.  I would not like to be taken as making a special case for the clerical staff as against any other grade, except the preparation they have to undergo, and the difficulty of getting into clerical service after one reaches 21 years.  Those men who are three years in the service understand they are permanent, and are declared to be permanent, inasmuch as the Ministry of Industry and Commerce exempts them from the operations of the Unemployment Act. Their training is largely of a specialised character and they are not the same use in the commercial world as those in other employments might be.</P>

      <P>I threw out the suggestion, as it appeared to me that the argument was directed towards the clerical staff and the clerical staff only.  The word &ldquo;permanency&rdquo; has been introduced and I used it myself in a relative sense.  Senator O'Farrell asserts that parties other than the clerical staff have the some hope of permanency.  It is not exactly the same.  It is even less relative.  In one case the contract is terminated by a month's notice, and in the other case by a week's notice.  It is a very slight permanency in such a case.  Taking into consideration the present situation, the lack of employment, and the fact that certain men, undoubtedly, if discharged, will simply take refuge in the unemployment benefit I am not disposed to quarrel very violently with Senator O'Farrell in his object in the amendment.  In the absence of any statement that it would put an unsupportable burden on the amalgamated undertaking, I am prepared to go the full length and take the amendment he proposes.</P>

      <P>No.  There is an express reference excluding those charged with misconduct.  The amendment deals merely with people who would ordinarily be in the service of the railway, were it not for the operations of the Bill; whose services were dispensed with because of the amalgamation effected under the Bill.  I might say that people in the railway service start at a very low wage and work up. Anyone with less than 5 years' service will, in the ordinary course, have an exceedingly small salary.  It means that for each year's service such a person will get two months' salary. The amount will be exceedingly small and cannot be a big impost upon the amalgamated company.</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage I endeavoured to explain the object of the change.  It was, if possible, to save certain officers and servants from injustice, who, apparently had been dismissed in order to facilitate the working of the amalgamation. The Minister suggested that I should, if possible, give substantial cases, and that he would then consider them.  My great wish was that we should not build on any particular case, but that there should be a means of allowing those who considered themselves aggrieved by dismissal, to apply to the tribunal, the company or the arbitration board, as the case may be, to have their cases thoroughly investigated. As I live in Dublin, and, having a short time at my disposal, I could only submit one case to the Minister.  Unfortunately it is the case of a senior officer in one of the companies who considered himself aggrieved.  That is Mr. Bennett. I should like to have been able to supplement that with cases of labourers and clerks but the time at my disposal was not sufficient.  I submitted that case to the Minister.  He will be able to form an opinion whether it is desirable to deal with new cases in the manner I suggest, by altering the date, so that anyone who is aggrieved shall have an opportunity of submitting the case to the authority who will arbitrate in these matters.</P>

There may be some cases, such as Senator Sir John Griffith <Col N="761" /> has mentioned but I would point out that were it not for this Bill, those cases, hard though they may be, would not be capable of being re-opened.  I do not think it was intended that this Bill should be availed of as an opportunity for a sort of court of appeal, or a re-trial of the cases of men who may have suffered under previous railway administration.  I think that would lead to abuse, and while I have no strong feeling against the amendment I feel that it is a rather dangerous precedent, and might be availed of to allow cases to be re-opened that should not be re-opened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator Dowdall has stated is, to a certain extent, my answer to the amendment. Senator Sir John Griffith has presented me with one case.  It is quite true that he preferred not to have this amendment based on a specific case, but preferred to have it looked at in another way.  He sent one case to me, and if I am to take it as a typical case, I am, certainly, against the amendment, even on the grounds stated by the Senator.  The case mentioned by the Senator did not give much details, but I got them in another way.  I am quite convinced that this gentleman's dismissal, if it is called dismissal, is not in any way due to the coming of this Bill, or any proposal for amalgamation or other scheme.</P>
      <P>I am informed that legal proceedings have been instituted in the particular case mentioned by the Senator, and it is not a matter into which I should go now.  But no plea is made that the disappearance of the gentleman concerned was due to the coming of this Act.  On the other hand, I would agree with Senator Dowdall that the Bill was not intended to give anybody a weapon with which to re-open cases of hardship, where the hardship simply came about in the ordinary course of railway administration, and was not due to the operations of this Bill, or to the coming of this Bill, and it would have a very definite evil effect, if passed, on a man whom it is sought to protect under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure, for instance, if <Col N="762" /> Senator O'Farrell has adverted to the full meaning of it.  It seeks to strike out the 3rd of April, 1924, and to substitute the 3rd of April, 1923.  It would very definitely rule out a very big number of people who had come in five years previous to the 3rd April, 1924, and while seeking to provide for a very limited number of individual cases of hardship which apparently are known to Senator Sir John Griffith, it would rule out a big body of men whose interests are sought to be guarded by the clause as it stands.  In regard to the one case mentioned, believing as I do that the bringing in of the amendment would defeat the interests of a large number of men to whom justice must be done, I must oppose the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and negatived.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">

      <P>Third Schedule.  Page 35 Immediately after the words &ldquo;shall be&rdquo; in line 11, to insert the words &ldquo;in the case of an officer or servant with less than five completed years of service a gratuity calculated at the rate of one-sixth of his remuneration and emoluments for each completed year of his service, and in the case of an officer or servant with not less than five completed years of service.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment which I held over on the last occasion to find out what the Minister was prepared to do. As the Bill stands it provides that any promotion that took place between the 3rd April, 1923, and the 3rd April, 1924, shall not count in the event of the person becoming redundant, and his salary for the purpose of calculating rates of compensation shall be the salary he had prior to the date of his promotion, no matter at what time the redundancy took place.  I pointed out that the very wide and sweeping effect of that affected hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people promoted from one grade to another.  I notice that there is a Government amendment which seeks to exclude from that provision grades dealt with in the agreement between the railway companies and the trade unions.  To that extent it certainly protects the rank and file, and all the staff, with the exception, I <Col N="763" /> think, of the officers.  If I might say a word for the officers I think it is hardly fair that they should be excluded. The majority of them were members of the ordinary rank and file up to the time they got their promotion. In some cases they have been waiting for it for ten years, and even longer, and it just happened that the promotion became available after the 3rd April, 1923.  They are now to be deprived of the benefits of that promotion and when they become redundant their compensation is to be based on the salaries they had before the 3rd April, 1923.  It was unfortunate for them that the particular vacancies arose within that period, but in view of the fact that at most there are only a few known cases I hardly think that it is fair that they, who have been the victims of circumstances, should be punished because of what was really an accident in the matter of vacancies falling due.</P>

      <P>I have to urge, sir, that the next amendments be accepted in place of this&mdash;amendments 30 and 31.  They have reference to this particular portion of the Schedule. This is a very difficult portion of the Schedule.  It is one that we have chopped and changed many times, and I am not even yet sure that we have got the matter right.  I think I met all the arguments that Senator O'Farrell put on Committee Stage.  I did emphasise here what the object of the limitation was.  It was to remove from the operation of the Schedule people who received promotion within a particular period, that period being the period after which notice had been served on the railway companies that no official promotions were to be made, that is to say, it was not to cut out the ordinary natural promotions in certain grades, but where men were lifted unnecessarily that we did not intend, and we do not now intend, that they shall get compensation based on the proper scale.  The only thing we have to take care of is that in cutting out people of this type we should not do any injustice to men who had got promotion in the ordinary way.  Senator O'Farrell did the last time, I think, admit that <Col N="764" /> that met the position as far as the people in whom he got interested were concerned, and he said that he left the spokemanship of other interests to those who would be better able to represent them.  I did not hear from any other interests concerned, and I am not even clear that the particular type of officials to whom the Senator refers are not technically within the grades dealt with in the agreement, because these official grades to which the Senator refers are, I understand, mentioned in order to be exempted, but they are in that technical sense a grade dealt with under the agreement between the railway companies and the trade unions, and would, I believe, be brought in.  I have not had it proved to me that they will not be brought in, and I believe they would be, and until the other case is made clear to me I am going to abide by the Government amendment No. 30, fortified by 31.</P>

I suggest that instead of the words &ldquo;domestic fowls and ducks&rdquo; the word &ldquo;poultry&rdquo; should be used.

    <P>(d)  that there has been any contravention (whether by way of commission or of omission) of this Act or any regulations made thereunder on the premises.</P>
    <P>(4)  Before altering or cancelling (otherwise than in accordane with an application in that behalf made under this section) the registration of any premises under this Act, the Minister shall give at least one fortnight's notice in writing of his intention so to cancel or alter such registration to the registered proprietor, and shall consider any representations made before the expiration of such notice by such proprietor, and may if he thinks fit cause an inquiry to be held in relation to the matter.</P>

      <P>I would much prefer to hear what the Dáil has to say, and whatever statement the President has to put before it.  This is a matter in which everybody takes great interest.  It is a question that we ought to discuss with due notice and full information.  I would be quite against discussing it on Friday.</P>

      <P>I hope to have the information to-morrow about the Estimates. The matter is already in some sort of order.  I have not been able to look into it, and see if it is satisfactory for presentation.</P>

      <P>We will leave it that way.  We will settle to-morrow whether we can discuss this question with additional information on Friday.  If, on the other hand, information is not available we can postpone the discussion until next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to mention, with regard to this matter, that I think as a matter of procedure it would be much more convenient to the Seanad if the motion to adopt the report were withdrawn, and a resolution of a definite character were put down pledging the Seanad to either one or other of the two recommendations&mdash;that is to say, a motion that the Seanad approve of the proposal to take over Leinster House.  An amendment could be moved to go elsewhere. Further you could put down a resolution to go elsewhere, and an <Col N="779" /> amendment could be moved to stay in Leinster House.  That would be a more convenient way of eliciting the opinion of the Seanad than the motion that the Report be confirmed.  That is a matter for ourselves to consider.  I would like the Seanad to hear a statement from Senator Douglas as regards the business outstanding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that it is the intention of the Dáil to meet until about the 16th or 18th of July and then adjourn, to meet again a week or so later to consider any outstanding business that may come back to them from the Seanad.  That information was given to Senator Brown and myself by the Attorney-General as the then intention of the Government.  But we know that good intentions are not always capable of being carried out to the full.  We may take it, however, that is substantially the plan of the Dáil at present.  There is a large number of Bills, many of them of a minor character, and it seems to me from the conversation I had with members of the Seanad that it would be much more convenient if some sort of time table could be arranged for the taking of these Bills.  I think so far as I can see, unless we spend a great deal of time over some motions, that we could meet for a reasonable time say, to-morrow and Friday and probably on Wednesday and Thursday and Friday of next week.  We would have disposed of most of the business that is likely to come before us by then with possibly one or two meetings on the following week if it be found necessary to hold them.  It would depend to some extent on the number of amendments that may be moved to Bills.  On to-morrow we promised to take the Fifth Stage of the Railways Bill and also the Fourth and Fifth Stages of the Unemployment Insurance Bill.  Senator O'Farrell has put down a motion to enable that to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Also the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Also the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  There were a number of Bills received last night which technically could not be taken <Col N="780" /> until Friday but I would submit to the Seanad that the Second Stage might be taken with a view to having the Committee Stage on Wednesday, which would give Senators ample time to consider amendments.  The Bills are: The Local Elections (Postponement) Bill, 1924; The Indemnity Bill, 1924; The Telephone Capital Bill, 1924 (a Money Bill); The Trades' Loans Guarantee Bill, 1924; The Damage to Property (Compensation) (Amendment) Bill, 1924; The Fisheries (Election of Conservators) Postponement Bill, 1924.  There are two Bills which I got leave to introduce and which are being circulated and printed&mdash;the Oireachtas Witnesses Oaths Bill and the Private Bill Costs Bill.  They are largely of a non-controversial character and I suggest that the Second Stage of them might be taken so that the Committee Stage could be taken early next week.  If there is general agreement on these two Bills, it would be desirable that they should reach the Dáil, if possible, and become law before the adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that the Seanad agree to take the Second Stage of these Bills to-morrow&mdash;most of them being unlikely to cause any lengthy discussion&mdash;thus having a day in between the Bills which were before us to-day but which were not apparently of a controversial character.  They could be taken on Friday in Committee with the report on the accommodation of the Oireachtas.  The Bills are: The Local Government (Rates on Agricultural Land) Bill, The Criminal Justice Administration Bill, The Criminal Justice (Evidence) Bill, and the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Continuance Amendment Bill.  That would give us a reasonable amount of business for Friday.  The other Bills which have been before us and which might also I think be taken are: The Dublin Police Bill&mdash;Report Stage; The Dáil Eireann Courts (Winding Up) Bill&mdash; Report Stage; and the National Health Insurance Bill&mdash;Report Stage.  As there was no amendment to any of these Bills on the Committee Stage, it is reasonable that the Report Stage be taken on Friday.  If there had been amendments in Committee, I would <Col N="781" /> have been opposed to taking them on this Stage on two days' notice.</P>
    <P>If this were done, the House, it seems to me, could adjourn then until the following Wednesday, when the Committee Stage of a number of Bills, the Second Stage of which we are proposing to take to-morrow, might be taken.  None of these Bills is likely to take any great amount of time in Committee with the exception of the Trade Loans Guarantee Bill, which is an important Bill, and which, I imagine, will take a considerable amount of consideration in Committee. But there will be from to-morrow until Wednesday for considering and putting down amendments.  On Wednesday the House could then consider, in view of the nature of the Bills, whether it was prepared to meet again on Thursday and Friday and take the final stages of these Bills, or whether it would be desirable to postpone the final stages of these Bills until the following week.  I have mentioned, I think, all the Bills which have reached us up to the present.</P>
    <P>In addition to these Bills, there are, I think, eight Bills before the Dáil, and I, personally, do not know whether they are going to reach us before the adjournment or not.  There is the Local Government Bill, which, I understand, is definitely postponed.  There is the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which seems to be indefinitely postponed.  I do not know exactly the position with regard to it.  The State Harbours Bill has been referred to a Committee, and it seems doubtful whether it will reach us or not before the adjournment, but I am told that it may.  The Dairy Produce Bill was referred to a Committee, and the Committee, I understand, is now in a position to report.  I do not know when the Report and Final Stage will be taken in the Dáil, but in any case it is not likely that we will have it in time to deal with.  There is the Military Service Pensions Bill and the Local Officers Compensation (War Period) Bill.</P>
    <P>There is the Intermediate Education <Col N="782" /> Amendment Bill, which, I think, will probably reach us.  A Bill which was introduced yesterday, the Drainage Maintenance Bill, 1924, will not, I think, reach us.  It would seem as if in all probability we will have to meet for one or two days the week after next, after the Dáil has adjourned, to finish up our business.  I have carefully, with the assistance of the Assistant Clerk, gone through these Bills, and, as far as I can see, that is a correct statement of the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be a number of these Bills that are not pressing.  If that is so, I think, in view of the fact that they have been rushed in upon us at this hour, we ought to be very slow in going through them.  If there is no hurry about them why should we not give them a Second Reading and let them stand over until after we meet again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Seanad should consider that, in the case of each Bill, and I have suggested that we should take the Second Reading to-morrow. Most of these Bills are small Bills.  My own view is that a Bill that would be important is the Trades Loan Guarantee Bill.  Most of the others are regarded by Ministers as important because they are mostly small amending Bills which they want to get through. I think it is important that the Trades Loan Guarantee Bill should be passed before the summer.  Otherwise its effect would be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think as each Bill comes up to be read a second time we will then see whether it is a Bill we should give reasonable and proper time to, and whether it is or is not an urgent Bill.  If it is not an urgent Bill, I think we ought to let it stand over.  If it is urgent, let us dispose of it.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.20 p.m., until 3 o'clock on Thursday, the 10th July.</P>
