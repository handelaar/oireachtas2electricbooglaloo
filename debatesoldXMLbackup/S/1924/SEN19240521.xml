      <P>Before we go into the Orders of the Day I rise to ask permission on the Motion for the Adjournment to call the attention of the Seanad to a matter of public importance. It is in connection with the statement made by the President in the Dáil the other day as to the conclusion of the Session before July 4th and the effect of that on the business of the Seanad before the end of the Session.</P>

      <P>Very well, you will have your opportunity on the adjournment.  I have to inform the Seanad that in pursuance of the Standing Orders the Speaker of the Dáil and myself, as Chairman of the Seanad, have appointed Senator James Douglas to be Chairman of the Joint Committee to which the Sligo Lighting and Electric Power Bill, 1924, has been referred by both Houses.  I have further to inform the Seanad that in pursuance of Standing Orders the Joint Committee on Standing Orders relating to Private Business have nominated the following Senators to serve on that Committee&mdash; Mr. Thos. Farren, Sir John Keane and Mrs. Costello.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like that the Minister would be here to explain particularly one question in connection with this Bill.  The Bill gives certain <Col N="110" /> powers to the Dublin Corporation, and I should like to know if those powers now devolve on the Commissioners who have been appointed to supplant the suppressed Corporation.  Will all the powers and duties conferred by this Bill on the Corporation devolve on the new body, or will it be necessary, before any progress can be made, to have a new Corporation elected, and functioning in the ordinary way?  With the general principle of this Bill I presume there will be no quarrel.  I think the pity is that it was not introduced earlier.  If the passing of the Bill is necessary to start the work, I wonder could the Government exercise any influence on people responsible for starting the work, particularly in O'Connell Street, with a view to getting them to commence?  We have seen statements in the Press regarding the decoration of Dublin streets with regard to the Tailteann Games, but I think that any attempt made at decorating in this way would render us grotesque unless some serious attempt is made to remove the highly objectionable and far from picturesque ruins in O'Connell Street.  They have not even the saving grace of being picturesque, otherwise we might point them out with a certain amount of pride to visitors to our city.  They are an objectionable eyesore, and to the man in the street there is no reason why that part of the work of clearing the ruins should not have been started long ago. I hardly think that it was necessary to wait for the passing of this Bill to enable that work to be started.  I know that the Corporation will probably find it necessary to assert certain powers with regard to the alignment of buildings, but I do not think that any persons will be prejudiced in their rights by clearing away the ruins.  There is a large amount of employment involved there which is very badly needed in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 gives the Corporation powers to sell any sites upon which building has not been started, or having been started has been discontinued within á period of two years after the passing of the Bill.  I believe that that period should be shorter.  It is an extraordinary <Col N="111" /> length of time&mdash;two years from now, or four years from the period in which the buildings were destroyed. Any prospective builder who has not started within the next six or eight months must have extraordinary reasons for not starting, and I think that these reasons should be sufficient to enable the Corporation to take over the site and sell it to somebody who is prepared to build on it. It is deplorable, especially when you consider what has been done in other cities.  We have read about the burning of San Francisco, Baltimore and other cities, and we are filled with admiration when we see these cities rise phoenix-like after their destruction.  In London, after the destruction of part of the East End as the result of an ammunition explosion, the stones were hardly cold when re-building started. Where the community has compensated people for destruction done to their property, and where public money has been voted and decreed by the courts as compensation, I think it is only reasonable that these people should be asked not to waste further time in expending that money for the purposes for which it has been voted.  I hope that the Government will exercise its influence in seeing that the money is spent at once, and that the delay in re-building shall not be a day longer than is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>With much of the last speaker's remarks, I think, we are all in agreement.  I look upon that part of O'Connell Street which is in ruins rather feelingly, as I am concerned with reference to the expedition of the re-building. I seriously tell Senator O'Farrell that if he and those with him who are interested give an assurance that there will be no labour disputes that will not be submitted to arbitration, it will make a great many of us hurry up in the re-building without any Enactment or Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect we will be starting the clearing of the sites pretty soon.  With regard to Section 6 we must all agree that it is a very revolutionary clause and, to some extent, it strikes at private property.  We have to be very cautious as to how we extend any legislation along those lines. Two years would be considered in America, say, an exceptionally long time, but when you take into consideration the state of unrest and the uncertainty with regard to business I think it is only rational that we should allow two years in a matter of this kind.</P>

    <Title>OLD AGE PENSIONS BILL, 1924. (REPORT).</Title>
    <P>The following Government amendments were agreed to by the Seanad:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Section 1.  To delete in lines 25 and 26 the words &ldquo;2nd day of May,&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;20th day of June.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(2)  Section 3, sub-section (2).  Immediately after the word &ldquo;week,&rdquo; in line 46, to insert the words, &ldquo;to a <Col N="113" /> person who, on the first appointed day, shall not have attained the age of eighty years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(3.)  Section 3.  To add at the end of Section 3 two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  If any person whose pension is reduced or terminated in pursuance of a ruling by the pension officer under this section claims that by reason of his age his pension should not have been liable to be so reduced or terminated, such person may appeal against such reduction or termination as the case may be to the local pension committee, who shall consider the matter and give their decision thereon in the same manner and subject to the like appeal to the central pension authority as if the ruling of the pension officer under this section was the report of a pension officer on a claim referred to him for report and inquiry under Section 7 of the Act of 1908.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  An appeal against the ruling of a pension officer reducing or terminating a pension under this section shall not suspend the operation of such ruling, but if the appeal is finally determined in favour of the pensioner, he shall be entitled to receive all sums which would have been payable to him if the ruling of the pension officer had been in accordance with such final determination.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad hereby resolves that the attention of the President and his colleagues of the Executive Council be directed to a report contained in the Dublin Press of the eighth day of May, 1924, of certain proceedings before District Justice Goff at the Courthouse, Castleblayney, from which it appears that he asked a prisoner whether it was not a fact that the soldiers during the Great War had to take rum to brutalise them before being sent into action, as in the opinion of the Seanad such a suggestion is an outrage and an insult to the memory of the many thousands of brave Irishmen who fought and fell in the war.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Sir BRYAN MAHON</NameTxt>
      <P>I changed that in the amended form.  He was both, as a matter of fact.  Several members of this Seanad have served in his Majesty's army and can corroborate the statements which I am about to make.  I am sure that the whole of the Seanad will view with as much disgust as I do the insult that has been passed on a brave Irish soldier.  This man was a soldier in one of our oldest and most distinguished regiments, namely, the Connaught Rangers.  The man had earned the highest distinction which any soldier in the British army could earn, namely, the Victoria Cross, for bravery.  He made a statement that he was a teetotaller.  I can see no reason why that statement should be doubted. Teetotalism is not an uncommon thing in the army.  I myself joined an Irish regiment when I was a boy, and I have had to do with Irish soldiers all through my service.  I commanded Irish soldiers in the South African War and also in the Great War.  I commanded a division of picked Irish soldiers in the Great War, and later on, one of his Majesty's armies.  I ought to be in a position to know if what I am saying is accurate.  As far as the accusation is concerned, that the soldiers had been brutalised by giving them an issue of rum before they went into action, it is absolutely untrue. There is an issue of rum as a ration to every soldier when he goes an active service.  The issue consists of a very small quantity called a &ldquo;tot,&rdquo; equal to about a half-glass.  Very often the men do not get that ration, the principal reason being that if there is a rapid advance there is difficulty in getting it up to the fighting line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Seanad that there is no foundation for the statement that rum or any other stimulant has ever been issued to soldiers in the British Army to induce them to advance.  As far as our Irish soldiers are concerned, <Col N="119" /> I am glad to say that there has been no necessity to give them rum or any other stimulant to make them advance. What the Irish soldier wants is the command to go forward and to be properly led.  Many of these soldiers have served in the Irish Free State Army and I believe they are still serving in it.  The Irish soldier has for centuries served in practically every country, and in every Army, in Europe, and has always maintained the highest traditions of efficiency and bravery. Irish soldiers have fought for different causes, and very often for different sides, but whatever the cause, they maintained the great reputation, and still maintain it, that they have earned for themselves.  The first slur that has ever been cast to my knowledge on Irish soldiers has been cast by a fellow-countryman. This insult has also been levelled at the British Army, in which a great many Senators have had the honour to serve.  Whether Senators have been connected with the British Army or not I feel quite certain that there is not a Senator who would not condemn this insult to a body of men who were not present and could not answer it.  In Ireland the British Army has always been respected and has been received with welcome and hospitality. I feel convinced that the Seanad would disapprove of the slur that has been cast on that Army in its absence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion, not because a foolish person is said to have made foolish statements, but because there is a great deal of misunderstanding in this country, and a great deal of foolish remarks made about Irish soldiers.  These remarks are mostly made by people who know very little about Irish history.  I think it is opportune to say a few words now about Irish soldiers, their character, and their actions regarding their own country.  I do not know what District Justice Goff's national record is, but I do know that the national record of Irish soldiers is of the very highest. Their self-sacrifice for their own country has been quite on a level, and has probably been a great deal more than that of any other part of the population. I will probably say things now that many people will not be in agreement <Col N="120" /> with, because I speak from an entirely different point of view to that of Senator Sir Bryan Mahon.  Going back to my earliest recollections of the time of the Fenians, they found more support in military barracks than they did in the country.  Numbers of Irish soldiers joined the Fenians and drilled them.  The Fenians were not at all ashamed of the fact.  We know from James Stevens, who was a head centre of the Fenians, at that time, what support and help they got from Irish soldiers. In those days there was no one to raise a word against Irish soldiers.</P>
      <P>Coming along to the next period in which there was any rising, or attempted rising, in this country, we come to the Irish Volunteers which were raised in the years 1913-14, for reasons I will not go into, but which are well known.  These Volunteers were organised in about a year.  We organised 170,000 Irish Volunteers, who were joined by practically every ex-soldier in Ireland.  I think we calculated at that time that about 30,000 Irish ex-soldiers joined the Volunteers, and they made the backbone of that organisation, and in every village the Volunteers were drilled by ex-soldiers. To my knowledge every corps in Dublin was drilled by them.  Not a word was then said about Irish soldiers, and in these cases they received no remuneration at all; they came out voluntarily and sacrificed their time and everything else to do the work of the country, and to my knowledge very many of them underwent great dangers in doing so.  I happened to be in the North on one occasion, and I found&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I mean to say is this, that the Irish soldiers have established a record, and I am very much astonished that my friends opposite interfered in my speaking about the character of Irish soldiers.  It seems to me extraordinary that they should do so, but everybody takes his own line.  Irish soldiers have throughout history always shown the greatest patriotism and self-sacrifice.  Let us come to the point.  Who is this particular man against whom these charges were made?  He was a Connaught Ranger, a man of my own regiment. He was a man who earned the Victoria Cross for gallantry; he belonged to a regiment which made the greatest sacrifices that any regiment could possibly have made in the service of Ireland; they had sacrificed everything that made life dear to them, and when a man of this sort is brought up on a charge the District Justice is said&mdash;I do not know whether he did or not&mdash; to have travelled far outside the limits of his jurisdiction.  The facts as to what a man did in France has nothing whatsoever to do with it.  What business has he to raise any such questions? Only for the purpose of insulting a brave man and an Irish soldier who, like all other Irish soldiers, had served his country loyally and well.  I think I may add this, that I wish Irishmen would have a little more toleration towards those who differ from them in politics or in action.  In my time I have known a great many different Parties which arose in this country&mdash;the Parnellites, the O'Brienites, the Healyites, the Dillonites, Sinn Feiners, Republicans, and Free Staters. <Col N="122" /> Every one of these have spent their time in attacking each other.  As far as I know, not one of them gained any advantage whatsoever from the abuse they heaped on each other.  On the contrary, they went down in proportion to the abuse they gave.  I think that will always be the fact, and when the late troubles began, I was first to hope that that would be dropped.  However, one of the worst parts of this business, if it is true, is that here is a judge who is in a privileged position in which he cannot be answered; neither witness nor prisoner can make any retort to charges of that kind; they must be submitted to.  I think it is a very mean and cowardly action, if it were done, to stand up in a position of authority in that way and make charges, not only against a particular man, but against that whole class of man in Ireland, and I, for one, hope that such things will be stopped in future.  As I have not been allowed to say all I wish to say, I shall sit down.</P>

      <P>I regret that I must dissent from this motion.  If the facts are as set out here, my feelings are precisely the same as those of the mover. We all respect brave men, whether they belong to the British army or the National army.  I am sorry to have to oppose this motion, if the facts are as stated, but I feel we are entering on a very dangerous course if we, in either House of the Legislature, begin publicly to criticise men put on the Bench.  I am so strongly in favour of the independence of those occupying judicial positions that I would have preferred that not even a single resident magistrate who had been appointed should have been interfered with in his office Here, in a very early stage, censure by this House is being put on this man without actually knowing really whether this report is true or not.  If it is true, my feelings are as those of the mover and seconder, but even in such a case I think that we had better leave such a judge to the opinion of his fellow judges, or perhaps to some official superior who may draw attention to the matter.  I regret to have to oppose this, but in the higher interests of the independence of the administration of justice I must do so.</P>

      <P>I rise to say, Sir, that I cannot support the motion for several reasons.  This is a legislative assembly and I do not think it is a good precedent to set, at the outset of its career, to bring forward motions other than motions tending to, or leading towards, legislation.  Anything else I think would turn the Seanad simply into a platform for the expression of views of one kind or another. It has been my experience of public life that in public Boards, when we got away from the business, we lost a great deal of time and did not secure for ourselves a great deal of consideration.  I hope that this motion will not be passed for that reason, and I think that the mover and seconder could have taken another and an easier course to find out if the report in the Press was a true report.  There is a Minister in charge of District Justices, and I think that the Minister is sufficiently accessible for either the mover or seconder to approach and find out if the report is true or if it is not.  I also strongly object to the motion for this reason: a Press report that I never saw is taken as the basis of it.  The only reference that I saw to this occurrence was in Mr. Stephen Gwynn's article in the &ldquo;Observer&rdquo; of Sunday week.  He there drew attention to the statement as outlined in Senator Sir Bryan Mahon's motion.</P>

      <P>I saw it in the &ldquo;Observer,&rdquo; and I did not see it in the Irish papers, though I read them carefully. When District Justices were wanted fifteen months ago, I think few people were very anxious to take up the work.  The work was difficult, and the District Justice practically carried his life in his hands.  I think that to discuss the action of one of these men now is most unfair.  In public life, if a person utter words that are objectionable he is brought somewhere and asked is this true or not, and he is given an opportunity to state the why and wherefore, and why he made the remark.  I think the same should be the case with a District Justice.  We have not been told by the mover or seconder of the motion what the charge <Col N="124" /> against this ex-soldier was.  He was charged with having poteen in his possession.  The District Justice operates in County Monaghan, and I believe the traffic in poteen there is on a very large scale.  Whoever was defending him sought to bring in extraneous matters.  The first thing brought in was that this man, who was charged with having poteen in his possession, was a V.C.  The District Justice said that was extraneous. Whoever was defending this man said this man is a teetotaller, and the District Justice said, &ldquo;How can you be a teetotaler?  When you were an English soldier you had your rum ration served out to you.&rdquo; That is the case.  We are asked to come here and sit in judgment on a young man who, I understand, is doing difficult and dangerous work in the country for the last fifteen months in an able and conscientious manner.  For this reason I will not vote for the motion.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to agree with the two Senators who have just spoken, because surely it is the province of this House to draw attention to and criticise whatever may strike the House as a misdemeanour on the part of a public servant, no matter who or what he may be.  I think we should be neglecting our duty if we failed to draw attention to so grave a lapse from duty as it appears Mr. Justice Goff has been guilty of.  Senator Mrs. Wyse Power spoke as if the question of what the man who was before Mr. Justice Goff was accused of, was the point at issue.  That has nothing to do with it.  What we object to are the words which Mr. Justice Goff is reported to have made use of.  According to the report I read, Mr. Justice Goff asked whether it was a fact that the soldiers during the Great War had to take rum to brutalise them before being sent into action.  These are the words complained of.  When I read the report of Mr. Justice Goff's remarks in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo;&mdash;and I fancy it was in the &ldquo;Independent,&rdquo; too, but perhaps Mrs. Wyse Power does not study these newspapers&mdash;my first feeling was one of astonishment that a public servant in Mr. Justice Goff's position could so far forget himself.  I <Col N="125" /> hoped that he was wrongly reported, but there has been a certain amount said about it in the papers&mdash;there was a leading article in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo;&mdash;and it is hardly conceivable if Mr. Justice Goff did not use these words that some contradiction by this time would not have appeared.</P>
      <P>I am, therefore, reluctantly compelled to believe he did make use of these words of which we complain.  When I think of what we owe to these men who gave and risked their lives in our defence, and when I think of the tyranny from which they saved us by their heroic self-sacrifices, tyranny probably compared to which the worst oppression ever complained of in this country would be liberty indeed, and when I think Mr. Justice Goff dared to insult not only the living among these men but the dead, and that he dared to make use of a Free State court of justice as the platform from which to utter these abominable calumnies, then, Sir, I find it very difficult to find words in which to express the indignation I feel.  I can make every allowance for the length to which ignorant prejudice may lead a man, but there are limits. One must draw the line somewhere, and I draw it at insults to those men whom the people of the British Empire and the great nations allied with it have delighted to honour.  I hope that the House will, in spite of what has been said by other speakers, express its condemnation of Mr. Justice Goff's action in no uncertain voice.  I am glad the Minister for Home Affairs is here to hear that condemnation expressed, and I hope we will hear from him that it will reach Mr. Justice Goff's ears. I should like to hope that he will be able to tell us that either Mr. Justice Goff should be called on to make such an apology as may do something to soothe the outraged feelings of the men whom he so foully slandered, or else resign the Commission of the Peace which, I think, we have only too good reason to fear he is quite unfitted to hold.</P>

      <P>Before dealing with the matter in hand, I would like to express to the Seanad my <Col N="126" /> regret that a matter for which I am responsible came before them in my absence.  I was dealing with a Bill in the Dáil at the time and I became involved in a discussion and found it difficult to get away.  I am also sorry I did not hear the statement of the mover of this motion.  I would like to have spoken after the seconder, and I had intended doing so if I could, as I was anxious to prevent, if possible, this matter becoming the subject of a debate which might tend to become a heated debate.  I might be acquitted perhaps of any feeling of agreement or sympathy with Mr. Justice Goff's remarks. I have none.  An older brother of mine was killed in France, and there is scarcely a home or hamlet in this country that did not send its quota to that world war.</P>
      <P>That is a thing that none of us forget.  Now, having said that, let me say that if Mr. Justice Goff was guilty of an indiscretion or an error of judgment he was guilty of it in following a thoroughly bad and a thoroughly unsound tradition which existed in this country.  I do appeal that this should not be allowed to become a matter of party feeling.  Every Senator knows in this country that it was customary for Resident Magistrates, County Court Judges, and Justices of the High Courts to indulge in <i>obiter dicta</i> of a quasi political nature, and in remarks which were bound to give offence to, and to rub the wrong way, a large section of the community.  That is a thing to be deprecated and avoided, a thing which, I hope, Justices and Judges in the future will avoid, but that it has been the tradition and the practice here, there is no denying.  Looking across the Channel to what is euphemistically described as another place, we find these people in eminent judicial positions&mdash;Law Lords&mdash;indulging also in very partisan and envenomed political harangues.  I think it is as wrong there as here.  I think it is wrong everywhere that people who are appointed to positions to administer the law should go outside their sphere and indulge in remarks or suggestions that cannot but give pain to sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let us not magnify the thing, <Col N="127" /> let us not talk about abominable calumny.  Mr. Justice Goff put a question from behind which there peeped out a certain political bias and partisan outlook with regard to events that are passed.  That is the sum total of it.  Mr. Justice Goff was not appointed to his position as a skilled politician, but for his knowledge of law and knowledge of Irish, and as I say if he overstepped the mark in this matter, it is a mark which has been well overstepped in the past by people occupying similar posts.  If we are to have good will and unity here, there must be a scattering of old landmarks, and anything which tends to revive past feelings of bitterness or tension is to be deplored.  There was a suggestion that there was a Ministry responsible for the District Justices which could properly be asked about their doings and sayings.  This is not quite the position, and nowhere was there stronger feelings in favour of the complete independence of judges than in this House.  The price you pay for that complete aloofness and independence is that when there are indiscreet remarks either from Judges of Appeal or from Judges of the High Court or from District Justices you must simply be philosophic about it and let it pass.</P>
    <P>The doings and sayings of judges and justices cannot and ought not to be brought under review in either the Dáil or the Seanad.  There have been sayings from the Bench which, if it were a proper thing, might well have been brought under review by a motion in the Dáil within the last two years, but they were not brought under review because people recognised that it was better that we should simply swallow those things and let them pass, remembering that once you put a man in a position of independence to administer the law you must simply trust to his own discretion and good taste to avoid giving offence.  I would ask the mover and seconder of this resolution whether there is anything to be gained by pressing it to a division so that people may take party lines on the matter and that some who really deplore that the words were spoken would appear to be standing over the District Justice's remarks and others <Col N="128" /> would appear to be condemning them in a personal or bitter way.  I think that Senator Sir Bryan Mahon having made his protest&mdash;and I can well understand how he feels about the matter&mdash; should be content to withdraw his resolution and let the matter rest, remembering that if judges who are older, more mature, and have greater experience have erred, and erred badly in this respect in the past, it is not a source of great surprise that a District Justice of a year's standing might also err.</P>

      <P>Even though the Minister has spoken, it does not get us away from the fact that the question resolves itself into whether this Seanad is to be turned into an instrument to teach manners to badly mannered justices. I intend to oppose the motion, because I do not think that the Seanad should be made a party to such misconduct and because even though I object strongly to the hypocrisy and mischievous insult of Mr. Justice Goff, I do not think that this Seanad should be called upon or be put at the mercy of anyone who proposes resolutions expressing disapproval of the justices' conduct, because there may be no end to this sort of comment on District Justices. I would just like to remark this, that the chief objection, I think, is to the use of the word &ldquo;brutal,&rdquo; and to the attitude of mind that seeks to make people believe that soldiers should go into action on buttermilk.  If I were required to go over the top, I would require more than a tot of rum, and would be inclined to linger until it was brought up to the front line.  When a man talks about soldiers he should talk honestly.  I think I have shown that I am as heartily opposed to this breach of manners as General Sir Bryan Mahon, but I am not satisfied that the Seanad should be the vehicle of disapproval of mistakes that may be made in the future, otherwise we will be at the mercy of everyone with a grievance or a sore head.</P>

      <P>I rise to call attention to a matter of public importance in connection with the business of this House during the remainder of the present Session.  I take it that every member of this House has seen the statement made the other day in the Dáil by the President, that it was the intention of the Government if possible to bring the Session of the Dáil to a close on or about the 4th July.  Now, we all know there are at present in various stages some fourteen or fifteen Bills going through the Dáil.  I am also aware that there are certain other Bills, of a more or less formal nature, which will not excite any lengthy discussion but which it is important should be passed before the end of the present Session. This is the 21st May and there are only six weeks between the present date and the 4th July.  From what you have told us there will be no business for the Seanad next week, which means that we will not meet till this day fortnight. That leaves us only four weeks to get through the legislative work of the House before the Dáil rises.  It is, therefore, impossible that the Seanad could deal with those matters of legislation before the 4th July.  We all sympathise with the Government who, at the close of a long and trying Session, are anxious to get their legislation through, and I am sure every member is anxious to unite and assist them in this matter.  After all that will not excuse us for hasty and unconsidered legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had in the past, from time to time, owing to the state of the country, legislation of an emergency type.  I think I may say that this House recognises on all occasions the necessity of coming to the assistance of the Government and passing legislation of that kind.  We all hope the necessity for that kind of thing is now gone and that in the future we will have time to give due consideration to all Bills that come before us.  If we are to do that we must have time to consider them. <Col N="130" /> I, therefore, suggest that in the case of Bills of any importance we should insist under our Standing Orders on having the full time allotted to us between the Second Reading of a Bill and the Committee Stage, and between the Committee Stage and the Report Stage.  I hold that the most important intervals for this House are those between the Second Reading and the Committee stage and between the committee and the Report Stages.  We have only a week under our Standing Orders to prepare necessary amendments.  Many of us are business men, and many of us live in the country.  It is also necessary when the Bill has been discussed in Committee to have at least a week to consider the effect of the amendments passed and to see the Bill with those amendments in it before Report.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, that for the future we should take the full time allotted to us by our Standing Orders and insist on it except in the case of emergency legislation.  If this is to be done it is clear that in the case of the Bills now in the Dáil we cannot deal with them in one month before the 4th July.  It is for this reason that I have thought it necessary, as a matter of public importance, to bring this before the House.  I think the Government should let us know which of the Bills now before the Dáil, and the Bills that are to be introduced between now and the 4th July, they think should be carried through both Houses before they rise.  I am certain that this House will facilitate them to the utmost to carry out their intentions.  All I insist on is that it is impossible to carry through all those Bills in the present Session.  We are willing to carry through what the Government thinks are the more pressing of their Bills, but we ought to take the necessary time for the discussion of those Bills.  Another question that will arise, after we have obtained the opinion and the wishes of the Government with regard to this Session, has reference to the fact that the Dáil will have Bills which we will not be able to pass this Session.  It will be a question for this House when they are to deal with those Bills.  It would be important that those Bills should be ready before they meet again in October.  Therefore, it would <Col N="131" /> be necessary for us to sit on when the Dáil rises, or rise with the Dáil and sit some time before October in the autumn so that our Bills shall be ready for the Dáil when they meet again.</P>

      <P>I wish to support one part of Senator Brown's speech.  This House should remain sitting after the 4th July.  There are certain Bills of pressing importance to this country. It is important we should not create a precedent of hasty legislation.  If we create that precedent, it will last long after our time, but there is an immediate necessity for certain Bills. I am only speaking to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that no Bill has been introduced on copyright. I would like to draw the attention of the President to the fact that the copyright of certain Irish dramatists in America is being lost because there is no Copyright Act to enable the registration of those copyrights in Washington.  I would, therefore, urge this House to remain sitting until we have passed the necessary legislation in order that the Government may find, when it meets in October, that our work has been done.</P>

      <P>The matter I referred to earlier was the question whether, when there was very little business, we should not sit in a week, because there would otherwise be a delay of two weeks instead of one.  It is obvious that it is hardly fair to our country members to bring them up from the country when you know there is little business and that their attendance is not required.  The matter is then passed on for a week.  When there are Bills of that nature in such a condition that debate on them is practically over, there are sufficient Senators living around Dublin to make up a House to do all that is necessary.  There should, of course, be an assurance that a meeting of the Seanad for that kind of business would not be made use of to transact business of which we knew nothing when we agreed to meet. Precaution should be taken, if any business was to be brought on that we did not know of when adjourning, that Senators living in the country would have at least two or three days' notice of it, so that <Col N="132" /> if they were interested in the business they would have an opportunity of attending. I think it is not a good practice not to utilise weeks when we could get an attendance here that would do necessary business like that.  If there is business which could be got through with a small attendance of Senators, for which Senators from the country need not necessarily be brought up, we should have such a meeting of the Seanad and not put the business off for another week.  The Reconstruction Bill which we had before us to-day is a matter more or less of urgency, especially in view of some of the remarks which Senator O'Farrell made.  In a case of that kind I do not see why the Seanad should not meet, as I have suggested, and put the Bill through its necessary Stages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that this question of the convenience of Senators from the country may be carried just a little too far.  After all, the State provides free travelling facilities for them and makes special allowances in respect of loss of time, etc.  I think Senators have no more right to complain than the members of the Dáil, simply because they may be called here to do a small amount of work at a time.  If they were called here for a week to do a large amount of work they might have a more genuine case for complaint.  I do not think it is really any compliment for anybody to come here, if they possibly can, when they are required.  It is their own look out as to where they choose to live.  The State has made arrangements to accommodate them.  I hope that we shall not be too disposed to emphasising the great benefits we confer upon the State, for which we are compensated.  Senator Jameson suggests that we might have a sort of half House at times.  Of course it is a matter for each Senator to decide as to whether he shall attend or otherwise. I think it would be a very dangerous understanding, that on certain occasions, only those resident in Dublin should attend, thus turning the House into a sort of resident committee or sub-committee which would deal with matters which were not considered controversial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly do support the suggestions <Col N="133" /> of Senators Brown and Jameson that as far as practicable we should know where we stand before the Session is too far advanced.  Senator Yeats referred to setting a precedent regarding hasty legislation.  I am afraid we are beyond recovery as far as that aspect of the case is concerned, because last year before the Dissolution we passed enough Bills in a hasty manner to convict us for the rest of our sojourn here in any case.  They were Bills of a highly important and permanent character for the most part.  We are largely in the hands of the Dáil.  They have to deal with matters that we have not to deal with, and they generally have the subject threshed threadbare by the time it arrives here, so that as a mere matter of course the Bill would not take so long to pass through the Seanad.</P>
    <P>But there are a few very important measures which must come before the Seanad, and I hope that it will not be necessary for the Government to come and tell us a few days before the adjournment that this and that Bill must be passed in order to faciltate public business.  One very important measure is the Railways Bill.  There will also be a Local Government Bill, and I think a few others of very great importance. Whatever time the Dáil may make up its mind to adjourn, I do not think that that should determine our action as to the length of time we may take to consider these very important Bills.  As to sitting on after the Dáil adjourns, there will be different points of view with regard to that.  Those who are interested in grouse shooting, in which I am not, will, of course, be in favour of waiting until August. Others would rather have July free, if possible.  However, I think that the members of the Dáil deserve a holiday as soon as they can get it, but I hope that they will, at all events, endeavour to see that some of the important Bills reach the Seanad in time to have them fully considered before the 4th July.</P>

      <P>Speaking as a Senator from the country, I do not think that our alleged convenience ought to be considered very much in this matter.  I should not like it to be said that because we were too busy, let us say in other ways, to come here, that <Col N="134" /> we were responsible for putting back a Bill like the Reconstruction Bill for a week and thereby, presumably, keep a certain number of men out of employment for a week.  I think that anybody who is a member of the Seanad ought to take his business sufficiently seriously to come here when necessary, and I hope that matter will not be considered too much.  Our legislation has always been inclined to be slipshod so far, and I very strongly support Senator Brown's suggestion that we should sit on.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might say a word or two in connection with this matter, because it has been one that has given me a good deal of anxiety for some months past, in view of the responsibility that rests upon my shoulders of determining whether a meeting of the Seanad should or should not be convened for a particular week. I have found myself in a dilemma with regard to this, and I have never been able to make up my mind whether it is more injurious to the position and dignity of this Seanad, that they should meet at such rare intervals, or that they should meet more frequently and have practically nothing to do when they do meet.  That is the position that really I have been confronted with. Take, for example, the position to-day. Had it not been for the last motion the whole Order Paper would have been disposed of in an hour, everything receiving as much consideration as the matters before the Seanad were entitled to receive.  But I confess that I think we have some reason to complain with regard to the way in which these Bills are received and the Stages at which they are received from the other House by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, we do give every measure of credence to the claims that the Government necessarily put forward as to the urgent pressure of many public matters upon them which prevent these Bills being brought into the other House at an earlier stage.  Nevertheless, anyone who reads the Journals of the other House, as I do most carefully, must see that there are intervals and occasions which could have been utilised during the past six months for the purpose of advancing those Bills at a much earlier stage and bringing them <Col N="135" /> through their different stages so that they might have reached the Seanad before now.  I think that there are two remedies, one of which the Government might adopt, and another that rests in our own hands which would, to some extent, get us out of the difficulty in which we are placed.  Personally I always feel very lonely when I know in the morning as I get up that there is going to be no meeting of the Seanad. I do not in any way wish to shirk my work, or to curtail the opportunities we have of meeting here.  But, as I have said, I am faced with the great difficulty, that must be manifest to every Senator, particularly in the case of Senators living in the country, of asking them to come up here to meet at 3 o'clock of a Wednesday, and then to be told at 4 o'clock that there is nothing more for them to do, nor will they be wanted for another fortnight. I think the Government might&mdash; and I wonder they have not thought of it&mdash;have utilised the Seanad for the purpose of introducing some of their Bills here.</P>
    <P>If they introduced some of their Bills here, the particular Minister who would not, necessarily, be wanted in the Dáil, would be able to attend, and many Senators would be willing to give their services to help in piloting a particular Government measure through the Seanad.  Up to the present that has not been done.  Probably the Government have it in their mind to do so at a later stage.  I think if they can adopt a plan of that kind, at least next Session, it would be to their advantage, and also to ours.  Then there is another thing with regard to our own procedure.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why a Bill, for example, like the Reconstruction Bill, should not be referred to a Select Committee, and that a certain number of Senators should form that Select Committee, say, six or ten, who live pretty near the city.  They could put the Bill through the Committee Stage in one of the Committee Rooms.  That would enable them to sit at a time the Seanad was not sitting, and it would probably be pleasant occupation for, at least, some of our Dublin Senators.  It might be well worth the while of the Seanad <Col N="136" /> to consider whether they would not do that with the Reconstruction Bill, as it seems to be a very appropriate measure for reference to a Select Committee. It was nearly time, I think, that the attention of the Government should be called to this matter, as it has been by Senators Brown, Jameson and others.  It is really becoming a sort of standing joke in the Dáil, when the Government have any trouble with amendments, to drop them and say, &ldquo;We can easily get them passed in the Seanad.&rdquo;  I saw a reference to one particular Bill, in which the Minister said, &ldquo;Looking into this Bill, I find it is very crude and will require a great deal of amendment.  We will not trouble you with it.  I will get the amendments put through in the Seanad.&rdquo;  Of course, that is a position we should not take up, and I think we should insist that all these Bills of first-rate importance should reach us in time to guarantee that they will receive, what the public expect they will receive at our hands, full and proper consideration.  I cannot conceive anything more important than the Financial Resolutions recently passed in the Dáil.  I am quite sure that the Seanad will demand a considerable time to discuss and consider them. Then there is the Railway Amalgamation Bill.  I do not know if it is the hope or the wish of the Government that that Bill should be passed before the two Houses rise.  Certainly, if it is to be passed, we will have very scant time to consider it.</P>
    <P>As to the suggestion that we should continue to meet after the Dáil has risen, I am afraid that is not feasible, nor do I think it is of much use, and for this reason.  If we meet after the Dáil has risen and if we inserted an amendment, even to change a comma, the Bill is hung up until the Dáil meets again in September or October, or whenever it may be.  Nothing has been gained.  Therefore, the only use or advantage there would be in continuing to meet after the Dáil has risen would be to consider Bills which we have no intention of amending, and merely proposed to put through stages in the ordinary way.  I think that if we agree that they should go through without discussion and in the ordinary way, <Col N="137" /> we can do that before the other House rises.  No advantage that I can see is to be gained by continuing our Session after the other House has risen.  The suggestion that the Government should inform the Seanad which of the particular Bills out of their long programme they are anxious about, and would like to see passed before the Seanad adjourns is, I think, a consideration that ought to weigh with the Government. I believe they would find it to their advantage to give us that information so that we can make arrangements accordingly.  Before I sit down may I mention that in view of what Senator Jameson has said, the position in which we stand as regards next week is that there is practically no business ready for us, except the Committee Stage of the Reconstruction Bill.  If it is the wish of the Seanad that we should meet for that purpose next week I shall, of course, summon a meeting.  If the suggestion I threw out to refer the Committee Stage of that Bill to a Select Committee of the Seanad, was adopted it would not be necessary to have a formal meeting of the Seanad next week, if that were the only business before us.  I throw that suggestion out for the consideration of the Seanad. I am entirely in their hands and will, of course, act on their views in the matter.</P>

      <P>As a Senator from the country, I look upon the matter in this way.  It has been suggested that the Committee Stage of the Reconstruction Bill might be taken next Wednesday.  I do not think Senators <Col N="138" /> from the country have any objection to that, as they do not consider it important from their view point.  The danger we fear is, that something hurriedly will arise, perhaps an important motion, of which we will not get notice.  I do not know if the Seanad recognises how we are situated with regard to postal communication in the country.  A letter posted at 6 o'clock to-day does not reach a place, within five miles of the city of Kilkenny, until the morning delivery the day after to-morrow.  If notice was sent out on Monday, the communication would not reach a Senator living within five miles of Kilkenny until Wednesday morning, which would be too late, if the meeting was held that day.  If any new business was to be introduced to the Seanad, Senators from the country would at least expect to receive telegrams, if possible, two days before the meeting.</P>

      <P>There is a very large programme that we have not yet announced to the Dáil.  I have been in conference with the Committee on Privileges, and I anticipate that within the next few days, or possibly within a week, it may be possible to announce to the Dáil the Bills we intend to introduce and those we hope to pass.  Our work in the Dáil is largely affected by the fact that we have not yet&mdash;and I hope will not have to&mdash;put in force the Closure.  With the Closure one can have an exact time table.  We have got on very well without the Closure in every respect as far as freedom of debate and opportunity for discussion is concerned.  Under these conditions it is difficult to compile a programme for a particular date.  I hope to be able to submit to the Dáil within the next week or ten days, a list of Bills and the dates on which these Bills will be taken, and to state that in the course of the consideration of these measures, it may be necessary, on particular dates, to move that the Dáil should sit later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our intention to adjourn on the 4th of July, but that adjournment is not intended to be a final adjournment; it will be a preliminary one, and we propose to come back in about a week's time to consider any amendments <Col N="139" /> to measures that would be before the Seanad, and in that case we would hope that the Seanad would facilitate us with regard to the consideration of the measures which would be passed by the Dáil.  It would be a matter for consideration between the Government and the Seanad as to what day we ought to come back, so as to allow a sufficient time for the consideration of these measures; they will not come, I think, in the nature of a shower.  According to the programme that we have outlined, each week should have its own quota, and it is unlikely that the Seanad would be faced with the same consideration as last year.  But I do object, if I may, here, to the term &ldquo;hasty legislation&rdquo;; I do not know that it has been very hasty; it may have been done without delay, but I think that, on the whole, very few faults were found with it, and I do plead for some consideration for the draftsman.  He has been for nearly two years at work, and I am sure that the Seanad will appreciate the immense amount of work he has got through, and how well it has been done.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking, about half the members of this House are not regular attendants, and it is always the faithful few that are here who have to do the work.  If I might suggest a way out of the difficulty, it <Col N="140" /> would be that when we go away to take our holidays the people who never attend should come and take their share, because it is a notorious fact, and I think public attention should be called to it, that a considerable proportion of the members of this House never attend to do the duties for which they are paid.  Some time ago we had an attendance book that members could sign when they attended here; I notice that for the past two months that book is not in use, and I think it ought to be. I now publicly draw attention to the fact that a number of the members of this House never attend to do the duties for which they are paid.</P>

      <P>I think it is only fair to say, in reference to that, certainly as regards some of the members who do not give the attendance that others give, that they are physically incapacitated, and in one or two cases, influenced by a sense of public duty, they have consulted me&mdash;I am not betraying any confidence now&mdash; and have asked me whether, seeing that they were not in a position to give a very constant attendance, but were prepared to attend at intervals, it would no be more in the interests of the Seanad and the country that they should resign their seats.  They have withheld their resignations at my request, on my endeavouring to persuade them to give us a more regular and better attendance in the future.  But I think Senator Farren may rest assured, at least as regards some of these Senators, that if they find in the near future that circumstances would not allow them to give the attendance they ought to give, they will not continue to hold their seats.</P>

I think I have pointed out before that circumstances differ in every case, and I strongly object to that way of putting it.  As far as I understand, we get an allowance to cover our expenses, and as far as I personally am concerned, it is hardly sufficient.  I am not paid, and I do not consider myself paid.</P>

It might be held up by reason of certain adjustments having to be made to provide for a new thoroughfare to join Gloucester Street, and these adjustments may involve some slight alterations of the exact positions in which some of the premises are to be reconstructed. I cannot say whether any recent developments have occurred which would make it necessary for the Bill to be passed before building commences, but on the last date we had a conference about it there were five firms, I think, which could start whether the Bill went through or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is the procedure.  Here is Standing Order 57: &ldquo;A Bill which has passed its Second Stage shall be referred to a Committee for detailed consideration or shall be so considered by the Seanad sitting in Committee.&rdquo;  The first is the case of a Select Committee, and the second is a Committee of the whole House.  Therefore, under that Standing Order the House has power to refer it to a Select Committee.  Then comes Standing Order 64: &ldquo;Bills not considered by the Seanad sitting in Committee may be referred to Select Committees, appointed from time to time for that purpose, and the provisions of Order 93 <i>infra</i> shall not apply.&rdquo;  That is, requiring notice.  In other words, a motion to refer the Bill to a Select Committee may be moved without notice, as Senator Brown has done. Then, there is a general provision which says that the members of all Committees are to be appointed by the Selection Committee.  Whether that would apply to a Select Committee of the House or not I am not quite certain. The question is whether it comes under Standing Order 97: &ldquo;At the commencement of each Session a Committee of Selection, consisting of eight Senators, elected by the Seanad, shall be appointed, whose duty it shall be to select the Senators to serve on all Committees in the absence of express directions as to the personnel thereof from the Seanad itself.&rdquo;  Therefore, I think unless the Seanad now wishes itself to select the names of members of this Select Committee it would naturally fall to the Committee of Selection to do so.  You can take either course.  Either Senator Brown can now name them in his motion, or if they are not named by the House itself it will fall to the Selection Committee as their duty.</P>
