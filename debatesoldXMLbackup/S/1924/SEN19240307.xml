    <Title>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (COLLECTION OF RATES) BILL, 1923&mdash;SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <P>Motion made and Question proposed: &ldquo;That this Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir J. KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to make some remarks on the Second Reading of this Bill.  I do not in any way wish to challenge the necessity for drastic measures in the collection of arrears, and I have got no sympathy for people who wish to shirk the payment of their arrears.  I do, however, think that the facts in connection with Local Government during the past years should be taken into account and known to the Seanad, so that regard should be had to the special circumstances of certain areas in which the arrear list is specially heavy.  A study of the actual rates over past years is exceedingly interesting.  The Government have supplied a return to the Dáil giving particulars of rates in the year 1914, and the years 1919-20, 1920-21, 1921-22&mdash;a most complete and valuable document.  It gives the rates in each district area throughout the whole of the Saorstát.  We get the extraordinary fact that in the year 1914 there is a great similarity in the rates throughout the whole country.  They are all in the region of between 3/- and 3/6.  The list was of such a length that I have not examined every one, but I find an extraordinary closeness between those rates.  I am referring now to rates on land in the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken at random four counties, namely, a district of Carlow, where the rate is 3/-; a district of Clare&mdash;Kilrush&mdash;where the rate is 3/5; Bantry, where the rate is 3/6, and my own district of Waterford, where the rate is 3/5.  When we come to examine these districts for the years 1921-22, and 1922-23, we find an extraordinary disparity. I had to take the years 1921-22, <Col N="968" /> and 1922-23 together, because in 1921-22 they were exceptionally high owing to the withdrawal of the grants.  These grants were restored the next year, and if you take both together and divide by two, you get a fair rate for the two years.  They are:&mdash;In Carlow, 5/10; Kilrush, 11/3; Bantry, 7/8, and in the Waterford area, 10/6.  In one area they are less than double pre-war; in another area they are a little over double, and in two areas, Clare and Waterford, they are more than three times.  When you come to go into the explanation it is perfectly clear.  These local bodies were used for what you might call war or political purposes.  I am not challenging that.  That is past history.  But they were used for that purpose.  Influence was brought to bear to return people for that special purpose, and I think it is generally admitted that people who would not have been returned otherwise were returned.  Then the incidences of war naturally fell very differently on the various districts. In Clare and Waterford especially the combination of these circumstances produced great extravagance in Local Government.</P>
    <P>There has been these abnormal conditions. The point I wish to make is that it is not fair that the entire increase of costs due to these abnormal conditions should be borne by the local rates.  If there was this disparity pre-war, and you could say that Clare was always badly administered, or that Waterford was always badly administered, there would be some justification for placing the increased cost now on the rates.  But that is not the fact.  The figures show that the administration, so far as it was reflected by the rates, was fairly even before the war, and I claim, and I think it is common knowledge, that this increase of rates is largely due to conditions over which the local authorities had no control.  For that reason these increased costs should not be borne by the local authorities.  There is a very acute sense of grievance throughout the country, more especially amongst the farming community, at the burden of these rates.</P>
    <P>In Clare, as the Minister, I think, knows there has been a very heavy arrear list, and a feeling <Col N="969" /> amongst the farmers that there is great injustice in enforcing this rate owing to that fact.  That is further reinforced by the Inquiry.  The Minister has very generously granted an Inquiry into the case of these two counties.  What does the Inquiry in the case of Clare reveal? I have not been able to get this from the Official Report, or even from the Press reports, but I have got it on good authority that one witness said the rates were used to defend a prisoner who was being tried by the British authorities, and that they also used these rates as a deposit for persons standing for the Dáil.  In face of these facts which the Inquiry brought out, surely it is unfair that all counties should be treated alike, and that there should be no discrimination made in the case of those counties where the rates have been especially high owing to special circumstances.  That is the point I wish the Minister to deal with, whether the Government will not take each county into account, and while enforcing the arrears, where a good case is shown give relief from the Central Fund to these counties.  I know it is said that the Budget must balance, or that we can do nothing.  Surely that is not a sound generality.  The Budget, we know, must balance, but there are certain charges in the Budget which might be reduced and the saving on these charges might go to more important charges, such as I have indicated.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter.  In County Waterford, and I believe elsewhere, there is a very large number of unexecuted decrees in the hands of the sheriffs.  I know that in Waterford especially there are complaints from shopkeepers and others who have got these decrees that the sheriff's officers will not go out.  It is very unfair that if a defaulter holds these unexecuted judgements he should be proceeded against with all the rigour asked for in the Bill.  I am going to put down an amendment which I hope the Government will consider&mdash;the legal phraseology does not matter at the moment&mdash; that where a defaulter holds an unexecuted decree the value of that decree should be taken into account, and he shall not be proceeded against until the decree is enforced.  There is a feeling of great discontent at the failure <Col N="970" /> of the sheriffs or their officers&mdash;whatever the reasons may be&mdash;to enforce the decrees of the courts.</P>

      <P>I do not rise to oppose this Bill, because I am of opinion that those who have not paid rates will, in the near future, as a result of the Bill, have to do so.  Of course, this country has gone through a terrible time and as a result local bodies have been affected directly and indirectly. The matter that I wish to allude to refers to Section 4 of the Bill.  Section 4 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where it shall appear to a District Justice, on the application of a local authority, that any person entered in a rate-book as the occupier of any tenement and rated as such occupier in respect of a rate made by that local authority was not the occupier of such tenement when the said rate was made, it shall be lawful for the District Justice to amend the said rate-book by striking out the name or description of the person entered therein.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Section goes on to say that the District Justice has got to insert the name of the occupier.  My house has been burned, but a rate has been struck by the proper authorities on that house. That house is not occupied by me.  It is occupied by crows, jackdaws, and owls.  The local bodies state that they have reduced the rate, but I cannot understand why a rate is struck on a house that has been burned and that is unoccupied.  I want to know from the Minister if, under any Section in the Bill, I am in a position to secure that I shall be treated with justice and equity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I emphasise what Senator the Earl of Mayo has stated.  I know a case, in which I am interested myself, where a house was destroyed&mdash;burned to the ground&mdash; over two years ago.  Shortly after its destruction I called the attention of the local authorities to the fact that the house was no longer in existence, and that it should be removed from the rate book.  It is only within the last few weeks that I have had a reply from the collector stating that he had reported the matter to the Commissioners of <Col N="971" /> Valuation, but that they had not as yet struck it out and that, therefore, rates had to be levied on it.  I am bound to pay them, but I think it is a great injustice. I hope I will not appeal in vain to the Minister in asking him to provide that the District Justice shall have power to amend the rates in cases of that sort.</P>
      <P>As regards what Senator Sir John Keane stated about the state of Clare I am deeply interested in that County and I live there very largely. I think I can amplify some of the statements he has made about County Clare. The fact of the matter is that a great many people like myself who have paid their rates&mdash;and the vast majority of the people have not paid their rates&mdash; find as a result that the County Council have acted on this principle: They have taken the arrears of rates due one year and added them to the next year and divided the total rate into two moieties.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are some cases of people who paid their entire rates for the whole year.  The arrears that other people have not paid have been added to those of the second year, and those people who have paid are being asked to pay a second time.  It is beyond my power to devise a remedy but I trust that the Minister will introduce some provision which will give relief to cases of that sort.  It is an open secret that a great deal of money was collected by improper people and that many people who paid their rates to such persons who gave receipts are being asked to pay a second time. I believe the receipts have been stolen and the money has been mis-applied. A great deal will probably come to light at the Inquiry which is now being held in County Clare, and it will probably be found that much money was missing.  If the Government will consider the question and see how the matter could be remedied I think it would be in the interests of justice and a very desirable thing.</P>

      <P>I have no great interest in defending the people of Clare whose conduct undoubtedly has been very bad, but I am informed that some of the statements made here about <Col N="972" /> them are not correct.  I understand that Senator Sir John Keane made a statement that they used the rates to defend prisoners and to pay the deposit for candidates to the Dáil.  I am informed on very reliable authority that that statement is incorrect and that the money used to defend prisoners in Clare was money received by the local Volunteers as a poundage on the collection of rates and that from the same source the money was obtained to lodge deposits for the candidates to the Dáil.  It is only fair that the truth should be known and that the people of Clare should not be made blacker than they are.</P>

      <P>With reference to what Senator the Earl of Mayo has mentioned as to the liability for rates for houses in ruins, so far as my recollection goes, when the rate collectors books under the existing law were examined by a Committee of the Co. Council, it was the rate collector's duty to point out a house unoccupied or in ruins and upon which the rates are uncollectable.  I do not know whether this Bill proposes to alter that provision. Whether that was the law or not I am unable to say, but at any rate it was the practice.</P>

      <P>I suppose I had better deal first with the questions put to me.  Senator the Earl of Mayo has complained about being liable for rates for a house that has been burned. I would like to say that I have been in the same position myself with regard to a house near where the Earl of Mayo resides at Naas.  I was charged with the rates for that house, and I wrote to the rate collector and pointed out the unfairness of the matter.  He immediately took it into consideration and I was allowed a rebate.</P>

      <P>Between Naas and Newbridge.  I believe the rate collector will take it into consideration in the case of the Senator also, and if not, if the Senator applies to my Department, I will guarantee that he will get satisfaction. With regard to County Clare, conditions there are anomalous.  I suppose that County Clare suffered more than any other county in Ireland during the recent troublesome time, and I know that the farmers there are very hard hit, and in administering this Act we will take all these facts into consideration. I was not aware of the facts stated by Senator Sir John Keane that rates had been used for purposes other than those for which they were intended.  An inquiry is at present being conducted in Clare, and if any irregularities are discovered we will surcharge the parties responsible.  We have no other functions in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been asked to allow a grant out of the Central Fund to meet such special cases as County Clare, but that would be admitting the principle of consequential damage, which we have not, so far, admitted. We have given considerable relief to local rates by not charging them with damage to property, which is being paid out of the Central Fund.  Perhaps it would be well to explain briefly what this Bill is intended to protect.  There is no necessity for me to stress the present serious financial condition of local authorities.  A great many of the county councils are working on heavy overdrafts.  For example, Cork has an overdraft of £160,000; Leitrim, £67,000; and Tirconaill, £60,000.  The financial situation is to a great extent the result of the large amount of arrears, which amount in all to about £2,500,000.  If vital local services are not to be discontinued it is absolutely necessary that these arrears should be recovered without delay, and it is for this purpose that this Bill is being introduced&mdash;to <Col N="974" /> speed up the collection of rates by extending the law, by extending the powers of Executive officers, and by providing additional or alternative machinery by making use of the Post Office for the collection of rates.</P>
      <P>It also provides for the performance of other duties of rate collectors in cases where the Post Office has been substituted, and for the performance of certain duties by the Civic Guard.  It makes other provisions which are more or less of a machinery character.  As part of the general disturbance in the country a general reluctance has grown up on the part of the ratepayers to pay their rates.  In some cases I am well aware that this is a case of necessity. The economic conditions have been such that ratepayers have been very hard hit, but I am also convinced that in many cases those ratepayers have the way, if they only have the will, to pay.  It is necessary to resort to drastic measures to deal with them to make them pay.  The rate collector has the following remedies for enforcing the collection of rates.  First of all, he can distrain and sell goods under his warrant. He can proceed in the Court of Summary Jurisdiction, and thirdly, he can proceed in a Civil Bill Court.  The first is encumbered by restrictive statutory provisions and has been practically in abeyance for the last few years owing to the danger of distraining without military protection and the reluctance of ratepayers to look for such protection.  Also, there have been appointed a great number of young and inexperienced rate collectors during the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a warrant to distrain is issued by a District Justice it is practically impossible to have it executed.  The Civic Guard cannot act, and it is impossible to get anyone to act as a special bailiff owing to the low statutory fee. The procedure in a civil bill court is too costly.  So we have been thrown back on the sheriff.  The District Justice cannot issue a warrant of this kind to an under-sheriff for execution without his consent.  Even if he could, their powers are not adequate to deal with arrears in the drastic way the situation requires.  This Bill, then, accordingly gives power to the Minister for Local Government only for a period of twelve <Col N="975" /> months to issue warrants to under-sheriffs to levy by seizure and sell all goods for rates due up to the 31st March, 1924.  The Bill includes the provisions of Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1923, and extends those provisions to include all goods found on rateable property.  These provisions will not be enforced except in those districts where notice has been given.  The Bill also secures to those rate collectors who have lodged the full amount of their warrant the same expeditious remedy of recovering rates as they had before.  As the law stands, such rate collectors are often put to great trouble and expense in recovering those amounts, as they are compelled to sue in a county or higher court.  This power is also given to people who have ceased to be rate collectors, but to whom arrears of rates are due, with the exception that they are not given the power of distress.</P>
    <P>The Bill also gives power of jurisdiction to a tribunal other than the local authority, namely, to the District Justice to amend the rate-book at the request of the local authorities.  But it restricts his power to insert the name of the individual who should have been rated.  It also gives power to serve certain notices through the post which had formerly to be served by hand.  This is necessary, particularly in those counties where the post office is being substituted for rate collectors.  With regard to substituting the post office for rate collectors, this is frankly experimental, and the provision has been inserted at the request of several local authorities.  For the time being we are only going to experiment with it in those counties where the ordinary system of rate collection has broken down. It is admittedly a drastic measure, but I believe the circumstances of the case justify us in resorting to a drastic measure in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word or two on what the Minister said about surcharging.  I think Sir John Keane stated the matter very fairly and reasonably.  Some of those acts complained of were done in the interests of the country at large.  We all know that in the past money was necessary to the national cause.  I should <Col N="976" /> like to ask the Minister, without having any regard to those things which are wrong, such as private robberies, to have some regard for things that were done in the national interest at a time when it was necessary to do them.  It is rather hard for an individual who did a straightforward national act to be surcharged for it.  I think some difference ought to be made in those matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad requests the Government to improve the accommodation on Dún Laoghaire Pier for passengers crossing from Dún Laoghaire to Holyhead and <i>vice versa.</i>&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have raised this subject before, and I shall raise it again, because the accommodation on the pier at Kingstown is inadequate.  On February the 13th my wife crossed from Holyhead to Kingstown, coming from Euston, and the mail packet arrived at 5.30, rather before the scheduled time.  There was a large mail on board.  There were no porters to carry the passengers' luggage on the pier.  The first train was missed, the second train was missed, and finally my wife and other ladies managed to get to Dublin by the third train.  I think I am right there.  During this long wait the only seats available for those ladies and others who had suffered in the same way was the ricketty table on which the Customs authorities examine our luggage.  That is a table on trestles, and is not a pleasant one to sit on.  As I said before, the crossing was a rough one. There was a hymn sung in my parish two Sundays ago which reminded me very much of what happened there on that particular winter morning:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Calm amidst tumultuous motion and with wonder</P>
      <P>  They, on toils and dangers past&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the last verse is&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Trouble ceases on that tranquil happy shore&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The happy shore in the hymn is heaven, but Kingstown Pier is <Col N="977" /> very far from heaven.  After a rough passage it may be a haven, but not a haven of rest.  To continue, Sir, this winter journey, the railway carriages in which the passengers are carried to Dublin may be described as Methusalean. They are exactly the same as my grand-parents sat in, or must have sat in.</P>
    <P>The first-class is furnished with red plush, much worn, of an early Victorian stuff that is indescribable.  The third-class is best left to the imagination. I have travelled in them very often.  I admit that some new carriages have been made, but you must understand my meaning in regard to the third class.  Imagine yourself, a bad sailor, after a bad crossing, and feeling for all the world like a worm on a vermifuged golf-link.  I cannot imagine anything that describes it better.  I have read the pamphlet that Senator Sir T. Esmonde has circulated.  He is chairman of the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company.  I am very sorry to see that he is not in his seat. He says, on page 14, &ldquo;The directors have in mind only two interests&mdash;the interests of the community served by our line, and the interests of our own stockholders.&rdquo;  That is to say, the interests of the community, comprising the public and ourselves.  The truth of it is that we are so accustomed in this country, in passing to and fro from Holyhead to Kingstown, and Kingstown to Holyhead, and doing it with the utmost discomfort, that we really do not take any notice of it.</P>
    <P>Since I spoke last something has been done, and I went down yesterday in my motor to see what had been done.  There has been erected what may be described as a cow-shed, or, rather, a shed that you would not put up for bullocks to protect them against the stormy winds that blow in our beloved country. Somebody may ask: &ldquo;What do you want done?&rdquo; I will tell you exactly what I want done.  There is no reason why, at the end of that shed that I have described a door should not be fixed which would open inwards, and when the wind blows from the east, that door should be shut after the passengers have passed in to have their luggage examined, and <i>vice-versa</i> on the other <Col N="978" /> side.  I may say in passing that it was a most lovely day, without a breath of wind on the sea.  You could hardly imagine that Kingstown Pier could be such a disagreeable place on a winter's morning.  There is at the other end what I might describe as a calf-shed. When you put up a shed for calves you put up a shelter at the end of it, and that shelter is there.  I do not think it is for passengers; I believe it is for the porters and the other officials, because I am told by my wife that she was ushered into the shed I have described, and not into this shed.  That is a very nice corner to shelter in.  There are no seats anywhere.  This is the journey. The passengers arrive a little before 5.30, and it took exactly two hours to get to the Hibernian Hotel, where my wife was putting up.  Now, that is perfectly ridiculous.  Why, you could ride there on a bicycle in that time.  A smart runner might get there in the time, and certainly in one of these Dublin four-wheeled cabs you could get there much quicker.  I have been asked to tell a story of what happened to myself.  You will hardly believe it.  I have told this to some members of the Seanad, and I should like to tell it to you, Sir, and the Seanad.</P>

      <P>No, it is quite proper, Sir.  I was travelling in the early spring last year.  I went down in a motor.  It was a very rough, stormy morning, and I went along the pier, where the passengers were passing in. I had to take my luggage into what you, Sir, described on one occasion as a hen-house.  The ladies were passing on board with band-boxes and hat-boxes in their hands, these kinds of paper things that you see them carry.  I heard a cry on the gangway of, &ldquo;Oh, my hat.&rdquo;  I looked.  I could see no headgear floating away, but what had really happened was that one of these large paper hat-boxes had fallen into the sea between the ship and the pier, upon which a sailor, with a long pole with a hook at the end of it, such as are used to rescue people who are blown overboard, <Col N="979" /> fished it out of the sea.  You may imagine the state of the hat-box. I, like many others, was looking at the unhappiness of my fellow-creatures on that winter morning.  I just turned my head, and a gust of wind took my hat and off it went down the pier.  I thought there must have been a demon in the wind, or in the hat.  Off it went down the pier, rolling over and over, and landed in a large pool of thick motor oil which is used for the turbines.  But that is not all.  The first train came puffing in and another gust of wind again took my hat.  I said: &ldquo;Well, that is the end of the hat&rdquo;; but the train stopped suddenly and out hopped the stoker.  He began, like a football player who is dribbling, to try to stop the hat, but it landed in front of the engine. He very kindly picked it up and handed it to me, wiping it with his oil-squab. I thanked him very much and said: &ldquo;For goodness' sake do not go on wiping my hat with an oil-squab.&rdquo;  I went on board and met a very old friend of mine, and I asked who was the lady who lost her hat.  He said: &ldquo;That is my wife.&rdquo;  I said &ldquo;Gracious goodness me, how dreadful.&rdquo;  It was a new hat. They were going on their honeymoon and the bride had bought this beautiful hat evidently to do a little shopping in London.  A little later on there was an assembly of sympathetic stewards, and some of the lady passengers and I had a glimpse of the hat.  It was a mass of soiled ribbons, and the paper thing was all in a pulp, and it was really quite a tragedy for the bride to have that happen.</P>
      <P>It all amounts to this, that I hope the Government will see that better accommodation is provided.  There is no doubt that this year a great many people will be coming to Ireland for the Tailteann Games.  A great many Irish-Americans will like to come to see the old country under new conditions, and they will take in both the Tailteann Games and the Wembley Exhibition, and in all seriousness I really hope that the accommodation will be improved before that.  Otherwise what will happen is that they will come once and they will never come again.</P>

      <P>Might I enter upon this interesting discussion, though really my contribution to it cannot be very practical.  I had not the pleasure of hearing the noble Lord's opening remarks.  If he would hand me his notes dealing with any particular point I would do my best to answer them if I can.  May I see your notes, Senator?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say that quite apart from what his opening remarks may have been, his concluding remarks were absolutely inimitable and I shall always congratulate myself that I have been present at the birth of a new edition of &ldquo;The Innocents Abroad.&rdquo;  It was a most pathetic and wonderful story of the misfortunes of travellers coming to these shores.  I do sympathise very deeply with this matter of the hat&mdash; the two hats.  The first hat was a most appalling tragedy but the second had afforded a little more diversion certainly to the gentleman who endeavoured to clean it with an oil rag.  He really was not a most obliging man and I am glad that the noble Lord bore testimony to that fact.  The question really is this.  You cannot have a Customs examination without a certain amount of inconvenience.  In the old days when one went backwards and forwards between this country and England there was no Customs examination, and people merely went out of the train to the steamer or from the steamer to the train, and they were not stopped in any way.  They have to stop now and they have to stop upon both sides, and my experience as a very constant traveller, unfortunately, is that the arrangements are quite as good upon this side as they are upon the other.</P>
      <P>As far as the Customs officials are concerned I do not think that anything could be said which would be strong enough to express our appreciation of the great courtesy and the great care with which they have discharged their duties.</P>

      <P>They certainly do the very best they can under somewhat awkward conditions. The whole trouble really arises from the fact that baggage must be examined, and we have not had sufficient experience on our side, or, indeed, at the other side.  But I think, so far as the Customs officials are concerned, they deserve our warmest praise.  The matter really is one of the construction of the pier, and the amount of space available for Customs examination.  In other countries where they have been in the habit of doing these things for many years, they probably do them better than we do.  I have had very considerable difficulties at many Custom offices in different parts of the world.  Possibly the worst Custom House in the world and where the largest influx of passengers obtain, is in New York, and the Customs arrangements there are anything but satisfactory.  So far as we are concerned, we have only to do the best we can.  It is a matter of sheltering the people on the pier, and that conceivably could be arranged by the responsible Government Department which is in charge.  They have done a good deal in that respect already.</P>

      <P>The noble Lord may have been unfortunate, perhaps, in his experience of the weather, as he certainly has been unfortunate in his experience of hats. There are certain proposals before the Company I represent.  I am not responsible for the Customs examination, but I hope that it may be possible in the course of the summer to make things a little more convenient for passengers, as regards getting them away more quickly.  A large number of people arrive there, very often at short notice of their coming, and it is not always possible at the last moment to make arrangements for their speedy transport.  That matter has been looked into, and I think when the summer comes passengers will find, apart from the necessary delay and inconvenience of Customs examination, that <Col N="982" /> arrangements will have been made to carry them away as quickly as possible, so that the noble Lord may reach his hotel whether on a bicycle, or in a growler, or whatever way it pleases him, more rapidly than at present.  The whole question arises out of the Customs examination, and that examination is likely to continue, and we have only to put up with it.  So far as those who travel much are concerned, they will sympathise with the noble Lord in the desire for a quicker examination of baggage there, and I hope when the summer comes there will be an improvement.</P>

      <P>The discussion of this motion has furnished an amusing interlude, but I think we should not overlook the fact that we passed an identical resolution some weeks ago.  I think Senator the Earl of Mayo has introduced the motion, because sufficient has not been done to improve what he considers are public requirements. It would, I think, make us look absurd to pass a similar resolution on this occasion, and consequently if the Earl of Mayo cannot see his way to withdraw the motion I shall have to move that the Seanad proceed to the next business.</P>

As an alternative, I would suggest, apart from the humour of the discussion, that discussions of this kind are not consonant with the dignity of this Chamber.  I think that representations to the Government or the people concerned would be the best way of dealing with it, and if the Earl of Mayo would accept the suggestion I make that this matter be referred to Senators Burgess, Bagwell and Sir Thos.

      <P>I have made representations to the proper Department. I brought it before them, and, as I have said, I have been passed on from one Department to another. When I take up a matter of this sort I <Col N="983" /> can assure the Seanad I am not going to drop it, because I know perfectly well big crowds are coming.  Senator Sir Thos. Esmonde admitted that the accommodation might be improved, and that they were going to get the passengers away quicker.  That is the whole essence of what I was speaking about&mdash; that long wait in the cold and wet&mdash; and Sir Thomas Esmonde admits the principle I have enunciated, that the passengers must be properly looked after.  He said in the summer, but I hope these arrangements will continue during the winter.</P>
      <P>It is then that the misery and discomfort occurs at Dún Laoghaire Pier.  I will leave the matter to the Seanad, and will not withdraw my motion.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Senator the Earl of Mayo will be satisfied with the suggestion made by Senator Farren, which seems to me to be a very sensible one. We have the advantage of having on the Seanad probably two of the most influential men to bring about the sort of changes that he desires.  We have Senator Burgess, who has attained to the very highest position in the London, Midland, and Scottish Railway, that of General Manager.  We have also got the Chairman of the Dublin and South Eastern Railway, Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde.  There are no two men whose influence would be greater or more powerful to bring about the reform suggested. It would seem to me that a committee consisting of these Senators, if they would be good enough to consider and report on the question, would be much more likely to produce what the Senator is aiming at than mere representation to the Government.</P>

The Cathaoirleach and myself are not quite in agreement as to that. There is no use in making a statement as to what happened at the Committee, but I want the Seanad to understand that I am not responsible for any portion of the Report whatsoever.  The proposal in the clause I wish to have omitted is a reversal of statements that have been made in this Seanad for a long time.  The proposal is to take away from the Seanad the appointment of its own clerks, and to hand over the nomination to the Cathaoirleach and the Minister for Finance and the appointment to the President of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg pardon.  He was called the President of the Dáil. Now it is President of the Executive Council.  It will be necessary for me to recall what happened over a year ago, when the Seanad first assembled.  A Committee was appointed about December 20 to select and recommend persons to be appointed as clerks of the Seanad.  On January 10 of last year that Committee reported to the Seanad, and recommended certain persons to be appointed on the staff as clerks on probation, and a proposed scale of salaries. The report was, in the main, accepted by the Seanad.  The clerks were to be appointed by the Seanad alone.  One recommendation of the Committee was amended by the Seanad.  It was a minor amendment, but it shows how meticulously careful the Seanad was to keep the appointment of its own officials in its own hands.  The Committee recommended that the minor officials, typists and other persons, should be appointed by the Cathaoirleach alone.  The Seanad disapproved of that, Senator Fitzgerald proposing an amendment that the appointment be &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Seanad.&rdquo;  According to that regulation even minor positions, such as typists and messengers, were retained under the control of the Seanad.  It will also be remembered that the President of the Executive Council had anticipated the Seanad by nominating Major-General Dalton to the position of Clerk. The Committee of the Seanad found that in front of them.  It placed the whole matter in a rather complicated position, both for the President and Cathaoirleach.  A compromise was effected mainly through the efforts of the Cathaoirleach, I think, by which the Seanad should appoint Major-General Dalton to the position, thus retaining the right of appointment in its own hands, but accommodating the President of the Executive Council in what he had done on account of the difficult position that had arisen.  The President agreed to this.  I daresay a strong statement of the Cathaoirleach will be remembered in which he stated that he considered the President had gone back in his agreement, by a statement he made in the Dáil.  On the 24th January the Cathaoirleach made a statement in the Seanad.  He said:&mdash;&ldquo;In my conversation with the President of the Executive Council, I told the President quite frankly that I did not believe the Seanad, for a moment, would accede to such a position,&rdquo; meaning the decision <Col N="989" /> of the President to appoint an official to the Seanad.  He went on:&mdash;&ldquo;I was quite certain that the Seanad would resent a suggestion that they were not to have the ordinary right possessed by every public board and body in the country, unless taken from them by resolution, of appointing their own staff.&rdquo;  He continued:&mdash;&ldquo;I brought it before the Committee, and they were unanimous in contesting such a claim on behalf of the Government, taking the view I had foreshadowed, that if there was anything at all within their powers, that they were entitled to fulfil, it was the nomination and control of their staff.&rdquo;  That Committee of 10 was drawn from all interests represented in the Seanad, and was unanimous in asserting the right of the Seanad to make these appointments. &ldquo;I obtained,&rdquo; the Cathaoirleach said, &ldquo;a distinct admission from the President, of the inherent right of the Seanad to appoint, control, and dismiss its own staff,&rdquo; Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde said: &ldquo;If the Dáil is to have a vote in our appointment obviously, as the Chairman points out, we are entitled to a voice in their appointments.&rdquo; The late Senator McPartlin spoke in similar terms, and congratulated the Cahaoirleach on maintaining the independence of the Seanad.  The Seanad unanimously agreed with the Cathaoireleach's statement.  Now, the Seanad is asked to go back on its defectly unanimous on that occasion.  Of course, the Cathaoireleach might say, that that was only his private opinion, but, after all, he was making a statement about the rights and liberties of the Seanad from the chair, and he was supported, as he generally is, by every stood that in making this statement, I am not at all trying to find fault with the Cathaoirleach, or saying that he was inconsistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a joint conference of the Seanad and the Dáil on the 15th March, at which the status of the clerk was not questioned.  The clerks were exculded form the common staff of the Oireachtas, and no attempt was made to go back on the decision of the Seanad.  At that time it was found that the Cathaoirleach had not carried our <Col N="990" /> an arrangement about the minor appointments, and that the Dáil had filled these appointments. I think the Senators took the very sensible view that it was not really of very much importance who appointed the minor officials and left it that way.</P>
    <P>On the 28th March, in the absence of the Chairman, by a strange coincidence a message came from the Dáil to the Seanad asking for a Joint Committee of both Houses to determine the number, grading, remuneration and terms of office of the staff.  It was called the Oireachtas staff, not a staff of the Dáil and Seanad.  In view of what had been said before, I think every Senator understood that that did not include the clerks to the Seanad.  Their names were never mentioned.</P>

      <P>The Chairman was absent, but he was delegated to represent the Seanad on the Joint Committee. It was clearly understood by all Senators that there was to be no interference with the clerks of the Seanad. On the 20th December a motion was put down on the Order paper for the appointment of a Seanad Committee to consider the question of appointments to the Seanad which would soon end. These appointments were only made for a year, and would come to an end early in January.  The Chairman asked the Seanad not to press that motion because there was a Joint Committee sitting at the time to consider the whole question, and he thought it would be better that that committee when it did sit should have before it the report of the Joint Committee.  Some discussion arose because Senators did not clearly understand what was meant by this Joint Committee.  The chairman was asked several questions, and he answered them in this way&mdash;this was on the 20th December, when the Joint Committee was sitting, and when it had nearly finished its work.  The chairman was able to <Col N="991" /> state what was going on.  He said that the Joint Committee had agreed that with the exception of the clerk and assistant clerk to the Seanad the staff should be a joint staff.  He further said that the idea of appointing this Joint Committee was that it should define what the joint staff was, and expressly eliminate from it the clerk and assistant clerk.  They remained absolutely officials attached to the Seanad who had control over them.  We the sole right of appointing them.  We went into the question of the entire staffing of both Houses, and one proposition we discussed was what exceptions, if any, should be made to the joint staff.  It was suggested that there should be no exception, but the chairman went on to state that &ldquo;in view of what happened in the early days of the Seanad I would not give way in regard to the clerk and assistant clerk, and accordingly the Committee arranged that the clerk and assistant clerk should not belong to the joint staff, but should remain separate officers of the Seanad, and be appointed by it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took that at the time to be a sort of pledge by the Chairman that the staff would not be interfered with by the Joint Committee.  On the 20th December it will be seen that when this Joint Committee was sitting it was arranged and settled that the clerks were not to be included in this.  What happened after that, of course, I do not know.  The curtain was drawn down, and we have not heard up to now the reason for changing this arrangement, and I do not know who it was on the Committee who persuaded the Chairman to change his opinion.  Like Juliet, swearing she would ne'er consent, he consented.  He changed his opinion, and when the report came up we found that all his fine statements that the clerks were not to be included were wiped out, and that the whole thing was handed over to the Chairman and the Minister for Finance to recommend to the Chairman of the Executive to carry out the decisions.  It may be a good way or not.  I do not go into it, but I know that the Seanad arranged otherwise, and having asserted its rights in the beginning it is now asked to stultify itself by surrendering these rights.  I, <Col N="992" /> for my part, am not prepared to do that.  I believe it is wrong and improper, and that having held out for our rights throughout we should not now surrender them.  Therefore I suggest that that portion of the report be omitted, and that the Seanad retain its rights in this matter.</P>

      <P>As a general rule I feel that reports of a Committee ought not to be subjected to much discussion when presented here, but in this instance I feel that a very grave injustice was done to the clerks whom we appointed, and who were appointed under certain conditions for a probationary period.  I take it that that meant when the term of probation expired they would be installed in office under the conditions and on the basis of the salaries which we arranged with them.</P>

      <P>This deals with the powers of the Seanad.  All through our controversy here we were of the opinion that we had power to retain the power of appointment of the Clerk and Assistant Clerk of the Seanad. That principle was adhered to by our Chairman, and a Joint Committee was appointed of which he was one of three members.  He who runs may read. Committees are largely a question of compromise, and in this case the matter did not emerge as well as we wished. I feel that we have not acted loyally to our Clerk and Assistant Clerk and that for the future we have surrendered to the Dáil the appointment of our staff. When this Joint Committee of the two Houses was appointed it was appointed to consider the Oireachtas staff, not the Seanad Staff, and I submit that when that Committee took upon itself to discuss the Seanad staff and to alter the manner of its appointment they went outside their duty as a Committee.  I take it that the Seanad staff was not the Oireachtas staff but was a distinct staff, appointed by the Seanad just as the Dáil staff was a distinct staff appointed by the Dáil.  For that reason <Col N="993" /> I feel that the arrangement they came to whereby they abrogated to the Dáil the appointment of the Clerk and Assistant Clerk to the Seanad ought not to be adhered to, and I therefore beg to second Colonel Moore's proposal that that part of the report be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should say a word or two on this matter because I have been brought directly into it by the statement made by Colonel Moore in moving the amendment. I have no complaint to make of the amendment or of anything its proposer said in support of it.  He dealt with it in a good-humoured and temperate way, and I have no complaint to make on that head.  It is very difficult to ask the Seanad to recall here the history of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will do it briefly because I am rather at a loss to know whether Col. Moore regards my utterances from the Chair&mdash;as sometimes I think he does&mdash; as the concentrated wisdom of Solomon or whether he looks upon them as containing the guile of the serpent.  He differs as my utterances accord with his own views.  Be that as it may, I hope I have been consistent in the attitude I took up in the interest of the Seanad on this somewhat difficult question. Originally when we were trying to put our house in order we had no idea what would be the nature of the staff we would require.  We were entirely in the dark and accordingly the Seanad very wisely, in my opinion, determined that any appointments made should be of a temporary character only.  We did anticipate then that we would require a number of minor officials such as typists, messengers, attendants and so on, and it is quite true, as regards these minor officials at that time, that the Seanad, while asking the Chairman to take upon himself the appointments, made it subject to their concurring in the recommendation. I mention that to show how the entire position has changed with the knowledge and acquiescence of the Seanad.  Not only have they acquiesced in reversing all that because now they have no minor appointments of their own to make at all, but from the point of view of manifest economy <Col N="994" /> they have acquiesced in a new arrangement altogether by which those minor appointments are to be drawn from the joint staff of both Houses.  That is a wise and economic change and it was done without any express resolution on the part of the Seanad by their acquiescence in what they saw was an obvious change in the interests of economy. Once you had disposed of the question of the minor offices, which has been satisfactorily disposed of by drawing them from a joint staff which will serve and accommodate both Houses as each House requires their services, there remains the appointment of the senior staff including the Clerk, the Assistant Clerk and the Second Assistant Clerk.  At the outset a complication arose by reason of the fact that the President asserted a claim to have the right to make the appointment. I, with the assent of the Seanad, put up as good a fight as I could against that proposition.  Now that the matter is closed.  I want to say that there was perhaps a certain amount of bluff in the position I took up but it succeeded, and we did obtain from the President a reluctant admission that the power to appoint these senior officials was to remain in the hands of the Seanad.  I might say that subsequent investigation did not leave me quite as confident as to the accuracy of my position as I had been at the time I took it up, because I have learned that in Canada the Clerk of the House of Commons is appointed by the Crown and that the Clerk of the Senate in Canada is also appointed by the Crown. It was just as well that I did not know all those facts at the time as I was able to make a most strenuous opposition on behalf of the Seanad and its rights. We got that right conceded and provision was made for the appointment of the Clerk and the two assistants.  As it was making a new start the Seanad limited those two appointments to a year.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, when the year expired it became necessary to provide for their appointment in the future.  In the meantime, in the month of March last year, when I was away in England for three weeks owing to illness in my family, a communication was received without my knowledge, and without reference <Col N="995" /> to me, from the Dáil in those words. It was a resolution passed by the Dáil on the 23rd March, 1923: &ldquo;That the Minister for Finance and Ceann Comhairle be appointed a Standing Committee to determine the number, grading, remuneration and terms of office of the Oireachtas Staff, and that Seanad Eireann be requested to nominate a member of the Seanad to act on this Committee.&rdquo;  That resolution of the Dáil came up before the Seanad on the 28th March, and in my absence it was moved and unanimously agreed to that I should act upon this Joint Committee in conjunction with the Minister for Finance and Ceann Comhairle.  When I returned a fortnight later I did not know that such a resolution was passed, and I was not aware that I was appointed to this Committee until I had a communication from the Ceann Comhairle asking me when it would be convenient to meet him.  I looked at the records and found that on the 28th of March I was nominated on this Committee, and that the Seanad had expressly agreed that this particular Committee was to have plenary powers. Consequently this Standing Committee was to be in a position that it had no occasion at all to report to the Seanad.  All it had to do was to agree on its findings and those would be binding on both Houses.  I went into consultation at once with the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance over the reference which was made to us by this Committee, and after many meetings and a great deal of trouble and difficulty, ultimately we were able to come to an agreement on all the points in dispute.  The points in dispute between the Ceann Comhairle and myself were practically confined to the question of the appointment of the Clerk and his two assistants in the Seanad, because the idea of the other members of the Joint Committee was that this was a reference to deal with the entire Oireachtas staff.  You will see that there is no limitation in the reference, and it has been so construed and so accepted by the Dáil, and if you look at it you will see that all these appointments to what are called the joint staff are to be filled up by the Ceann Comhairle and myself, whether they <Col N="996" /> are serving with the Dáil or serving with the Seanad.  But then, when we came to the question of putting the Clerk of the Dáil, the Assistant Clerk of the Dáil, the Clerk of the Seanad on the same footing, I said no, I could not do that as regards the Clerk of the Seanad and the Assistant Clerk, because they should be appointed on the recommendation of the Chairman of the Seanad alone.</P>
    <P>After a good deal of discussion and controversy, we ultimately came to an agreement that you will find referred to in paragraph 5: &ldquo;The appointment of the Clerk and Clerk Assistant to the Dáil is to be made by the President of the Executive Council on the recommendation of the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance.  The appointment of the Clerk and Clerk Assistant to the Seanad to be made by the President of the Executive Council on the recommendation of the Chairman of the Seanad and the Minister for Finance.&rdquo; In other words, no appointment can be made, either to the Clerkship or the Clerk Assistant of this House, unless a recommendation of your Chairman is adopted.  So that your Chairman is given a veto upon the person to be appointed to either office.  Exactly the same thing has been done as regards the Clerk and Assistant Clerk of the Dáil. Their appointment is not left to the Dáil; it is left to the President of the Executive Council, on the recommendation of the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Now, this report was completed in the end of December.  It was laid upon the Table of this House&mdash;and it shows how valuable that performance is&mdash; about the 2nd of January, and for six weeks it lay there, and no complaint or objection to it of any kind was received from any Senator.  But I am not making any point about that.  As a matter of strict interpretation of our rules, I do not think that that report is now open to discussion; first of all, because it was a report by a Committee with plenary powers, and, secondly, because after the time it has lain on the Table and been in the possession of members and no objection of any sort has been taken to it, it seems to me that the time <Col N="997" /> for objecting had gone.  But I do not want in the least to take this matter out of the consideration of the Seanad. It is a matter of absolute indifference to myself personally, because I know I shall never have an opportunity of exercising this power that is conferred upon the Chairman.  It will never arise in my case, except on this particular occasion; at least I hope not, for the sake of the Clerks themselves, and as regards this particular occasion, if this report is confirmed I have no hesitation in informing the Seanad, as I informed the Committee, that I should recommend the retention and re-appointment of the two gentlemen who served it for the past twelve months.  I stated that to the Committee, of which Senator Colonel Moore is a member, and this will be in all human probability the only occasion probably on which I shall ever be called upon to exercise this power.  That is the position.  I have stated it quite frankly, fairly and fully to the Seanad, as far as I know it, and I do suggest to them that so long as it depends on their Chairman, in whom, I presume, from time to time they will have confidence, as to who is to be appointed Clerk and the Assistant Clerk, they are sufficiently protected in a somewhat difficult and complicated position.  The Dáil, perhaps, might be said to be a more democratic House than ours, and they have accepted this report.</P>
    <P>This report puts the appointment of their Clerk and Assistant Clerk on precisely the same footing as I have put the appointment of Clerk and Assistant Clerk of the Seanad, and I do suggest to the House that this is a much more convenient arrangement in every way, because I can conceive nothing more injurious to the position and usefulness of our staff than that their names should be made the subject matter of a heated and controversial debate in the Seanad itself.  I think that there always ought to be unanimity in the view that we take as to the individuals who are to fill these offices and that it would be very unfortunate indeed, both for them and for us who have to come in contact with them, if their rival merits and claims were to form the subject of debate and controversy here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I be allowed to supplement, very briefly, what you, Sir, have stated.  As is known to most members of the Seanad, on two or three occasions I acted as your deputy on this Committee, with regard to the particular clause which you are now discussing.  Senator Colonel Moore's statement was, I am quite certain, obviously meant as a fair statement, but there was one matter which, quite unintentionally, he omitted to mention, that a report was received from a Joint Conference&mdash;this was after the Seanad had suggested that they should be appointed by the Chairman of the Seanad&mdash;recommending that there should be a joint staff appointed, practically as civil servants.  That was passed and assented to by the Seanad, and it was not simply a matter of arrangements taking place without their knowledge, because a report actually came here.  Further, I would like to correct another matter.  I do not wish to misinterpret Senator Colonel Moore in any way.  I am quite sure he wished to be fair.  He stated that our minor appointments were filled by the Dáil.  That is not correct.  I think that that is possibly a slip on his part.  The minor appointments, that is, the typists, were made by request for a loan of typists from the ordinary Civil Service, made by our clerks, which is quite a different thing from the suggestion that the Dáil appointed our staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, briefly, in support of what you, Sir, have stated, to point out that the net result of the whole of this Report means that our staff will be part of the State Civil Service, will be appointed and chosen in like manner as all other Civil Servants.  I would like to point out that this Section 5 means that our Clerk will be appointed in practically the same manner as the chief official of a Government department is appointed.  That means that first of all the Minister concerned&mdash; who in our case would obviously be our Chairman&mdash;looks round amongst the Civil Servants and amongst suitable persons for one who has the requisite qualifications to fill the position.  Then he gets in touch with the Ministry of Finance and obtains their consent, and the appointment is then made by the <Col N="999" /> President.  I suggest, and I would like to support you strongly in your statement, that now that we have got a Civil Service Bill and we have restrictions and care taken in the appointment of Civil Servants, and we have the whole matter regularised, it would be infinitely better for the Seanad that our staff should feel themselves under the same obligations, and with the same rights as the Civil Service has, and that they will be appointed as in the case of almost every other department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Seanad that this is in the nature of a temporary arrangement? I think it is paragraph I which says that this Oireachtas staff shall, for the time being, and so on, as set out in the Schedule, and it is further reinforced in paragraph 7, which says that the establishment set out in the Schedule is not to be taken as final, but will be subject to increase or diminution, and so forth, as the situation demands.  I think the Seanad can quite safely agree with this Report.  It was produced under conditions of difficulty, as you have explained, Sir, more than once.  The chief points about appointments of our more important officers, I think, has been abundantly safeguarded. The Report says that our chief officers shall be appointed by the President of the Council, and with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, on the recommendation of the President of the Seanad.  After all, if there is any meaning in these words, it is that the President of the Seanad shall nominate a person whom he thinks fit and proper to occupy the post, and the President of the Council merely comes in to ratify the appointment of the President of the Seanad.  There is every reason why the Finance Minister should be brought into consultation in this matter, for he is the gentleman responsible for the expenditure of public funds.  Therefore, it is obviously of the first importance that he should have a say in the matter of the salary of an official, whoever the official may be.  I take it that so far as the independence of the Seanad is concerned, and that is the only thing I am in the least concerned about, it is abundantly <Col N="1000" /> safeguarded by the fact that our chief officials are to be appointed on the nomination of the President of the Seanad.  A similar arrangement has been created in the Dáil.  The Speaker of the Dáil nominates his principal appointments, and when exception is taken to the fact of the President making these appointments, it must be remembered that somebody has to do it, and there is nobody, in my mind, better qualified to do it than the President of the Executive Council.  The fact is, when the matter comes before him it will be merely a formality on his part.  That we have agreed to a joint staff alters the situation considerably. I do not for a moment object to the appointment of a joint staff, as far as our minor officers are concerned.  Our chief officers are our own appointments, and we are absolutely independent as far as that is concerned.  In a time of high taxation it is obvious that we should make it our duty to conduct our business on the most economic basis possible.  Therefore, I cordially concur that there should be a joint staff of the Oireachtas.  The only point with which we are concerned is that we should have absolute control over our own officers.  We practically have the appointment of those officers, and I do not suppose any Chairman of the Seanad will appoint a chief officer who is not approved by the majority of the Seanad.  I cannot conceive that possibility. I think, having secured our independence in the matter of our chief appointments, and for obvious reasons having agreed on a joint staff of the Oireachtas, there is no reason why we should not agree with this Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not rise to express any positive opinion as to which is the best method of appointing clerks of the Seanad.  Senator Colonel Moore has given us the history of this question. My recollection in the matter is that from the very outset the Seanad claimed the right to appoint its own clerk and assistant clerk, and that right this House reiterated on more than one occasion.  The objection that is now taken, so far as I can understand, to Colonel Moore's point of view, is that the Seanad has never withdrawn that. It possibly would have, had its opinion <Col N="1001" /> been asked, or had it been requested to do so, or if some better method had been submitted to it.  It possibly would have rescinded its own resolution, and acquiesced in the other method.  It is not within my recollection that that was ever done.  When the joint committee was appointed, of which at the outset he was given no notice that he was one of the members, in March or early in April, that committee met. Even if the Report of that joint committee was laid on this Table as a joint Report, and if reference was made there to a joint committee having dealt with the Oireachtas staff, every member of this House would have it in mind that that Oireachtas or common staff&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply amplifying the thing, that I always thought that whenever the Oireachtas staff is mentioned we in our own minds excluded our own clerks.  That was always my view.  I always interpreted &ldquo;Oireachtas staff&rdquo; as meaning the staff common to both Houses, and always bearing in mind that whenever such arrangement was referred to, that our chairman, with the consent of this House, always expressly excluded, as he did in December, the clerks of the Seanad.  I hold that that is the position the Seanad has always maintained. I maintain, as a representative of a public body, that if a body appoints a committee, it does not delegate powers to the committee or any one of its members, and that committee is confined to the powers given to it, and can only enlarge its powers by coming back to the appointing body and asking for an enlargement of its powers. In any Resolution passed by the Seanad there was no delegation of powers granted to them.  I take it that is the crux of the whole objection taken here.  The objection is that things have not been done in what I might term an orderly way, and that when there was a change, or when the chairman realised that in his view the joint committee appointed for the purpose of bringing into existence the Oireachtas staff, had also included within its powers the appointment of clerks to the Seanad, he did not make that clear to this House, <Col N="1002" /> because in December, subsequent to the appointment of the joint committee, when a Resolution proposed here was subsequently withdrawn, it was simply on his assurance that the retaining of the appointment of its clerk and assistant clerk, was absolutely excluded from the purview of this joint committee.</P>
      <P>These are inconsistencies that have struck Senators like myself.  I do not rise for the purpose of objecting to anything that has been done by any Committee or by the Chairman.  I raise these points so that the Chairman and others affected by them may have an opportunity of explaining away the seeming inconsistencies.</P>

      <P>With a great deal of what Senator Colonel Moore has said I am in agreement.  When we found this Resolution of March and the subsequent laying on the Table of the decisions that the Committee had come to, we felt that we were up against a wall; that the Report was there and we could not do anything but accept the findings of that Committee. It appears to me that we are young to our business and that we do not pick up the Papers off the Table in time.  However, somebody has provided us now with a Table and the Papers, and I hope we will be more mindful in future of what we ought to do.  What I really want to say is, that in the Report circulated it is stated that Senator Colonel Moore moved the adoption of the entire Report. When the Report, as printed, came down to me and I was asked did <Col N="1003" /> I agree with the Report, I said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Since that Senator Colonel Moore has written to me and told me that he did not move the adoption of the Report. You will understand that sitting round a table you do not particularly notice who moves a Report, and when Senator Colonel Moore says he did not move it, subject to the deletion of the paragraph, I think every member of this Seanad will take his word that he was not the person who moved the adoption of the Report, and I think that it is only due to him that that portion of the Report should be deleted.</P>

      <P>If Senators had taken the trouble to read the report of the proceedings on the 28th March, it would have saved all this discussion, because that was the date on which the Seanad gave up the right to appoint its own staff.  I looked up the report, and I find that the resolution of the Dáil is:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Minister for Finance and the Ceann Comhairle be appointed as Standing Committee to determine the number, grading, remuneration, and terms of office, of the Oireachtas staff, and that Seanad Eireann be requested to nominate the member of the Seanad to act on this Committee.&rdquo;  It was actually proposed by Senator Bennett, who now seconds Senator Colonel Moore's amendment complaining of the effect of it.  That resolution was supported from every quarter of the Seanad.  Senator Farren said that he did not agree with an amendment of Senator Sir T. Esmonde trying to retain for the Seanad the powers to appoint its own staff. Senator Farren said: &ldquo;I think the suggestion contained in the message from the Dáil is most satisfactory.  It is a sensible proposition.&rdquo;  The resolution was acquiesced in almost unanimously, after you, Sir, had pointed out that this was the method and procedure adopted by other countries.  I do not see what we have to complain of now, and I think we have wasted an hour over a futile discussion.</P>

The Senator points out very properly that I did move a resolution <Col N="1004" /> on a certain date, but I moved a resolution explicitly stating in the terms of reference to the Committee that the terms of appointment and the terms of office of the Oireachtas staff be considered. My point is, and I tried to make it clear, that those appointments were quite outside the terms of reference of the Committee.  I am making a personal explanation that this had reference to the Oireachtas staff.  I maintain that our Seanad staff was not the Oireachtas staff, but the Seanad staff.  Therefore, I maintain I was justified in making the complaint which I now do.</P>

On that occasion there was no question of clerks being raised.  The Seanad had decided previously that the clerks would not be included in it and the clerks were never mentioned at all. It was clearly the Oireachtas staff. Somebody has made a mistake because the words used were: &ldquo;one common Oireachtas staff.&rdquo;  If it is looked up in the Report it will be seen that that was so.

      <P>The Senator is really misrepresenting me repeatedly. I must correct the last misrepresentation. I did not say that I claim plenary powers.  I said that it was expressly declared in the Seanad in my absence that the Committee was to have plenary powers.  The question was put to Senator Sir Hutcheson Poë, who moved or seconded the motion.  He was asked &ldquo;Do you propose to give this Committee plenary powers&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;  That is all I know about it.</P>

      <P>That is quite wrong.  You stated that I had said from the Chair to-day that I had claimed plenary powers for that Committee. I never made any such statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>For the moment then I withdraw.  Anyway, the Cathaoirleach was given plenary powers by the Seanad, and the Joint Committee was given plenary powers to act.  That is all I meant to say.  I readily admit that the Committee was given plenary powers, but plenary powers within the resolution, not plenary powers to do anything they liked all over the country.  They had only plenary powers to do everything within what they were instructed to do, and, of course, they had no right to go beyond it.  They had no authority at all to deal with the clerks.  The clerks were specially excluded by the Seanad long before and admitted on the 15th March. When the Oireachtas Staff was referred to everyone understood that the Seanad staff was excluded.  The Chairman has stated that the position in the Dáil and the Seanad are exactly the same.  What happened?  In the Dáil the Minister for Finance and the Ceann Comhairle were to nominate.  From the Seanad there was only one member, the Cathaoirleach. The Seanad has to decide now if it will go back on what was adopted at the beginning.  From the statement in the report of the Committee it would <Col N="1006" /> appear that I proposed, and Senator Bennett seconded, the adoption of the report, with the exception of one clause. Senator Bennett, who was beside me, agrees with me that we did not do so. I do not think it is fair that having made that statement the Cathaoirleach should insist in including our names in the report.  May I ask that my name and Senator Bennett's be excluded from the report.</P>

      <P>I am not dealing with that, but as you have raised it, I wish to say distinctly that my recollection is absolutely clear on the matter.  I was struck by it at the time.  You may have forgotten it, but you got up and said that you could approve of every portion of the report except the concluding words of paragraph 5, and that you would move the adoption of the report, omitting these words.  May I also say in further confirmation of what I have said, that I sent out a copy of the report without comment to the members who were present and asked them if it was found correct to return it signed.  Every one of them returned it signed, without any comment, including Senator Bennett, except that Senator Bennett was kind enough to add, it was correct.</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  You said in your speech that this Report had been laid on the Table and that no objection was made to it. We have wasted an hour and a quarter discussing a matter that was laid on the Table and that had no right to be discussed, as the time for doing so had passed.  In future I hope the Standing Orders will be strictly adhered to. There are a number of important amendments sent back here by the Dáil and they should be dealt with. There is also a Bill.  I desire to make this protest, and I hope it will be entered in the Official Report so that the Standing Orders should be strictly adhered to and that time should not be wasted discussing such questions.</P>

      <P>My amendment now is to delete Schedule &ldquo;C&rdquo; of the report of the Committee.  The object is to take out of the senior clerks' list our second assistant clerk and put him amongst the principal clerks.  When the clerks were appointed I was a member of the Committee, and the Cathaoirleach brought them up one after another and explained to them, before appointment, the terms and salaries.  He explained the conditions, and said that they would get the ordinary increments of pay, which, at that time, had not been decided on.  In explaining that to the Seanad, the Cathaoirleach said that the report was an interim one and that it would be necessary for the Committee to deal with their remuneration so far as increments of salary and pensions were concerned.  He also added that he did not wish the officials to consider that the arrangements being made were permanent ones, but that they would be entitled to the increments that would ordinarily accrue.  Now a change has been made by which the salaries of the clerks have been reduced.  The assistant clerk should be taken out of that grade and put into another one.  I am not objecting at all to moving the second <Col N="1008" /> assistant clerk, but I think he should be given a fair chance of getting at least as good a position as he had before. It was very clearly understood at the time that these clerks would not receive any worse terms than they then had.</P>

      <P>I would like to take the views of the Seanad regarding the three other matters on the agenda.  I think it will be necessary for us to meet next week.  There are two or three important Bills and I think we may be fairly expected to deal with them next week, but I do not think there will be business to occupy us more than one day from what I can see of this list.  What I suggest is this.  There is one Bill returned from the Dáil the Local Government Electors Registration Bill, which is urgent because the perfection of the machinery has been hung up pending the fate of this particular amendment inserted in the Seanad.  What I would recommend is that we take it to-day because it is urgent and allow the consideration of the other two Bills to stand over until Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should explain very shortly what is the question.  When the Local Government Electors Registration Bill was in Committee in this House an amendment was put in, which practically deprived of the franchise people who had not paid their rates at a particular date. When that was returned to the Dáil they disagreed with it mainly on the ground that as the Bill itself was really only a Bill to hasten the machinery of registration this was too big a question to discuss in a Bill of that kind.  They rejected our amendment, and it has come back to us.  The question for the Seanad now to decide is&mdash;Will they or will they not adhere to their amendment? It may be put in either a negative or positive form.</P>

      <P>Without meaning any disrespect to the Seanad I think we would be placing ourselves in a ridiculous position by trying to uphold the amendment.  The Bill was simply one for making a new register and did not deal with the question of franchise, whereas this amendment does deal with that question.</P>

      <P>That is not quite accurate.  The question was raised, and I held that it did deal, in Clause 3, with the question of the franchise. It was only on that ground that I allowed the amendment to be moved.</P>
