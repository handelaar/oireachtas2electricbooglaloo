      <P>I have looked through these two Bills, which seem to be more or less of a formal nature.  There does not seem to be anything controversial in them, nor was anything controversial suggested in the other House, and the only question is whether it would be desirable to allow them to remain until we meet again for the Committee Stage, or whether the House would like to take any other course with reference to them.  If no other course is proposed they will appear on the Order Paper for the Committee Stage on the next day we meet.</P>

      <P>Might I say that I have looked through these Bills, and certainly as far as the first is <Col N="148" /> concerned, it is a purely formal measure. I do not think that there is anything contentious in the second either. Inasmuch as we have such a large programme looming before us in the shape of legislation, the Seanad might consider it advisable to go on with these two Bills to-day, if we could do so, by moving the suspension of the Standing Orders, and get them out of the way.  I propose that that should be done.</P>

      <P>I have a little hesitation in deciding that there is anything urgent about these two Bills, and it is only in cases of urgency that the power is conferred for suspending the Standing Orders.  If, however, it is the general desire of the House that the Standing Orders should be suspended for the purpose of passing these two Bills, possibly and probably the contingency hinted at by Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde, as to the congestion that will occur later on would be sufficient reason to bring them within the Order.  Therefore I will raise no point of order if any Senator desires to move the suspension of the Standing Orders in order to enable these two Bills to be put through their remaining stages.  Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde has proposed that Standing Orders be suspended in regard to these two Bills to enable them to be put through their concluding stages.</P>

      <P>One of these Bills, it is true, is merely a formal Bill, that is the Civic Guard (Acquisition of Premises) Bill, but the other is an important measure, and though on the general principle there may be no great difference of opinion, it is possible that in Committee some amendments might suggest themselves to Senators, and I think that in view of the very important body that it covers, some time should be given for the consideration of amendments.  I would favour the suspension of Standing Orders for the first Bill, but not for the other, and I would suggest to the House that it should not pass the second without some further consideration.</P>

      <P>The alternative <Col N="149" /> would be to utilise the precedent we set the other day, and refer those two Bills to a Select Committee.  If we can be certain to get the services of eight members of the House to-morrow who would be prepared to meet for the purpose of passing those two Bills through a Committee, it may meet the situation.</P>

      <P>I think it would be a great mistake to take a Bill which makes all the provision for what is, after all, the principal police force in Ireland, and to pass it through all its Stages in a few days when many of us have not read it from the point of view of seeing if there are any amendments to be suggested.  I think that Bills on which there is no serious difference of opinion on a matter of principle, could be usefully referred to a small Committee. The Bills would then come before the Seanad on Report.  I support your suggestion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To delete the new section which appears from the Report of the Select Committee, to have been inserted immediately <Col N="151" /> before Section 2 of the original Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the House to understand that in Committee there was a new Section 2 inserted. You propose to delete that new section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, simply to delete the section for reasons I will state to the House.  The main object of this Bill is to enable the Corporation to take compulsarily certain parts of any area where there has been destruction, for the purpose of widening or otherwise improving the streets.  When a body under statutory powers takes lands compulsorily they have got to compensate the owners of the lands. The new section which was inserted in Committee is an amendment proposed by the Government, and inserted on the initiative of the Minister.  It deals with the mode in which the Corporation are to compensate, through the arbitrator, the owners of the property which they take under the compulsory powers in the Bill.  The section was subject to a good deal of discussion in the Select Committee, and it was only inserted on the understanding that it was to be reconsidered on Report. The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>2.  Where under the provisions of Section 15 of the said Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, a report in writing in respect of the damage or destruction of any building has been made by a judge to the Minister for Finance, and the site or any part of the site of such building is acquired or purchased compulsorily by the Corporation under this Act&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The arbitrator shall fix and determine the value at the date of the passing of this Act of the estate right or interest in such site or part thereof, and such value shall be the compensation to be awarded by the arbitrator to such person in respect of such compulsory purchase or acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The Corporation shall be entitled to such site or part thereof after paying to every person claiming to be interested therein the compensation awarded by the arbitrator <Col N="152" /> to such person under this section.</P>
    <P>(3)  The arbitrator shall, if so required by the Minister for Finance, also fix and determine the value of every such estate right or interest immediately before the damage or destruction in respect of which such report has been made by a judge to the Ministry of Finance, and shall report to the Minister for Finance the value as so fixed and determined.</P>
    <P>That at best is a very obscure section. Personally I do not know the object which the Minister had in desiring to have it inserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the distinction between sub-sections (1) and (3)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the puzzles of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (1) deals with the interest in the site at the date of the passing of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can explain. I think the value of the site at the date of the passing of the Act is its value now, when it is a tumbled down house or a vacant space.  The value of the site in sub-section (3) is the value of the site before the damage, with the house on it.  I have no doubt, if he were here, the Minister could explain to us for what purpose he wants the value of the site with the house on it ascertained by the arbitrator.  The section is one of great obscurity and I do not know the exact meaning of it. One thing of which I am certain is that it is a section which may do very great injustice to the owners of those sites.  To begin with, it is very objectionable in a Bill which incorporates the Lands Clauses Acts to interfere with the principles on which the arbitrator under these Acts arrives at the amount of his arbitrator.  Therefore, it is a bad principle to begin with to introduce a section into the Bill which will interfere with the ordinary well-known principle on which the arbitrator fixes compensation to which a man is entitled from whom the property is compulsorily taken.  In the next place, it does this in a way which <Col N="153" /> may do very great injustice to the owner of what is called a site under these Acts.</P>
      <P>The principles on which the arbitrator awards compensation under the Lands Clauses Acts in a case like this are perfectly well known.  He gives in the first place the value of the site to the owner&mdash;what it is worth to the owner.  In addition to that he gives compensation for what is known as severance.  That is, if the portion of land taken and the fact that it is taken, diminishes the value of the immediately adjoining property of that owner, he is entitled to be compensated for that.  Now, the value of the site to the owner under the present Act at the date of the passing of the Act is much more than the value of the site itself.  It is the value of the site itself, and attached to that site there is the certainty of an <i>ex-gratia</i> grant from the Government of an amount already recommended in these cases by the Recorder.  There is also the advantage attached to the site under this very Bill itself, the advantage of borrowing money at a low rate of interest repayable by easy instalments. Therefore, the value of the site to the owner at the date of the passing of this Act is very much more than the value of the mere site itself, and includes the added value of these advantages which it gets under the Compensation Act of 1923 and under this very Bill itself.  Therefore, if the arbitrator was confined, as I think he might be under this new section, to valuing the site merely as a site, he would be doing a very great injustice to the owner.  Apart from that, under this new section it is quite clear that he could not give any compensation to the owner of a site for severance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will observe that the section deals not only with a site but a part of a site, and under this the Corporation can take, for the purpose of widening a street, a strip off a site, leaving the site much too small for any useful purpose.  Under this new section as drafted it is quite clear that the arbitrator could not give any such compensation and, therefore, the section might work very considerable injustice in the two ways I have pointed out.  I would suggest to the <Col N="154" /> Ministry that it would be far better to allow compensation to be fixed in the mode in which it has been fixed for eighty years under the Lands Clauses Act.  It does perfect justice to the owner, if the arbitrator does his duty, as arbitrators have always done, I think. If this section remains in the Bill it will not do perfect justice to the owner or it may not do perfect justice.  For these reasons I suggest it would be wise to omit the section altogether and allow compensation to be fixed, as it has been fixed all these years, under the Lands Clauses Acts.</P>

      <P>If this motion was carried, does the Bill contain then any provision dealing with compensation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I ought to have explained that before this section was inserted, the Bill provided in the schedule that the Minister is to make an order, when the Corporation ask him, to allow them to acquire compulsorily a certain plot of land or site, and he in his order is directed to incorporate the Lands Clauses Acts for the purpose of compensation for the compulsory acquisition of these sites. In that way, indirectly, the Lands Clauses Acts are incorporated in the Bill.  As this Bill was drafted, before the new section was put in, compensation would be assessed in the ordinary way by the arbitrator under the Lands Clauses Acts and on the principles defined by these Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you quite clear that if the section is removed altogether, and the only reference as to the mode of assessment is to be found in the scheduling of the Lands Clauses Acts, that it is a direction binding upon the arbitrator to work under the Lands Clauses Acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>

      <P>The new section on the Orders of the day.  As I understand, in Committee, a new <Col N="155" /> section was inserted before Section 2 of the original Bill.  The new section was inserted at the request of the Government, and with some hesitation on the part of the Committee.  Senator Brown's motion is to delete that section for the reasons he has given and thereby restore the Bill in that respect to its original form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  I may add that the new section introduced into the Bill was an alternative section by the Government to a section that Senator Mrs. Wyse Power had given notice of in Committee.  If I may say so, Senator Mrs. Wyse Power's amendment was much the better of the two, as she in her amendment fell back on the Lands Clauses Acts.</P>

I would call the attention of the Senator to the following reference in the Bill:&mdash;&ldquo;The arbitrator shall fix and determine the value at the date of the passing of this Act of the estate, right or interest in such site.&rdquo;  Would not these words, &ldquo;interest in&rdquo; cover this <i>ex-gratia</i> grant, and also the power of borrowing money on very favourable terms?</P>

      <P>It would be quite possible to amend this section so as to make it include the matters Senator Brown is anxious about.  What he has pointed out is that, if this section is removed, there is enough left in the Bill to enforce the carrying out of this arbitration in accordance with the Lands Clauses Acts.</P>

      <P>As I understand the position, this Bill gives certain powers to the municipality for the purpose of acquiring land, to widen or straighten streets, or to make new streets.  It only relates to the area where destruction has taken place, and really only touches the fringe of the general question.  I would be very slow to interfere in any way with the rights of the municipality to acquire land compulsorily, wherever they need it, for the improvement of the City of Dublin.  It is quite patent to those of us who frequent Dublin that some of the streets require to be widened and others require to be straightened.  In fact, if Dublin is ever to be made a proper Capital, a good deal of reconstruction will have to take place.  I would like to hear Senator Brown more fully on the point.</P>

      <P>If that right is not interfered with it removes my objection.  It seems to me that the point Senator Brown has made about the Lands Clauses Acts is met in the schedule.  Section 1 of the schedule lays down that where a corporation propose to acquire lands compulsorily under this Act they submit their offer to the Minister.  It specifies clauses of the Lands Clauses Acts.  Probably there would be no objection to leaving out this section, provided the rights of the municipality are preserved, in as much as power exists in the schedule to make the corporation take advantage of the Lands Clauses Acts.</P>

      <P>Senator Brown said he did not understand the new section. If that is so it will be very hard to expect that I should understand it. What I understand happened about it was this: before the Select Committee which considered this Bill a certain new section was put down in the name of Senator Mrs. Wyse Power and myself jointly.  This new section was drafted by the Law Agent to the Corporation, and what we understood was that the Corporation was anxious to safeguard the position of the citizens and the ratepayers generally, so that they would not be called upon to pay on the double for one particular site. The position as I understand it is that compensation has already been awarded to persons whose property was destroyed, and if we delete the section it will mean, if the Corporation want to acquire a site for the purpose of widening a street, they will have to pay compensation again to people who have already been compensated.  I may mention that in this instance it is only one particular site is required.  The intention, as far as I understand it, is to make a new thoroughfare linking up O'Connell Street with Amiens Street. It is proposed to make the new street through O'Connell Street into Gloucester Street, and the intention is to take one particular site so that that may be done.  The proposal is to make room for the new thoroughfare.  It is proposed not to take part of a site but the whole of a site.  The Corporation say that if the ratepayers have to pay compensation to the persons who owned this property, and the Recorder has already given very liberal compensation in most cases, that when they come to acquire a mere site they will not have to pay for bricks and mortar that were not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As compensation has already been given for the property destroyed, and as the Corporation only require the site, it would not be fair that the ratepayers should have to pay on the double when the site merely is required. The ratepayers are being taxed pretty heavily to pay compensation for the property already destroyed, without having to pay on the double for the same property again.  I understand that this section is framed <Col N="158" /> for the purpose of seeing that a fair value is paid for the site, and that this value should be fixed by the arbitrator. The section that was put down in the name of Senator Mrs. Wyse Power and myself was withdrawn on the suggestion of the Minister, on the grounds that the amendment submitted now meets the point and satisfies the position better than the section which was prepared by the Law Agent for the Corporation. I think the Seanad ought not to accept this amendment in view of the fact that the Minister responsible for this Bill is not present.  I think we ought to postpone it in order to allow the Minister responsible to be present, so that we could hear his views on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Farren has really explained what happened at the meeting of the Select Committee.  We were all just as much in a fog as, I think, the Senator himself confesses to be in now.  As regards the amendment, we did see that it could be used to the detriment of the individual and to the advantage of, let us say, the Corporation or the State.  During the whole discussion we were anxious to take care that such rights as the individual owner had now should not be interfered with.  As far as I understood the matter, it was left over for the Minister to get an amendment drafted which would preserve to the individual owner the rights which he now has.  I think Senator Brown has made it quite clear that the amendment, as it now stands, does not preserve to the owner the rights which he had, and I agree with Senator Farren that before we agree to do anything finally on this amendment we should have the Minister here.  He knew that we had a long discussion about it, and that we were very hazy about it.  He knew that even we, who sat on the Committee, would have to get the amendment explained to us when it came before the Seanad.  Now we have nobody to advise us on the subject. There is really nobody here capable of answering Senator Brown's statement, which seems to be perfectly clear as far as the effect of the amendment is concerned.  With that state of affairs in front of them, it is for the Seanad <Col N="159" /> to say whether they are going to postpone this Bill to-day.  The idea of setting up the Select Committee was to expedite the passage of the Bill.  Here we are now being held up.  The Seanad is ready to pass the Bill if we were once satisfied about this amendment, but I do not see how the Seanad can refuse to consider the aspect of the matter that has been put before us by Senator Brown.  The Minister knew that the matter would be dealt with to-day, and he knew that we had a good deal of discussion about it.  It would be well, I think, if he were here to give us some information before we come to a final decision on the matter.</P>

      <P>I think that every member of the Select Committee who has spoken has really put himself in the dock.  They have told us that they had a full discussion in regard to this at the meeting of the Select Committee. This amendment was evidently carried unanimously at their meeting, but as far as one can gather, they all come here now and tell us that it embodies something which not one of them understands.  They come along now and they ask us to relieve them of their responsibilities.  Senator Mrs. Wyse Power's amendment does not seem to me to clear the air very much.  At the same time it would seem as if some amendment were necessary if a lot of litigation is to be avoided.  I think a lot of the arguments that have been put up to-day should have been put up before the Select Committee before this was agreed to.  Personally, I am not in favour of adjourning the matter for the attendance of the Minister.  If his attendance is necessary here it is his business to know that, and he should be here.  We cannot be holding up every little amendment that requires Government attention for the attendance of a Minister.  If he does not think it worth his while to attend, then I do not think we should adjourn this. I do not see any great danger in the amendment as it stands, because it does not prohibit the arbitrator from taking into consideration the interests which Senator Brown has mentioned.  In other words, it will provide to have taken into consideration the question of consequential loss, which is not provided <Col N="160" /> for under the Property Compensation Act.  No compensation in respect of consequential loss arising out of destruction during the trouble has been allowed for, and I do not know if it is the intention to make allowances of that kind.</P>

      <P>The difficulty in the section as it stands is this: it is not that the arbitrator shall fix and determine the estate, right and interest, but it is the estate, right or interest. In other words, interest there, I think, is plainly used in its legal sense and refers to the extent and nature of the ownership&mdash;the quality of the ownership whatever it may be. What Senator Brown is anxious to include in it is not merely his interest or title, but any other interest he may have in the matter, such as an award on the question of severance.  That is not covered by the section though it may have been the intention to include it.  I do not profess to be able to tell you offhand what is the legal effect of the section at all.  Certainly it is not clear as it stands.</P>

      <P>I did my best to amend the section in some way so that it would carry out the intention I had in mind myself.  The intention I had in mind was to protect the owner in such a way that he would get what he would be entitled to under the Lands Clauses Act.  But I was unable to put in the section words that, in form, would carry that out.  In the alternative section proposed by Senator Mrs. Wyse Power, there was an express section or sub-section excluding the right to give any compensation owing to the fact that an award had been made for the destruction of the premises. The alternative section I have referred to actually excluded that, and it is that that makes me look on this present section with still more suspicion.</P>

    <P>This Committee was appointed by Resolution of the Seanad adopted on the 19th April, 1923, in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That a Committee of the Seanad be appointed to submit to the Government a scheme for the editing, indexing, and publishing of manuscripts in the Irish language, now lying in the Royal Irish Academy, Trinity College, and elsewhere; for the scientific investigation of the living dialects; for the compiling and publishing of an adequate dictionary of the older language.  That the Committee have power to invite the assistance of persons not members of the Seanad and to take evidence on the subject; the Committee to consist of Senators W.B. Yeats, Mrs. Alice Stopford Green, Mrs. Costello, and Edward MacLysaght; two to form a quorum.</P>
    <P>The Committee met in accordance with this Resolution on 26th April, 1st May, 3rd May, 31st May and 27th June, 1923, and on the 21st of May, 1924.</P>
    <P>Evidence was heard from the following witnesses:&mdash;Dr. R.L. Praegar, Dr. R.I. Best, The Rev. Dr. Lawlor, Dr. Douglas Hyde, Mr. E.J. Gwynn, F.T.C.D.; Professor O'Bergin, Professor T. O'Rahilly, Mr. R. Foley, and Professor Tomás O'Máille.</P>
    <P>It was decided to make the following report to the Seanad:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Your Committee is gravely impressed by the responsibility now laid upon the Saorstát towards the Irish people.  For the first time in many centuries our country, free and independent, is charged with the pious duty of preserving and making accessible to Irishmen the mass of learning and tradition which forms the basis of our National history&mdash;a body of manuscript tradition bequeathed to us by a noble succession of scholars and scribes throughout a thousand years of labour, and further enriched by folk-lore, folk-song and music, and the important study of topography.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the British Government by its political and administrative <Col N="163" /> policy through a long course of centuries did in fact make wreckage of Irish learning and language. But we are bound to remember that in our own time among the rulers there were men who did not remain deaf to claims of scholarship.  We may recall the valuable services rendered from time to time by enlightened statesmen in funds allotted to such work as the Irish volumes of the &ldquo;Rolls Series&rdquo;; the &ldquo;Historical Manuscripts Commission&rdquo;; the &ldquo;Ancient Laws of Ireland&rdquo;; published by the Government under the direction of the Commissioners; the &ldquo;Ulster Annals,&rdquo; which it published under direction of the Royal Irish Academy. The Government was prepared to do the same with the &ldquo;Annals of Tigernach,&rdquo; when, unfortunately, the editor recommended died.  A grant in aid to the Academy was employed, to issue the Todd Lectures, Facsimiles, etc., etc.  For some years a grant was also given to the School of Irish Learning founded by Dr. Kuno Meyer, £700 in all.</P>
    <P>These are a few illustrations of obligations to the country recognised by a British administration.  We claim that the Irish Nation should fare no worse under a home Government, when it depends on its own honour, its own patriotism and resources, to complete the task of research, to preserve for future generations all that has been or can be saved of older learning, and to secure to the people of Ireland their full national tradition.</P>
    <P>We may observe that the present moment is usually favourable for reviving and enlarging the study of Old Irish Law and government even beyond the bounds of this country; since the important research work of Professor MacNeill is rousing amongst foremost Continental scholars a new interest not only in questions of language but of the study of Comparative Law.  By judicious use of its scholars and its means Ireland may take the lead in a new historic movement.</P>
    <P>Your Committee, in the course of enquiry, has interviewed many witnesses of the most diverse groups and opinions. We have endeavoured to find <Col N="164" /> out the points on which there is practically unanimous opinion, and to advise measures which are of urgent necessity, and promise useful results under conditions of sound administration and sympathetic aid.  We therefore recommend the following suggestions as a basis for any scheme of financial assistance:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The editing and publishing of important texts, both of the early and the classical periods and of modern times, considering Irish literature as forming one indivisible whole.  This work would involve grants in aid of publication to competent scholars.</P>
    <P>(2)  Publication of photographic facsimiles of important Codexes by the latest scientific processes.  This is most essential for purposes of study.  A grant to aid in the production of such a facsimile might be given to a learned body outside Ireland&mdash;for example, to the Oxford Press for the publication of Ms. Laud 610.</P>
    <P>(3)  The dictionary of Old Irish in course of preparation by the Royal Irish Academy under the editorship of Dr. Bergin&mdash;a work of enormous labour and difficulty&mdash;should receive further aid.  Its progress must be slow, as the meaning and use of old Irish words can only be determined when more texts are made available by editors and photographers for the work of the Dictionary.  At present three workers are employed, necessarily on half-time which is as much as the excessive strain of the task will allow. The number of workers might be increased to six&mdash;all on half-time.</P>
    <P>(4)  The publication of Catalogues of MSS. is of great importance for students.  Catalogues should be compiled not only for the Royal Irish Academy but for collections elsewhere, as for example, in the Franciscan Convent, and the King's Inns, the National Library, and many others in Ireland or outside.  We suggest that the Dictionary workers, and others, now employed at half-time, might most profitably also serve in this task of cataloguing.</P>
    <P>(5)  Investigation of living dialects. This work is of immense importance when dialects are rapidly dying out. It has been done in patches of the Irish speaking regions, but a systematic <Col N="165" /> study is in fact essential, and the work cannot be relegated to volunteers.  Research should be endowed.  For example, a grant to a trained phonetist would be of the utmost value, with aid in the publication of his results.  It is unnecessary to add how great would be the stimulus given by such training to local workers in Gaelic-speaking regions.</P>
    <P>(6)  Folk-lore, songs and traditions cannot be neglected.  The best aid would be a grant towards publication of work done, as for example, a grant to the Irish-Folk Song Society in aid of publishing work submitted by the Society and approved.</P>
    <P>(7)  The Academy has drawn attention to two other needs of a pressing character: a survey of the antiquities of the country, such as is at present being carried out by Commissions in England, Wales and Scotland.  In this connection it remarks that the measurements and plans of earthworks of different types and surveys of cairns already published by the Academy would serve as a nucleus for this undertaking.  The work might be very gradually carried out, district by district.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Excavations should also be conducted under scientific direction of the more important archæological sites, to determine their age, significance and historical associations.</P>
    <P>In the view of the Committee all grants should be allocated by an authoritative body, including trained Irish scholars, animated with the desire to encourage students by the assurance of means of publication of their work.  We have, therefore, enquired into the best machinery by which these suggestions may profitably be carried out, and the body to which public funds should be entrusted.</P>
    <P>The body which in our opinion is marked out for the development of Irish studies is the &ldquo;Royal Irish Academy,&rdquo; which has now incorporated the &ldquo;School of Irish Learning.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Academy was founded to encourage learning in a wide range of Sciences in which it has earned distinction. It has also charge of linguistics and archaeology, and Irish research has long been a notable part of its business. <Col N="166" /> Since it has no special funds for archaeological work, apart from occasional grants, its resources have been spent on publication.  The Government grant is £1,600, and £885 comes from members' subscriptions and other sources. On a total income of £2,485 &mdash; with establishment charges of £1,050&mdash;the Academy shows an admirable record of careful administration.  It must be remembered that the benefits it contributes to Irish learning include a library rich in Irish books, to which the public have admission; a valuable collection of ancient MSS.; and also the printing in its &ldquo;Proceedings&rdquo; of important Irish communications.  For many years past an average of six hundred pounds&mdash;over a third of its annual income available for general publication &mdash;has been expended on Irish subjects, literature, archaeology and the like. At the moment the Leabhar na hUidhre (Book of the Dun Cow) is being published at a cost of about £1,000.  The task of publishing the Irish Dictionary, now calculated at nearly £600 a year, must necessarily occupy many years, and remain a heavy charge on finances. All strictly Irish work of the Academy is delegated to an &ldquo;Irish Studies Committee,&rdquo; drawn from two older groups &mdash;the Dictionary Committee and the Irish Manuscripts Committee.  It has enlisted in its service all the best Irish scholars, whose knowledge, experience, and ardour in the cause cannot be surpassed.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;School of Irish Learning&rdquo; was founded in 1903 by Dr. Kuno Meyer at a time when there was no regular teaching in Dublin of an advanced nature in Old or Middle Irish. The School held summer courses by professors invited to lecture from England, Scotland, Germany, Denmark, and Norway, and students were attracted from oversea by the remarkable training thus offered.  Travelling scholarships were also given by the School with excellent results.  With a single exception all the professors and lecturers in Irish in the National University Colleges have been students of the School, as also have been Professors of Celtic in Great Britain and abroad.  The work of the School has for some years past been limited to <Col N="167" /> summer courses, the last of which, in 1923, was a remarkable course in Phonetics, and the study of a living Irish dialect by Professor Sommerfelt, of Christiania.</P>
    <P>An important and enduring work of the School was its journal <i>Eriu</i>, devoted to Irish philology and literature, and recognised in the learned world as the leading review of its kind.  The School also published text-books on Old and Modern Irish which are now used by scholars in every country.</P>
    <P>It was felt desirable at this time to unite forces working for Irish scholarship, so as to avoid all overlapping of effort, all conceivable competition in publications, and all unnecessary doubling of rent and services.  An amicable arrangement has, therefore, been made by which the School of Irish Learning has been incorporated in the Academy, and so far as Irish studies are concerned, <i>Eriu</i> remains the common Journal, the representative work of the united body.</P>
    <P>Your Committee, therefore, after careful consideration, recommend that the authoritative financial control of any grant allotted by the Government should be placed in the Academy whose Irish Committee is fully qualified, trained in this special work, generous in outlook, and easy of access to all.</P>
    <P>We believe that additional funds allotted to it by the Government will be spent not only with a due sense of stewardship, but with an earnest desire to advance the cause of Irish Learning, and to complete the national work of restoring to the Irish people their inherited tradition both of ancient and of later times.</P>
    <P>We fully realise the overwhelming claims on the Government in these times.  On the other hand we feel it to be of great importance that some earnest should at once be given of its sympathy with the national desire to renew and broaden its historical tradition and faith.  We, therefore, recommend that an additional annual grant be given to the Academy, and especially earmarked for the disposal of the Committee of Irish studies on the lines indicated in this Report.  In the existing <Col N="168" /> state of our national finances we do not name a definite sum, but we urge that as liberal a grant as possible should be given immediately, and that the Government should bear in mind that as soon as our financial position allows not less than £5,000 per annum should be devoted to Irish research.</P>

    <P>I hope and indeed I have no doubt that the Seanad will accept this report. I would like, however, to draw the special attention of one section in the Seanad to the nature of the report. Certain members of the Seanad have. I think, a great dislike to pray in a language they do not understand. There are other members of the Seanad who dislike having our Acts of Parliament expensively printed in two languages. That may be right or wrong; but this is an entirely different question.  We are asking the Seanad to urge upon the Government to do a work for learning, a work for literature and a work for history which any Government in the world would consider its duty and its privilege. This country possesses a great mass of old mediaeval literature in the Irish language.  There are great collections of manuscripts in the Royal Irish Academy in the Library of Trinity College, at Maynooth, and in the Franciscan library.  There are very large collections of manuscripts in other countries.  There is a great collection in the British Museum, in the Bodlean, and in the Louvain. These manuscripts are a historical trust to this nation, but they should be interpreted, edited, indexed, and catalogued.</P>
    <P>Much work has been done on them in the past &mdash; much by Irishmen, much by Germans, and to some extent we may say that the centre of Irish scholarship has in recent years been in Germany. But the German interest is only <Col N="169" /> primarily a philological interest.  If we are to exhaust the value of these manuscripts for literature and history we must do that work ourselves.  They possess first of all their value to this country; then they possess their value to the world.  They consist of stories, annals, and poetry.  I think that all the famous stories have been translated and have been edited.  We will learn nothing new of importance about Finn and Cuchulain and other old Irish heroes or Kings of the legendary period.  The annals have to a great extent been edited and translated, but I understand, they have been badly edited and translated in many cases, and if they are to be of historical value that work has to be done over again. In the case of poetry there is probably still a large quantity of untranslated and of even unread poetry.</P>
    <P>That poetry would be of two kinds: First of all, what is called the official poetry, not of great literary value but of great historical value &mdash; the work of the official Bards.  But there is also much poetry which is personal expression &mdash; that kind of poetry which Dr. Kuno Meyer has translated in recent years.  If we can judge the unread and unedited by the read and edited, they will be of supreme value.  I should say that we had evidence given before us, that great scholars might work for 100 years on the old Irish manuscripts now in the possession of the Nation, and in the possession of other nations without having exhausted the subject. We are anxious that provision should be made for that work and that the work should be carried out.  Already the traditional imagination in these old books has had a powerful effect upon the life, and I may say upon the politics, of Ireland.  People forget that the twenties, forties and fifties of the last century was the forming period of Irish nationality, and that the work was begun by O'Donovan, Petrie and men steeped in this old literature.</P>
    <P>We owe it also to learning and the scholarship of the world that we should provide means for the doing of this great work.  Twenty years ago, in Paris, I knew slightly the great French scholar, D'Arbois de Jubanville, who devoted his life to the study of our literature because he believed that only <Col N="170" /> through that literature could he find light on the most important secular event in human history.  Going back 1,000 or 1,200 years before Christ we find Dorian tribes descending on the Mediterranean civilization.  They destroyed much and wandered much, and it has been held that we owe to their destruction, the story, of the Fall of Troy, and to their wandering, the Story of Odyssey.  D'Arbois de Jubanville considered that only through Irish literature can you rediscover the civilization of these tribes before they entered the Mediterranean. That does not mean than our people were the Greeks or that our literature is as old as 1,200 years before Christ, but our legends and our books have preserved and gathered together the old literature and much of the history of a similar period.  We ask you to urge upon the Government that they, shall place in the hands of the Royal Irish Academy sufficient funds.  We heard much evidence and we came to the conclusion that the Royal Irish Academy itself contains within its limits practically all the great Irish scholars and that it is the proper body to carry out this work in a spirit of scholarship. The danger is that it may be carried out in some other spirit.  It is most important that nothing should be taken into consideration except the interest of scholarship alone.</P>
    <P>It should not be allowed to become a means by which some man will make a living until he gets some other occupation; the money should be used to help a man whose life-work is study and scholarship. It has been contended that the Royal Irish Academy is not a democratic body and that therefore we should not ask the Government to endow it in this way.  I have heard it contended that it is not a democratic body because by its rules it can only elect seven new members every year. Twenty years ago I should not have been able to invite you, with the same confidence, to ask the Royal Irish Academy to undertake this work, because twenty years ago it had not that rule.  It could elect any person who professed himself interested in the subjects with which it dealt.  That rule of <Col N="171" /> electing only seven members a year was instituted in order to raise the position of the Academy by making it necessary to elect those only who were eminent in the studies of the Academy, and not merely interested in those studies.  I think I am right in saying that since that rule was passed the Academy has risen more and more in the estimation of the learned, and in helping it to do its work we are helping a body which has advanced the learning of this country.  I beg to move the adoption of the Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. STOPFORD GREEN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second.  I would like to make two or three explanations about the matter. There, is, I think, a certain fear amongst some people that a learned body like the Academy will be contemptuous of modern Irish or at least neglectful of it.  I do not think that there is the slightest fear of that.  We have marked plainly that the language is one and indivisible from beginning to end.  I remember one of the greatest scholars of the last generation saying to me: &ldquo;There are three ages of Irish language; there is the language up to 1000, which is worthy of study and an honourable language; there is a language from 1000 to about 1600, which is an inferior and common language, not worth much interest, but which must be read, because it occasionally contains a word of the old language, or expressions which help one to understand it.  There is a third language, from 1600 to the present day, and with that no sensible person has anything to do.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe my friend was fast abandoning that theory, but I am quite sure that you will find no scholar whatever in Ireland who would have any sympathy with such a statement as that, and I do not in the slightest degree fear that modern Irish will be neglected. That is consoling, but I wish to give a warning also that the difficulty of editing a modern Irish text is as great as the difficulty of editing an ancient one.  The work requires the same aptitude, the same scholarship and the same laborious toil.  With regard to the preparing of the materials for scholars to work on, that is a most essential part of the work to begin immediately. <Col N="172" /> The first thing is the preparation of the material for the coming scholars.  In the first place it is of the-greatest importance to have facsimiles made of the old manuscripts which exist in a single copy, which are far away from Ireland in many cases, and which must be here for the scholars to work on.  Facsimiles are extremely difficult to make.  With ordinary photography the manuscript comes up black and cannot be read.  The most difficult and delicate process now is by the use of reflecting glasses, which is scientific and skilled work, and it is also very costly.  But that for the preservation of the manuscript and for the work of scholars is absolutely necessary, however costly it may be.  There is also a quantity of preparatory work to be done.  Dictionaries, I believe, ought to be done, though not on such a great scale as in the case of that which is now being carried out.  The transcribing of certain documents and the cataloguing of them so that scholars, when they come on, may know where to get what has already been printed and the catalogue it is to be found in.  With regard to publication we hope that new workers, earnestly interested in Irish, will be encouraged by the hope of publication and the esteem and regard which they would get in bringing out new work.  In one respect we have gone beyond our terms of reference, that is, in urging that work of survey and archæological research should be kept constantly going.  Its importance cannot be exaggerated.  The general history of Ireland depends on local history and local history depends on the examination and knowledge of the various sites. A single illustration will show what can be done.  A few years ago three members of the Royal Academy visited Carrowkeel in Sligo, a site omitted by the old Ordnance Survey.  They there discovered what had been missed by every Ordnance Survey officer; a very important site, the site of the most ancient village in Western Europe and in connection with it, burial mounds as important as Brugh-na-Boinne, a very important discovery that shows what can still be done.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost of this, we are asking for a considerable sum, and this is a kind of rough allocation which <Col N="173" /> is not authoritative in any way, but which indicates what may be done.  No less than £1,500 is required for photographing facsimiles for the reasons that I have given.  The Dictionary is matter which goes on continually.  A sum of £250 should be given for the publication of catalogues of manuscripts to guide the scholar.  There should be an investigation into living dialects.  £500 would not be too much to spend on that important issue.  Folk-lore and songs would take £150.  This is a perfectly rough calculation, but it gives some idea of the sum now.  For the publishing and editing of the texts, £750, perhaps, is required.  Further, that will lie with the great authority to whom we all bow, the Ministry.  As for the general importance of the subject of this work, there will be, no doubt, considerable difference in this assembly.  I might suggest a reason very briefly.  There are probably many more reasons, but there is no need to weary you, if the first three are not sufficient.  I would ask you to suppose that, as an Irish nation, it would be seemly for us to have a history which somebody in the country could read with pleasure.  We know that the present situation is that up to 1150 there is no history written at all.  From that time, all we know comes from the tomes and volumes that lie on our shelves.  We have, I know, a mighty series of solid volumes by laborious, conscientious and patient writers, whom we read with esteem, but may I say, with all respect, not with corresponding exhilaration.</P>
    <P>Knowing my own weakness, I challenge any member of the Seanad to tell us whether he ever got through those tomes of monotonous detail, those volumes of mediæval history, whether he has been able to see the wood from the trees, whether he has got any clear comprehension of Irish history at the end, and whether he does not think Ireland the most God-forsaken country in the civilised world.  I do not blame the writers.  It was their material that went wrong.  It is very well to have piled up stacks of English State Papers, but some kind of an intermixture is needed if you want to read Irish State history.  Where are what we call the Irish State Papers, the writing of our <Col N="174" /> own people?  They have been neglected, burned, buried, drowned, torn in pieces as badly as ever the Danes had done. They do not come at all into reckoning with the writers of history.  The result is that Ireland has history that is no history at all.  We cannot be a self-respecting nation until we have the Irish State Papers &mdash; in other words, until Irish writings are expounded and gathered together.</P>
    <P>A scholar told me two days ago that he had discovered 30 important works by an important person which had been turned over and neglected.  Therefore, what we absolutely need is a full aid to the Irish language in the editing, reading and bringing out of all those masses of Irish material so that we shall have the new story of her history. Professor MacNeill has been the first pioneer to point out the real road by giving us for the first time a true translation of the old Irish laws.  The whole of Irish history will have to be re-written.  The early part will not have to be re-written because it has not been written at all; it is only alluded to.  I urge, therefore, that if we wish to encourage the self-respect of the Irish nation and the respect of other people for this nation there must be the most generous effort made to give us our history, and to give it to us on lines of full and adequate knowledge.</P>
    <P>My second reason for urging the encouragement of the Irish language is one of simple pride.  There was no country in mediæval Europe which was so intensely and passionately beloved by its people.  The people of Ireland were not made one people by race. They were made one people by the land they loved.  It was to them as a living being.  They always called it by the name of a woman.  Every rock, ruin and mound, every spot of it was known to them and beloved for its beauty, its homeliness in the homeland, and its heroic memories.  That affection lasted long.  Over one hundred years ago, when the Ordnance Survey was opened in Derry, the people were so impassioned by having their old boundaries. landmarks, fields and memorials of their ancestors known, that the Government thought it better to stop the whole work to the lasting loss of history. When, a few years ago, there <Col N="175" /> were papers written in Arthur Griffith's journals about Irish sites of any importance it was the most touching sight I have seen to witness the quiet groups of local pilgrims visiting the long-forsaken memorials of their own people. I do not know if I should be trespassing too much to tell of a touching incident of the other day.  There was an old woman of over 100 years.  No one knew how much over 100 she was.  She gave the slip to her friends one day and disappeared.  She was lost for some time, but she finally returned with the story that she had been to Ireland.  She went first from London to Dublin. Then she went to Galway and walked about 20 miles to her own home.  She was picked up by a kindly farmer and sheltered for the night.  When she returned she said: &ldquo;I heard they were murdering each other in Ireland.  I went over to see.  Do not you people believe a word of it.  I did not see a single murder when I was there.&rdquo;  That good old woman had the honour of Ireland at heart.</P>
    <P>Last, I plead for ourselves now alive.  We owe it to ourselves.  We now see the result in this country of the breaking of a great, tradition. We are now divided into several parties, and groups contending with each other, and not one of them has reached a decent age.  The most elderly, founded by foreign arms, boasts of a venerable antiquity going back to 1685.  The younger groups go back about 100 years and later than that.  About three or four of them were founded in the last part of the 18th century.  All of them are with foreign ideas, having foreign arms to back them, foreign hopes and the old traditions that gathered and united the people together are broken.  What we want is to restore to them that ancient tradition and that honourable faith, so that they may become a real nation.</P>

    <P>There is another point I want to make.  I saw a serious criticism of the report of this body.  It was written in English, I suppose naturally, seeing that our Report also is in English.  It suggested that we ought to have made some provision for the National University whereby they would be enabled to publish the theses of students which are written there in Irish.  That seems to indicate a lack of understanding as to the exact scope of our inquiry.  Our Terms of Reference really prevented us from going outside the question of the manuscripts which are lying in the Royal Irish Academy and other places. On the other hand, people ought not to think that we are only dealing with ancient manuscripts.  Senator Mrs. Green has pointed out that in our Report we deal with modern Irish.  I am not sure that the ordinary man can realise what modern Irish is.  When the Senator spoke of modern Irish she was really referring more to literature which started about 1600 or later on. Senators are aware that there was a prolific output of Irish up to the Union.</P>
    <P>I suppose it was not until the Famine that the Irish language really began to decay.  Personally, I was a little afraid that a learned body like the Royal Irish Academy would look a little coldly on the more modern Irish literature, but my objections have been largely removed by Senator Mrs. Green's argument.  I am not an authority on Irish manuscripts, but I know of one in the Royal Irish Academy of which the date is as late as 1830.  I hope such manuscripts will not be overlooked.  This particular manuscript, only a few pages of which have been published, is one of the greatest possible interest.  It is a document of human interest, and throws a light on the social life of Ireland about that time, from the point of view of Irish-speaking men, which no other document I have ever seen does.  I mention that just to show that this is not what you might call a dry-as-dust subject. <Col N="177" /> When this Motion is passed I hope the Government will not pigeon-hole it, but make this a small part of that general policy for the re-Gaelicising of the country which has been foreshadowed by the isolated action of individual Departments.  I, for one, await hopefully evidence that the Government as a whole is actuated by the same spirit as one or two of their Departments.</P>

      <P>I think the Report of our Committee is an admirable document, and I would like to congratulate them upon it.  They have dealt with a number of aspects of this most interesting question in a very practical way.  I welcome the Report because I think it is the beginning of what we should have had in this country for many years&mdash;an Irish Record Commission; some official body that would take steps to translate and bring to our notice all the wealth of Irish literature and history that is isolated and scattered practically all over Europe.  This is a very admirable beginning, and I cordially support the appeal for assistance from the public purse.  Every self-respecting country has an interest in its own history and records, and in this country, with the assistance of the Government, we should have every possible light and information that is to be had in connection with our ancient history and language, and also with the various stages of civilisation through which the country has passed in the course of its long history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased with the recommendation that modern Irish as well as ancient Irish should be studied and, if possible, developed, because we know perfectly well that the difficulty of understanding much of the meaning of the very ancient Irish may be, to a certain extent, lessened by the study of modern Irish.  Modern Irish is naturally the development of ancient Irish and it will teach us very much indeed.  I am also glad that our Committee has gone beyond its terms of reference in its suggestions with regard to the excavation and investigation of our national monuments and antiquities.  I have always been glad to express my appreciation of the latter-day policy of the Irish Board of Works and of the Irish Ordnance Survey. <Col N="178" /> Both these institutions have given immense service in the cause of Irish archæology, and the latest sheets of the Ordnance Survey have reminded us of very many of our antiquities that we were in danger of forgetting.  I am glad that our Committee has suggested that examination into our national monuments should be done scientifically. There is ever so much to be learned of the habits and customs of the people and their progress by the proper examination of these historical monuments.  The strata, the different layers of soil and ashes, etc., which repose one on top of the other, may give us very great information as to what manner of people lived in these ancient habitations.  I think the most valuable part of their report is that entrusting this portion of the work to the Royal Irish Academy.  Personally, I do not think it could be entrusted to better hands.  It is a very scientific body and has done an enormous service to Irish archæology and is capable of doing much greater service in the future.  I cordially support that part of the report and congratulate the Committee on their work, particularly where they travelled outside the terms of reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. SIGERSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems somewhat strange to me that the Seanad should be asked to concur in the formation of a catalogue of manuscripts.  Every learned society has a catalogue of its manuscripts.  The Royal Irish Academy has one.  Trinity College has one which was compiled by O'Reilly, author of the great dictionary.  The British Museum has one which was compiled by Standish Hayes O'Grady, which is a model catalogue.  In the library in Brussels there is also a catalogue of Irish manuscripts open to visitors.  I read several Irish poems there.  It does not seem as if this is a matter of great urgency.  No doubt, a catalogue, complete and comprehensive, would be an admirable work, and would be useful to scholars at home and abroad, but as a rule, these scholars have knowledge of where manuscripts are deposited and of their contents.  Would it not be better to produce something of wider and more general interest, something which lies unpublished, the work of authors who were assembled together <Col N="179" /> in that great undertaking, the Ordnance Survey of Ireland?  There you have men like Petrie, O'Donovan, O'Curry and some others.  Their work was intense, meticulous and exact. They worked at it for years and you will find their recorded work in the bound but unwritten volumes of the Ordnance Survey stored in the Royal Irish Academy.  When you open these you will find not mere catalogues of names or of descriptions but the intensive work of scholars who, in dealing with localities, sought for references amongst the living and in the records of the dead.  You will find there, not merely transcripts of ancient Irish manuscripts but transcripts of Latin manuscripts, transcripts of historical references and maps referring to all localities.  These are very valuable, to a certain extent invaluable, manuscripts which are left lying there unnoticed, except when some rare scholar comes, perhaps from the Continent, to examine them.  I have known some of my friends to come and publish their researches in Continental places.  What were the works of these men intended for?  Formerly county histories of Ireland were published.  Some of these are of great historical, value.  It was intended that this Ordnance Survey would produce not only a survey of each county, but a complete record of its place in history.  When the work was begun the one county selected was the County Derry.  That history was printed but the intellectual generosity of the Government at that time dried up suddenly and no more histories were published.  All the rest were placed under lock and key and await the research of foreigners.  I would suggest that it is the more urgent work because you have already a summary of many great and intense works.  That is a subject which will interest, not only the few distinguished scholars, but also the people at large by, for the first time, placing in their hands in each county, a record of their position in Irish history.  If you desire the people to take an intelligent interest in history you cannot do anything better than give them an account of the proceedings of their forefathers, and, if possible, also supply some aids to the <Col N="180" /> cultivation of music, and the popular lore of their country.</P>
      <P>That looks after itself to some extent, but this great literary work requires the assistance of the State. Otherwise it might lie locked up for another score or two score, or even four score of years, as it has done since its origin.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government is here now and we will resume the debate on the Dublin Reconstruction Bill.  It is well, perhaps, that I should tell the Minister what happened.  Senator Brown has moved the deletion of a section that was adopted and inserted in the Committee, I think at the suggestion of the Government.  He has moved its deletion on the ground that in his view it does not make sufficient provision or give sufficient instruction to the arbitrator with regard to the different interests of the owner that may be affected.  In other words, the expression, &ldquo;his estate or interest&rdquo; seems to exclude anything but the ownership of the estate or interest, and pays no regard to the fact that the site may have been the subject matter of compensation by the Government, and also that it makes no provision in a case where a part only of property is taken, or for the damage done by severance to the remaining part of the property.</P>

      <P>In suggesting this amendment to the Special Committee for its consideration I found myself in rather a novel role, that is to say, in the position of acting as a champion of the Dublin Corporation and its rights.  We were faced with a rather difficult problem in bringing forward this amendment.  We had to reconcile the claims of the Government, of the <Col N="181" /> owner and of the Corporation, which was a very difficult thing to do in a matter of this kind.  Under this amendment we thought that these claims would be fairly met if the Corporation paid the building owner for the value of the site and left the owner afterwards his right against the Minister for Finance, in so far as he had a right, for the value of the buildings that were on the site when it was destroyed.  That is really the whole point of the amendment. I do not know exactly what Senator Brown's objections to it are.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have fairly summarised Senator Brown's objections to this amendment. He pointed out, in the first place, that by confining the arbitrator to the estate or interest, he is then merely to deal with the actual place itself as distinguished from any rights or interests that may attach to it.  He illustrated this by referring to the right to receive a certain amount of compensation from the Government.  That added value to the site.  Another illustration he gave was that taking part of a site might leave on the owner's hands a portion that was materially injured by being cut in two, and that therefore the arbitrator ought to be empowered to have regard to the injury resulting from severance.  In other words, his argument may be summarised this way, that the arbitrator should carry out his inquiry in accordance with the Lands Clauses Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can appreciate what the Minister's intention was in framing this section as he did.  The intention was that the owner of the site should not get more from anybody than what the value of the site was before the destruction, that is to say, the site with the old house on it.  That <Col N="182" /> was to be the maximum of his compensation, but he was not to get that from the Corporation.  He was only to get from the Corporation the value which the arbitrator placed on the site qua site, and without any of the advantages that attach to the site.  The point is that the owner was to get no compensation for severance or anything of that kind.  That was all that the Corporation was to give, and the difference was to be met in the shape of a moral claim against the Minister for Finance; the difference between that and the value of the house before destruction.</P>
      <P>I can quite appreciate the Minister's point that the Corporation should get the benefit of the <i>ex gratia</i> grant to some extent at any rate, but I very much object to the principle and to the way in which it is being done here.  The way it is being done here is simply by getting a small amount fixed as the value of the site and then leaving the owner to make the best case he can as regards his moral claim against the Minister for Finance.  On behalf of the owners of property I object to that and I press on the Minister that the right solution of this problem is to leave the owner of property where he is under the Lands Clauses Acts, and leave it to the Corporation to enforce the moral claim against the Minister for Finance.  I desire to say at once that there is no better form of reconstruction than the widening of streets. The Corporation ought to get the whole of the money that would otherwise have been spent on the reconstruction of houses, but at the same time I think that the owner ought to be entitled to get every penny the <i>ex gratia</i> grant adds to the value of the site and that he ought to be left with his rights protected under the Lands Clauses Acts.</P>

      <P>That is my own individual view.  Our resolution was not agreeable to the Special Committee because the Government had another one.  Therefore, why I did not move my resolution was because I <Col N="183" /> thought I was getting something at all events out of the amendment put in by the Government.  Now, I am afraid Senator Brown is going to take away from me the very small bit that fell to my lot at the Special Committee.  If I had known that he intended doing that I would take the liberty of proposing again my own resolution, and of letting the Seanad decide upon it.  I think it is very unfair the way in which this matter has been treated.  The reason we did not agree to the resolution at the Special Committee was that the Chairman of that Committee was about to move to take the whole section out. I think this leaves us in a very awkward position, and so far as I am concerned I will have to vote for the little bit I got out of it.  If I do not get that then I will certainly have to move the original amendment to the Bill that we put in in the Special Committee.  I think the Corporation is entitled to some compensation when it takes a site for the purpose of street widening, because by so doing it loses for ever on that site the rates that would have been payable on it.  The rates are extinguished for ever, and in that way a benefit which the city had been deriving is lost.  I felt, however, all the time that the Minister would not agree to the resolution that I moved originally, and then I had to take the next best thing.</P>

      <P>The suggestion of Senator Brown that the Corporation should go to the Government to get anything from them is really very funny.  What chance would the Corporation have of getting justice from the Government?  I am afraid, in view of recent events, it would be very little indeed.  I am in the same position as Senator Mrs. Wyse Power.  We put down a new section to be introduced into this Bill in the Select Committee; it was not accepted by the Select Committee, and that Committee accepted the alternative suggestion of the Minister. In view of the fact that it was so accepted by the Committee, and that we were not aware when we met in the Select Committee that an attempt would be made to delete the section after it had passed through Committee it leaves us in a very awkward <Col N="184" /> position.  I certainly will vote against the proposed addition to the section as it was introduced into the Committee.</P>

      <P>We seem to be losing sight in this debate of the right of the unfortunate man who owns the site.  The interest of the Corporation is being taken care of and the interest of the Government is also being taken care of, but the unfortunate individual who happens to own the site and from whom the Corporation wants to buy it, is undoubtedly losing by this amendment the rights which he held at the moment.  I doubt if the Seanad is wise in acting thus towards the individual. Part of our duty here is to protect the rights of individuals.  No doubt the Corporation is going to get this site. for admittedly less than it would get it if an arbitration was carried out under the Lands Clauses Acts and the individual is to be left with his moral claim upon the Government.  What I am speaking of now is the attempt by the Minister himself and by Senator Mrs. Wyse Power and Senator Farren. But I do not like to see the Seanad knowingly accepting in any way a solution like this where a right is taken away from an individual and that right divided up between the Corporation and the Government.  It is a bad precedent &mdash; this happens to be a site where there is only one house in one street&mdash;but if we once admit the principle that you can alter the law so as to take away from an individual the right he has now got, for the purpose even of widening a street we open the way and we establish a principle which I hold might react against every single one of us as ordinary citizens.  It is the right and <Col N="185" /> duty of the Seanad to take care to defend the individual from any such attempts being made.</P>

      <P>I do not know that it is quite correct to say we are taking away the rights of private owners.  We are leaving them with the same rights, but we divide them up.  At present the individual has only a moral claim upon the Minister for Finance, and we are not interfering with that claim. Of course there may be some reason to complain of the division of the right. On the other hand, if we did not give some guarantee to the Corporation that they will be recompensed for the expenditure which they have been put to in acquiring this property, I am afraid there would be no chance of going ahead with this scheme of the improvements of streets at all.  They never would have thought of improving the city if these buildings had not been destroyed, and if they find themselves now placed in the position when they have to compensate the owner, without any security of compensation from the Government, it is very likely they will drop the whole proposal.  It was bearing that point of view in mind that we drafted this amendment. However it is a matter that I am perfectly willing to leave to the Seanad, and let them decide upon it.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash; In section 7, to delete, in line 19, the figures &ldquo;1930,' and to substitute therefor the figures &ldquo;1934.&rdquo;  The object of the amendment is to extend the time at which the increased valuation will come into effect.  People will be obliged to spend considerably more money on new buildings that will be allowed them.  If they are handicapped by very high valuations on account of the expensive structures they will have put up the handicap will be a very severe one.  In the Reconstruction Act of 1916 there was an allowance of twelve years from the time the buildings were destroyed until the new valuations would come into force, and that was found very workable and very successful.  I appeal to the Minister to give the matter his favourable consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DEA</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment.  The cost of building is very high and the result is that instead of new houses there is quite a stagnation in building.  It is getting worse and worse every day, and one of the reasons I believe, a very strong reason, is that if you either reconstruct a house or build a new house the valuation goes up at least two or three times.  If it were possible to make these new buildings immune from rates altogether for a period of five or seven years I think it would have a very good effect on rebuilding in the city of Dublin.  Building is really stagnant <Col N="188" /> and young people have no earthly chance of getting a house of any kind except they are able to buy one at a 200 per cent. advance on 1914, which young people cannot afford to do.  If they could it would not be good business. I think the amendment is very reasonable and if the Minister were to think it out, think out the necessity of making new or reconstructed buildings immune from increased rates for a fixed number of years&mdash;five or seven years&mdash; I am sure it would give a great fillip to reconstruction and rebuilding in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>The original Section was that new valuations should not come into force before the 31st March, 1927, and in Committee it was extended to 1930.  Now it is coolly proposed to extend it to 1934, which is robbery without violence.  What it means is this, that any citizen who rebuilds his premises has to pay rates on an increased valuation.  The people whose premises have been destroyed have been given ample compensation, and now it is coolly proposed, when they rebuild, that the increased valuation of the premises should not take effect until 1934.  In other words, you propose to compel the rest of the citizens to pay increased rates in order to make a present of something to the people who have got compensation, and who are going to rebuild in the destroyed areas.  In effect that is what it means. I think these people have been met very fairly.  The time has been increased to 1930, and I do not think any further extension would be fair.  The Corporation, and even the Commissioners like the Government, have to budget for a certain amount of money on which to run the city.  They strike a rate on the valuation of all the property in the city, and if some people do not pay what they are entitled to pay, others must make up for it by paying increased rates.  Therefore think this is a preposterous proposal. The Government itself fixed 1927; in the Select Committee it was extended three years further, and now it is coolly proposed to add another four years. I must oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>I wonder if Senator Farren had in his mind, when <Col N="189" /> making the somewhat strong remarks he has just made, the desirability of improving the architecture and the type of buildings in Dublin.  Supposing a man has an old building, valued at £100, I think everybody would be unanimous in saying that it would be most undesirable and in fact it would be impossible to improve Dublin if another building of the same kind were put up.  It would be most desirable that the building should be improved. With regard to the amount that is demanded in rates, is any man likely to improve a place with a certainty that his valuation will be doubled or trebled in a short time?  I think it would be well worth the Minister's, while to consider whether, having regard to the creation of a suitable thoroughfare in Sackville Street, which will be a credit to the metropolis of Ireland, this amendment should not be adopted. Senator Farren says that the people have been most generously dealt with, and have received ample compensation, but we heard a few moments ago that they would have to go with their hats in their hands to the Minister, or with their hands in the pockets of the Minister, to get him to give this compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to, point out to Senator Barrington this fact.  If there were persons who had property in this thoroughfare or the other, if their lease fell in and they were to rebuild, the local authority would not allow them to put up any building they liked.  They would insist on their putting up a proper building suitable for the thoroughfare.  Every municipal authority has to do that.  In every city the municipality has the right to say what class of building should be erected in the main thoroughfare.  If any other people are going to rebuild premises in any other part of Dublin they will have to pay on an increased valuation. It is unfair to make one section of the community pay for rebuilding while another section of the community <Col N="190" /> whose premises, mark you, are being rebuilt for them, are to escape their responsibilities.</P>

      <P>The valuation that a man will get is going to be the same whether we leave the date at 1930 or 1934.  I take it for granted that the valuation will be put on according to certain rules in those matters.  It is not a question of its not being revalued, or the valuation not being increased.  We considered this very carefully in the Select Committee, and those of us who sat there came to the conclusion that this was a reasonable and fair compromise to make to extend it from 1927 to 1930. I feel at any rate as a member of that Committee having arrived at that decision, and considering it a fair and right thing to do, that I should be obliged to agree with Senator Farren and to vote with him.  I would not like to upset the resolution of the Committee. It seemed fair then, and it seems fair now.</P>

      <P>I have drafted a clause which I think may meet what the Minister wants.  It is on the supposition that the new Section 2 goes out altogether, and that the owner is left to the Land Clauses Act for the measure and method of his compensation. For the purpose of at least giving a measure of what the Corporation ought to get back from the Ministry of Finance I propose a new Section 2 should be added as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.  Where under the provisions of Section 15 of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, a report in writing in respect of the damage or destruction of any building has been made by a Judge to the Minister for Finance, and the site or any part of the site of such building is acquired or purchased compulsorily by the Corporation under this Act, the arbitrator by his award shall certify the amount of the compensation which is awarded in respect of the site itself, and the amount which is awarded in respect of the fact that such Report has been made under Section 15 of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, and the amount (if any) which is awarded in respect of any other claim to such compensation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That will divide up the compensation in such a way that although it will be received in full by the owner of the taken site from the Corporation, the Corporation will have the measure of what they ought to get back when they come to the Minister for Finance with their moderate claim.  It is really a moderate claim, because they ought to get that back.</P>

      <P>I desire to draw attention to the peril of the National Museum from fire, and to ask the Government what steps they propose to take to ensure the safety of the national collections.  A petition has been sent out which has been very largely signed, and letters have been received showing a very great anxiety throughout the country in this matter. It is now learned that the Government intend tabling proposals, which are far from meeting the intentions of the protestors, to remove the natural history specimens from their present place to a room in the basement.  That would be very bad for the specimens, which are very delicate, and it would also be a very serious matter so far as teaching facilities are concerned.  There is also a danger, not only from inflammable spirits, but from other inflammable materials.  It would be desirable to know what the Government proposals really are, who is carrying them out, and whether the Seanad can be satisfied as to the complete protection of the national treasures.  Some members of the Seanad are on the Committee which is considering the future housing of the Oireachtas, and it might be advisable to form a Committee of the Seanad to consider this question.  We cannot speak too strongly of our own grave responsibility as occupying this building, and in the interests of the public we ought not to agree to precautions which we do not know anything about.</P>

We went carefully into it and we were informed, without going into details, that arrangements had been made, or it was proposed to make them, by the Board of Works officials that every possible <Col N="195" /> precaution was taken against any outbreak of fire in the premises belonging to the Museum, and that they did not anticipate any danger.  What the precautions actually are the Committee did not go into.</P>

      <P>It should not be impossible to get some Deputy in the Dáil to put down a question. You could elicit an answer there more directly than by the machinery afforded in the Seanad.  I am certain you would not have any difficulty in getting a Deputy to ask what these precautions are.</P>

      <P>If the Government decides to remain in this building for a few years have we not means of getting expert opinion on the question as to whether these buildings are properly secured against fire?  I do not think we ought to take the opinion of a board which is under the influence of the Government.  If, as a result of the Seanad staying here there was a fire, and the Irish gold ornaments and other national treasures were destroyed, it would be a final touch to the evil reputation of this nation. Certainly, I do not think that the Seanad could throw off responsibility on the question.  If we are to be kept here we should have expert opinion, independent of the Government and the Board of Works, as to whether these buildings are properly protected against fire.</P>

      <P>It is deplorable that all these treasures are shut up at a moment when we ought to encourage national feeling as regards the <Col N="196" /> treasures, and be taking people around and showing them what they have behind them as a nation.  They are absolutely cut off now and we do not know how many years the Government will stay here.  The position is highly unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>That would all depend, I think, on the adoption of our report.  We cannot leave this place as a person would leave a hotel. We cannot leave in a week or a month. No matter how the report goes about the housing or accommodation for the Oireachtas, I am of opinion we will be here for some months.  I think it is time when the Government adopts the report to ask&mdash;if we are to remain six months or a year &mdash; what precautions they are taking.  Until that decision is arrived at I am afraid we are only beating the air.</P>

      <P>Probably Senator Mrs. Green's wishes have been so far gratified by the discussion, but meanwhile it will be open to any Senator interested to put down a resolution asking that a committee should be appointed to investigate the matter, or to take some definite course of that kind.</P>
