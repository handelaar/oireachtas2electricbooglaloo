    <P>Question again proposed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That with the object of avoiding industrial friction throughout the Saorstát between employers and employees, the Seanad earnestly requests the Government to devise means whereby Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration might be constituted immediately, of which the decisions would be final and which would command the confidence of the public generally.&rdquo;&mdash; Senator Benjamin Haughton.</P>

      <P>The first motion on the Orders of the Day is on the adjourned debate on Senator Haughton's motion.  The Seanad will recollect it came up at a meeting one afternoon, and I think that Senators were not altogether satisfied that Senator Haughton had the fullest opportunity for stating his views.  I take it that if he wishes he has the leave of the Seanad to speak again now upon this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenjaminHaughton" hpid="Mr. HAUGHTON Mr. HAUGHTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HAUGHTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I will trespass on the time of the House for not more than a few moments.  I had the opportunity of speaking for ten minutes or so on the last occasion, and what I said then I repeat now, that the question of unemployment is one of the most important questions confronting our country at the present time.  The whole country has been severely handicapped in the recent past because of strikes or lock-outs, or whatever they might be called, throughout the 26 counties, but especially in the Metropolis and the South of <Col N="342" /> Ireland.  Very large sums of money have been thrown away, and salaries, wages, interest and capital itself has in many ways been wasted.  In my own neighbourhood in the city of Cork alone we estimate that more than a quarter of a million, which was a low estimate, was lost in the three months during which the strike lasted, and the consequences to the community, both to employers and employed, must be regarded as real facts which should be faced by us as reasonable men, and some means should be devised whereby this unwise, imprudent and, what I would call foolish, action on the part of the community from time to time could be averted.</P>
      <P>We have been set, I submit, splendid examples by other parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in many directions from time to time, and on this very subject of industrial strife, Australia and the Dominion of Canada have set a splendid example.  I venture to hope that Ireland will rise to the occasion and follow their lead and set an example to Great Britain in this all-important matter.  It seems to many of us that such machinery could be set in motion and that those most desirable objects could be obtained.  I do not wish to go into details at all at this stage of the question, but simply to bring forward the subject in the earnest hope that our discussions will lead to something tangible and that something practicable will result that will induce and encourage the Government to take up the matter earnestly, and that something will be done to bring about a different and a better state of things for our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it is desirable in any discussion of this question that any remarks made in connection with it should be free from those exaggerations and asperities that marked some similar discussion in another place.  I cannot vote for this motion, though as far as the principle of Conciliation Boards, as distinct from Compulsory Arbitration, is concerned, my colleagues and I are in complete accord.  There has always been greater support for conciliation machinery from the workers side than from the employers. Such Boards already exist in <Col N="343" /> certain industries, such as the flour milling industry, and recently there has been established a comprehensive and elaborate scheme of Departmental Committees, Sectional Councils, and Wages Boards for the Irish railways.  If these Boards get a fair chance, I believe they will have the best results, because the principle of compulsory arbitration does not enter into their constitution.</P>
      <P>Strikes and lock-outs often occur on questions other than wages and conditions of service.  Alleged victimisation, individual infringement of established rules, unfair promotions, and so forth, are all fruitful sources of trouble which often result in sectional strikes or lock-outs, and sometimes extend far beyond the radius of the original storm centre.  The existence of Conciliation Boards which could be assembled quickly to deal with all such local emergencies, would, in nine cases out of ten, avert trouble and thereby avoid financial loss and suffering, as well as prevent the development of bitterness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in the case of the railways, the functions of such boards should be extended so as to include the discussion of better systems of working, greater efficiency, welfare of the staff, methods of recruitment, and so on.  It is only by taking the employees into consultation and confidence that the co-operation necessary for the complete success of any enterprise can be secured.  We fail to see the necessity, however, for Government intervention in this respect.  You cannot make people, whether employers or workers, conciliatory by legislation if they desire to be otherwise.  You may even compel them to set up those boards, but you do not thereby create conciliation. You can force a man to kiss his mother-in-law, but you cannot make him love her.  At the present time there is nothing to prevent both sides in any industry evolving by mutual agreement conciliation machinery to meet all requirements.  This development will not serve as an absolute guarantee against industrial trouble, but should at all events tend to lessen their number, and what is more important, help towards the creation of a spirit of mutual understanding and reason. Neither is there anything to prevent <Col N="344" /> both sides setting up an arbitration board, and if they so desire making its awards binding, but I certainly cannot support a request to the Government to set up such Courts arbitrarily, or to seek legislative sanction for such action.</P>
    <P>We are opposed to the principle of compulsory arbitration for many reasons.  I think it was Russell Lowell who said that &ldquo;peace in order to make it stick at all must be driven in with bayonets.&rdquo; You are not going to have industrial peace on the strength of awards made by people who at the very most have only a superficial or entirely inadequate knowledge of the conditions obtaining in the industry in which the dispute occurs.  Our experience of arbitrators has been very unsatisfactory. They are very generally drawn from people with an anti-labour outlook; because of their social standing, training and environment they approach their task with an unconscious bias towards the worker, so that he has to face the proceedings with a very heavy handicap.  Employers are very quick to utilise this bias in their favour to the best advantage, and their method of attack or defence as the case may be is invariably approved by the arbitrator in an industrial dispute.  The procedure is to plead inability to pay, and the employer forthwith sets out to overwhelm the court with a statement of his alleged financial position.  Some of these statements might have emanated from the realms of fairyland, and the workers are unable to disprove them because the employers are never compelled to produce their books.  I have a vivid recollection of an important arbitration in which I was interested, presided over by a very able member of the Irish Bar, who immortalised himself by his findings, but not exactly in the way which would make him an Attorney-General in a Labour Government. It was then I had brought home to me the truth of the statement that figures could not lie but that lawyers could figure.  The plea was one of inability to pay, and the employers set to work with a skill and enterprise they had never displayed in their business to fool the unhappy K.C., and <Col N="345" /> by the time they had finished their financial tale of woe as represented by the elaborate table of figures, mostly absurd estimates, the eminent lawyer had in his mind the necessity for the immediate appointment of a receiver. The funny part of it was that he resented any attempt on our part to express the slightest doubt as to the real reliability of his statements.  The books were demanded and refused and the legal gentleman upheld the refusal. He was an honest gentleman, but he made the mistake of assuming that the employers' representatives were all George Washingtons, whereas the workers were the lineal representatives of Ananias, and his finding was in accordance.  And it even imposed on their side, who had very reasonably made allowance for a very large proportion of their statements being discounted.</P>
    <P>However it was too good to stand. The award was properly turned down, and a mutual agreement of a very different kind to the award made subsequently proves beyond all shadow of doubt that the employers' statements were grossly exaggerated.  That award if allowed to stand, would have inflicted cruel and unnecessary hardship on the workers.  On the other hand, I should say before proceeding any further, that in regard to arbitrators there are, of course, exceptions, but they are unfortunately very few.  In that connection I would mention, if I might, one particular arbitration, in which the employees' side had at least got a fair show.  That is the one in connection with the Bank officials, presided over by our present Chairman.  I think that is one instance where the workers have no reason to complain of not getting a fair and reasonable show.  On the other hand if the industry is prosperous the employer refuses to disclose his financial position, and the Courts uphold the refusal.  What they do is to cite the case of the worst paid workers and demand a reduction to the rates of pay made to these workers.  The poor agricultural labourer is a favourite example quoted to any worker who gets a few shillings more than the slave of the field.  The British Railway Companies in their recent attack adopted this attitude because their prosperity <Col N="346" /> was so well known that it was useless to attempt to disguise it.  These facts are very disturbing.</P>
    <P>The worker is asked to look upon the industry and to work for it in that spirit, and I have always told him so myself whenever I had an opportunity. Yet in actual practice he is made to bear more than his share of its adversity while he is warned that in no circumstance is he to claim a share of its value.  It is a case of &ldquo;heads I win, tails you lose&rdquo; all the time.  Apart from all this it would be too much to expect the workers to have any confidence in arbitrators appointed by the present Government who have gone out of their way to inspire employers to reduce wages, and who have utilised the machinery of State to undermine anything approaching decent conditions of employment in all industries. The curt and truculent manner in which the National Teachers and the main body of the Civil Service have been treated is an example of the kind of conciliation the Government desire. After all Government Commissions are in reality arbitration courts on a large scale because they are appointed to enquire into and make recommendations on questions on which there is a difference of opinion.  They go much further into their enquiries than an ordinary arbitrator.  Yet we have the Government contemptuously turning down the findings of their own Commissioners, and telling them in effect that they do not know what they are talking about.  What about the very reasonable salary recommendations of the Postal Commission, a Commission dominated by people who were themselves employers?  If the workers have those examples of the way the Government treats arbitration how can anyone ask them to accept and respect the findings of arbitrators appointed by the same Government?  Every action and gesture of the present Government towards its employees has been calculated to create resentment and inspire disloyalty.  If any ordinary employer, either in this country or elsewhere, had attempted to treat his own employees with the lofty contempt which the Government has extended to the Teachers and the Postal workers, there would be no doubt as to the result.  In <Col N="347" /> these circumstances we are not willingly going to set up the present Government as the supreme arbiter of our economic destinies.  Reference has been made to compulsory arbitration in Australasia.  Nobody has thought fit to mention the important fact that this has not prevented strikes and lock-outs. Mention has not been made of the fact that compulsory arbitration is invariably accompanied by measures for the strict control and regulation of prices.  New Zealand is a pretty fair example and is not an unreasonable comparison with Ireland because of the fact that its staple industry is agriculture.</P>
    <P>The circumstances under which arbitration Courts were first introduced there, are described briefly by Sir John Findlay, K.C., ex-Attorney-General of New Zealand, as follows.  He stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;About thirty years ago, the conscience of the people of New Zealand was shocked by disclosures appearing in the public press of sweating, especially among woman and child workers, and particularly in the clothing trade.  Legislation was passed to check this evil, and to secure, by the intervention of a competent and impartial tribunal, a living wage for all those engaged in New Zealand Industries.  The framer of this legislation afterwards justified this statute on the principle that it prevented that injury to the community as a whole which results from any form of industrial parasitism, from the payment, for instance, of wages insufficient for the full maintenance under healthy conditions of workers and their families. The legislation was not due to any demand or pressure from the trades unions.  It aimed rather &lsquo;at improving the condition of sweated workers, too poor and too weak to give battle in the ordinary fashion of industrial warfare.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will thus be seen that the Courts which are popularly known as Arbitration Courts, were established, not to prevent labour upheavals, but to protect defenceless and unorganised workers from the rapacity of sweating employers, but they have not prevented <Col N="348" /> industrial disputes.  Mr. Hughes, speaking in the Federal Parliament, said in his conclusion that &ldquo;legal systems of industrial arbitration, compulsion, and all that was ancillary to them, had proved far less effective for the purpose than the method of getting both sides together in a friendly conference.&rdquo; Side by side with those courts, there has been acting in New Zealand (and this is where we might profitably follow the example of our friends of the Antipodes) a Board of Trade, whose business it is to regulate prices, prevent the formation of food rings, to arrange the distribution of raw material, and to punish all attempts at profiteering.  Its activities are described in a nutshell by Sir John Findlay, K.C., as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Board has dealt somewhat arbitrarily with the price and the distribution among flour mills of good milling wheat.  It has dealt with the price of flour and bread, providing in certain cases for a Government subsidy to flour millers to enable flour and bread to be sold at a certain fixed price.  It has further dealt with the price of sugar, butter, timber, coal, groceries, and several other commodities.  It has also instituted numerous proceedings for profiteering.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Government are asked to take action at all, I suggest it should be along those lines.  We have here the most rapacious crowd of unscrupulous profiteers that any country could be cursed with, and if the Government would only have the courage to follow the example of the Government of New Zealand, it would be the most statesmanlike gesture they have yet made.</P>
    <P>When Senators ask us to copy Australia and New Zealand in one respect, they should be prepared to consider adopting the policy of these States in other directions, in respect of matters which really govern the question of industrial disputes.  Here is what the State does in New Zealand; I am again quoting the ex-Attorney-General, Sir John Findlay:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State not only owns, and has in the main constructed, the railways, but has adopted the settled <Col N="349" /> policy of prohibiting the construction and working of any railway by private enterprise.  Nearly all our city and borough tramways are municipally owned and operated.  The State has acquired, to a substantial extent by compulsion, large pastoral estates and divided them among landless would-be settlers.  It has lent these settlers money for farming purposes at the lowest possible rates of interest, and on the most favourable terms.  It has engaged extensively in ordinary banking.  It has opened and worked coal mines.  It has erected and conducted saw mills for the supply of a portion of its requirements. It has extensively engaged in life and fire insurance.  It has acquired land and erected many houses thereon for workmen generally.  It has cooperated as a helpful and unremunerated partner with those engaged in nearly every branch of production. It has its own workshops for the manufacture of railway rolling stock and similar requirements.  It owns and operates a certain number of steamers and has erected tourists' hotels and manages many tourist resorts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, if we are asked to accept one part of the policy adopted in those countries, I suggest that the Seanad must be prepared to consider the adoption of the whole social and labour policy, and if so, Labour is quite prepared to discuss the proposition on its merits, including compulsory arbitration. It is illogical to cull one small item out of a whole chain, of which that item is a mere link, and to say &ldquo;This is the thing for Ireland,&rdquo; whilst closing one's eyes to, or conveniently forgetting the existence of, the chain from which the single link has been purloined.  This is a grand country for what are popularly known as &ldquo;stunts.&rdquo;  The latest &ldquo;stunt&rdquo; is &ldquo;Wages must come down.&rdquo;  Every Tom, Dick and Harry anxious for a newspaper paragraph, and who is not personally affected, bawls out this parrot cry on every conceivable occasion, with monotonous regularity.  Nobody seems to take up the cry of &ldquo;Greater efficiency,&rdquo;&ldquo;More up-to-date methods,&rdquo;&ldquo;Better workshop and <Col N="350" /> market organisation,&rdquo;&ldquo;Better advertising of what we produce,&rdquo;&ldquo;Earlier adoption of modern equipments.&rdquo;  No; the easy and the lazy way is to cut wages.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known and regrettable fact that Irish employers as a class are notoriously non-progressive, and that their employees, as well as the country generally, suffer as a result.  Their policy seems to be to take the least possible risk, and obtain the maximum amount of profit in the minimum period of time.  The long view is rarely taken. Hotel keepers at seaside resorts fleece their visitors for a season, and ensure that they shall not come back there again.  We have the Fiscal Enquiry Committee giving the following examples of the non-progressive character of Irish manufacturers:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the tanning and boot making industries, the failure at a critical period to equip themselves with the most modern appliance marks the arrest of their growth.  In the tobacco industry, the failure to foresee the importance which the consumption of cigarettes would have upon the development of their trade left Irish manufacturers behind in the race for securing the Irish market.  When cigarettes from their competitors were being brought into every Irish town, they had not set up the plant necessary for their manufacture in any quantity.  The taste for other than Irish cigarettes was formed and Irish manufacturers awoke too late to the double task of securing the home market and altering the home taste.  Again, in the clay pipe making industry the witnesses stated that the clay for the manufacture is imported from the South of England, and the existing supplies of native clay have ceased to be worked; even the imported clay is brought by a roundabout and needlessly expensive route.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These may be taken as an example of Irish traders and manufacturers generally, and until they develop a more enterprising spirit, in a world of competition in which a certain amount of risk is inevitable, if success is to be secured, they will never be able to provide <Col N="351" /> decent conditions of employment; they will be unable to hold their own with foreign competitors, and the country as a whole will be the poorer. If there was less talk about &ldquo;cutting down&rdquo; and more about &ldquo;speeding up&rdquo; the outlook would be much brighter.</P>
    <P>I believe with Ruskin that &ldquo;That country is the richest which nourishes the greatest number of noble and happy human beings.&rdquo;  Hence, I believe that Irish industrial development is not going to be fostered, nor that general peace which is so sorely needed going to be secured, by the tomahawk onslaughts of employers, nor the axe-swinging propensities of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This indiscriminate frenzy for merely &ldquo;cutting down&rdquo; indicates a bankruptcy of statesmanship, and instead of getting men to put their backs into their work will compel them, in defence of their livelihood, to put their &ldquo;backs to the wall.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be well that the position of some of us who may be unable to vote for this motion in its exact form should be made clear.  Senator O'Farrell has given us a long statement, containing a large amount of proof, and a large amount of subject matter which could be controverted at about the same length, if it was desirable or thought wise to do so.  The motion suggests that you are to have Courts of Conciliation, the decision of which will be final.  It also suggests Courts of Arbitration, the decision of which will be final.  Personally, I have no doubt that there is not one member of the Seanad who does not wish to see Conciliation Courts which will reach final decisions.  If that is all that is meant by the motion, I do not think there will be much difficulty in voting for it.  At the same time, I do not think the Seanad ought to ask the Government to set up Courts which could be regarded as compulsory Arbitration Courts; that is, to which the parties who take part should be regarded as bound definitely by the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be circumstances&mdash;I can quite conceive circumstances arising&mdash;<Col N="352" /> in which it would be wise if both parties would agree to court arbitration which would be binding on each party for a period.  I think it is extremely likely that the circumstances in which we will find ourselves will make some such Courts almost essential.  I do not see how, as a general principle, we can support compulsory arbitration.  I put it, too, from the employer's side.  If my business is not paying, and if I cannot find a method of making it pay, am I to be coerced by the decision of a compulsory Arbitration Court to go on until I become a bankrupt?  That is one side.  The other side is the side of the worker.  He will undoubtedly be struggling for improved conditions, conditions which, if I know anything, most employers, particularly those represented here, would like to see, but which at the moment most of us are practically powerless to bring about.</P>
    <P>Personally I would be well content if business were flourishing, and wages were higher.  That would not worry me.  It would indicate a healthy state of affairs.  I would like to see Irishmen developing their own land efficiently so that we would be able to have wages higher.  At the same time we know that for the next twelve months we are not going to have that state of affairs.  Unless there is some kind of intelligible understanding and give and take between employers and employees there is going to be loss on both sides. Some kind of arrangement has to be made.  I care not whether it is by some Government machinery or not, so long as it is there, by which at least conversation will be ensured before you have a strike.  A strike, even for a day, in most large concerns, means a very heavy loss.  I think that some kind of machinery is essential by which, certainly in larger concerns, there should be without any question at all conversations, and if possible conciliation, before strikes take place. I think it will be more or less generally admitted that you cannot apply compulsion generally to the decision of such Arbitration Courts.  Looking at it for a moment from the point of view of the arbitrator, I should like to point out that it is almost impossible for an arbitrator, or for the President of a Commission, or for any man who is <Col N="353" /> acting in the position of conciliator, to do more than try and adjust the differences because he has no principle upon which he can issue a verdict.  When a case comes before a court of law the Judge has a code of law which he has to interpret and on which he can issue a verdict or give a decision.  If it comes before a jury, the jury is asked for a decision on a question of facts.  When you come to a question of a trade dispute for consideration say by a court of arbitration or by a Commission, there is no definite standard which can be adopted.</P>
    <P>Take for instance the question of the cost of living or of what is a decent standard of livelihood.  The Postal Commission has been referred to.  We sat for days listening to budgets put forward by representatives of the different sections of the staff and I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that no two of them agreed as to what they considered to be a decent standard of living.  I am not complain-have nothing on which we can say: have nothing on which we can say &ldquo;This is a proper standard of living at the present moment, and therefore we make our recommendations accordingly.&rdquo; A great many other questions arise also.  The question arises, what is to be the basis of promotion?  Is an employer or superintendent or person responsible for promotion to disclose to the man who is disgruntled why he should not have been promoted?  On the other hand, is the employer to have the right to promote whom he wishes? I only wish to show that there is no standard which an Arbitration Board can definitely adopt.  Until some such standard can be found or generally adopted it would be practically impossible and unwise to attempt anything in the nature of compulsory arbitration. To that extent I am in agreement with Senator O'Farrell, though I do not agree with all his conclusions or arguments.  Incidentally I have not by any means the optimism he has as to the ability of employers to deal with the average K.C.  I think the K.C. would be likely to come off the best on most occasions.</P>
    <P>There is one other point.  Reference has been made to the Postal Commission. I do not propose to enter into <Col N="354" /> that question here, except to say, as reference has been made to it, that I do not personally agree with the action of the Government, but I would not like it suggested that that Commission was in any way an arbitration, or that either side put its case before it.  They were not in any way bound to accept its decision, nor would I like it to be thought, as has been frequently stated in the Press, that that Commission unanimously recommended any general increase in public expenditure, because we do not admit that we did so.  I think that Senator Haughton has done well in bringing the subject before us, because it calls further public attention to the exceedingly serious problems which are before us, and which we will have to deal with in the new year.  At the same time, I think it would be wiser if he were to withdraw the motion than to ask us to pass it, just exactly in the form in which it is on the Orders of the Day.  If we, as a Seanad, with full responsibility, were going to make a definite suggestion or request to the Government, I think a Committee should be appointed and, if it is the desire of the Seanad, a message should be sent to the Government, dealing with industrial arbitration or industrial conciliation. Then I think the Seanad should appoint a representative Committee and make a definite suggestion with agreed proposals, but not in just this vague resolution.  Although for that reason I could not support the resolution, I think it well that it should be brought forward by Senator Haughton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving this resolution, Senator Haughton referred to the question of unemployment. He said that there was no question of more pressing importance.  He further stated that he believed unemployment had been largely brought about through industrial disputes.  Speaking as a large employer, and as a member of the Employers' Association, he believed he voiced the feelings of many employers when he said that they would place more value upon the stabilisation of wages than upon reductions of wages. In this motion he proposes, in order to avoid industrial friction throughout the Saorstát, that the Seanad should request <Col N="355" /> the Government to devise means whereby conciliation and arbitration courts might be constituted immediately, the decision of which would be final, which in effect means compulsory arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I want to say that the workers of this country are opposed to compulsory arbitration.  There is at present machinery in existence whereby, when disputes do occur between employers and employees, they can be brought together in conference to discuss their differences, and there is also machinery whereby, if they fail to adjust their differences in conference by mutual agreement, their cases can be submitted to arbitration.  But, judging by recent happenings, I am convinced from my knowledge of the point of view of the workers of this country that there is a growing disinclination to submit their cases to arbitration.  I have had experience of arbitration in industrial disputes and of conferences, under three Governments.  I had experience in dealing with the British Government; I had experience in dealing with the Republican Government, and I have had experience in dealing with the Free State Government, and from my experiences of the manner in which these arbitrations were conducted, and because of the nature of the appointments of the arbitrators, I am not in the least bit surprised at the growing disinclination of the workers of this country to participate in them or to submit their cases to arbitration. I have had the experience of being at an arbitration in connection with a dispute between farmers and farm labourers.  And whom do you think was the arbitrator?  A farmer.  I have been present at an arbitration where I quoted a decision given by a former arbitrator, and I heard the Secretary of a Farmers' Union deliberately say: &ldquo;Yes, but that gentleman will never arbitrate again for the farmers.&rdquo;  And he was right.  He did not.  I have a recollection of an arbitrator appointed to deal with disputes between farm labourers and farmers where a man who continually gave reductions in the wages of farm labourers was appointed again and again to arbitrate in these <Col N="356" /> disputes.  Judging by that experience, I do not think it would be human to expect farm labourers to submit their cases to such an arbitration.</P>
    <P>The mover of this resolution dealt with the question of unemployment. He said, that in his opinion, unemployment was largely due to industrial disputes. I do not agree with that at all. No doubt a certain amount of unemployment does accrue from industrial disputes, but I do not agree that unemployment generally is due to industrial disputes.  The proposal outlined by Senator Haughton is, in fact, that the Seanad should agree, and request the Government to set up these arbitration courts, the decisions of which shall be final.  I briefly told you some of my experiences of the arbitrators appointed by Government Departments.  I could proceed much further in the matter, only that I do not want to take up your time.  When we talk about compulsory arbitration, and when we refer to compulsory arbitration in Australia, we have got to remember that in Australia there is a Labour Government.  If there was a Labour Government in this country, would the employers of this country be so anxious for compulsory arbitration, if the Labour Government had the appointment of the arbitrators? From our recent experiences we have come to the deliberate conclusion that arbitrators appointed by the present Government would not be fair to the working-class people.  Some members of this Seanad may not agree with that statement, but I propose to prove it. The President in the Dáil on the 25th September, when there was a discussion on the question of industrial disputes, made a statement to the effect that it was unreasonable to expect the reduction of wages unless there was a reduction of prices.  He went on to refer to the Commission on Prices that had been set up by the Government, and he clearly gave it as his deliberate opinion that it was unreasonable to expect reductions in wages until there was a corresponding reduction in prices, which, if it means anything, means that the Government had no intention of reducing the present standard of living.  The President in making that statement conveyed, certainly, that it was not the intention of <Col N="357" /> the Government to reduce the standard of living, and he referred to the Commission on prices and its failure.  The Commission on prices failed in so far that it had not the power to compel all those whom it summoned to give evidence, to give the evidence that was required.</P>
    <P>The unanimous recommendation of this Commission was that there was room for a reduction in prices of a certain commodity which is largely used by the working classes.  No attempt was made by the Government to put the recommendation of this Commission into operation.  Let me proceed further.  At a later stage there was a discussion in the Dáil on the question of unemployment, and the President, speaking, I presume, on behalf of the Government, stated that the Government is not concerned with making an offensive on wages, and he hoped that point would be appreciated by the Labour Deputies.  That is all very well, but recent events have proved that the Government have changed their mind in this matter.  The Government, in the first place, state, through the mouth of the President, that you cannot expect a reduction in wages unless there be a reduction in the cost of living.  In the second place, the Government, through the mouth of the President, state that they have no intention of making an attack on wages, and they hope the Labour Party will bear that in mind.  Now what are the facts? The Government have made an attack on wages, but they have not the courage to deal with the profiteers.</P>
    <P>Through the Local Government Department they have sent circular letters to the County Councils, District Councils and Corporations in Ireland, demanding that the wages rate to workers be reduced.  They insist on that as a condition of their forwarding out of the Road Fund monies to which the respective County Councils and Corporations in Ireland are entitled. They have made it a condition of these grants that in certain districts in Ireland the wages to be paid for this class of work shall be 25/- a week.  If that is not an attack on wages I do not know what an attack on wages means. Senator Douglas speaks about a decent standard of living, and about budgets <Col N="358" /> put forward.  But no budget that can be put forward can prove that 25/- a week is a living wage for any family. The author of &ldquo;Livelihood and Poverty,&rdquo; who is a recognised authority on these matters, shows by his figures that at the present value of money it will take at least 30/- a week to provide food alone for a husband, wife and three children.  And the Government Department who are not going to make an attack on wages have decided that a man employed on road work in certain districts in Ireland shall be paid at the rate of 25/- a week. Is it reasonable to expect that any body of workers in this country could agree to any conditions of compulsory arbitration proposed by a Government who have betrayed the workers, and I have no hesitation in saying it, in such a manner as this?  They would object to such a Government having the appointment of the arbitrator.  They feel that the dice are loaded against them on every occasion, and so they are not prepared to submit questions in dispute between them and employers to arbitrators appointed by the Government. I have had experience of Government appointed arbitrators, and I say the experience we have had of Government appointed arbitrators, whether appointed by the British Government, the Republican Government or the Free State Government, does not justify us in welcoming it.  For these reasons we have no hesitation in opposing this motion.</P>

      <P>I venture to suggest, if we are to vote on this resolution, it does require some alteration or amendment before we vote on it.  I think the speeches that have succeeded the speech made by Senator Haughton in moving the motion, make it clear that it deals with two things which are really incompatible.  The motion speaks of conciliation, which Senator Farren pointed out cannot be compulsory. It speaks of arbitration which may, or may not, be compulsory; though the word &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo; is not used in fact, it is implied.  Therefore, it seems to me, it is really a contradiction in terms.  I should like to know, for one, what we are to vote on, and I would suggest as a possibility to Senator <Col N="359" /> Haughton, if the last sentence were left out, and if it were left merely as Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration, there might be some unanimity in voting. I do not know.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Haughton's motion.  He is, like thousands of others of us, looking for a remedy for the very great evil in this country.  I do not think that any of us care for compulsion, but as a general rule we have to submit to it.  Only a few months ago we had a Land Bill passed here, which gave power by the Minister to his Commissioners to take lands compulsorily from the existing owners for the relief of congests.  Nobody likes that.  But it has to be done for the public good.  If the Labour Party has any other remedy, any better remedy, let them tell us.  I have not heard their remedy for this evil, so far. But really strikes in this country have become so chronic that it is nearly impossible to keep any industry going. We would very much rather pay high wages, and I am an advocate of high wages, but I want constant work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not so much high wages as broken work.  We have had a dockers' strike here in Dublin lasting for about four months.  I understand that directly and indirectly that strike cost over one million of money to this country, and at the end of that four months neither person on one side nor the other was one penny better off than when it started. That is a thing we do not want.  So far as I know the employers in this country, I am sure they are anxious, the best of them, to pay good wages. We are quite willing to do so, but we cannot pay high wages if there is not steady employment.  It is out of the question.  If there is any other remedy to be found&mdash;I do not know whether this motion provides a remedy&mdash;but if it does it would be worth trying.  Any experiment would be worth trying to stop the present state of affairs.  One of the Labour representatives says the Government have persistently penalised the workers.  I am not able to speak for the Government, but I certainly say that that statement is not accurate, and what we say is that the Government <Col N="360" /> have glorified the workers and allowed them to do pretty much as they like.</P>

      <P>Yes, but their interests fall apart when they come to be employers and employed.  Of course, we might pass this resolution, and a dozen like it, without any effect in reality, but there is no use asking for a court of arbitration unless it has the confidence of the employers and the employed.  Now, how the Government are to come in to establish such a court, I really do not see.  In anything I have ever seen of Governments coming in, they have had to use more or less compulsion.  Our friends on the Labour benches seem to think it is always used against Labour, but I am afraid the employers&mdash;if they were entering into a debate upon the point&mdash; would say that the Government's interference in these matters has been much more largely used against them than against Labour.  But these are matters of detail.  I think all will agree with me in this, that, unless both employers and employees have a Board of Arbitration to which they can go with confidence that the result will be a fair and reasonable one, and that there will be confidence in the justice of a court of arbitration, there is no use in appointing a court of arbitration at all.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words from the point of view of the employers in the agricultural industry. We do not feel that even in the present form the motion is altogether acceptable, and personally I do not quite appreciate what the effect of the last amendment to the motion would be.  It strikes me in this way&mdash;and Senator O'Farrell has provided me with most of my arguments&mdash;that it may be quite possible to maintain this standard we all admit to be desirable in certain industries, such as the distributive trade and the transport business; but at whose expense is it to be provided? It is going to be provided, in my opinion, at the expense of the country's main industry&mdash;agriculture&mdash;and you are passing it on to agriculture, which can pass it on to nobody else.  To make that possible at all in the logical and economic sense, you must fix prices; otherwise you will merely fix prices for the farmer, who will have to bear the burden.  Farming is a peculiar industry, without very wide flexibility.  It may give employment to a large number of men or to a small number of men.  We have heard of some farmers who only employ themselves and their dogs. Well, if an industry cannot stand existing wages to raise the existing wages will only lead to further unemployment, and further seeking after unemployment doles.  That does not get you any further, but gets you right away from the very fundamentals of the problem, which is to get increased production. That is the only way you can ever settle this very tangled question, and, of course, even then you will always leave a certain amount of unrest and upheaval, and, therefore, no form of arbitration can ever deal with the matter so far as agriculture is concerned without accumulative fixing of prices.  This is not referred to in the amendment, and I cannot support it.</P>

      <P>The next business on the Order Paper appears only in conformity with the requirements of the Standing Orders, by which any communication from the other House has to be communicated to this House at the earliest opportunity.  This particular Bill was returned yesterday from the other House at a time when, I regret to say, both the Clerk and the Assistant Clerk of the Seanad were necessarily absent, owing to very severe illness, and the second Assistant Clerk thought, having regard to this provision in our Standing Orders, that it would be safer on the whole to insert it on the Paper for to-day.  But in view of its grave nature, and the serious situation it has raised, I would strongly recommend the members of the House not to discuss it to-day.  I think it would be desirable that they should thoroughly inform themselves of what occurred in this House when this amendment was inserted, because the facts and position do not seem to have been understood in the other House, or correctly stated there. Therefore, I think the House, in view of the importance of this action on the part of the Dáil, would be well advised to consider carefully this matter before they embark on reconsideration of it.  It is for this House to say whether they should like to deal with this matter to-morrow, or let it stand over until, say, the first day of the session next week.  We have to-morrow the Second Reading of the Judiciary Bill, which will necessarily take, I presume, some time.  But if it is the wish of the House we could also dispose of this matter after the Second Reading of the Judiciary Bill.  The House will, therefore, kindly say whether they prefer to deal with this to-morrow, or to allow it to stand until the first sitting of the Seanad next week.</P>

      <P>Before I pass on to the remaining Orders of the Day, I might remind the House that our staff ceased to have any legal existence for some days past, because under our engagement of them the tenure expired.  It was only for a year, and it expired a few days ago.  The circumstances did not permit of our dealing with the situation in the way that the position required in the interval before the recess adjournment for Christmas.  Accordingly, while it would be necessary for the Standing Orders Committee on the Staff of this House to meet and fully consider the situation for the future, we think it more desirable that they should do that at their leisure, because they probably now will be settling the position for all time.  What I would suggest to the House, if it agrees with that view, is that we should carry on our staff on the terms already existing between us and them until the 1st April next.  That would give us ample opportunity of dealing with the position and regulating it for the future.  I might mention that a Standing Committee was appointed by this House, called the Committee on the Oireachtas Staff, in accordance with the terms of the following resolution passed by the Dáil on the 23rd March, 1923, and agreed to by this House on the 28th March, 1923.  The terms of that resolution were:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Minister for Finance and the Ceann Comhairle be appointed as Standing Committee to determine the number, grading, remuneration and terms of office of the Oireachtas staff, and that Seanad Eireann be requested to nominate a member of the Seanad on this Committee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> In accordance with that resolution, this House, on the 28th March, passed a resolution nominating its Chairman to be a member of that Committee. That Committee met, and its Report has been concluded, and has been laid on the table of both Houses, and any member who wishes an opportunity of seeing it will be able to get a copy of it on applying to the office, or to any member of our staff.  I think it would be necessary for them to read that before they come to any decision about their own staff, as it would help them. I would suggest that they would pass a resolution to-day continuing their existing staff up to, say, the 1st of April, and ask their Committee meanwhile to meet and fully consider and report on the future of this staff.</P>

To add at the end of the Sub-section the words &ldquo;and also to the citizens of any co-equal nation of the British Commonwealth of Nations that accords to the citizens of Saorstát Eireann identity of treatment with its own citizens in respect of regulations for appointment to and service in its Civil Service.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad will remember that this matter was discussed on the Committee Stage in a somewhat different form from my amendment.  As the Bill now stands, or as the amendment which was proposed in Committee stands, it is to the effect that all citizens of the British Commonwealth of Nations, irrespective of what rules they have of admission to their Civil Service, should be allowed to compete for our Civil Service. My amendment omits that, and confines a right to enter, to those citizens of any co-equal nation of the Commonwealth that gives to the citizens of Saorstát Eireann identity of treatment; in fact, reciprocity of treatment. I do not think I need say much <Col N="367" /> to commend the good sense and justice of this amendment to the Seanad.  Our position as a co-equal member of the British Commonwealth has been fully and adequately recognised, more especially by the manner in which we were received, and the status we were given at the recent Imperial Conference.  The fact that we are equal carries with it the right to do what we please.  But it also, I think, carries with it the obligation to be fair and generous, and that is what the amendment intends to ensure. It does not seem to me that our citizens in practice would be seriously prejudiced with regard to their service at home in the Government service of this country.  I do not conceive a very large number of citizens of other nations competing, but if they do compete, I think they should be entitled to do so.  I do see a desire for some time to come on the part of the citizens of this country to compete for the Civil Service and other public positions in Great Britain.  I am not saying whether it is a wise thing or an unwise thing that they should do so, but we must yield something to tradition in those matters, and tradition will persist for some time to come, and those whose parents and kin were in the British Service will, to a certain diminished extent, wish to continue the process.  I do not think there is any danger that the British Government will retaliate. I do think we should not put ourselves in a rather undignified position.  That is why I would commend this motion to the Seanad.  There is a further danger, perhaps imaginary, that if this is taken up by other than the British Service, it may extend to other professions, banks, and a number of large employers.  I think that would be equally undesirable. Bearing all the facts in mind, I hope this motion will be accepted by the Seanad.</P>

The narrow limits that otherwise would have been adopted would infer, to my mind, that we Irishmen had not confidence in ourselves to hold our own in intellectual competition. I remember some few years ago <Col N="368" /> I had the privilege of visiting the United States and Canada.  I was greatly struck with the fact that from New York to Chicago, and from Montreal down to Indianopolis, in the middle west, a tremendous number of Irish people were filling positions of prominence throughout Canada and the United States.  They were cordially welcomed and given the highest positions in the land.  I am aware at the present day that in the universities in this country, the National University and Trinity College, I suppose&mdash;I know it occurs in the National University&mdash;when there are posts with valuable emoluments vacant for professional men, notices are put up in the Universities advertising the fact and inviting graduates to enter into competition for such posts.  That broad-minded spirit obtains throughout the British Commonwealth of Nations, and is Ireland alone to adopt this singularly insular attitude of boycotting students, or valuable applicants from other parts of the world? I sincerely hope the amendment of Senator Sir John Keane will be adopted.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I must disagree with the statements made by the last two speakers.  I recognise that there is a great deal to be said for the views they put forward from the point of view of those young Irishmen and women who want to go abroad to England and other places, and make their living, and live there.  There can be no question that it will be a disservice to them if they are prevented from doing so, by an attempt at reprisals.  There is, as Senator Sir J. Keane said, not likely to be any reprisals, but in any case, there is a good deal to be said from that point of view.  There is another and more important point of view to be taken; that is, the position of the Irish people wishing to remain in Ireland.  Those who have spoken already have been dealing entirely with those who want to go and <Col N="369" /> live out of Ireland.  While I wish those every good will, I think it is our duty to look to those who wish to stop in Ireland.  I am not much interested in Irish people who wish to go abroad and live abroad.  Our idea ought always be to serve this country and the people in it.  This country has suffered for a very long time from the best of its people going abroad, and serving abroad, and remaining abroad.  I have lived in many parts, and all over the world I agree that, as Senator Haughton said, Irishmen are at the head of the State, Commerce and everything else.  What would have happened if those young Irishmen stopped in this country?  Does anyone tell me that men like Henry Ford would not have made opportunities?  It is the people of brain, intelligence and energy who make opportunities, and a great loss to this country is that the centre of its intelligence has been drained.  London has been like a sponge spread out over Dublin and the banks of the Liffey, soaking up all the intelligence and money of Ireland, and squeezing them out on the banks of the Thames.  In the same way our people have gone to America.  My view is we ought to do everything we can to make people stop in this country.  Even if they are prevented from taking up positions abroad, so much the better for Ireland. We will have them here pushing our business.  When I compare those Irishmen abroad with those here.  I see we have only the leavings and dregs of a great nation which extends all over the world.  All the best of the people are abroad.  Here we are left in a poor way.  In the last debate it was pointed out that employers of labour, and leaders of Commerce, were not progressive. Why?  Because all the great people have gone abroad.  I am not impressed by those arguments by which we are induced to send abroad our people.  Let us keep our people at home.  If we do we will have a great nation.</P>

      <P>I think it is an insult to the national pride that this country should be asked to accept gifts from Canada while it refuses to give anything in return.  It is, I think, an insult to the country to suggest that it <Col N="370" /> is to be kept up by law and artificial barriers.  The last Senator has described how in various parts of the world he found Irishmen occupying most important positions.  These Irishmen should be able to occupy them at home without the law making a barrier to put them into them.  If we do not pass this amendment we will have a precedent in this country for keeping out the experts from abroad whom we require and putting into position the ignoramuses at home whom we would be glad to lose.  We will constantly have to import able men to teach this country many things that Irishmen had no possibility of acquiring.  Every country in the position of this nation, at the beginning of its career, has to import talent.  You are now to create a barrier which will make it impossible to do so, and, with the insulting theory that good intellects at home require protection.  It is only the bad intellects at home that require protection, and I hope they will never get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I opposed the form in which this amendment was introduced on the Committee Stage, and I still feel obliged to oppose it.  The remarks passed by Senator Yeats make me feel that it is obligatory on me to set forth my reasons, and more particularly my reasons with regard to this matter.  I would be glad to know from Senator Yeats which of the co-equal nations of the Commonwealth accord these facilities?  From the last debate it would seem they had all agreed.  My information derived from expert opinions is that they did not. I wrote to London and from the answer I understand that in the case of Great Britain the Civil Service is open to all citizens from any part of the British Commonwealth whose parents were also citizens.  In other words, if you are outside England there is a slight difference in so far as if we were to adopt for the sake of argument a German who became nationalised as an Irish citizen, he would find that as an Irish citizen he would be eligible but he is ineligible on a purely technical point.  There is a difference even in England, as they do not open to all members of the Commonwealth their Civil Service.  In connection with the <Col N="371" /> Foreign Office there are restrictive provisions.</P>
      <P>In other parts of the Commonwealth the conditions are not the same as in England.  Generally speaking most of the Civil Service appointments are open on certain conditions to members of the Commonwealth.  Preference is given certainly to members of the Commonwealth.  In Australia and South Africa I am informed three years residence is necessary to be eligible for their Civil Service, so that the principle of equal treatment has not been accepted.  If my information is correct, and I have it from the Secretary of the Empire Parliamentary Association, and he ought to know, this amendment would not have any effect. Personally, I do not believe if the Seanad inserts this amendment that it will help our relations with the Commonwealth. I desire to see this country co-operating fully and fairly with the other nations in the Commonwealth, and I am prepared, having accepted that position, to say that we should loyally accept any obligations, whether legal or moral.  I am convinced that the best interests of the Commonwealth in this country are to be served by co-operation, rather than by obligation.  I think some arrangement might be made for a mutual agreement by which, after a certain term of residence, Irish citizens would be eligible for appointments in Australia and elsewhere.  I am not against any such mutual arrangement of that kind that might be made from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot help feeling that when England finds it necessary in the case of the Foreign Office to make restrictions, our Government might also find it essential to have restrictions.  I oppose the amendment, as I think it gives an impression without creating the reality. The Bill, to which this amendment has been introduced, is, because of the necessities of the situation, a drastic one, and it gives the Government and Ministers the minimum amount of latitude with regard to examinations.  The drastic character of the examinations has the effect that only candidates of a very high standard are going to apply from distant countries.  I am convinced <Col N="372" /> from the fact that I have been in communication with people from different parts of the Commonwealth, and with the Parliamentary Association, that the circumstances in which the British Civil Service is open to members, with one exception that I have mentioned, are purely technical, and there is not the slightest danger or likelihood of there being any change.</P>
    <P>In any case, what I do suggest is, that if it is found desirable to open our Civil Service under certain restrictions to all members of the Commonwealth, it should not be done hastily at this stage.  It should be done after a report by the Minister or a Committee, so that we should have full knowledge of the existing conditions in the Commonwealth. In conclusion, I would like to say that I feel rather strongly that we must not hastily jump to the conclusion that our relationship with the Commonwealth forces on us obligations other than obligations of good feeling, good sense, and confidence.  I feel that if we were to press this matter here possibly we would not be doing good service to the Commonwealth idea.</P>

      <P>I should like to correct a small matter.  In my day the qualification for the Civil Service was British born, and that included, most unquestionably, Canadians, in the opening for the Civil Service.  I believe it is practically the same to-day.  It was mentioned that the Foreign Office was excluded. That, I think, we can understand, but I believe I am correct in saying that all the offices in the Civil Service throughout the Empire&mdash;to make it as wide as possible&mdash;are open to British-born subjects, which, I understand, would include those of the Irish Free State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Senator Douglas with great interest, but, after listening most carefully, I really can hardly understand what he <Col N="373" /> is driving at.  The Bill shuts the door which the Senator says ought to be kept open.  He says we ought undoubtedly to approach all the different nations of the British Commonwealth, including Great Britain herself.  We should try and make the best arrangements we can with them.  If this clause allowed us to make those arrangements, none of us would oppose it at all, but as I read the clause, it does not give the Government a chance of doing anything in the way of making reciprocal arrangements.  Senator Sir John Keane's amendment certainly does.  It gives our Government the right to make similar terms for Irish Free State citizens to compete for appointments in all the nations of the British Commonwealth, on exactly the same lines which we will allow them here.  But, if we do not allow them to compete here, and if they take us up, we shall most undoubtedly not be able to make any such arrangements for our own use or our own people.  I notice one peculiar thing in this clause, as it stands in the Bill. The words are used &ldquo;born in Ireland.&rdquo; We admit, at least, that the Six-Counties are not to be barred out.  We admit that it is inherent in Irishmen that they should be free to compete. To take up one small part of what I might call the British Empire&mdash;the Six-Counties&mdash;and say that they are to be allowed to compete, but outside of that nobody else is, I cannot see any logic in support of it.  Undoubtedly, it is a very wise thing to do.  I think it is the best thing in the clause, but probably the clause, as a whole, is what Senator Yeats said; it is a clause which implies that positions in our Civil Service can only be held by Free State citizens, that all other competition is barred out.  I do not for one moment believe that that is the case.  We have never seen it in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland was part of the British Empire, but in the ordinary way all our main posts were filled by Irishmen. Senator Colonel Moore said that we had plenty to export too and very brilliant people they were.  To bar out any competition in the matter, except from Irishmen, and to run the risk of having all our surplus young men ruled out from competition abroad is, to my <Col N="374" /> mind, very foolish.  We know that it is the brains-carriers who are looking for employment outside and they are the people for whom it is very hard to find employment now.  To think that the small Civil Service that we will have here in the Free State is going to be anything like sufficient to swallow the best of our youth is to my mind impossible of upholding.  Senator Col. Moore would rather run the risk of all the youth who have to look abroad for a living having their chance entirely taken away from them, than to expose our young men to foreign competition for our own Civil Service.  It seems to me that that is a cowardly policy for our Free State to follow.  Senator Sir John Keane says that it should be open to citizens of any co-equal nation of the British Commonwealth of Nations. That gives our Government the full right to take care of our citizens who wish to get appointments abroad.  They should have equal rights with what is given here.  I should say that that would be an excellent move in the interests of our educated and brains-carrying youth.  The clause, as amended in that way, would be infinitely better than it is at present.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, as regards the difficulty pointed out by Senator Douglas, namely, that in many of our sister Dominions there are conditions which clog the immediate right to competition in their Civil Service, I suggest that Senator Sir John Keane's amendment would cover the whole ground if it was put in this form &ldquo;Or who are otherwise qualified under reciprocal treaties arranged between the Free State and any other co-equal nation of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo; It will have to be the subject of negotiations and if you put it in that way it will cover the entire ground.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to detain the time of the Seanad.  Probably most of what can be said about this amendment has been already said.  I would like to take the opportunity of telling the Seanad how this thing works in practice.  There are some vacancies in England for veterinary inspectors under the Ministry of Agriculture.  Quite lately I was asked if I would recommend two young men from this country. That was because I was one who was likely to know something about veterinary surgeons.  I do not believe they were asked for specially because they were Irishmen, but they were asked for.  I have recommended them. I believe they have still to go through some form of examination.  Whether they get appointed or not, they go there on equal terms with anyone else, and there was no objection made to them because they were Irishmen.  If we pass the Civil Service Bill in the form in which it is, without Senator Sir J. Keane's amendment, we could not reciprocate in such matters.  And every Irishman would feel that he would be put in the position of having it said that we could not stand on our own feet and take on anybody at even weights.  That is why I shall vote for Senator Sir J. Keane's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Ernest Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to oppose this amendment.  I do not wish to say very much.  I think what I said against <Col N="376" /> the previous amendments applies to this amendment.  I agree with the point of view which I think Senator Sir J. Keane holds, that this is not very much a practical matter.  Almost the same people will come into the Civil Service whether this amendment is passed or not.  I think the Seanad might as well realise that it is discussing a matter of theory for all practical purposes.  There is not the slightest danger of any British retaliation.  The British Government has its own reasons, and very good reasons, for leaving its Civil Service open.  It does what suits itself.  We should do what suits ourselves, provided we are not under any obligation to do something that does not quite suit ourselves.  Under the particular obligation that we have taken, we simply do what is best to get the best Civil Service for this country, a Civil Service that will serve this country best.  There is no parity in the case of Canada.  Canada is not like this country.  Canada is sending out advertisements and doing its best to attract population to it.  But it does what suits itself, and we should do what suits ourselves.  There is nothing in this Bill which says anything about bringing in experts from abroad.  We may bring in experts from abroad, from the Commonwealth or from France or Germany.  This Clause in the Bill deals with the ordinary examination in which there is open competition, an examination in which the ordinary clerks for doing the Civil Service work will be selected.  Without passing this Bill, we can bring in any experts we wish. But we must have regard to the history of this country, and we must not ignore the feeling of the country when we legislate.  There is no doubt that the passing of an amendment such as this, of no practicable importance at all, would be misunderstood, and would be resented by the majority of the people of the country.  We have suffered in this country by being ruled from outside and by having every item of our national life dictated to by foreign officials.  The country desires that the Civil Service of Ireland should be composed of men who would be inspired by patriotic feelings.  If we give them such a service as that there will be confidence in it, and if, you do <Col N="377" /> not do it, there will be discontent, and we will not get as good results as we would by having such people.  We cannot ignore history nor the feelings of the people of the country, and these are important factors.  In fact, these are the only factors, the feeling of the country and the interests of the people &mdash;the getting of the Civil Servants that will suit ourselves&mdash;that we have to consider.</P>
      <P>Senator Douglas is quite right. What we do about this will have no effect at all on the good relations between us and the other members of the British Commonwealth.  If we pass the Bill as it has been put up, it will not exclude any substantial number of people outside who would not be excluded by the unattractiveness of our service to them or probably the types of examination and the subjects that would be put up.  The passing of an amendment of this sort, to my mind, will do one thing, and one thing only; it will irritate a large number of people in this country, and will do something to take away the confidence that there ought to be in the Civil Service, which is a very important part of the machinery of the Government.</P>

      <P>I would just like to ask for an intrepretation of the clause as it stands.  It reads to me in this way.  In line 38 it is stated that competitive examinations &ldquo;(with the exceptions hereinafter in this section mentioned) shall be open to all persons desiring to attend the same who are born in Ireland of Irish parents or who are the children of such persons.&rdquo;  Now, those born in Ireland of Irish parents go abroad, get married, and have children abroad who are citizens of other States in America.

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, it is sufficiently wide in its meaning to attract those who have Irish leanings and Irish blood in their veins, and to attract them to these examinations.  I suggest that it is only by some sentiments of that sort that we can ever hope to get any <Col N="378" /> competition from abroad for our examinations. I do not think this country will afford sufficient allurements to the citizens of other States to compete, and the only hope we can have of getting competitors from abroad would be that sentiment would attract them.  The children of Irish parents born abroad are sometimes more Irish than the Irish themselves, and they would come with added experience and knowledge to our country, and I think it is in that sense that we are quite justified in leaving the clause as it stands.</P>

But if it means, as I think it does, that the children &ldquo;of such persons&rdquo; means both parents, therefore to entitle a child born of an Irish family to compete in the Irish Free State, he or she would have to prove that both were born of Irish parents in Ireland.</P>

      <P>After the speech made by the Minister in charge of the Bill I should like to explain the position in which I find myself. I listened with great interest to the speeches made by Senator Sir J. Keane and the other Senators who have spoken in favour of the amendment, and I need hardly say I sympathise entirely personally with them.  I feel it would be in many respects deplorable that it should go forth to the world that in what are the early days of our existence we looked at this matter in a purely parochial sense.  I am speaking with some interest on the subject because we have had a case recently in the National Gallery.  We extended the applications for the position of directorship of the Gallery to the whole world, and we got 130 applications from Germans, Austrians, Frenchmen, Italians, Englishmen and so on, and the majority, quite within rights, no doubt, said: &ldquo;This is a case where none but Irish need apply.&rdquo; That was really the effect of it, and I think it was a very deplorable effect. We took a man whose ability and qualifications could not have been on the same footing as others who had applied. There is no use asking for applications if you do not consider them when they apply, and after what the Minister said, we have to question ourselves whether we are going to do more good or harm by accepting this amendment. I think most of the Senators who spoke in favour of it have admitted that for all practical purposes there will be no reprisals from the other units of the Commonwealth and we will not suffer in that respect by any barring of our young men applying for positions in the Commonwealth.  If there was it would be a most deplorable result, because this small Civil Service of ours could not afford scope for all our young men.</P>
      <P>I have no sympathy with Senator Moore's view of trying to establish all our young men here in Ireland, and prevent them going outside its waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> I think that would be a very unhappy state of affairs.  The Minister said that in these things he spoke with some authority and from what we have seen of him and know of him he always speaks from conviction.  We are all satisfied that he is doing things for the best interests of the country.  He would do anything to defend those interests and he said deliberately that this would provoke great feelings of resentment on the part of a considerable section of the Irish Free State. We know unhappily that in the last two or three years there has been great division of opinion and that that division still exists.  We do not want to increase that feeling or to do anything that will intensify it.  And when the <Col N="382" /> Minister tells us it will not have any practical effect and will not make any difference one way or another, but that it would undoubtedly provoke feelings of resentment amongst the Irish people here, I feel I am not justified in voting for it.  We should try to bring the people together as much as we can and endeavour to forgive and forget the past.  In the course of a few years, the men now opposed to us, if the occasion arises, would be the first to welcome Englishmen and any other members of the Commonwealth into Ireland.  At present one can understand there is some feeling against it, and in these circumstances I shall be obliged to vote against the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am against this amendment for two reasons.  Civic Guard is not the translation of the word at all, although I dare say that some Senators imagine it is.  Síochána really means &ldquo;peace&rdquo;&mdash;and the phrase means Peace Guards.  It seems ridiculous to have two words used. When we had policemen no one thought of calling them anything else. We were not allowed to have Irish words, and in former times my friends were put in prison for putting their names on their carts in Irish.  Really, I think we ought to be allowed to call our policemen what we like, but I do not want anyone to be sent to prison for doing so.</P>

I think if our country is going to adopt bilingual procedure, such as they have in South Africa, while we would like to see the Irish language preserved, it is prejudicing individuals to make it compulsory to adopt certain phrases.  I venture to suggest that it would be more consistent to give us the option of calling them Gárda Síochána or Civic Guards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: Section 8.  To delete the Section and to insert in lieu thereof a new Section 8, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Commissioners shall conduct all examinations in Saorstát Eireann which are by statute or other authority required to be conducted by Civil Service Commissioners, and shall also conduct all educational examinations, whether competitive or qualifying, for the time being required by law to be held for situations in the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann or in the Dublin Metropolitan Police, the Gárda Síochána, or any other police force in Saorstát Eireann, and shall also if so required by the Executive Council, or by statute, conduct examinations for situations in the service of any local authority, and shall also conduct such other examinations as the Executive Council shall from time to time require to be conducted by the Commissioners.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Commissioners may with the consent of the Minister for Finance, from time to time make regulations for the conduct of examinations to be held by them under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very long amendment, but is does not mean very much.  When the Bill was first drawn up it was proposed that the Civil Service Commissioners should hold examinations for positions on the local bodies, as well as positions in the police and so forth if it was so desired by the Executive Council.  We deleted the words <Col N="385" />&ldquo;Executive Council&rdquo; and the result of that situation is that nobody can be appointed to any of these local offices except after examination by the Civil Service Commissioners.  Personally I am strongly in favour of all these positions being eventually determined by examinations held by the Civil Service Commissioners.  We have not yet reached that stage.  Apparently until an Act is brought in amending the system of Local Government, it would not be possible to make the change.  As regards the police, I do not know if it is suggested that the appointment of ordinary police constables should be as a result of a Civil Service Examination. That would be the result of this amendment.</P>
    <P>It is conceivable that many of these positions will have to be filled on the recommendations of the responsible authorities, and they may have to pass qualifying examinations, not necessarily Civil Service examinations.  Therefore, I think we went further than we intended in our proposal.</P>

      <P>Your amendment does not make it compulsory to hold examinations, for example, for the Defence Forces or the D.M.P.

      <P>The same people. This is an amendment we agreed on with a view to carrying out an undertaking that was given when the matter was last before the Seanad.  It does not go the whole way, but it goes a certain distance to meet Senators, and I think goes as far as we can agree to go at the present time. It makes it compulsory that the Civil Service Commissioners shall be the body to carry out any examination by law required in respect of the Police Forces or the Army, and also any examinations that may by Statute be required to be held to fill any local posts, either now or later on.  It does not compel the Civil Service Commissioners to hold examinations for local appointments until legal changes have been made which would make it necessary for their findings to be given effect to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, an amendment was passed when this Bill was before the Seanad a week or so ago, the result of which was, that if the Bill passed without this amendment, or something like it being inserted, the Civil Service Commissioners would have to hold examinations before a surface man could be appointed by a local Council or before a private could be recruited into the Army.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move in Section 9&mdash;&ldquo;To delete in line 43 the words &lsquo;Minister for Finance,&rsquo; and in line 49 the word &lsquo;Minister,&rsquo; and to substitute therefor in each case the words &lsquo;Executive Council.&rsquo;&rdquo; This matter was discussed more or less informally on the Committee Stage, and the Minister made a statement on the subject that I must confess did not satisfy me.  For that reason I now move this amendment. I have no doubt that there may be some legal technicality or fictions involved in relation to the individual and collective responsibility of the Minister, but as the Section now stands, in plain English the Minister for Finance has power to control the whole of the Civil Service in respect of classification, enumeration, and other conditions of service.  I am not satisfied that that is a position that makes for good business. I quite agree that there must be some regulations made, and that in matters of finance and in co-ordinating financial affairs the Minister for Finance is the proper person.  I do not believe, if the Minister is to act as the Section indicates, that it is wise that he should have a sort of over-ruling power in all Departments.  I suppose it will be argued that there is an appeal, and that it is not done by the Minister for Finance as an individual or a Minister, but by the Minister for Finance because of his collective capacity. <Col N="388" /> I confess I do not understand the point.  There may be some obscure point of Constitutional law, but I prefer to argue the point in plain English. It gives the Minister for Finance powers to regulate and control all other Departments.  That, I think, should not be so.  If you are to control a Department it should be done by the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had made the position moderately plain.  Under the Constitution the Minister for Finance is one of the Ministers who must be a member of the Executive Council. The Constitution also lays down that the Executive Council shall be jointly and collectively responsible for the Departments administered by the members of the Executive Council.  In all matters with which the Minister for Finance has to deal he is subject to be overruled by the Executive Council as a whole.  In all matters in which they are likely to disagree with him, he must enter into consultation with them.  As a matter of fact, financial matters are of such importance, and involve so many other considerations, that a Minister could not take it on himself to decide without consultation.</P>
      <P>The only thing that would be effected by the passing of Senator Keane's amendment would be that a large number of routine and unimportant matters would have to be brought before the Executive Council quite unnecessarily.  Now, a great number of matters have to be brought before the Executive Council, and if routine and unimportant matters were brought before them to take up their time, that would clog up the business of the Council and would deprive the members of the opportunities they should have of conferring on broad matters of policy.  It seems to me this amendment, if passed, will not increase in any way the control of the Executive Council, but it may burden the Executive Council with the consideration of matters which ought not to be brought before it, because of their unimportant nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>Still I am not satisfied.  If the Minister put in a form of words to indicate that the other <Col N="389" /> Ministries are in consultation and concur, it would be better.  I know it is a somewhat technical matter, but you are defining more or less the internal machinery of Government, and by this clause you are giving the Minister for Finance unduly wide powers.  I have had experience of the system of Government which the present system is more or less following in tradition, and I know the embarrassing and clogging effect of some of those financial powers in actual operation.  It is, if I may say so, in the dark that the Cabinet and Ministerial action is carried out.  For the first time, now, there is an attempt to lay down by statute the relations between Ministers, and we have responsibility for regulating and co-ordinating Ministries.  Under the British Constitution the whole thing was unwritten and followed custom and precedent.  We did not know where we were, and there was a great deal to be said for that.  Here we are abandoning the flexible method, and giving opportunity for more precise enactments.  Personally, I do not approve of these far-reaching powers being given to the Minister, although I do not wish to underrate the importance of certain of his duties.  Rather in his own interests, I do wish to see him relieved of detailed control and able to decentralise, as far as is safely possible, amongst his colleagues.  It is because this will maintain centralisation and will militate against decentralisation that I move the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This would not relieve the Minister for Finance of anything. Matters coming before the Executive Council, if they are to be put properly before it, must be put by a Minister.  Some Minister must be made responsible, and you cannot have things brought up in a casual way, or you are sure to have a mess.  This will not relieve the Minister of any responsibility or work, but would throw matters of detail and routine matters on the Executive Council, taking up its time without achieving any good result. It is on that ground that I oppose it.</P>

      <P>If it is incompetent for the Seanad to discuss matters of <Col N="390" /> finance, are we in order in discussing the Minister for Finance?  I would like to give my reasons for opposing this amendment, which seems to me rather unnecessary.  I think the Minister ought to be kept in his own individuality as much as possible, and not fused with the Executive Council, particularly as he said he does not act executively without having consulted with his colleagues.  As regards Senator Keane's reference to action in the dark, it is absolutely impossible to make public the mentality of the Executive Council.  I am against the amendment.</P>

      <P>This, I think, is a useful amendment, because any certificate which is given by the Civil Service Commission as a result of the suspension of these examinations must state specifically the grounds upon which that certificate is given.  I think that will be a useful thing in the case of anybody seeking employment, and I beg to move it.  It is really an improvement on the Bill.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad is of opinion that, with a view to the encouragement of Irish industry, steps should be taken for the representation of the Irish Free State at the forthcoming British Empire Exhibition.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I will not detain the Seanad long.  If they will bear with me for a few minutes I will endeavour to put the matter before them.  A certain amount of disappointment has been created by the fact that this country is not to be represented at the Exhibition in London this year.  A number of inquiries have reached me and my friends from various parts, and there is a general feeling amongst our friends in various parts of the Commonwealth of Nations that they would like to see us at Wembley at the British Empire Exhibition. I am not blaming the Government at all.  The Government have had many calls made upon them.  They have had to endeavour to make some reparation of the effects of the civil war, and they have shown a great deal of courage in the way in which they have faced the problem of reducing the expenditure of this country somewhat more within the ambit of its capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have done very important <Col N="392" /> work in the financial scale, and there is very important work before them still.  If the Finance Minister does not loosen his purse strings I, for one, am not prepared to find fault with him. But possibly the country as a whole might be prepared to deal with the situation itself, provided we had the good will of the Government.  We do not ask from them very much more than their good will.  I think the country itself is quite competent to take charge of this situation.  The good will of the Government would be of considerable importance to us, because undoubtedly they can assist us in many ways; quite apart from the financial position they could assist us in other respects and give us important assistance. While not asking them to assist us financially in the present state of things.  I think it would be of help if we had an expression of their good will towards this undertaking.</P>
    <P>Now, there is no doubt about it that this country ought to be represented at this Exhibition.  If we be represented, we must be represented largely by our own efforts.  We have been brought up in a very bad school.  For a number of generations we had been in the habit of going to the Government for everything. In the time of the British Government if we wanted a light railway built or a lighthouse erected we went to the British Government, and we expected them to help us.  It was not very often that they did help us.  We were brought up in that school, but we have advanced a stage since then, and we are approaching the time when we shall try to do these things for ourselves. In a matter of such importance as the representation of Irish industry in a place where it would be exhibited practically to the whole world, I think that Irishmen themselves would be well advised in taking, at all events, a larger share of the burden upon their own shoulders.</P>
    <P>It is not for me to suggest how this should be done; it is for the practical business men of the country.  It is also for the members of the Irish Labour Party who are mainly concerned in this question with our manufacturers as representatives of the industrial population, and it seems to me on this ground it might be possible to come to some <Col N="393" /> understanding between the representatives of our industry and the representatives of those who are employed in carrying that industry out.  My recollection in this matter goes back many years, to the most interesting Exhibition held in Dublin in 1886.  I think it was called the Irish Industrial Exhibition.</P>
    <P>As well as I remember, the Trades Union leaders of that time joined in assisting the Exhibition.  It was a small Exhibition, but unquestionably it was a great success.  Then we had a very admirable Exhibition in Cork.  That was a larger Exhibition, but not as large as it might have been.  Still, it was very representative of Irish industry, and, finally, we had the exhibition of a few years ago in Dublin, an Exhibition carried on mainly through the instrumentality of the late Mr. William Martin Murphy.  That was probably the most successful Exhibition held in our time.  Now, we have a great opportunity, before a wonderful concourse of people and a great display of the products of various countries, to present the exhibits of our own industries.  This Exhibition in London will give us, perhaps, the best chance we have ever had of doing that.  It will give us an opportunity, too, of making a strong appeal, in what is really the only market there is in the world at the present time, owing to the difficulties created in foreign countries by the exchanges and matters of that sort.  It is not likely that this country in the immediate future can do business with other countries except those comprised in the Commonwealth of Nations.  At all events, if you do business with them, you are sure of getting paid, and you need not bother about calculations in francs or in marks.  You are sure to get paid for your commodities, and I think you ought to take advantage of this opportunity, and show our friends from the various countries exhibits from our own industries.</P>
    <P>I am sure these people will be glad to see our exhibits, particularly those who come from a far distance.  We are appealing to the best market in the world, and we can show, for instance, our American friends things they cannot <Col N="394" /> get at home.  We can also show them many artistic things.  We make the most wonderful woollens, and we can show them examples of this industry. I have taken the opportunity of raising this question in the Seanad, because, as I said, of the feeling which has reached me from many parts that people will be very much disappointed if Ireland is not represented at the Exhibition.  In view of the importance of the matter, I think our industrialists and manufacturers should be prepared to bear a considerable proportion of the burden of the cost that will be involved. I do not want to appeal to our over-worked Minister for Finance. He may have to do some other things very soon, and I do not want to ask him for too large a sum of money.  I think if the business people of the country, and the representatives of industry in the country, would come together, they might devise some scheme whereby we might be represented at this great Exhibition.</P>
    <P>It may be urged that we are too late, but I do not share that view.  I am certain that if the project were started in Dublin, and that if the leaders of Dublin industry and of trade put their heads together, it would be easy to get proper representation for the country at the Exhibition, even though we are starting late in the day. I have had some experience in conducting matters in this country, and I find that we succeed best in doing what is apparently impossible, and that we succeed wonderfully well when we have to do things in a rush, and when there is a certain amount of enthusiasm and excitement created in respect of them.  I think it is quite possible for the industrialists and the manufacturers of Ireland to retrieve the situation as far as the existing vacancy is concerned, and I suggest that this is a matter which the Seanad might commend to the consideration of the country.  I beg to move.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion.  I, and I suppose everybody here, can recall a very fine exhibition of Irish goods, especially breakfast table products, that was organised and exhibited by the Department <Col N="395" /> of Agriculture and Technical Instruction at almost every show at which other manufacturers were invited to exhibit.  I believe that the Department of Agriculture is functioning still.  It surely would be rather a slur on the Government if, under the British Government, the Department of Agriculture made it its object to display the goods we have for export in a prominent and most artistic way at these International or Imperial Exhibitions, and if no attempt was made to do so by the Department of Agriculture under our own Government.  I only mention that as one instance where I think the Government would be held to be at fault.  Then we have a great many industries, especially art industries, of which we are very proud, and I think there should be some public body to organise a fair representation of these industries.  I need not speak of those large industries for which we are famous all over the world, brewing, distilling, woollens, and so forth.  Of course, for the ordinary requirements of our citizens we purchase practically all foreign-made articles.  This country is a dumping-ground for the surplus manufactured goods of the world, so that I do not think, of objects of ordinary use, that we have very much to show, and certainly we have practically nothing to export.  Of course, it is open to us to change all that in the future.  I hope that the Government will take some action to ensure that the products for which we are famous, and especially agricultural products, shall have a fair show at this coming Exhibition.</P>

      <P>Without desiring to speak against the motion, perhaps you will allow me to say a word or two with reference to the attitude of the Government.  More than a year ago the Government decided to take part in this Fair, and, I think, actually secured a site from the management. If they did not actually do so they certainly were in negotiation with regard to a site, but as the last winter went on, and as the destruction in the country increased and the pile of debt grew, we felt, when the time for introducing the Estimates came along, that <Col N="396" /> we could not commit the country to this expenditure.  Consequently we decided that we would be reluctantly compelled to withdraw from the project altogether.  Until about a month ago our position had not improved financially in any respect so as to enable us to reconsider the position. When the National Loan was floated and was very successful the matter did come up, but we felt then that the time for having an Exhibition that would do us credit had passed, that it was no use having a small show or a small pavilion on some very unsatisfactory site in the grounds.  We felt that while very good results might have been got for the country by a good, well-arranged, well-organised exhibition in a suitable place, no particularly good result would follow if we had a sort of a scratch exhibition in a pavilion that was unimposing.  I think that it is now really too late to do anything that would be useful.  I am not sure of the exact date on which the Exhibition opens, but I think it is in next April. It will be quite impossible in the time that is available to erect a pavilion; it would be impossible, I think, to organise an Exhibition satisfactorily. There is also the point to be borne in mind that whereas considerable expenditure might bring good results and might impress people, a small expenditure, which is all we could contemplate at the moment, might really disimpress them, and it was really because the time is too short and the condition of the country is still so serious that we have felt unable to take part in the Exhibition.</P>

      <P>I have pleasure in supporting Senator Sir T. Esmonde's motion very strongly, and I do so in spite of what the Minister for Finance has said, because, judging only by the avidity with which the Colonial Premiers have seized upon the sites in Wembley, the value of this Exhibition is undoubted.  Two of the best sites have already gone to New Zealand and Australia, and if at their distance from the market they are seeking they still think it worth their while to be represented, it ought to be more urgent for us to take advantage of this opportunity. There is another consideration, <Col N="397" /> apart altogether from the economic and commercial aspect, and it is this: If we absent ourselves from the Wembley Exhibition the internal conditions which gave rise to the absence will not be understood.  We will be taken as still sulking in our tent, and sulking in our tent in the presence of the greatest collection of visitors that is likely to occur anywhere in our time. The extent of the Exhibition should be known before people lightly turn aside the opportunity of bringing Ireland possibly before six or seven millions of human beings, a large percentage of whom will be our own countrymen. There is another consideration, too, and it is this, that in the Exhibition there is already evidence of the linking-up of the Colonies to the detriment of Ireland, and there is a good deal of headway for Ireland to make up in view of the competition that is now becoming so great from Denmark and the Netherlands, countries further from England and with less rich soil than ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exhibition is to be opened in April.  I do not know how long the entry list for exhibitors will be kept open, but this I do know: you can erect a tent in a week and a pavilion possibly in a month, and the difference between a tent and a pavilion is a matter of small importance.  But it is an opportunity that should not be lightly passed, because the Exhibition will represent every form of national life, and the products of every form of industry, and it is abetted by immense attractions in pageants that will bring people there just as a theatre would draw them.  This country would have the advantage of an immense advertisement at very little cost, and would help the people to clear themselves up in the eyes of their customers in a way that is highly necessary, because very few people know how deep the ignorance of the sources of some of our greatest commodities is in England. We may think that certain of our products are world-famous.  That may be, but the world does not know where that source is.  Not so many years ago I heard a soldier in a Crewe restaurant ask for a bottle of &ldquo;Guinness's Twenty.&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;Guinness's Twenty. We call that Guinness's double X in <Col N="398" /> Dublin.&rdquo;&ldquo;Just like you Irish,&rdquo; he said.</P>
    <P>In the same way reasons like that make me think it is necessary for the Irish people to show where they stand with their products, and there could not be a cheaper or a more direct opportunity of getting into practical contact with the consumer than this exhibition affords.</P>

      <P>There is a certain body interested in artists, of which I am Chairman, and we had this matter before us at the last meeting, and there was exactly the same difference of opinion there as we find here now.  We found out that invitations from the exhibition reached various artists at the end of last September to send in their work.  We have been carrying on some correspondence with Ministers to find out whether the work of Irish artists would be classified with the general mass of English artists and other artists from different parts of the Empire, or whether they would be treated separately, and exhibited in a different room.  I do not know whether we have had any satisfactory answer yet.  It is possible it is too late to have them separated in a separate room, and that they would go along with others from different parts of the Empire under the head of &ldquo;British Artists.&rdquo;  If they went into a separate room we would have very distinct possibility for Ireland.  About 16 years ago Sir Hugh Lane gave an exhibition of Irish Art in London, and it was discovered that some of the most famous artists were Irish.  If our artists now had not the opportunity of exhibiting separately they would be driven back in the public estimation. At the same time we were not sure but it might be too late now to organise a separate Irish art section, and to bring into it men like Orpen and Lavery and Shannon, and if we could not recover these men we would have an Irish section that would not fully represent us. I am very much in favour of having Ireland represented at an Empire exhibition, but I am very anxious that the representation should be adequate, and I confess I have not before me any facts upon which I could feel assured upon that subject.</P>

      <P>Well, as a business man I will tell Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde what we have done.  I went into this matter about a year ago when it was first mooted.  At that time the prospects of Wembley Park were not what they are now, and probably the Free State Government, when they began looking into it, might have had doubts at that time whether it would be well to spend money on it.  But since that time the management has got into excellent hands, and I think there is no question but it is going to be a great success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We decided months ago we would exhibit, and we went into the whole question.  I found our Government had gone into the whole thing.  I was told all about how it had looked into it, and what the cost would be.  I take it that if our business community, to which I presume Senator Sir T. Esmonde is referring, wanted to go into it that it should have taken it up at that time, and should have pressed the Government if it wanted to go into it.  I did not hear of anybody pressing the Government at the time that it would have <Col N="400" /> been of use.  I spoke to some members of the Government about it, and I had to admit their case was sound.  They had not been pressed by the business community, as far as I know, and the expense would be considerable, and the finances of the State would not warrant it.  I agreed that the Government was right, but we decided that so far as our own personal business was concerned, to aid our export trade, we would take a site, and that decision was made months ago.  I doubt very much indeed whether, if the business community in the Free State now choose to look for a site, that they could get one that could give us any kind of show.  There is no use in going in for a small, wretched kind of thing.  If it is to be of real benefit, the Chambers of Commerce in Dublin, Cork and Limerick should get a small body of business men to go over and examine the question immediately and see if they can get a site, but it will cost a good deal of money.  I cannot see how a lot of our industries, that is, the smaller industries which belong to the different parts of Ireland which come under the head of Irish industrial products, can get represented now to push forward glass and carpets and all the different things that we ought to be exhibiting. If we only decide to go in to-morrow, I am sorry to say that if you send over your business men now they will bring back a report that they could not find a site that they could recommend to Free State manufacturers. I am sorry to say that to Senator Sir T. Esmonde, but I am dealing now entirely with the business community, because I believe the Government has a justifiable case for the position in which they stand.  If the business community wish to take it up, they will have to act at once.  Our money is out on our own show at present, and it is a very costly business.</P>

      <P>My only object in raising this question was that we might have a discussion on it, and if the people say they want to be represented there that they could be ready in time, and that they should take off their coats at once and see about it.  I am obliged to Senator Jameson for his very practical statement, <Col N="401" /> and for his useful hints on the subject.  I did not venture to make any suggestions in the course of my remarks, for I am not in a position to make them to gentlemen who thoroughly understand their own business, but I cannot withdraw the resolution. I think the resolution will do no harm whatever and may do good, and may bring the Chambers of Commerce together to make investigations and something may come of it.  Seeing that we have treated the Government very nicely, I think the least thing they might do is that the Minister might get up and say &ldquo;this thing has my blessing.&rdquo; He has not done that, and, therefore, I will ask the Seanad to agree to the motion.</P>

While I think it is most unfortunate that we are not to be represented, I am greatly afraid that having regard to the demands for space we are too late, but it is not too late to ask the Chambers of Commerce to send over competent men and have that matter ascertained.</P>
