      <P>I have not had an opportunity of considering this Bill very fully, but I should like to direct the few remarks I intend to make to the general question of the treatment of the liquor trade.  It seems to me that some time or other&mdash;I do not say we have yet reached that stage&mdash;this country will have to take the question of the regulation of the liquor trade seriously into its consideration.  What lines are now being followed I am not in a position to discuss.  As I say, I have not studied the question sufficiently. Might I suggest, however, that in any future legislation on this subject we would do well to consider what is being done in other countries, notably with so much success in the Province of Quebec, in Canada.  An adaptation of the Gothenberg system would seem to be a wise way of approaching the question. I know I am hardly in order in raising the question now, but I would like to <Col N="1118" /> make the suggestion to the Government that when they are resolving this matter, seriously and permanently, they might consider what has been done in other countries, and more especially how this Gothenberg system has been actually put into operation in the Province of Quebec, where its operation has met with very considerable success.</P>

      <P>I desire to welcome and support the Bill as I believe it is an honest and well-conceived effort to regulate in a legitimate way, and in a statesmanlike way, a very important trade, which has frequently been subjected in the past, here and in other countries, to very repressive legislation. The Bill is in no sense a prohibition measure.  All the interests concerned are safeguarded.  In this connection I should like to quote a few sentences from a very fearless and very impressive speech which was delivered by the Bishop of Durham quite recently in the House of Lords.  The Bishop said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To determine one's own choice of food and drink is, I submit, one of the essential franchises of self-respecting manhood, and, of course, it must be exercised reasonably and with due consideration for the rights and interests of society....  Let us throw ourselves into the great and salutary movement for providing improved public-houses....  Instead of making the trade in alcohol a disreputable one, as with disastrous consequences they have done in America, let us try to make it respectable and responsible.  I would have the whole trade know that they are engaged in a lawful and a salutary industry, ministering legitimately to the needs of the people.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I conceive that it is on these general principles this Bill has been introduced. Orderly regulation is the essence of the Bill, and there is no attempt at repressive compulsion or undue interference with the liberty of the subject. We are all very anxious for the cause of true temperance.  At the same time, one has to remember that in the words of a very famous and eloquent Irishman&mdash;the late Archbishop McGee&mdash;we would prefer Ireland to be free, to Ireland compulsorily sober.</P>

      <P>This Bill tries to deal fairly and justly with the various people concerned, and I welcome it. One particular section, which I feel is a very proper one, deals with the standardisation of porter and beer bottles. The Commission which dealt with that matter found that originally twelve bottles went to the gallon.  That has been gradually extended by licensed holders to sixteen to the gallon, and possibly further.  Apparently that is to be stopped.  That is a valuable concession to the consumer, and a just one. Having gone that far, I think it is necessary to point out that for this particular offence the penalties are not as stringent as are laid down in other sections which deal with matters that are not any more important.  A man apparently may break the law in respect of supplying diminished quantities of drink as often as he likes without having the conviction recorded on his licence.  To my mind, that is a flaw in the Bill, and on the Committee Stage I hope to move an amendment to the effect that a conviction in such a case should be recorded on the licence. With that exception, I think the Bill in its main provisions is a just one, and one which shows that the question has been approached from the point of view of equity and fairness and without any idea of what you might call &ldquo;Pussyfootism.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to run very briefly over the provisions of the Bill and say a word to the Seanad as to the spirit in which it was conceived.  We are fairly satisfied that a good deal of the abuses and irregularities that exist in connection with the licensed trade in the country exist by reason of the fact that there are probably twice too many licensed establishments.  Figures that I give now are not for the entire country, but for the area of jurisdiction of the Free State.  There are 15,000 publicans' licences; that is, roughly, one for every 250 of the population&mdash;men, women and children.  In England there is one to every 450 inhabitants, and in Scotland one to every 695.  There is nothing contained in the Bill under consideration attempting to deal with <Col N="1120" /> that side of the question.  I would hope, in the very near future, to establish a Committee or Commission whose Terms of Reference would be to make recommendations bearing on that aspect.  At the moment I am satisfied that in that particular trade in the country there is too keen a struggle for existence.  You have small traders scrambling for crumbs, and the crumbs are only got by abuse and breach of the law.  Naturally in any attempt to effect a substantial reduction of licences some consideration will have to be paid to the danger of going so far in that direction as to produce and create shebeening.  There can be, without any danger of that, a very substantial reduction effected in the number of licensed establishments in the country. I am satisfied that with such a reduction irregularities and abuses will tend to disappear.</P>
      <P>This Bill, as I say, does not purport to deal with that side of the question, but merely regulates hours of sale and matters of that kind.  The hours of sale are, I think, reasonable, from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., on ordinary week days, and from 9 a.m. to 9.30 p.m. on Saturdays. The Act that is in operation at the moment enforces a 9.30 p.m. closing. Under the provisions of this Bill there will be a further extension of half-an-hour on the ordinary week day.</P>
      <P>I have not attempted to deal at all with the bona fide traffic in this Bill. That, too, is a matter that has to be left over for the consideration of whatever committee or commission is established.  There is only this provision that, as between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Sundays, no bona fide traffic is allowed.  There is a section in the Bill dealing with clubs.  The hours for the sale and consumption of drink in clubs is restricted to the statutory hours for licensed premises.</P>

      <P>I might mention that I was asked to receive, and did receive, the Chairman of the Clubs' Association as a deputation.  He interviewed me on behalf of this Association which is mainly concerned, I think, with working men.  He expressed a very strong desire on the part of the Association which, I believe, <Col N="1121" /> numbers some 15,000 members, that the Seanad would at any rate carefully consider the question of extension.  In view of that, perhaps the Minister might say a word on the existing provisions.</P>

      <P>Part 3 of the Bill deals with clubs and in Section 20, Senators will find that the hours for sale in clubs are identical with the provisions with regard to licensed premises. That matter received a good deal of consideration, and it has to be recognised that legislation of this kind must be uniform for the country and must embrace all kinds of clubs.  I am well aware, and the officials of my Department are well aware, that there are clubs here and there through the country which are well run and are well managed, and in connection with which there is little, if any, abuse.  On the other hand, there are a great many establishments where that is not the case, and where it is not true to state that the sale and consumption of drink is a mere side line incident to the existence of the club.  It is the main purpose of the club's existence and the main purpose of its membership.  The consumption of intoxicating liquor in many of these establishments would run very close the consumption in the average prosperous public-house, and would probably exceed the sale and consumption in most public-houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being so, and having regard to conditions generally in the country, we have to ask ourselves whether 13 hours in the day is not adequate for the purpose of the consumption of alcoholic liquor by the ordinary citizen; whether there is a case for the further extension of the hours with regard to clubs. Personally, I do not think there is.  The idea was that it is bad to have men turning out, whether from licensed houses or from clubs, making their way homeward after the ordinary life of the city or the country has been suspended for the night, and after people have retired.  I am satisfied that 10 o'clock is reasonable.  I met deputations from clubs, and some of them put up a very plausible case for extension; they pictured the case of a man who goes for a walk after his day's work, and so on, <Col N="1122" /> who does not come back to the town or city perhaps until 9 o'clock, and who might wish for a couple of hours' social intercourse in his club, and a certain amount of drink&mdash;of refreshment, as it is called.</P>
    <P>Well, that is not the average case. The average case is that people repair after their day's business to their club just as other people repair to licensed premises, and the case that the sale of drink is a mere side-show in the club and that it is not the main purpose of its existence, that people play billiards, read, and so on, is met by the fact that this Bill does not lay down that clubs shall turn out their members and lock their doors at 10 p.m., but merely that the bar shall be closed and that the sale and consumption of liquor shall cease at 10 p.m.  If the consumption of drink is merely accidental to the club's existence, why is the cry raised that we are turning them home at 10 o'clock if there is no use in staying on?  It is not as if we struck the newspaper from their hands or the cigar from their lips, at 10 o'clock.  We merely ask that the bar shall be closed at that hour. What happened was that where you had the distinction between the club hours and the licensed premises, people who left the licensed premises went to some club, and having spent two or three or perhaps four hours in a public-house, spent two or three more hours in a club either on their own membership or on the introduction of a friend who was a member.  It is said we are taking an unduly rigid and puritanical view of a matter like this, and it was urged most eloquently and almost passionately in the Dáil that what was needed was more enjoyment for the people of the country and not irritating restrictions of this kind.  My view is that legislation of this kind must be taken in the setting and with regard to conditions as we know them in the country.  This is a period of subsiding lawlessness, but there is still a good deal of jibing at restraints of one kind or another, a tendency to wildness and abuses, and you have to frame your social legislation in recognition of that fact.</P>
    <P>If the circumstances were other than what they are, there might be a case <Col N="1123" /> for greater latitude, but with the tendency in the country, it is a perfectly reasonable provision to say that the sale of drink shall cease at 10 o'clock, that people coming out from places where drink is sold, shall come out at an hour when people are up and about, and that there shall not be a temptation to outrage and excesses of one kind or another that there is at a later hour in the night, and that there will not be the same prospect of committing offences of one kind or another with impunity that there would be at a later hour in the night.  We are not tending towards prohibition.  We hope we are tending towards moderation in the direction of temperance, and I believe that we will, when the struggle for existence in the licensed trade is somewhat reduced by a substantial reduction in licences, bring about a situation where the publicans themselves will be the most active and industrious agents in seeing that the laws are properly carried out and properly obeyed&mdash;the laws in connection with the sale of drink.  On Committee Stage, if any Senator feels strongly on the matter and puts down an amendment bearing on this question of clubs, we can discuss it further, but in view of the statement which has been made by An Cathaoirleach I thought it as well to say that much.</P>
    <P>There are provisions in the Bill bearing on illicit distillation which were generally approved in the Dáil, and which, I think, are scarcely open to objection.  I think that for effective treatment of the illicit distillation problem it is necessary to take power to schedule an area and restrict within that area the sale of the raw material for poteen.  I am aware that in anticipation of this Bill for the last few months, very large orders have been sent from the West to brewers and maltsters round Leinster and the Midland counties, so that there is a kind of intelligent anticipation there of hard times ahead, and they are taking steps with regard to it.  We will not make any inroads on that problem until it becomes a difficult matter, an increasingly difficult matter, to get material without detection, and the provisions in the Bill in that connection are framed <Col N="1124" /> with a view to bringing about that result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like generally to support the Bill.  It was not my intention to speak at this stage, but rather to reserve my remarks for the Committee Stage, but as you, sir, referred to the deputation, I should like to mention the fact that Senator O'Dea and myself received a deputation of three leading members of the Catholic Church, a well-known Dean of the Church of Ireland, a prominent Minister of the Presbyterian Church, and a member of the Society of Friends.  They were not at all satisfied that the restrictions on clubs were sufficiently satisfactory. I am not expressing my own view; I will keep it for the Committee Stage, but as you, sir, mentioned the deputation, I should like the Minister to know that there is apparently an organised public opinion which has another view.  There was another point which was raised in regard to clubs and which was emphasised there, and which is, I think, of importance.  If it were possible to frame an amendment to meet it, I think it would meet with a more or less general approval.  It was pointed out by that deputation that there are certain clubs in Dublin that have what is called honorary membership&mdash;that you pay a shilling a year, but you do not get any of the privileges of the club except the right to go to the bar.  It seems to me that quite a reasonable arrangement could be made by which, for the purposes of the Act, members only who would be entitled to all the privileges of the club would be regarded as members of the club.  I suggest that the Minister might consider this.  I think it is an important point.  Generally I welcome the Bill.  I think it is a good Bill, and I am glad it is received as such.</P>

      <P>Under the existing law, the Act of 1904, I find that one of the conditions of registration is that the rules must prescribe that no young person under eighteen years shall be admitted a member of the club unless the club is one devoted to athletic purposes ... and that no excisable liquor shall be sold to any person under eighteen years of age.</P>

      <P>Like everybody else in the Senate, I have sympathy with everything tending to make the lives of the people more decent in this country, and although this is not a teetotal Bill in any way, it may tend towards a little more decency in drinking than has hitherto been shown.  For many years, perhaps for many centuries, every good man and woman has been trying to limit the amount of drink consumed, and the damage done to everybody in the country, yet we have gained but little in the efforts that were made as far as the enforcement of the law is concerned.  Efforts were made by numbers of the very best people in olden times, by Father Mathew, and later by the Gaelic League, by the Irish Volunteers, and by all sorts of temperance organisations to establish temperance in the country.  These efforts succeeded for a time, but afterwards lagged, on account of the state of the general law, and still more, on account of the assistance given by the police in permitting everyone to do what was illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have knowledge of the country, and I have seen these things done before my eyes.  I have seen public-houses opened immediately after Mass on a Sunday, when they should not be open. I have seen police within one hundred yards from the houses where people were streaming in and out, and they <Col N="1126" /> did not come near these houses until the people were gone away, and if they did walk in the direction of these houses they did so at a pace that enabled everybody to clear out.  I am alluding now to the old police, and not to the new police.  I hope that the new police will not follow in the footsteps of the old.  The main point of this Bill seems to me to be to prevent liquor being pushed in the faces of people in places where they did come in particularly to fetch it.  There was a section included in the Bill, which has since been taken out to my very great regret&mdash;to prevent the sale of drink at grocery bars and such places. According to that section there were to be different places for the sale of drink and for the sale of food and groceries.  I consider that was the most important section in the Bill, but, on account of certain people offering opposition in the Dáil, unfortunately it was left to a free vote, and was defeated and taken out of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his courage in bringing forward this Bill. I know this is a very difficult and troublesome matter, and that it caused great opposition in the country.  I do congratulate the Minister on his efforts to retain that clause in the Bill so far as he could.  He was overruled unfortunately.</P>
    <P>We all know what it is to have women and children going into grocery shops, and the efforts sometimes made to induce them to come over and have drink.  It is an absolute curse on the country, and should be stopped more than anything else.  I would sacrifice the whole of the Bill for that one section; it was by far the most important section of the lot.  It was most important that people should not be persuaded to drink in order to sanction some bargain with the owner or with some customer.  We all knew the efforts that are made in such houses to induce people to come and have a drink.  Women were induced to do the same; it is notorious.  I, for one, hold that that clause should be reintroduced into the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think it is only natural that the Minister in charge of this Department should be able to decree public holidays wherever of advantage to the community.  There was a fear, I understand, first entertained about this Bill that some attempt might be made to interfere with the three Monday holidays known as Bank Holidays in the country, and which have passed into the ordinary course of our holidays.  These three Mondays are of great importance to certain people, who regulate their holidays in connection with them.  The fear that these might be interfered with affected the situation when this question was first proposed.  I understand it is being made perfectly clear and safe now, and in so far as the Minister seeks the powers sought under this Bill I thoroughly support it.</P>

      <P>I wish to mention that the print of the Bill in possession of members of the Seanad is the Bill before it was amended in Committee of this House.  Consequently there may be difficulty in following it, because the list of amendments inserted in Committee have been printed on a separate sheet, and, of course, the Bill now as it stands should have these amendments in it.  There was no time to have a fresh print, so that Senators must follow as best they can the Bill and the amendments on the paper.</P>

      <P>It was pointed out at the Special Committee that while the words &ldquo;margarine,&rdquo;&ldquo;factory&rdquo; and &ldquo;milk blended butter&rdquo; occurred in the Act, no definition of these words appeared under Section 2, and that is so.  We further discussed in the Special Committee the question of what would be a suitable and convenient definition, and I think it was generally agreed that the definition of these words in the Butter and Margarine Act of 1907 would be a suitable definition.  I will read the definition. Margarine is defined as &ldquo;any article of food, whether mixed with butter, or which resembles butter and is not milk blended butter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Milk blended butter, as defined in the same Act, is any mixture produced by mixing or blending either milk or cream other than condensed milk or cream.</P>

      <P>Senator Brown, as a matter of drafting, suggested that this amendment might be changed mainly in order to make another special sub-section to the first half of clause (f), and that has been done.  That is the effect of the new amendment.  The new amendment is quite the same down to (e).  It was thought, and rightly thought, that the regulations in regard to the registered premises should get a separate clause, and that the regulations in regard to unregistered premises should also get a separate clause.  That is the reason for splitting that into two sub-sections, but the effect is the same. There is another sub-section which sets out specifically the exceptions instead of making them a proviso to the section. I notice, however, that there is one point in connection with the sub-section which will arise later on.  It is a very important point, and I might as well state the position now.  Clause (e) of the amended sub-section reads: &ldquo;There shall be available on or at the premises such adequate supply of good and wholesome water as may from time to time be reasonably necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That raises a very important point which will again arise in connection <Col N="1131" /> with some of the other sections of the Bill.  Clause (e) of the original section reads: &ldquo;The premises shall be provided with such adequate supply of good and wholesome water as may from time to time be reasonably necessary.&rdquo; Senator Sir John Keane suggested that that might possibly come to mean that &ldquo;premises&rdquo; under this section might mean farm-houses, and that farm-houses would be required to put in pipes in order to provide a supply of water.  He pointed out, and rightly so, that most farm-houses have not got pumps or a supply of spring water in their yards, and that in a good many cases they have to cart a supply of good and wholesome water very long distances to their premises.  He said it should be made quite clear under this Bill that the Department of Agriculture ought not have the power to order that pumps or artesian wells should be sunk on the premises of an ordinary farmer. Senator Sir John Keane himself suggested, Senator Brown agreed, and I tentatively agreed to the following words, leaving out the words &ldquo;at or on the premises,&rdquo;&ldquo;there shall be available such adequate supply of good and wholesome water as may from time to time be reasonably necessary.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That amendment has been already made.  It was passed in Committee.  It is in the Bill though not in the print of the Bill. It is one of the amendments that the Committee have inserted.  I have here the report from the Committee, in which they set out in the appendix the amendments that they inserted in the Bill and this is one of them.  Subclause (3). in line 47, the words &ldquo;the premises shall be provided with&rdquo; are to be deleted and the words &ldquo;there shall be available&rdquo; substituted therefor. That amendment, as I say, is already in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to call the attention of the Seanad to the great inconvenience, and this is an illustration of it, that we suffer in not having the same privilege that the Dáil has.  When a Bill passes through Committee in the Dáil it is reprinted and the amendments that have been inserted in Committee appear in <Col N="1132" /> the reprint.  That ought to be done in the case of a Bill like this in the Seanad also.  Then we would know where we are.  As it is, you have got to look at the original Bill, then to look at the report of the Committee, and then we have got to look at the new amendments moved by the Government, whereas if we had a reprint of the Bill as it left the Committee of this House, the matter would be very simple for every member to follow it.  I shall take upon myself in the future, in the case of a Bill of any importance, to give directions that it shall be reprinted after it has left the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The Committee first of all agreed with this amendment, and then agreed to a re-drafting of the whole clause.  I was going to ask the leave of the Seanad to alter the amendment which was put in in Committee so far as that particular point was concerned. The amendment on the appendix which I have before me was agreed to in Committee.  We have a special amendment here.  In line 47, the words, &ldquo;the premises shall be provided with,&rdquo; are to be deleted, and the words, &ldquo;there shall be available,&rdquo; substituted therefor.  In addition, it was agreed in Committee, but this does not appear on the Order Paper, that a certain re-drafting of the whole clause should take place.  The re-drafting of the section was suggested by Senator Brown. Whether that is inconsistent or not is the question.  Whether our procedure on that occasion was inconsistent hardly arises, but I suggest that we discuss the whole matter in connection with the re-draft of the clause.  I wish to ask the leave of the Seanad to make a slight alteration in what was agreed to at the Special Committee.</P>

When it was sent to the Committee this particular Clause 3, sub-section (e) in the green print of the Bill was amended.  It stood: &ldquo;the premises shall be provided with such adequate supply&rdquo;; that is the way it stood.  The Committee struck out the words &ldquo;the premises shall be provided with&rdquo; and inserted the words &ldquo;there shall be available.&rdquo; Now the Government want, in addition, to add, after the word <Col N="1134" />&ldquo;available,&rdquo; the words &ldquo;on or at the premises.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It was agreed in Committee that this re-drafted section should be inserted, while it was not agreed that the words &ldquo;on or at the premises&rdquo; should be put in.  Now the first question you have to ask yourself, if simply inserting the words &ldquo;there shall be available such a supply of good and wholesome water,&rdquo; is what exactly is the meaning of that?  As the words stand at present they are hardly good drafting, and hardly the definite and precise language that should be in an Act of the Oireachtas.  We had to improve them, therefore, and for these reasons: We may disagree afterwards on what we want to effect.  It is, I think, clear enough that &ldquo;there shall be available an adequate supply of wholesome water&rdquo; is not good re-drafting. It is really an expedient for avoiding the points of difference before us.  The real points of difference, or perhaps I should say the real points of agreement are&mdash;we want to make it clear that we do not want to coerce any owner of a farmhouse to put in a supply of water, while we do wish that a supply of water shall be available at the premises, wherever it comes from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is our position with regard to Section 3, which deals not only with registered factories and creameries, but which deals with farmhouses as well When it comes to creameries our position <Col N="1135" /> in the matter is that every creamery and every butter factory and every manufacturing exporter should have an adequate supply of water.  In fact, I think every single one of them&mdash;and I have gone over the list&mdash;have on their premises a supply of good and wholesome water sufficient for the purpose. In any event, we wish to make it clear that we are going to require that every creamery shall have a supply of good and wholesome water on the premises. To meet that point, and to meet this looseness in drafting, the suggestion was that we should insert here in the clause that deals not only with creameries but farmhouses, the words, &ldquo;there shall be available at or on the premises a supply of good and wholesome water.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The only distinction between farmhouses and a registered creamery would be the word &ldquo;at&rdquo;.  In other words, it would be compulsory that there should be a supply of water on the premises in the case of a creamery and at the premises in the case of a farmhouse.</P>

A creamery is a premises where butter is made from cream separated from the milk supplied by a number of individuals, on the premises.  The section as it originally read was as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>If you turn to the definition of creamery business, Section 2, it reads:&mdash;</P>

      <P>My purpose was, that the shrine should contain a vellum roll, on which every member elected to the first Irish Seanad up to this date should sign his name, and that the shrine should be placed on the Table at the opening of every meeting of the Senate&mdash;now and in the future &mdash;to be a perpetual memorial of the foundation of this body, and a witness, in later times, of its increasing service to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Senators do me the honour of accepting this gift, with these conditions, I will then proceed to do what could not be done without their <Col N="1141" /> consent&mdash;to inscribe on the shrine my name as donor, and that of the artist, and to place in it the vellum roll.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Seanad gratefully accepts the casket upon the conditions named by the donor, Senator Mrs. Stopford Green.&rdquo;  Mrs. Green has sent to the Seanad with this gift a message which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I ask leave to send a few words as to the casket which I offer to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Senators will agree that we should place no emblem before us in this Assembly that is not of Ireland, in spirit and in workmanship, carrying in it the faith both of the Old Irish world and of the New.  I have insisted, therefore, that the form of the casket should go back in direct descent to the &ldquo;shrines&rdquo; designed by the Irish over a thousand years ago. The artist has magnificently proved the power of that spiritual inheritance which has been bequeathed to us from an Old Ireland; and has shown that a really living art has no need to copy in slavish routine, and can to-day be as free and original and distinguished as in the times of ancient renown, supposed to have been lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus the shrine in its intense vitality carries to us its own message. That if we want to revive here an Irish nation we must dig our roots deep into its soil, and be nourished by that ancient earth.  In Old Ireland, a land of many peoples, it was not privileges of race that united Irishmen in one country and under one law.  It was a common loyalty to the land that bore them.  &ldquo;This then is my foster-mother, the island in which ye are, even Ireland.  Moreover it is the mast and the produce, the flower and the food of this island that have sustained me from the Deluge until to-day.&rdquo;  This feeling was the refrain of Irish nationality, the loyalty of a people made one by their sonship to the land that bore them, an early and passionate conception of nationality.  A sudden and brief outburst by an Irish poet of the old time has no parallel in European <Col N="1142" /> mediaeval history&mdash;&ldquo;The counsels of God concerning virgin Eriú are greater than can be told.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From the beginning, Ireland has been rich in her hospitality to men of good-will coming within her borders.  And at all times there have been incomers who have honourably responded to that generosity, and have become faithful members of her people.  She has had her reward among the strangers who under her wide skies have felt the wonder of the land, and the quality of its people, and have entered into her commonwealth.</P>
    <P>Through the long record of wars and assaults, in every generation in turn, men who came as warriors, even the roughest of them, remained as men of Ireland.  They took their share in defence of their new home, and endured, if need were, in evil times outrage, ruin and death in the cause of Irish freedom and independence. No real history of Ireland has yet been written.  When the true story is finally worked out&mdash;one not wholly occupied with the many and insatiable plunderers&mdash;it will give us a noble and reconciling vision of Irish nationality.  Silence and neglect will no longer hide the fame of honourable men.  We shall learn the ties which did in fact ever bind the dwellers in Ireland together.  Whether we are of an ancient Irish descent, or of later Irish birth, we are united in one people, and we are bound by one lofty obligation to complete the building of our common nation.  We have lived under the breadth of her skies, we have been fed by the fatness of her fields, and nourished by the civilization of her dead.  Our people lie in her earth, and we ourselves must in that earth await our doom.  We have shared our country's sorrows, and we expect her joys.  &ldquo;The mother that has nursed us is she, and when you have looked on her she is not unlovely.&rdquo;  To Ireland we have given our faith.  In Ireland is our hope.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that after reading that message, no words of mine could possibly add to the appreciation of every member of this House of the <Col N="1143" /> spirit in which this gift has been made. When Senators have time and when they can spend time, in looking at and examining this casket, they will see that it is supremely beautiful.  To me, the message is, if possible, still more beautiful.  I would like to see that message also inscribed on vellum and placed within the casket.  I believe myself Senator Mrs. Green meant this gift to be an inspiration.  She desired to lift our minds out of too much emphasis on present-day difficulties with a hope and a belief in the future.  She desires to connect the faith which created the past with the new faith which would make us believe in still greater things for the country that we live in.  I believe that, if as a result of this gift, we can make the conception of the work of this House even one whit more noble, if we can do our work even one more degree in the spirit of that message, it will be the best reward, the best thanks we can give to Senator Mrs. Stopford Green.  I beg to move the resolution.</P>

      <P>May I have the honour of seconding this resolution? Senator Mrs. Stopford Green has presented us with an exquisite work of art, quite in keeping with the best of our ancient artistic traditions.  It is a most beautiful thing, well worthy the acceptance of the Seanad, and well worthy a place of honour amongst its household gods.  I should hope that this beautiful work of art may be the beginning of a collection of art treasures and of historical relics such as should belong to the Seanad of Ireland. Accompanying her beautiful gift, there is a charming message from Senator Mrs. Stopford Green, and I may say it contains quite as many gems in its own sphere as does the lovely casket on the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Stopford Green's message is quite as beautiful in its own way as is that casket, and I certainly agree it should be inscribed on vellum and placed within that beautiful receptacle. Her message contains many profound truths, and one above all, and that is that we are a nation made up of mixed races.  Our nation has been built up <Col N="1144" /> through the centuries by many foreign elements, originally foreign elements, and in the sorcery of Ireland's environment and in the wonderful atmosphere of Irish art, Irish tradition, Irish poetry and Irish patriotism, all the different elements of our nation have been welded into one.  Sir, if I may suggest it, it is more by the consideration of these things that really mattered, that Ireland has been made one, and that Ireland will remain one, and it is in the development of our indigenous art, in the prosecution and following out of our indigenous instincts, and not so much the following of shibboleths or party war-cries, that the real unity and the real happiness of this country will be assured.  The Seanad will accept, I am sure, Senator Mrs. Stopford Green's present with gratitude.  I hope it will be a standing memorial to us of what it really means.  I beg to second the resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move Amendment 15.  Section 16.  Sub-section (2).  To delete the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was one of the amendments originally put down in my name that I could not see my way to withdraw in the Special Committee.  It appears to me to carry this matter of regulation almost to a state of absurdity; it is to try to effect the control of creameries and butter factories in a manner that will not be effective.  This amendment and the next one really stand together and should be argued together. The Bill proposes to regulate the entry into registered creameries of all butter other than that coming from registered creameries.  If you examine the wording it will be found that the Minister regulating this matter has to deal with very variable, very indeterminate conditions.  One is if he is satisfied that there is &ldquo;a temporary decrease in the quantity of the milk supplied.&rdquo;  I really do not know how he can possibly satisfy himself upon that except by a very detailed analysis of the conditions obtaining at the moment, and also other similar purposes in other years.  Any decrease in the quantity of the milk available will depend upon the seasons and a number of factors present on the farm almost impossible for the Government to discover.  Or if the Minister is satisfied with the temporary decrease, then he is going to meet the &ldquo;immediate requirements of the business&rdquo;... &ldquo;as normally carried on.&rdquo;  There again he has to examine further into the trade connections of the business, whatever they may be, and barely even known to the business people themselves. <Col N="1146" /> They must obviously be of a very uncertain kind.  Then he has also to examine the business &ldquo;normally carried on&rdquo;&mdash;another exceedingly vague condition.</P>
    <P>Trade is a thing that is bound to fluctuate from year to year, depending upon foreign imports in the same market, depending upon purchasing power in the same market, and upon a number of very uncertain factors which go themselves to make up that exceedingly complex mechanism known as trade and commerce which, I submit, no Government is ever able to determine. All these initial difficulties are to be got over by a licence allowing the introduction on to the premises of butter of such and such description. He has to have certain guarantees as to the description of butter introduced under foreign brands, and in such quantities, which is again a very irksome condition I submit.  No business can be sure of the quantities required for temporary purposes, yet it is to be entirely dependent upon the discretion and good-will of the Minister as to the quantities allowed.  The same thing applies to &ldquo;every such purpose.&rdquo; It is quite impossible in reality to determine the period of shortage, governed as it is by a number of conditions of business which even the business man himself, who is most concerned, will not know.  Having fulfilled all these conditions, then the premises is allowed to bring in the supplies that are necessary to carry on its winter trade.  I submit that is going too far and that these creameries are perfectly competent to do their own business.  If they have a normal connection for their summer business, they are not going to prejudice their custom by introducing bad and inferior butter during the winter.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that all the butter going out is under our guarantee, but you cannot guarantee butter which is not manufactured, as this temporarily imported butter will not be, under your own control.  I submit that in many cases it will be better or as good as the home-manufactured butter. I really do not see why the Government should be allowed to carry interference with private business <Col N="1147" /> to this unwarrantable length.  I am not going to raise the general question&mdash;I have done that already&mdash;as to these provisions with regard to undue regulations.  I think that the power proposed to be given here is such that the Senate would be well advised to withhold it from the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I must ask the Senate to agree to retain this particular provision. I would like to put a specific question to Senator Sir John Keane. Does he think that a creamery should be perfectly free to bring butter from a butter factory on to their premises, and not only to bring butter from a butter factory but to bring butter from unregistered premises such as a farmhouse, or from an unregistered blender who is making butter of very poor quality for home consumption and which we would not allow him to export? Remember if we refuse registration the manufacture of butter can still go on for all purposes except export. I ask is it the Senator's contention that a creamery making creamery butter, the quality of which we are endeavouring to improve and a reputation for which we are endeavouring to get on the English market, should be perfectly free to bring factory butter or butter manufactured on a farm on to the creamery premises. You know the custom in a country town.  I do not say it is the general custom, but you know that it is quite a common thing for people to go into a town and sell 1 lb., 2 lbs., or 3 lbs. of butter to the local shopkeeper, who may be engaged in the sale of liquor, hardware, manures and all the rest.  He just takes the parcel of butter and puts it into a barrel under the counter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another person comes along and sells him one or two pounds of butter made under different conditions to the butter sold by the first person.  That parcel of butter is also put into the barrel under the counter.  When the barrel is full all that butter, without being blended or anything else, is sent to some place where the shopkeeper has a buyer to take it.  There you have a magnificent sample of butter with water content and all the rest of it. <Col N="1148" /> Is it Senator Sir John Keane's contention that that barrel of butter should be sold to a creamery?  If it is not his contention, will he frame some form of words, other than the words that I have here, which will give power to prevent the sale of such butter?  I do not want Senators to get the view that I am quoting an extreme case.  I am not assuming that that procedure would occur very often, but it might occur often enough in the case of a butter factory or of a shop.  Sometimes in the winter creameries get their butter from butter factories or shops.  What we ask is that if such a thing does occur we should be in a position to stop it.  I might say that this question was discussed by the Agricultural Commission, which contained representatives of farmers, labourers, university professors and so on.  I suppose that the Commission examined a couple of hundred witnesses. They had the whole trade before them.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that it was unanimously agreed by that Commission and by every other Commission that ever sat on this question&mdash;(1) that the word &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; should be strictly defined, and (2) that a creamery itself should be strictly inspected from the point of view of seeing that it did not connect with a butter factory or any other registered or non-registered premises except another creamery&mdash;that it did not connect with any such premises except by the public road.  That provision was inserted in the Bill on the recommendation of the Agricultural Commission and of every other Commission that ever sat on this question.  Sub-sections (4), (5) and (6) of Section 14 deal with that point, that no premises in the way of a butter factory or non-registered premises shall be connected with a creamery. That provision was inserted with the goodwill of the whole Seanad without amendment from anyone.  Why did we insert it?  For the purpose of making sure that butter would not come from a butter factory.  It might be found as good or worse butter, but this provision was inserted so that it would not come from a butter factory or any such premises into a creamery <i>sub rosa.</i><Col N="1149" /> If it is right to take power to see that no creamery shall be connected with a butter factory or in any other place where butter is blended; and if it is right for us to see that such factory butter shall not be brought into the creamery, why is it not right to state specifically here that not only shall butter not be brought secretly on to a creamery&mdash;secretly by connection with a butter factory through a back yard or something like that&mdash;but that it shall not be brought openly on to the premises except under the licence of the Ministry of Agriculture?</P>
    <P>It is because we do not want to regulate trade more than we can possibly avoid that we inserted this section.  We do not intend to go over to England to see exactly how the butter market is. We do not intend to make an exhaustive inquiry into the amount of milk which a particular creamery is getting at the moment.  It is rather an open secret amongst agriculturists that in certain months of the year milk becomes extremely scarce, and anyone engaged in the creamery business could rattle off for you at a moment's notice certain creameries which would be short in their milk supplies during particular months in the year.  If a particular creamery were to say that they had not sufficient milk we would require this licence to make the necessary inquiries, and as a result of our inquiries we would be able to say whether the contention of the creameries that they were not getting sufficient milk was likely to be true.  On the other hand, if a creamery in the month of July or June comes to us and says: &ldquo;Our milk supply is short,&rdquo; we will want to know the reason why.  My point is this, that we cannot allow unlimited and unlicensed quantities of butter&mdash;that is, factory butter or any other blended butter&mdash;to go on to a creamery the produce of which we are trying to improve for the purpose of our foreign markets.  We cannot allow them to bring such butter on to premises which we control at a time when we are endeavouring to standardise the products turned out in these premises. You cannot standardise their produce and at the same time allow absolutely free access to non-standardised butter into them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> On the other hand, we do not say that we have winter dairying in this country.  We do say that in certain months of the year it is necessary that butter should come in and that these creameries should be allowed to get in butter which they do not make themselves. We provide for that contingency by giving power to the Ministry to give a licence for that purpose. These are the merits of the case.  I go further and say that I do not believe that a single inquiry within the last twenty years has not agreed that butter going into a registered creamery should be controlled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite in agreement with the Minister on this point.  If the Bill is to be of any benefit at all for the purpose for which it is intended, the Minister for Lands and Agriculture must control the butter that is permitted to come into registered premises during the winter months.  If they do not exercise some such control the stress of competition at times might cause a needy creamery to import something which would lower the standard, and, that being so, the competitors of that creamery would necessarily be compelled to lower their standard also if they were to compete with the creamery that was producing a lower grade and selling at a lower price.  I do think there is something in what Senator Sir John Keane says with regard to the interference with trade, which runs right through this Bill.  But to my mind that is our safeguard in this way.  The success of this Bill depends upon its administration, and if it is unduly onerous on the trade, there are so many persons connected with the trade in Ireland that such a fuss would be kicked up that not only would the Minister for Lands and Agriculture disappear, but the Government themselves would disappear if this Bill were not administered in the sense in which it is intended.</P>

      <P>When there is a shortage of milk, I believe there will also be a shortage in factory butter. The conditions which produce a shortage of milk will militate against the supply of factory butter.  I would be quite prepared to meet the Minister with regard to the prohibition of the <Col N="1151" /> introduction of butter made in a farm or factory.  But we know that to meet the shortage there is imported, every winter, New Zealand or Australian butter.  There would be no harm in permitting that to continue.</P>

      <P>That could be continued by these regulations.  That is my objection to the whole Bill&mdash;that there is too much bureaucratic control. Why not allow these recognised brands of butter in without the necessity of having to get these licences and permits? We all know from our experience of legislation that all these conditions do not operate in practice, while we can very well visualise that they are an intolerable nuisance to the trade which is suffering from them.  I feel that it is the duty of the State to try to limit all this circumlocution to its least possible limit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane's suggestion is that there should be free entry not only for butter from other creameries but for butter from other creameries outside the country, such as New Zealand butter.  Now, there are a number of creameries in New Zealand the same as this country. They are exporting butter to this country. Here is a Bill to control butter and to give a reputation to exports of butter from Ireland; and the Senator's contention is that there should be free access to this country of creamery butter entirely uncontrolled.  Suppose for a moment that our inspector goes into a creamery and that there he finds butter with 16 per cent. excess water, and that he finds there butter that is dirty, and that he finds other noxious things in it, and all these other particular faults specified in the Bill, and the creamery owner says: &ldquo;Oh, that is New Zealand butter that we have just got in,&rdquo; would not that make the administration of the Bill impossible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put that as the lowest argument to show that it is essential if foreign butter is allowed in to these premises that are supposed to make a standard article, that that butter can only be <Col N="1152" /> allowed under licence and under certain conditions.  I may say that the trade are satisfied with these conditions. There are people here who know the trade better than I do.  As long as they can get in New Zealand butter at certain times of the year for home trade they are quite satisfied.  We have power to licence them for that purpose, under special conditions.  For the reasons I have stated, if it is an insuperable objection, it is because the administration of the Bill would be made impossible if this butter were allowed in and always the inspector would be met with the answer: &ldquo;This is not our own make.&rdquo;  That is why I say it would be impossible to let in New Zealand butter without control.  I am prepared to compromise on any section of this Bill provided the purpose we are aiming at in each section is safeguarded.</P>

      <P>Before you leave Section 16, I wish to say I had an amendment in Committee&mdash;I think it will be within the recollection of the Seanad that the Minister said he would consider my proposal and bring forward some suggested amendment, As far as I see, he has done nothing in that respect.  I think, therefore, it would be incumbent on me to move my original amendment.  It is to Section 16, the Section stating that the manufacture of butter on the premises shall be under the control of a qualified manager, and so on.  It was to this effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>On Sub-section 3, Section 16 of the Bill.  That deals with the qualifications of the persons, and that is the very section I propose to amend.  The clause as it stands, as I endeavoured to argue in Committee, would allow the Minister at all times to put into the position of creamery manager any person whom he, or any subsequent Minister, thought was qualified for the position.  I do not think that is desirable. We have been trying to improve the conditions of the butter industry, and I recognise that this Bill will go a great length in putting the butter industry of Ireland on a sound basis. For a certain period I think it is essential that the men now managing creameries should be ratified in their positions because they have proved their competence; they are acquainted with the details of the management and they could not be adequately replaced.  The Minister on this particular clause presupposes a certificate, and then after the lapse of a reasonable time, when this Bill comes into operation, I think it is only fair that no man other than an existing manager, butter-maker or tester, asking for an appointment, should be allowed to carry on unless he is fitted with credentials for that appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we should put into the position any man who has not the hallmark of ability and the requisite education.  For that reason I proposed the amendment in Committee, and I would ask permission to propose it again now. What I mean is, that previous to the registration of creameries there should be, so to speak, a going over of the capacity of the various managers, and where the Minister is satisfied that a manager, although not possessing a certificate, is qualified, then he becomes <Col N="1154" /> by that mere examination qualified and the Minister so certifies.  If in three or four years time, the position of manager becomes vacant, then the person appointed should be a certificated manager, or butter-maker, or analyst. That is essential.  I understood that the Minister and myself were practically agreed, and I had hoped that he would have met the position in some reasonable way, but I suppose he did not think it was worth doing.  I would ask the Seanad to consider my amendment and to say whether this is not essential to the proper working of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think we are paying too much attention to the mysteries of qualification.  I understood that in Committee the idea was to limit the power of the Minister to make appointments. Now Senator Bennett suggests that any little authority from the Minister will qualify a man.  Is there any great mystery about being qualified and made the manager of a creamery?  Suppose a man is incompetent, he will be held up by other provisions in the Bill.  Automatically he will cease to be an active agent in producing butter.  I would like to know what is meant by qualification.  I think we are unduly mystified by the word itself.  It adds greatly to the complexity of the matter.  Butter has been made from a time before history.</P>

I do not think any man should be allowed to carry on the work unless he is certified and qualified. Senator Gogarty says that any man can make butter.

      <P>As that amendment stands, would it not really amount to what is in sub-section 3?  It would enable the Minister to issue a certificate to a man who had not got a degree or who had not passed a certain examination. I want to be clear about this.  If I understand what Senator Bennett is after, I understood from his first statement that he wanted to ensure that every creamery manager should have passed the appropriate examination and should only get a certificate on passing that examination.  If that is his position, then, I take it that it means after registration every creamery manager and every butter maker, and everyone employed in a technical position should have passed the requisite examination for his position and have got a certificate to that effect from the Minister. If that is his position it is vitally different to what is set out in sub-section 3 and to what is set out in his own amendment.  What the amendment means is that no man shall be a creamery manager or butter maker unless he has a certificate from the Minister. On the other hand, the Minister may give him such a certificate as is contemplated without having passed the creamery manager's examination.  If we got at the exact point we would probably get nearer to agreement.</P>

      <P>While the Senator wishes that there should be a prescribed examination for new creamery managers, or for other people interested in the butter trade, he wants to have power reserved to the Minister in the case of those already in the trade and occupying these positions, so that they should not be compelled to pass these examinations provided the Minister gives a certificate that he is satisfied with their qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the first object is concerned, dealing with existing creamery managers and officials, we are at one.  There is only this distinction, that while under sub-section 3 we should recognise them as qualified for the position, it would not be necessary <Col N="1158" /> to issue certificates to them to that effect.  That is the only difference. The second point contained in the amendment of Senator Bennett is the real contentious one; that is, that in future all officials, not only managers, but butter-makers, testers and all other officials of a creamery, should have to pass these examinations and get a certificate before acting in any of these capacities.  Remember, too, they are Irish examinations.  For instance, that would bar out a Dane, would rule out an American, and we have a good many fairly efficient managers who are not of this country and who have not passed examinations here.  I agree that is a point that could be covered by drafting, and if Senator Bennett were agreeable we could not only include Irish examinations as a qualification but examinations in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general principle, is it wise to insist that every official in a creamery shall have passed the requisite examination? There are at present short courses for creamery managers, short courses for butter makers, and practically all, I think&mdash;certainly the most of the butter makers&mdash;have been through that course.  On the other hand you have creamery managers, first-class managers, really good business men&mdash; and that is what you want in a creamery manager, just as much technical competence&mdash;who have never been through a creamery manager's course. The question is, are you going to insist on an examination always?  What will be the effect of that?  In certain cases a man would go into a creamery perhaps as manager of an auxiliary. He might go there as a butter maker or in a great many other capacities and show himself a really first-class man, get promoted along line, after getting experience, and become a really first-class manager.  The creamery manager's course is six months.  He does a certain amount of bacteriology of a very elementary type, a certain amount of simple science, in addition to a certain amount of practical work. If the other man is an intelligent man he might learn ten times as much from actual experience as he would learn from a six months' course in the school.  If you put in that proviso you <Col N="1159" /> might have a butter maker who has gone through the course and has passed examinations, got the certificate and who is tied to that all his life, or he will have to go back to school and to the creamery manager's course. That would be very serious.  You might have such a butter maker there for 7 or 8 years, the best man in the creamery, the manager resigns, and some young fellow, just out of college, walks in, knowing perhaps about one-tenth of what the butter maker who has been acting as assistant manager, might know.  You have to take all these considerations into account.  I put it to the Seanad: is it wise to lay down here and pass a hard and fast, stringent rule, that no man shall act as a creamery manager unless he has passed the requisite examination in Ireland or elsewhere?</P>
    <P>I agree with the principle, or, rather, with Senator Westropp Bennett's point of view, that the really important thing is to get good managers and good butter makers.  If you have not efficient men your creamery is no good, no matter what regulations you bring into operation, and no matter what laws are passed.  I do not yield to anybody in insisting on getting the really best men to fill executive positions in the creamery. It is from that point of view it is a little bit dangerous to lay down hard and fast rules that nobody except those who have passed the requisite examination should be a creamery manager and to rule out of consideration the man who has been acting as assistant manager.  He is notoriously a first-class man, and I think it would be an undesirable decision that he should be over-ridden by a man who has spent six months in a school.</P>

      <P>This amendment is to try to withhold from the Minister power to make any regulation he likes over and above any safeguard in this Act, in respect of premises supplying cream to an institution which makes that cream into butter, known technically as manufacturing exporters. There are not many of these manufacturing exporters, but it is possible they may increase.  Manufacturing exporter is a business which either makes butter from milk separated on the premises or from cream supplied directly from individual farmers.  I think I am right in that.  Now, when you read sub-section (1), paragraph (a), section 18, you find that gives power to the Minister to make all the regulations he likes or to submit individual suppliers of cream to any conditions he may prescribe.  That means to say he can go even beyond the conditions of cleanliness and order, in Section 1, and tie them up to any extent.  In fact, we are giving him a blank cheque to impose any conditions whatever on firms supplying cream to a manufacturing exporter.  I do not like to lay great stress on that because the Minister has got such enormous powers up and down the Bill, but this is apparently opening the door too wide, and I think the House should, unless they consider it is necessary, curtail this power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister expressed that view.  I might straightaway say that there is a precedent for this unfortunate proposal.  It was introduced, during the course of the Committee Stage, without being previously on the paper, into the Egg Bill, giving the Minister similar powers now sought under this Bill.  But I would strongly urge that it is an undesirable precedent and should not be repeated.  Now, if you examine it, the effect of this will be that on representation made to the Minister by any party, and in any manner, that the creamery has failed in a breach of contract, <Col N="1163" /> the Minister, after hearing what evidence he likes, not evidence given before people competent to judge of the laws of evidence, taken without any judicial safeguards, can cancel registration, which will have the effect of ruining the creamery, because it will have to close the business, and the export trade will have to be stopped.  I think that is a very serious and a very grave and a very dangerous power to give to any Government.  It infringes the proper functions of the courts which are the judges of a breach of contract and have the right to punish accordingly.  It removes all the safeguards that surround judicial proceedings, and gives very dangerous powers to the Executive.  Further, I may add there is no appeal whatever from the decree of the Government. An inquiry can, but not necessarily must, be granted.  I ask the House, therefore, to accept this amendment and to allow a breach of contract to be dealt with in the dairy business as it would be dealt with in every other business by the courts of law, and by the ordinary laws of contract and of tort governing these cases, and all other cases of commercial dispute.</P>

      <P>I ask the House not to accept this amendment and not to delete this sub-section.  If there is one thing more than another in the butter trade which has brought the whole industry into disrepute in other countries it is the dishonourable efforts of some people who have accepted orders and cannot deliver them trying to get out of their responsibility. I have often felt, as an Irishman in England, degraded at the reproaches thrown at me of this character and which have made me really feel ashamed.  It is easy to say that a merchant in England has the right to come over and sue for breach of contract in the courts here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in the butter trade your turnover takes place forty times a year, and you have something else to do beside coming over to fight the creamery <Col N="1164" /> in some out of the way place, and not knowing the day or the week that the court may sit.  This really has had more to do with the difference between the price of Irish butter and Danish butter, than the merits or qualities or intermittency of the supplies can account for.  If a man undertakes to sell butter that he cannot deliver the man disappointed sometimes may like to get a little of his own back by penalising Irish butter in a bad market.  I admit this is a very peculiar provision to put into a Bill of this kind, but the fact that it is so shows that in the opinion of the Board of Agriculture, not only the Board of this Ministry, but in the opinion of the Board long before the Free State was established, this was something that should be dealt with, and, for my part, I am very pleased that it is dealt with.  Both in the interest of the trade and for the good name of the Irish traders, I hope that it will be insisted upon.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear this amendment argued very fully before we are asked to vote on it.  I was recently in the United States and I found there, not particularly in regard to butter, but in regard to several commodities, that our reputations for keeping contracts was about as bad as it could possibly be.  I fear it is one of the most serious obstacles one has to face in the effort to see how far an export trade might arise.  There is a great deal in what Sir John Keane has said.  His argument appealed to me, but the weakness of it was that he does not provide an alternative, except that of going to the court.  I have had, as a trader, to meet breaches of contracts, but I never sue.  I simply close the account.  It is a much easier and more effective way of dealing with it. I am quite certain that a similar attitude is taken up by persons who buy butter from this country.  We are concerned particularly with developing a satisfactory export trade, and I certainly shall feel obliged to vote with the Minister except some amendment providing an alternative other than that of suing in the courts is proposed. I feel there is a good deal in Sir John Keane's criticism except, as I say, that <Col N="1165" /> the only alternative is to leave the law as it was before.</P>

      <P>I am trying to put myself in the position of a butter dealer in Manchester, because I have sufficient knowledge of the creamery trade to know in any way the advantage of the clause in providing a person to whom <Col N="1166" /> the injured merchant could appeal. Senator Dowdall has shown to us the uncertainty of tribunals in remote parts of the country and also the smallness of the breach of contract, but inasmuch as there is a firm point of appeal to which the merchant whose order has been refused may go, a good deal may be done to give a strong assurance to those engaged in the Irish trade.</P>
      <P>It is a very important thing that it should be done.  I myself heard of a contract with an American firm which was stopped by wireless merely because the market in England rose a few points.  Until we have the solemn assurances to give that contracts will be fulfilled, the whole of the Irish trade will be open to this objection, that nobody can be sure of the word of an Irish trader.  In so far as it infringes on the liberty of the subject, it infringes only so far as that subject becomes a butter dealer.  He has got many other functions to exercise, but if he likes to put himself under the rules of the trade which will very shortly be one of our most important industries, he must put up with this infringement.  I hope the butter trade will very soon make up for the £7,000,000 invisible imports.  I think the greatest assurance we can give to our market is that first of all there will be a willing listener and an immediate appeal by this Bill in spite of the fact that it is taken out of the jurisdiction of the courts.  I do not think that giving the Minister power over such a department in the country is a precedent that we may dread, because it is only inasmuch as the subject is a butter dealer, and only inasmuch as the Minister is dealing with creameries that these things could apply.  Therefore from what I know of the objections on the part of buyers abroad to this particular part of the Irish trade, and for the sake of improving the trade and for the honour of the country I strongly support that clause.</P>

But I do not know of the same conditions in any other country either.  I do not believe that the same conditions apply to any other country that is competing with us.  I do not believe that the same circumstances apply to the trade of any other country that is competing with us as apply to our trade with England as a result of the shameful breaches of contract that are taking place and the complaints that are being made as Senator Dowdall has referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BUTLER</NameTxt>
      <P>There is standing in my name this amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 29, Sub-section (4), Immediately before Sub-section (4) to insert a new sub-section (4) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister may also by order make regulations prohibiting the placing of any particular mark or marks of any particular class or description on all or any classes, grades, or descriptions of butter, or on any packages or wrappers containing any such butter, or on any letters or invoices or other trade documents issued or used in relation to such butter, and where any such regulations have been made and are in force, any person who places any mark on any butter or any package or wrapper or any letters or invoices or other trade documents in contravention of any such regulation, shall be guilty of an offence under this section, and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Select Committee a new sub-section was inserted.  In lieu of that sub-section, I propose now this new sub-section.  I suppose this will be looked on as an interference with trade. I consider that this is a very necessary section.  The previous section of the Bill gives the Minister power to see that certain marks or brands may be placed on a package of butter.  This section gives him power to prohibit that.  What may happen is this&mdash;it is open to any exporter, unless this section is inserted, to place on any package of butter a brand or mark saying &ldquo;Factory&mdash;Inspected by the Government&rdquo; or &ldquo;Butter exported under licence of the Free State Government.&rdquo; That description may be perfectly true and would not be misleading to anyone in this country, but it might be misleading in England.  The butter is exported to England to be sold perhaps to a wholesale dealer.  He may know the meaning of it.  The shopkeeper to whom he sells it may know the meaning of it, but certainly the buyer in <Col N="1169" /> England would not know the meaning of it.  If it appeared, say, on the invoice, or on the package of butter that the factory was inspected by the Free State Government, or that the butter was issued under licence by the Free State Government, the buyer would be under the impression that that butter was guaranteed.  It is in order to prevent any such false impression being conveyed that I move this amendment.</P>

I think if some arrangement could be made with the Department of Agriculture in England to get penalties instituted there for tampering with the brands of butter, or for putting on brands to which the butter is not entitled, it would do much good.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5)  Every inspector appointed under this Act must possess the qualifications requisite for an instructor in dairying, together with such further qualifications as the Minister may prescribe.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case I was going to ask the Oireachtas to exercise their sovereign powers by imposing conditions upon the Minister. We are giving the Minister power to impose almost any conditions he likes on the unfortunate people engaged in the industry.  I think that we should impose a definite condition on the Minister and on his Department to see that the inspectors who are appointed are experts in the business.  I anticipate that if that were done that you might succeed in introducing not only a factor of sympathy but a factor of economy into the work of the inspectors.  I am sure the Minister will say that that is the intention, but I should have liked to have that made perfectly clear here by the statute, that the inspectors who are to carry out the multifarious duties prescribed under the Act shall not only be thoroughly acquainted with the business but shall be technically qualified to show how things, if necessary, should be done.  If that is done people will not be able to say &ldquo;we do not want Government interference by busybodies who know nothing.&rdquo;  I am not tied to the words of my amendment because I do not know what are the qualifications of an instructor in dairying.  If the Minister would accept the spirit of the amendment I would not cavil about the wording of it.  We all know that instructors appointed <Col N="1171" /> by county committees of agriculture have to possess certain qualifications.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment which stands in my name.  In Section 45, sub-section (1) to delete, in line 55, the word &ldquo;consultative&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;dairy produce.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This seems to be a very small matter <Col N="1172" /> but really it goes much deeper than one might think.  The Commission of Inquiry which reported on this subject was given very ample powers.  This Bill embodies many of the recommendations which were made by that Commission. This recommendation, however, was not made by the Commission. It is called the consultative committee. It has no power whatever; it is merely a consultative committee according to the Bill, and I agree for the moment it could not be very much more.  The powers that were suggested for that commission were very extensive.  I think we recognised at the time and certainly recognise now that they could not be handed over all the powers that were then suggested.  I think that making the commission a consultative committee stamps it for that purpose alone.  I would prefer that a little more liberty were given this body by calling it some other name in order that at some future time when things develop a little better in this country the commission should become something more than consultative.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest that the name be changed to &ldquo;Dairy Produce.&rdquo;  I do not know whether the Minister will go that far, so as to leave the matter open without stamping it always as a consultative committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My position is that you cannot leave this matter open. Either the committee is to be a consultative one or one with administrative functions.  We must make up our minds at this Stage whether it is to be one or the other.  You could not possibly draft an amendment which would confine the functions of the committee to consultation for the first two years, and then suddenly give them administrative functions.  If you give them, you can take them away.  You can do that as it is.  I dare say you could hand over certain administrative functions to this committee if you liked, but you certainly could not hand over the responsibility of the Department in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not proposing that.  I meant to leave it open for some future time, and not stamp it by <Col N="1173" /> name always as a consultative committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to that, I am saying that I do not know any form of words which would at the same time establish a consultative council and also establish an administrative council, even if those functions are not to come into operation until a later stage, and which could take over the responsibilities of the Department of Agriculture either in big or small things.  Let us consider what is the position at present. If it is changed afterwards I am afraid it will have to be changed by legislation.  At the moment we could not have anything except a consultative council, and I do not see any prospect of it in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We could not have an administrative council.  We could not either surrender our responsibilities or our rights in this matter to any outside body.  My answer to the second question is, that if later on it does seem necessary to give certain administrative powers, vis a vis the Department, to the Council, I take it the only proper way to do that will be by legislation. It would be a serious step, and it would need legislation and consideration by everybody.  It would raise a very important issue.</P>

      <P>Section 45, sub-section (3).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;but the meetings shall be held not less frequently than once in each quarter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the same matter.  I do not like this consultative committee to be merely a nominal body which will only turn up when the Minister chooses to call it&mdash;perhaps never.  I should like to see the committee brought together at least once a quarter&mdash;at all events at some specified time, so as to ensure that it is being set up for real practical purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was the intention of the Department to make this Committee a useless body it could be done <Col N="1174" /> in spite of anything you can insert in the Bill.  The particular safeguard which the Senator wishes to introduce would be quite useless for that purpose. When I say it could be done I am hardly correct.  It would be more correct to put it in another way.  No amount of safeguards in the Bill itself will make this consultative committee a real body.  It is circumstances outside the Bill that will ensure that the consultative committee shall be a really live body.  Senator Dowdall put his finger on the real point.  This Bill contains such wide powers that unless they are administered with the co-operation of the trade it will fail.  There is no doubt that the trade could wreck this Bill.  Everyone sees that it is essential we should have the co-operation of the trade.  If we have not that co-operation the Bill is going to fail, and that means a very big discussion in the Dáil, in the Press, and all over the country about this question.  It will be in that atmosphere this council will be operating.  If the Bill is failing because of some contention, say, between the Department and the creamery managers or farmers on a point that could be put to the council, the question will be asked: why is it not put to it?  The fact is, it would be impossible for any Minister, having set up the council, to fail to call it together. I put it to the Senator that these are real safeguards.  The council might come together three times a week for six weeks to deal with regulations, and then perhaps might not be called together for four months.</P>
