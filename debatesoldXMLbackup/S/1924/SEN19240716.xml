      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Immediately before Section 5 to insert a new section 5 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any ratepayer in a county may, during the hours that the office of the county council is open, on payment of a fee of one shilling, inspect any books or returns of the county council, showing the rates which have been paid in the county.</P>
      <P>It often happens in a county that there is a large amount of unpaid rates, and I think it is only reasonable that any ratepayer, especially a ratepayer who had paid his rates, should have an opportunity of knowing who has or who has not paid his rates.</P>

      <P>I beg to support the motion.  From my experience of local administration I think that if you could get lists of defaulters published it would be a very good thing.  I remember I was very anxious for the proper administration of asylums, and I had a list prepared in the case of a particular asylum of the people who had allowed their friends to be detained at the public expense; but when it came to a question of publishing the list the committee, who had a number of their own friends in the asylum, refused to have the list published.  If you could go further even than this amendment and publish the list of defaulting ratepayers it would be a great thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the remarks made by Senator Brown.  It would be hardly fair that a ratepayer who has not paid his rates should take up the time of the officers of the county council examining the books and so forth in order to see who has paid his rates.  In recent times there was a disposition on the part of some people to say that they will meet their financial responsibilities if other people meet theirs; and in order to see how many people are meeting their responsibilities and in order to enable him to decide as to whether he would or would not pay his rates a man may sport a shilling to have a look at the books. I hardly think that we should facilitate him in that way.  I certainly would support the amendment if words were inserted to the effect that the right should be confined to the ratepayer who has paid his rates.  But I do not think that the right should be extended indiscriminately to people who have not paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is right to limit the right for another reason.  I hope nothing of the kind is likely to occur, and I am not going to make prophecies, but a no-rate agitation may possibly arise, and if it did it is possible that a clause of this kind, unless properly safeguarded, might play into the hands of agitators of this kind at some future time.  I think that should be guarded against.</P>

      <P>There is one further reason which would make this amendment advisable.  In the case of an agricultural show an exhibitor may put down his valuation incorrectly, that is to say, he may put down his valuation as the valuation of one of his farms only, and thereby obtain access to a class which is confined say to farmers of another valuation.  That is a difficulty we very often meet with.  I speak as a member of the committee of an agricultural show when I say that in the case of a farmer who has entered in virtue of having only one particular farm within the qualification for that particular class it is very often difficult to ascertain whether such an exhibitor has more than one farm in the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that as the law stands I think any ratepayer at present may inspect the rate-books without paying a fee. Twenty-one days, I think, before the date of the audit is the usual time.  The period may be changed.  While I have no objection, and there does not appear to be any objection, on the merits, to confining the right to ratepayers who have paid their rates or to inserting the words &ldquo;on payment of a fee,&rdquo; at the same time will that be taken as repealing the law under which any ratepayer may, during a certain time, inspect the books without payment of a fee, and whether he has paid his rates or not?  This particular amendment merely extends the time.  Instead of giving the ratepayers the right of inspecting the rate-books at certain times prescribed, under this amendment any ratepayer may go in at any time.  I am told by the Local Government Department that as things stand very few ratepayers ever exercise their right in the matter.  I do not think that Senators need be afraid that any ratepayers will take advantage of this clause.  The real value of this clause is the  it gives to the fact that well-off people who are not paying their rates may be caught out by their neighbours who are.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>But even as it stands would it not be inconsistent with an existing provision which gives unlimited power to any ratepayer, as I understand you?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>So then, surely, it is wrongly drafted.  I am not aware of its existence, but if there is an existing provision which enables any ratepayer without payment of a fee to inspect these books, then this would be inconsistent with that provision, and you are repealing an existing provision and substituting this in its place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggestion is that the amendment should read like this: &ldquo;Any ratepayer may in a county during the hours that the office of the county council is open inspect any books or returns of the county council showing the rates which have been paid in the county.&rdquo;  I am leaving out the words &ldquo;on payment of a fee of one shilling.&rdquo;  You will then be extending the existing rights of ratepayers.  You will be allowing them to inspect the books at any time instead of during the 21 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Might that not become a very serious abuse?  Supposing there was an agitation in a particular county against paying rates, half a dozen men could go in and take possession of the whole office for the whole day and say they were searching the rate-books.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all certain that the county council have these things.  When the warrant is issued to the rate collector he is responsible for the lodgment of the total amount of his warrant.  I do not think that the county council have any individual record of what rates have been collected.  They look to the rate collector to discharge his warrant.  I do not know that you would find anything in the county council office.  If you go to the rate collector you may get the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>The county council gets a return from the bank which is the treasurer, I think every seven days, and the collector is bound to send in returns at the end of the week of what he has collected.  I do not think the difficulty suggested by Senator Sir John Keane will occur, so I am not sure that the Minister is not right as to the right of a ratepayer to inspect books during a certain period.  I think it is confined to 21 days after or before a certain date.  If he would allow me to look into this before report, then if the matter is raised on report I think we might make some useful amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the present amendment should not be inserted without further consideration, but some provision of the kind is desirable if it could be dove-tailed in with the existing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If you ask me my opinion, I am quite clear, and Senator Brown, who knows the law very much better, is of the same opinion, that there is a provision at present under which any ratepayer has the right to inspect the books for a given period.  All this amendment does, if you take out the words &ldquo;on payment of a fee of one shilling,&rdquo; is that it extends that time. I do not anticipate any dangers from inspection of the books, or any danger of people taking possession of the county offices.  I believe, on the contrary, the more publicity the better, and the more people who inspect the books the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the object of the Senator who moved the amendment, if I understand it, was to <Col N="836" /> put some restraint on these powers, to give the power, but at the same time to make them pay something for it, so that mere idle curiosity would not prompt them to go and inspect the books, and that if a man wants to see the books he should pay a shilling for the privilege of doing so.  I think that was the object of the Senator.  I may be quite wrong, but I do not think the object was to extend the existing facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardButler" hpid="Mr. BUTLER Mr. BUTLER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BUTLER</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to extend the existing facilities, and the time, but the reason I put in the payment of one shilling was to prevent anyone coming to the offices out of mere curiosity, and wasting the time of the officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BUTLER</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

      <P>&ldquo;Any ratepayer in a county may during the hours that the office of the county council is open inspect any books or returns of the county council showing the rates which have been paid in the county.&rdquo;  That, as I understand, would effect a change in the existing law. The existing law limits the power of the ratepayer to a certain period, and if that power is to be enlarged by this amendment there should be some re-reference saying &ldquo;notwithstanding anything in any previous Act&rdquo; to show that this is an amendment of the existing law, otherwise the two clauses will come up, and the court will say: &ldquo;We do not know which is the law; you have two provisions dealing with the subject and they do not agree; which is in force?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator and the Minister would be well advised to accept the offer of Senator Brown to try and re-draft something for the Report Stage.  We will not be the worse but we may be a great deal the better.  I doubt very much if the <Col N="837" /> words are quite clear.  I do not know whether &ldquo;any ratepayers&rdquo; means every ratepayer in the county whether he is paying rates or not in the county.  It might mean any ratepayer in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you pass from this, without moving any amendment, might I call the attention of the Minister to the word &ldquo;merits&rdquo; in line 5. The clause reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where, before trial, or at any stage of a trial, it appears to the court that the indictment is defective, the court shall make such order for the amendment of the indictment as the court thinks necessary to meet the circumstances of the case, unless, having regard to the merits of the case, the required amendments cannot be made without injustice.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the word &ldquo;merits&rdquo; is liable to misinterpretation or misapprehension, and I think the word &ldquo;facts&rdquo; would be better than the word <Col N="838" />&ldquo;merits&rdquo; there.  &ldquo;Merits&rdquo; is one of those curious words that means nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the difficulty as to both of these words this, that neither the facts nor the merits at that stage be before the court at all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point I want to raise in connection with Clause 13, and that is as to the condition of the bond or recognizance that is given by a person who gets bail. This recognizance is intended, apparently, to apply to a person who gets bail in the District Court in a case which is not intended to go beyond the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The condition of the within-written <Col N="839" /> recognisance is such, that whereas the said A. B. was this day charged before me, the Justice within mentioned for that (etc., as in the warrant); if, therefore, the said A. B. will appear at the next sitting of the District Court (or of the Circuit Court, or of the High Court, or of the Central Criminal Court, as the case may be) to be holden in and for the district (or as the case may be) and there surrender himself into the custody of the keeper of the (common gaol) there, and plead to such indictment.</P>
    <P>That only applies to an indictment where the case is tried in the Circuit Court, the Central Criminal Court, or the High Court.  I suggest that after the word &ldquo;indictment&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or complaint&rdquo; should be added.  It would then apply to persons who obtain bail in respect of a charge never intended to go beyond the District Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

      <P>With reference to Clause 5, I would like to ask the Minister if the words &ldquo;criminal proceedings&rdquo; include prosecutions under the Licensing Acts.  Sub-clause 1 (f) says: &ldquo;a person charged and called as witness in pursuance of this Act.&rdquo;  He is not obliged, if he is asked, and if asked he shall not be required to answer any question as to whether he has been <Col N="842" /> convicted or charged with any offence other than that with which he is then charged.  It is to prevent evidence of that character of previous convictions given against him.  Clause 5 says: &ldquo;This Act shall apply to criminal proceedings, etc.&rdquo;  Under the Licensing Acts there are what are really criminal proceedings.  A licensed person, when charged with an offence, is liable to a fine of up to, I think, £20, and liable to imprisonment in default of payment.  Is it intended that this Act shall apply to proceedings under any prosecution under the Licensing Acts?</P>
      <P>It seems to me rather unfair that a licensed person who is a publican and who is not supposed to be a greater sinner than anyone else, in going into the witness box, could be asked whether he was not convicted of some offence under the Licensing Acts within the last six months.  I do not think that is fair to the publican, and I think criminal proceedings ought to include prosecutions under the Licensing Acts. I suggest to the Minister that he might introduce another sub-section which would read like this: &ldquo;Section 1 (f) of this Act shall apply to a person charged and called under the Licensing Acts, 1833 to 1900, or any amending Acts.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to bring in cases that have been decided by the courts previous to the 11th June, 1924.  I know at least of one case that was decided before that date, where all the justice was on the side of the person against whom the judgment was given, but the judge was afraid to give that decision as he was working at the time under the British law.  I do not know what attitude the Minister may take on the matter, but it would be very desirable that this amendment would be carried, or, at least, such a date fixed that it would be considerably prior to the 11th June, 1924.  It does not look just that a judgment given, say, on the 12th June, 1924, would be made null and void, whereas a judgment given before that would be allowed to stand.  Compensation is provided by a subsequent clause in the Bill, and this clause would not take effect unless the Minister certified that the proceedings in respect of which it took place were proceedings governed by sub-clauses (a) and (b) of Section 1 of the Bill, that is, that the matter was done by a person holding office under the first Dáil Eireann or the second Dáil Eireann or employed in any capacity whatever in any service, military or civil, established or maintained by the authority of the first Dáil Eireann or the second Dáil Eireann, or was done under the authority of any person so <Col N="845" /> holding office or so employed.  That will not come into effect unless the Minister certifies whether the matter was done to carry out those objects or not.  I hope the date will be amended, putting it back to the 21st January, 1919, which is the date in the Bill of the period to be covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would in effect reduce this section almost to an absurdity.  The actions that took place up to the 21st January, 1919, are negligible in number and in the amount for which decrees would have been obtained.  I explained on the last day that a number of actions are pending against persons who in some cases were acting under orders. Where there is a liability in respect of such cases, provision is made in the Bill for that liability to be discharged by the State.  But protection is required for individuals who so performed what they believed to be their duty acting under the orders of others. This amendment would practically reduce this section to an absurdity.  No guarantee, no security and no indemnity would be given in respect of the great number of actions that are pending where individuals have not benefited themselves.  These individuals are at present liable and would be liable if this Bill were not passed.  In the case of the British, in the indemnity which we gave we put down the date as the date of the passing of the Act, or, certainly, some date in January or February, 1923.  At that time quite a number of British military had left the country&mdash;in fact, all of them.  We gave that indemnity in very generous terms, and we could be criticised if we did not afford the same generous cover to persons who have just as much right as the British military, whom we indemnified under the Act of 1923.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter in connection with this Bill.  I take it that this £500,000 is only provision for a year or thereabouts.  I imagine that a capital expenditure of £500,000 will not be sufficient to provide an efficient telephone service here and that something like two or three million pounds will have to be spent in the next four or five years as capital expenditure.  I think I am correct in stating that the reason why we have continuous complaints as to the telephone service is not because of the inefficiency of the staff but owing to inefficient instruments in a very large number of exchanges.  I know that to be the case.  I think the circumstances are that the Exchanges belonged to a private company who for some time knew they were likely to be taken over by the Government and did the minimum amount of repairs and made practically no renewals.  They were taken over by a Government which, I think, had a kind of feeling that they were going to be taken over by another Government, and, therefore, did the minimum amount of repairs and renewals. The result has been that the Post Office has been faced with a really serious problem, and I am glad to see that steps are being taken to make provision for it.  A good deal of the information I ascertained in this matter arose out of evidence given at the Postal Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter which I would like to urge upon the Minister.  In view of the fact&mdash;I take it to be a fact&mdash;that further expenditure will be necessary, if not at an early date, at any rate during the next four or five years, a <i>bona fide</i> effort should be made to induce some leading firm, manufacturing telephone apparatus, to set up a factory here.  To my own knowledge a firm made a proposal that they were prepared to discuss the setting up of such a factory&mdash;I think it was a British firm&mdash;and that they were prepared, if they could get an agreement that <Col N="847" /> Government supplies would be taken from them for three years, to enter into a guarantee that charges made by them would not be greater than those which they were charging the British or any other Government they have contracts with.  There may be excellent reasons why nothing came of that proposal.  I am not here to say that there were not, but I suggest that if that was possible as regards one firm it might be possible with other firms, possibly from the Continent.  Steps should be taken to see if we could not make the fact that we will have considerable orders to give from the State during the next year or two sufficient reason to induce such a firm to come over here.  The difficulty in setting a factory of that kind up is that for a number of years the firm would have to face a loss.  When the State has orders of the magnitude which it obviously will have under this Bill alone, without any reference to the future, it ought to be possible to persuade some firm to set up a factory here or some Irish firm in alliance with some leading telephone firm of experience.  I do not ask the Minister to make a declaration on the subject, but simply throw out the suggestion so that it may be considered.</P>

      <P>I am interested in rural party lines which are very much used in other countries and provide a very cheap form of telephone facilities in agricultural districts.  A number of people use the one circuit. One can, of course, hear what other people are saying, but it is not usual in a well-conducted community to listen-in.  The system is used largely in Canada and other places.  I would like to know whether something of the kind could not be done here in order to provide telephone facilities.  One is not satisfied to feel that possibly the whole of this expenditure will be in urban districts, because telephone communication is a great necessity to farmers. We do not feel that the Government are doing all that they might to develop telephone communication in districts which are not now served, rather than improving the services in the more populous areas.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Senator Sir John Keane's suggestion. In Western America all the farm-houses are connected by telephone. The lines are put up along the road and quite small houses are connected. It is possible to speak to most houses in a district, and to the nearest town.  Something of that sort should be done here.  In view of the developments indicated, I would like to point out that there are parts of Ireland where there is no telephone service. There is a telephone service to Galway, but there is none in any part of Mayo. I do not see why western districts should be cut off from that service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to answer some of the questions put to me about this particular Bill, as I am taking the place of the Minister for Finance.  In this respect his duty is simply to provide capital for necessary extensions of the telephone service in the country.  The policy of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is not Government policy.  He is an Extern Minister, and it is his responsibility. It is not the responsibility of the Government.  With regard to this Bill, we are providing capital up to half a million.  The Bill is retrospective. Something like £64,500 was issued in respect of capital expenditure for 1922-1923.  The issue for 1923-1924 was £70,000.  These two sums of £134,500 will be covered by the half-million grant in this Bill.  There will still remain something like £360,000 available for capital extensions up to March 31st, 1926.  The Bill covers all that has been borrowed since we came into control of Government affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual sum of capital expenditure on telephone plant within the Saorstát up to the 31st March, 1923, amounts to £312,000.  The responsibility of the Minister for Finance is to provide the money.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs arranges that on the capital expenditure, granted there is a corresponding income guaranteed in respect of any extensions.  Developments through the country depend upon the number of subscribers in particular areas, which would secure that the payment of interest would be guaranteed by those persons.  We are <Col N="849" /> in much the same position in this matter as a municipality which has an electricity undertaking.  All the residents and ratepayers along a line of several miles will ask that the road be lighted by electric lamps.  In that case the municipality is limited in its expenditure on the cables and on the construction of the posts for lighting the district with electricity.  It is limited by the fact that any such capital expenditure must have a return from other sources.  In the same way any capital expenditure under this Bill must be justified by subscribers in various places.  If there is a desire for telephone connection, I do not think there is any limit to the amount of money that will be made available by the Government for that purpose.  The limitation is not there.  It depends entirely upon the number of subscribers in a particular district, so as to make it an economic proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the Minister stated, the position is that I have some personal experience. A certain number of people made an application for a telephone service and got back an intimation that the annual subscription would be £21. Of course, that was quite impossible. We got no figures to show how the £21 was calculated.  No doubt, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs included in that capital outlay what he considered was justifiable, but, naturally, that was not satisfactory to us. We did not know how the charge was made up.  There is nothing more elusive and tricky than capital expenditure. In this case it might involve, to an extent, a charge for trunk services on the area and an apportionment of the costs of the main trunk line.  Many technical questions would arise, but we were in the dark.  We were told that the annual subscription would be £21. In Canada people can enjoy the telephones for sums within their means. Certainly £21 a year would not be considered in that light.</P>

      <P>In connection with this Bill I intended to suggest that some method of going over the accounts and the Estimates, which would be better than the present one, should be established.  I do not know whether this is the proper time to say it, but I should like to have a Joint Finance Committee of both Houses, if possible. I am not sure that the Government would approve of that, and if it cannot be, there ought to be a Committee of the Seanad, at least, to go over the Estimates and accounts.  I brought before the President last week a case in which, as it appears to me&mdash;he may have some explanation of it&mdash;there has been a mistake in the Estimates of £2,900,000. That is a very large sum.  It is a very <Col N="852" /> considerable portion of our income, and it is stated, deliberately stated, that £2,900,000 was not in the accounts at all last year.  Although it was not, it is put into the accounts of this year as having been paid last year, and it is put into the accounts again as not being payable this year, and then in the third column in which the expenditures for last year and for this year are compared, it is claimed that £2,900,000 less is going to be paid this year than last year on account of these land annuities. Possibly, that is so.  Nobody would be more pleased than I if the President would tell us that it is so, but I am afraid from the inquiries I have made, that it is nothing of the sort.  Here is a claim put down, if I am right, that the Estimates have been reduced by £2,900,000, which is a pure fiction.</P>
      <P>It seems to me a very extraordinary thing that an estimate of that sort should be made up by the finance officials, passed by the Ministry, and not noticed by the Dáil, and that here in the Seanad a person who knows nothing at all about finance or accounts gets up to call attention to this which is palpable and is a most extraordinary thing.  I do not know whether there is a Finance Committee of the Dáil, but certainly if you had a Committee of the Seanad that would be seen at once, because there are people much more capable than I am of understanding accounts and they would call attention to such a matter as this.  I am not at all asserting that the Minister made a false claim of having reduced the Estimates by £2,900,000.  Probably he did not notice it.  It is not a case of omission, but it is a deliberate statement that that amount has been saved. That is the astonishing thing.  I would like to ask the President to consider the question of these annuities very seriously.  It is a very large sum of money paid by the Irish tenant purchasers. It came to pass at a time when there was one Parliament for England and Ireland, and Ireland was entitled to her share.  It is not an English business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill of 1920 came up in the English Parliament, as I understand&mdash;I may have been misinformed&mdash; the whole of these annuities were handed over to the Parliaments of <Col N="853" /> Northern and Southern Ireland.  At present the Northern Government is enjoying their share, but the Free State, on account of having refused the 1920 Act, did not apparently claim the annuities which, under that Act, would have been paid to us, and they proceed now to hand them over in bulk year after year to the Government of Great Britain.  We are penalised by this 1920 Act, and whatever anybody may say, whether we like it or do not like it, we are penalised by the division of the country, and if we are penalised by the division of the country in that way we ought, on the other hand, to claim whatever little advantages might have been got out of it.  If the English Government choose to force on us a thing we objected to, we, on the other hand, should say we claim that money. Not only can we claim it, but we actually collected it here and handed it over to them&mdash;a nice generous gift.  It would be rather a splendid thing if the Minister for Finance had £3,000,000 in his pockets.  How nicely he could balance his accounts.  How nicely he could rebuild the Four Courts.  How nicely he could set up the whole country if he had that, and we have nothing to do but just to keep these annuities until the country is re-united. Then some other arrangement might be made.  But meanwhile it seems to me a very right and just thing that we should keep this money, and I would ask the President to consider the matter carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter arising out of Senator Colonel Moore's remarks about which I would like to ask the President.  It is whether he can see his way to associate this House with the work of the Public Accounts Committee.  Of course we realise perfectly well that the Dáil is responsible for expenditure, but we have a certain status under the Constitution in connection with Finance by virtue of the power to recommend, and possibly some members of this House would be of service to the Government if they were allowed to sit, even perhaps without voting power, on the Public Accounts Committee, which is a very valuable Committee.  It is rather dull work, but it is exceedingly important, <Col N="854" /> and it is the one real opportunity of getting to the root of questions of public administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that this question of the £2,900,000 referred to by Senator Colonel Moore would come under review when the Estimates would be under consideration.  I understood the last day that Senator Colonel Moore was under the impression that we had lost this £2,900,000.  We have not lost that sum, nor have we, according to what I heard from him to-day, entered into possession of it.  Our responsibility in connection with these annuities is that of an agent.  The British Government have issued securities to the extent of, I think, £130,000,000, and this £2,900,000 is the amount of the Land Commission annuities, that is, the interest and principal on that amount, which would clear it at the end of a certain date.  I understand under the 1920 Act there was a provision which handed over this £2,900,000 to what was called the Parliament of Southern Ireland, but it was not a free gift to this extent&mdash;that you did not enter into the possession of this money without entailing a corresponding liability.  My recollection of that liability was that it was somewhere about £10,000,000, so that it was a rather expensive gift.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The contribution under the Act of 1920 from all Ireland was £18,000,000; £8,000,000 from what is called the Parliament of Northern Ireland, and £10,000,000 from what was called the Parliament of Southern Ireland.  I should say it was rather a good bargain for the British Government to make if they were going to hand over three millions and get eighteen millions.  The Land Act of last year made certain provisions for the £2,900,000, or the annuities payable by the tenants, and it is owing to the provisions in that Act that this particular sum has altered its place in the Estimate.  I think I will be able to satisfy Senator Colonel Moore when we are discussing the Estimates as to that.  With regard to the point raised by Senator Sir John Keane, it is more a matter <Col N="855" /> for the Minister for Finance, and I would not be able to answer it right off.  I do not know that it would be in the power of the Executive Council, even if they desired to do it, to assent to Senator Sir John Keane's suggestion. My impression is, it would not.</P>

      <P>That was the object I had in putting this motion on the Order Paper.  I did think it was right that the Seanad should have an opportunity of considering this question fully and of coming to a clear and independent judgment.  Now, this question of the temporary accommodation of the Oireachtas is one that has been troubling us for a very long time.  The Report that we have to consider to-day, and which, I take it, is the final report of the Joint Committee, contains two solutions of the problem.  One of these solutions is recommended by the Committee to us for adoption, and the other is simply placed before us as the only alternative to the first one.  Now, the solution which the Committee recommends us to adopt, to put it shortly, is this, that we should remain where we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel very strongly that we ought not to adopt that solution except on certain conditions, and with very definite assurances.  I have often wondered what exactly was meant by the word &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; as used in this phrase, &ldquo;temporary accommodation of the Oireachtas.&rdquo; I have often wondered how temporary it is to be.  I have heard it suggested that it probably means a term of ten years.  In my opinion, if the Oireachtas have their home anywhere for ten years, they will have it there for twenty years, and very probably for a generation. Because in these times, where reconstruction is so important in this country, and will involve so much expense, it is almost certain that the choice and erection of a permanent home for the Oireachtas will not be made for another generation.  We are, therefore, dealing with this question <Col N="861" /> over the space of a generation.  Now, that being so, I also sometimes wonder whether we remember that we are merely guests where we are.  We have been practically invited to come here and made welcome here, and we are really only guests.  I also wonder if we do not sometimes forget the injury which we are doing to our hosts and the injury that we are doing to the country by remaining here.</P>
    <P>Nothing but a real national necessity would justify our remaining here.  I am satisfied however that for the present, at least, the national necessity does exist.  But I am also satisfied that we ought not to remain here for one moment longer than we can help. The Committee report that the only alternative to Leinster House is the Castle.  In that I am also satisfied that they are absolutely right. It is not only the only alternative to Leinster House, but it is in my opinion a more suitable House for the Oireachtas than Leinster House.  But great as is the injury which we are doing by staying in Leinster House, the injury which we would do by going to the Castle before adequate accommodation is provided for the Law Courts would be greater still.  The administration of law in any country is quite as important as the making of it.  In this country at the present time, I have no hesitation in saying, the due administration of the law is more important than the making of it.  For some years past, for reasons which it is not necessary to mention, the administration of the law in this country has not been held in respect by the majority of the people and therefore it was not successful.</P>
    <P>If the future of this country is to be made secure, due respect for the administration of the law must obtain and it cannot be regained and it cannot obtain in this country unless there is due accommodation in the capital city for the Courts of Justice.  It has been suggested that if the Oireachtas were to go to the Castle that, during the rebuilding of the Four Courts, the Courts of Justice might find accommodation in the King's Inns.  We did occupy the King's Inns for something like 12 months.  It was most important <Col N="862" /> at the time that the administration of justice should at least appear to be carried on.  We did keep the Courts open but that is really all we did.  We were not more than just able to carry on and if anything like the quantity of business had to be done then that there is to do now it would have been physically impossible for it to have been done at the King's Inns. Even if you erect a couple of temporary courts in the garden there&mdash;and three or four courts would probably be an absolute necessity&mdash;you still have no office accommodation.  In the King's Inns for twelve months the offices were each represented by a small table in the Great Hall.  The clerks sat round the table, the public came in there and there was no place to keep documents or to keep registers.  It was a perfect mart and it is greatly to the credit of the officials that the business in the King's Inns was carried on with as great success as it was.  But it could not have been carried out if the volume of business had been anything like what it is now.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why we could not go back to the King's Inns. We have started a new system of judiciary, and I am happy and proud to say that it is going to be a success.  At no time for many years was there such a boom in business.  It is as if it came to welcome the new courts.  Let me remind my fellow-Senators that the prosperity of the country is closely tied up with the prosperity of my profession. If the profession is prosperous, it is a sign that the country is prosperous, and my profession is never prosperous when the country is really unhappy.  Therefore, they are bound together, and I am happy to say that we have started these new courts with a volume of business that, in fact, we had nothing like since before the war. The Castle is not a very suitable home for the Courts of Justice, though it is a great deal better than the King's Inns.  There is ample space there in a way, but it is not a very suitable home for the courts.  It would be a much more suitable home for the Oireachtas.  But if you turn us out before you provide us with adequate accommodation, then you will be doing, in my opinion, an irreparable <Col N="863" /> injury to the country.  The true solution of the difficulty is, in my view, quite obvious.  The true solution is that the rebuilding of the Four Courts should be undertaken at once, and should be carried out as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As soon as the Four Courts are rebuilt, the courts will leave the Castle and the Oireachtas will go to the Castle.  It might be suggested, or it might be objected, that it would take a long time and cost a lot of money to rebuild the Four Courts.  I understand that a certain rough estimate has been made of the time it would take to rebuild the Four Courts and the probable cost of rebuilding.  That cannot be very accurate.  It must be taken to be rough.  But if I am rightly informed, the rebuilding can be done within two years, and I think I am putting the cost higher than it has been estimated at, when I say it could be done for a quarter of a million of money.  A quarter of a million of money is more than you would spend, perhaps, if you turned us out of the Four Courts and had to put up temporary accommodation for us, or if you had to put up temporary accommodation for the Oireachtas here, if they were going to stay as long as ten years or twenty years in these buildings.</P>
    <P>Remember that every penny that is spent on the Four Courts is money spent on permanent reconstruction; it is money spent on a building which will remain, whereas the money you spend, if you turn us out or if you have to build us temporary accommodation elsewhere, is largely waste money. Therefore, the time is not very long, the money is not very large, and it will be well spent money.  May I call attention to the terms of the resolution which I am moving.  With the first proviso in it, I have already dealt, namely, that the Four Courts should be rebuilt as soon as possible.  The second proviso is almost, if not quite as important, as the first.  If we are to stay here for even a couple of years, this building and its contents must be made safe.  In the first place, this room in which we have sat in discomfort for a considerable time, should be vacated, and given back to the <Col N="864" /> Museum, and the Museum, including this room, should be given back to the public for their use.  That will help the safety of the Museum and its contents, but it will not make the safety quite sure.  We have been told that precautions have been taken which have made the safety of this building and its contents secure, or at least will make them secure when they are completed. I am not satisfied that the safety of these buildings has been, or will be, secured.  The ordinary fireproof doors are all very well in their way, but the safety of the Museum and its contents will not be ensured until the refreshment room, which is lined with wood, and the other wooden buildings, sheds, etc., so many of which are near this building, are removed. There should be no difficulty in putting up a building in Leinster Lawn at very small expense.  It will not be an eyesore for more than a very short time.  Some suitable building for a refreshment room, if it is required, and cannot be got in Leinster House, could be put up there.  All that is perfectly possible, and it will be a very small price to pay for the real safety of the Museum and its contents.  I beg to move the resolution which I have already read.</P>

      <P>I thought I explained that.  On the previous occasion, about three weeks ago, there was a formal motion that the Report <Col N="865" /> be adopted.  That was moved and seconded, and then, on the suggestion of Senator Mrs. Stopford Green and other Senators, it was agreed that the further consideration of that motion should be postponed for not less than a fortnight to enable Senators and others to see the reports as to the precautions against fire.  Accordingly, that accounts for the adjournment.  These reports have been seen, and now the matter comes up again.  The motion before the Seanad is the adoption of the Report.  Senator Brown has moved what is, in substance and in fact, an amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish very warmly to second the amendment which has been moved to the Report. In doing so I wish, first of all, to say expressly that I have no desire to criticise or to blame the Government for anything that has been done up to now.  They have had to deal with circumstances of very great difficulty, and they did so in a very pronounced manner and with a degree of courage which has won all our respect.  Therefore, it is not in any hostile spirit that I desire to say a few words now.  In the first place, circumstances have greatly changed since we first occupied these buildings, but we have to take regard of the new circumstances, and must consider the future.  We who have been occupying these buildings at our ease&mdash;Senators may think I am romancing when I speak of ease, and when we can neither sit, listen, nor speak with any ease&mdash;are responsible to the people who sent us here for the complete safeguarding of their treasures. That responsibility has been brought home to me very acutely by the petition which I sent out lately as a private person and without any backing whatever.  The response to that petition was rapid and pretty widespread. Besides, the signatories to it, I had many letters, some of them expressing warm gratitude at the opportunity of being able to show their interest and their concern as to the present <Col N="866" /> conditions; others spoke of the loans or gifts which they had proposed to give, but which they thought unwise to offer under the present conditions, and others asked for my advice as to the safest place in which to deposit historical manuscripts.</P>
      <P>The whole tenor of the correspondence showed me that there is a very widespread interest and a very important interest throughout the country which has, so far, been practically and necessarily silent.  It is our business to consider that interest and to consult it if we want to make a truly united Ireland.  I am sure that many Senators besides myself have felt a deep personal humiliation at sitting down here, and sitting down rather heavily, upon the whole of the cultural institutions of Ireland&mdash;the National Library, the National Gallery, the Dublin Society, the College of Science, and the Academy, as well as the Museum here, of which very few Senators would venture to give any estimate of the extraordinary value of its treasures, not only their historical value, but their value in money as well, which cannot be reckoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We say the fate of these various institutions is very serious.  Some are slowly recovering, some cannot revive at all, some are somewhat stagnant.  I suppose that no one here would wish to bring into this building any citizen from an educated and civilised country to see the condition to which we have been brought.  Take an example. There is now an illustrious judge looking over our boundary.  If he comes to Dublin can we picture the scene of our Education Minister who is responsible for the greater part of this place, endeavouring to convoy him throughout the building, and show him for his admiration our little particular partition boundary&mdash;the boundary we have established through the solid bar we have fixed up between the outlawed and deserted home of Science and Arts and the demesne of our legislators.  I fancy that visitation will not be made, and I think it ought not to be possible in this country for such a thing even to be suggested.  I suppose there will be very few sorrowful faces&mdash;when we come out, some day, from under the shadow of the monument which grips <Col N="867" /> the ground so firmly in the front, and blocks the way to our humbler quarters, and obscures the front of one of our old historic houses.</P>
    <P>Now, I think we have come to a new departure.  It is our business here, I believe, to attempt to check the apathy, disillusionment and disheartenment we see all round us in the country.  If it continues it will be not wholly the blame of the people, but the condemnation for it will fall upon our heads.</P>
    <P>Then, look at the artists' fate.  They are shut out from the treasures that they might study here.  Their fate is deplorable.  There are now in Dublin artists who could emulate the triumphant artistry of the Irish people. What fate have they?  Their lot is tragic.  No help comes to them except from America.  We are losing by our callousness and indifference to that side of life, in the midst of politics, assets to the nation which would be of incalculable value in its honour and in its credit.  We here ought to leave no shadow of doubt in the minds of the people of the country that we are determined to guard their treasures that we venerate them as much as the humblest man or woman in Connemara and that we venerate the things of the past and that we are determined to preserve them for the people.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to speak now about the means of preservation.  Over four months ago I began to ask about the protection that was afforded here, and whether it was adequate protection for our treasures.  There have been various explanations since; every one of them absolutely discount the intelligence of this House, but however that may be, we have to work with the limited gifts that God gave us.  But this subject will come up later and will be dealt with more ably than I can deal with it.  What I say now is, politics will never unite this country; they never did and they never will.  There is a nobler and a mysterious influence which is a bond in this country, and that is what Burke described once when he spoke of his devotion to Ireland and said, &ldquo;It is that deeper instinct which I cannot reconcile or <Col N="868" /> subdue to reason.&rdquo; It is that deeper instinct that we can have for the things which would make this country live that will unite this country and make everyone in this land, of whatever rank or race or faith, feel the influence of that deeper instinct which is our life.  I beg to second the resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. BAGWELL Mr. BAGWELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard what has been said by the two Senators who have spoken, with the greatest interest, and I am very much impressed by it. I wish to speak in favour of this resolution. There are several different ways in which the difficulty could be met, but I think this is far the best one.  It would, I think, quite satisfactorily house the two legislative chambers in this Free State.  That is the first point.  It would restore to the Royal Dublin Society their property, and that Society deserves well of the inhabitants of this country.  I suppose there is hardly an instance that you will find in the world where a society&mdash;practically a society of private individuals&mdash;has done so much for the material welfare of the country as the Royal Dublin Society. It is most desirable that they should be able to continue that good work.  The Society is one of the country's most valuable assets, and continues to be, and it should not be hampered in any way.  The restoration of the treasures which are to be found in the Museum and the Picture Gallery, which have a very great educative value, is very desirable.  Their loss and use to the public at present is really a great national disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rebuilding of the Four Courts would give a great deal of employment in Dublin which, perhaps, more than any other place in Ireland has suffered from unemployment.  All these objects could be achieved by other methods no doubt, than by going to the Castle and by the Four Courts being rebuilt and rendered available for the housing of the Judiciary, but the proposal which Senator Brown has so strongly recommended has two advantages which, I think, no other scheme would have.  It would more suitably house the Judiciary than they could be housed in any other way, and although I am not an <Col N="869" /> authority upon that subject, for I know very little of the inside of Law Courts, I have been told that a very great authority upon that subject who was in Dublin some years ago, said that he never knew&mdash;and he had travelled in every civilised country in the world&mdash; and never saw Law Courts so well arranged as the Four Courts, and that he considered them an absolute model of what a building of that kind ought to be.</P>
    <P>Now, another thing is that this proposal would remove a very great stigma from the Capital of the Free State, and that stigma is the ruins which have been made by the inhabitants of the State.  If the ruins were made by an outside enemy, that stigma would not be a stigma to the same extent.  Any stranger coming to this city here, however well disposed he may be to this Free State, and however much sentimental attachment he may feel to it, must feel discouraged on seeing these ruins in our midst.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of scorn that this city should possess such things in its midst. It would remove one of these things from our midst.  I think it would restore in that particular direction national self-respect to a very great extent. I cannot help thinking that to a great many people the fact that we have these ruins is a steady discouragement on the mind, and makes us feel less proud of the country to which we belong.  If we saw the Four Courts rebuilt, I think it would be a very happy augury for the restoration of a better state of affairs, and I hope that this House will accept the proposal as being the best course for finding accommodation for the Seanad as well as for the Law Courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say a word or two in confirmation of what has been said by those who have preceded me.  Since I first came to Dublin in my youth and went round the city, I have always been proud of the beautiful buildings in the capital of my country, and I felt great humiliation when I saw them destroyed.  I saw the Post Office destroyed by a foreign enemy, and the Custom House and Four Courts, not by foreigners.  I remember the time when it was suggested that notices be put up on certain <Col N="870" /> places that were destroyed, stating who destroyed them; but now I regret to say that I no longer wish to see them put up.  Let us do our best to restore these ancient monuments, so that we and our children can again have that respect which we formerly had for our country.  From an economic point of view, I feel it is a terrible loss to the College of Science to be taken over.  I do not understand, and I do not pretend to understand, these proposals about the College of Science, but I think that as soon as possible it should be put back to what it was originally meant for.  So long as we remain here, we impede everything in the nature of progress.  We impede the culture and science of the country, and we ought to get away from here as soon as we can.  I am entirely in favour of what has been said.  There has been talk of the cost of rebuilding the Four Courts, but I have heard rumours that there are certain people who in consideration of certain buildings which may not be wanted for the country being handed over to them would be prepared to rebuild the Four Courts without expense to the country. I do not know how far these things are true, but I believe there is some truth in them.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it would be convenient if I were to give the House some estimates made by the Board of Works, which have been placed at my disposal by the President. Perhaps I had better read them for what they are worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scheme No. 1.&mdash;To move the Seanad to Leinster House and to move the Royal Dublin Society elsewhere.&mdash;Estimated cost of moving the Seanad to Leinster House, £4,000.  Estimated cost of moving the Dublin Society to 64 and 65 Merrion Square, altering and fitting up those houses, building a bookstore in the back gardens, and hiring other houses for the Technical Instruction Branch at present in Nos. 64 and 65, say, £9,000.  (This proposal is the only one for housing the Dublin Society which occurs to me as immediately practicable; of course, I do not know what the Dublin Society would say to it.) <Col N="871" /> Scheme No. 2.&mdash;Move Oireachtas to the Castle, move the Law Courts elsewhere.&mdash;Estimated cost of moving Oireachtas to the Castle, £10,000 to £15,000 (according to the amount of reconstruction asked for).</P>
    <P>I do not like to say anything in view of this statement from an expert like Sir Philip Hanson, but I should be greatly surprised if it would involve such an amount as that.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Further, the Stamping Department would probably have to be moved elsewhere&mdash;cost say £4,000 additional. Total, £14,000 to £19,000. Estimated cost for rebuilding the Four Courts and setting up the Law Courts there, £180,000 to £200,000. (This seems to me the only satisfactory way of housing the Law Courts if they leave the Castle, the Royal Hospital, which is fairly well suited for the Oireachtas, is very ill-suited for Law Courts, because the two great halls are too big for courts, and no other room is big enough).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that the Seanad should have these figures to assist them in the discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I see nothing inconsistent in the amendment or any reason why it should not be carried, with the Report itself, because it proposes to adopt the Report with a certain reservation which, I think, will be fairly unanimously agreed to, particularly in view of the figures which you, sir, have read out.  It is, indeed, very gratifying to know that the estimated cost of rebuilding the Four Courts does not exceed £200,000.  If that is the cost, and we must take it that it is, there seems to me no good reason why the rebuilding of the Four Courts should not be undertaken without delay.  What is termed &ldquo;Scheme 1,&rdquo; involving the removal of the Seanad to Leinster House and temporary accommodation being secured for the Royal Dublin Society, also commends itself because of the fact that it is the cheapest of all schemes, and it does not involve a great deal of building of a temporary character.  I think it will be agreed by anybody who visits this Chamber that the sooner we get out of it the better.  It was, I think, originally constructed for the <Col N="872" /> preservation of mummies or the housing of antique furniture, and certainly its atmosphere is more conducive to the development of antiquities than to develop progressive ideas.  I do not know if that accounts for some of the decisions we have taken from time to time, but even the enlightened policy of the Labour Party is inclined to suffer owing to the mustiness of the atmosphere here.</P>
      <P>I think that a theatre such as the place where the other House is accommodated would be preferable to the place we are in now.  Its ventilation arrangements leave you the option of suffocation or, on the other hand, of pneumonia.  There is a danger too that if this continues the legislature itself will be brought into contempt owing to the miserableness of its surroundings.  There is something in the way a legislature is housed.  In a building of fine architecture and good surroundings the meanest minds are inspired. While, on the contrary, surroundings like those in which we are, tend to depression and demoralisation and certainly have an unfavourable effect on the minds of visitors who come here, and see the miserable place where the laws of the country are enacted.  There is, also, the danger of bringing the law courts into contempt if they are in uncongenial surroundings. We all agree with Senator Brown when he objects to the Law Courts being sent back to the Kings' Inn owing to the lack of accommodation there.  The three great buildings of Dublin, the G.P.O., the Customs House, and the Four Courts have been destroyed in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Four Courts is indispensable and to practically the same extent, the other two buildings are indispensable too.  It seems to me extraordinary that the Government seem to have made up their mind that the rebuilding of those institutions is not contemplated in the immediate future.  We have heard it said that the pressure on the skilled trades for building houses is so great it would not be fair to start the building of those other institutions.  It is a well known fact that skilled tradesmen are idle in various parts of the country and many of them have to emigrate at certain periods in order to get work. <Col N="873" /> I do not think that that is a reasonable excuse why the building of one of those institutions, at least, could not be started.  Is there any reason why the permanent home of the Oireachtas should not be a matter for immediate consideration?  I think it is a vote of want of confidence in the stability of the State to suggest that a permanent suitable home for the Oireachtas should not be a matter for consideration now in the immediate future.  After all, it cannot be such a tremendous expense. I think, even if it is a fairly substantial matter in the way of finance, it would be a good investment if it were only for a gesture of the confidence of the people in the stability and prosperity of the State.  However, our immediate business is to get some kind of temporary home pending the provision of a permanent one, but I am not without hope that it would be still possible to avoid going to the Castle unless it were the intention that that should be the permanent home of the Oireachtas.  It should be in the region of possibility that when we change here, in the space of two years, or thereabouts, we will go into what will be the permanent home of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Like those who have spoken in this debate, I feel it my duty to express my appreciation of the generosity and hospitality of the Royal Dublin Society, and to express our regret at the great inconvenience and the considerable interference with their most useful functions which are entailed by our occupying their premises.  I am sure the Royal Dublin Society understand that we are here not altogether of our own free will, but owing to the circumstances and the misfortunes of the times, we have had practically nowhere else to go.  I am quite certain that every member of the Seanad would assure the Royal Dublin Society that not one of us would like to stay here one minute longer than we could help. We realise the obstruction we are causing to their work, and to the work of other public institutions, such, for instance, as the National Library, the College of Science, the School of Art, and, not least, the National Museum. <Col N="874" /> For all those acts we would not like to be guilty one second longer than we could help.  I am certain that the Seanad will be only too glad when its occupancy of those premises terminates. Senator Brown's resolution, which I am very glad to support, is governed by the blessed word &ldquo;temporary.&rdquo; We are now discussing means of finding a temporary home for the Oireachtas.  The Joint Committee that investigated this matter made a double-barrelled suggestion, and we are simply dotting the &ldquo;i's&rdquo; and crossing the &ldquo;t's&rdquo; when we vote for their recommendation.  We are voting for it as a temporary expedient.</P>
      <P>We are not in any way committing ourselves as to our future actions in whatever development this question may eventually take.  I do not think that we are committing ourselves even to Dublin Castle as the future permanent home of the Oireachtas.  For my part, I would like to say that Dublin Castle has no attraction for me now any more than it ever had.  I think the proper use for Dublin Castle would be to turn it into a picture gallery or a museum, or both.  That, I think, would be a useful purpose to devote Dublin Castle to.  With the proposal to rebuild the Four Courts, I am absolutely in accord.  It is a beautiful building and has housed our law courts for many years.  It has been specially built for this purpose, and as a specimen of architecture it is second to no similar building in the world.  I cordially agree with Senator Bagwell, who dwelt upon the advisability of rebuilding our ruins.</P>
      <P>I think the sooner this country makes up its mind to abolish those horrible records of a horrible time the better for the self-respect and public pride of the country.  With those remarks I cordially support Senator Brown's resolution.  We are not now discussing the permanent home of the Oireachtas, though I agree with Senator Farrell that the sooner we make up our minds on that matter the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These things cannot be done in a day, and I cannot agree with Senator Brown in his idea that it would take us at least a generation before we <Col N="875" /> could find a permanent home.  I think we could make up our minds on this subject within the next twelve months, and possibly we may have a more interesting discussion.  If the Chamber in Leinster House is a superior Chamber for making long speeches to this one, then I suppose it is better.  I am quite in agreement with this proposal.</P>

      <P>I also wish to speak in support of the amendment, and if I could I would influence the Government in connection with the decision arrived at.  We all sympathise with the Royal Dublin Society.  We came here as guests, and now we are evicting our hosts.  It would seem the Government had made up their minds, and there is no other alternative; but I would wish that we could use all our influence to induce the Government to remove us out of this building.  If the intention is to take over the whole of Leinster House, there must be rooms and departments there which could be converted to a Senate Chamber and refreshment rooms.  These last constitute the greatest danger to the Museum.  In that way the Museum could be cut off altogether from any other building, and would, perhaps, be as safe as before we entered into possession of these premises.  I do hope that before two years are passed we will see the Four Courts restored.  I would rather see that done and Dublin Castle pulled down, as you would have to do to turn it into a picture gallery.</P>

      <P>In reference to what Senator Jackson has said a very important proviso arises.  He puts it that it is assumed and taken for granted that if Leinster House is taken that accommodation is to be provided for the Seanad.  There has never been any undertaking on the part of the Government that that will be so, but throughout all the discussion and throughout all the debates, it seems to me that there is an honourable understanding to that effect.  And in that point of view those of us who have examined Leinster House, and the Committee who examined it in this very connection, came to the conclusion that there were two rooms there, either of which might be <Col N="876" /> suitable for the purposes of the Seanad.  One is a large room that is used for the sorting of books and the handing out of books.  The other is the room above it on the top floor.  I want to suggest, by way of caution, that a friend of mine, an undoubted expert in these matters, has put it to me that it would be very wise of the Seanad if they themselves would go and see these rooms, because his view, rightly or wrongly, is that neither room would be large enough for the purpose of the Seanad, and secondly, that there are no accommodation offices&mdash;either a room for the chairman or the staff.</P>
      <P>Then there is the difficulty arising about accommodating the Private Bill officials who, of course, would have to leave their present quarters.  He mentioned further a matter which is well worth investigation, and that is that he was very doubtful indeed as to the acoustic properties of these two rooms. He suggested to me that the Seanad should hold an informal meeting there next week.  It would be easily arranged with the courteous superintendent. It would be worth while for the Seanad to meet there in an informal way, and to see how far these chambers would be suitable, so far as acoustics are concerned.  Perhaps Senator O'Farrell could address us on that occasion, and then we would be able to judge.  I think these matters are worth bearing in mind, and it would be essential that a Committee of the Seanad should be appointed to look after our interests in the distribution of the new accommodation to be obtained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. YEATS</NameTxt>
      <P>My interest in this question is almost entirely confined to seeing to it that the contents of the Museum are safe.  I do not know whether the members of the Dáil or all the Senators realise that practically no Museum is insured, that the contents of Museums are so valuable that money cannot replace these articles. The National Gallery in London, the great museum in South Kensington, and the British Museum or the Irish Museum are not insured.  You must, therefore, see to the safety of the Museum in the way that you do not see to the safety of any ordinary building. <Col N="877" /> Furthermore, you cannot trust merely to your fire-extinguishing apparatus&mdash; though in museums that is generally of the most perfect kind&mdash;because the water hose may do as much injury as the fire to the Museum.  There is only one thing that you can do with the Museum, and that is to see to it that no fire can break out in it.  Certain precautions are taken all over the world.  In no museum in the world is smoking permitted.  Now, here we have a refreshment room where there is cooking.  In museums where there is a refreshment room they are specially constructed on concrete floors, so that fire cannot break out.  Furthermore, all these museums of any importance are detached buildings.  About twenty years ago it was discovered that the National Gallery in London had an inflammable building up against it.  There was great agitation in England, and there was great indignation, and that building was pulled down.  In the Bodleian Library, which I know very well&mdash;I used it for several years&mdash;artificial light is not permitted, because it is an old inflammable building, though not more inflammable than our building. These are the ordinary precautions taken all over the world for the protection of national treasures.  Are we going to be less civilised than any other country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some few weeks ago the various persons whose business it was to look after these treasures memorialised the Government in various forms.  The Royal Irish Academy laid weighty evidence before the Government to show that the national treasures were not safe.  The Visitors to the Museum, who are persons appointed under Act of Parliament to take care of the treasures there, laid a memorial before the Government, showing that the national treasures were not safe.  A petition was laid before the Government signed by bishops, peers, representatives of all the learned institutions of Ireland, and some twenty Senators of this House, stating that the national treasures were not safe.  The answer to that was the statement by the Government that they were safe.  Then, some three weeks ago we postponed the report of the Special Committee that we might see the technical evidence <Col N="878" /> upon which the Government had stated that the national treasures were safe.  I have here on the Table, where it should have been laid by the Government, the report of the technical advisers.  It was sent to the Clerk of this House that members might see it. I will read you one extract from the letter written on the 22nd June by the Board of Works to the President's Secretary:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We beg to report that the danger of fire to the National Museum is undoubtedly increased by the fact that the Seanad and its officials are housed there, and that Senators and officials are accustomed to smoke on the premises.  It is also true that the annexes of the Museum at present used as refreshment rooms and kitchen are lined with wood, and are very inflammable, and that there is a wooden hut near the annexe occupied by soldiers, which also is of an inflammable nature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And yet we are told the national treasures are safe!  The Board of Works might have said more.  They might have pointed out that the floors are of wood, that the centre of danger &mdash;the kitchen and the bar&mdash;are flanked by rooms containing highly inflammable material.  Any of you can go and look at the place next the dining-room and you will find a room packed with inflammable show-cases.  If you go into the passage in the same building you will find bottles full of spirits &mdash;not the spirits they have in the bar, but spirits in another form equally dangerous in case of fire.  Then the Board of Works, in this letter which I have here, go on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Special precautions have been and are being taken to meet these risks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They define their precautions.  They are putting up a fireproof door between the passage and these buildings.  They are putting up a fireproof door between the building on that side and the other Museum.  They are putting up a further fireproof door above the way that leads down to the spirit store, which is under the kitchen.  Then they go on to say that there are other precautions. There is, they say, a fireproof door outside the room upstairs where the gold ornaments are housed.  There <Col N="879" /> is no fireproof door there.  There is a burglar-proof door.</P>
    <P>They say an inspector goes round every night and that that is the best precaution of all.  If that is the best precaution of all, I think very badly of the others.  If that man does his work properly it will take him at least an hour to see after the library which he is to inspect, and to see that all the windows there are properly shut.  I am informed that it would take him several hours to make his rounds, if he does his work properly.  A fire might therefore have a very considerable start before he discovered its existence. And that is the best precaution according to the Board of Works!  Then, why were not those precautions taken months and months ago?  Can we trust anything the Board of Works says to us when we have it that it is only now it takes such precautions.  Is it a fitting guardian of the public treasures? The only thing it does, as a result of Mrs. Green's agitation, is to put up those fire-proof doors.  If the Oireachtas remains here, there is only one thing to be done if the Museum is to be safe&mdash;that is to rebuild the kitchen and those other apartments somewhere else.  The chief danger is from those buildings.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine that the Government desires to take less precaution in guarding its national treasures than Governments do in other countries.  I can only think that the situation has arisen because of the extraordinary apathy of this country&mdash;an apathy that has come upon everything in connection with the national life in the recent past.  I cannot imagine that if the mind of this country were what it was seven or eight years ago, the people would think for a moment of leaving in any greater danger their treasures than the treasures, say, in South Kensington Museum or the British Museum.  These treasures are the only visible signs we have that we ever had a civilisation.  I do not think that the Government, if they gave thought to the matter, would like to set such an example before the people of this country of contempt of things of the mind.  They are bringing in an ambitious Education Bill.  They talk occasionally of their desire to see this an <Col N="880" /> able, intellectual country.  But if they are going to pay less respect than any other country does to their national treasures, to the irreplaceable things, who in this country will take them seriously when they speak of their desire to see this country able and educated?</P>

      <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that for the purpose of satisfying the public mind as to the sufficiency of the safeguards provided against fire in the National Museum and the adjoining buildings, the Government should obtain a detailed report from an independent expert; and that inasmuch as Sir Edwin Lutyens will be in Dublin by invitation of the Tailteann Games Committee in August, he should be requested to make the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the Board of Works would object to an independent expert being asked to give an opinion on this matter.  I find in one of their statements this occurs: &ldquo;If the Government were to ask to make a special inquiry into the matter, it would be desirable to agree to do so, and to appoint a committee for the purpose, as the report of such a committee would probably have more weight than Departmental representations.&rdquo;  That statement of the Board of Works admits on principle the desirability of there being some outside report upon the question.  I was in London until last night, when I returned for this meeting, and while there I inquired from various persons whose business was the safety of museums from fire, and I was told that Sir Edwin Lutyens would be the right person to examine into the question and to make an expert report. I went to him and asked him if he was invited by the Government to make a report, would he do so, and he said he certainly would.  He will be in Dublin on August 1st as the guest of the nation.  I think he would be regarded as the most acceptable person to do this.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEVOY</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that, in view of the urgent need for the relief of unemployment in, and to prevent the future flooding of, the affected area, the Government should proceed without further delay with the work of draining the River Barrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Irishmen are interested in this matter.  It is not necessary to tell Senators that deputation after deputation waited on English Chief Secretaries during their occupation in this country in connection with this matter. They received a favourable reception every time, and occasional offers of help, but for one reason or another the contributions which the British Government promised to give in aid of the work were turned down. At all events, nothing has been done so far to relieve the destitution occasioned in the district by reason of the devastation caused by the flooding of the Barrow.  The Barrow is a river about 100 miles in length.  It stretches from the Slievebloom Mountains to the ocean.  It is 80 miles from its source to St. Mullin's, where it joins the tidal waters.  It has been divided by the engineers into two separate areas, one called the upper area, which reaches from its source to Athy, a distance of about 40 miles; and the lower area, which reaches from Athy to St. Mullin's, where it joins the tidal waters.  The lower area is not so much affected by the flooding as the upper <Col N="883" /> area.  The upper reaches of the Barrow affected by the flooding, I mean the catchment area, covers an area of 408,000 acres, while the lower reaches cover an area of about 300,000 acres. It is in the upper reaches of the river that the flooding takes place.</P>
    <P>It was estimated fifty years ago that there were 50,000 acres affected, and now it is calculated that at least 70,000 acres are affected by the flooding. Commission after Commission has sat to consider the question of the flooding of the River Barrow, and plan after plan has been prepared with the idea of relieving the flooding.  It has been calculated that ten or twelve thousand pounds have been spent on Commissions and on engineers' plans, and yet nothing practical has been done as far as removing the flooding is concerned. Not a shovelful of sand has been lifted.  I ask the Seanad to support this motion for several reasons.  One reason is unemployment.  In the area from Mountmellick, where I come from, to Athy, I am told that about 1,000 men are on the unemployment list.  About £1,000 a week is being paid to these men, who are able and willing and quite anxious to work, if the work were provided for them.  When we approached the Minister for Finance on the question, we were told that the question of providing money to do the work was the difficulty; but here we find that £1,000 a week is being paid to men who are able and willing to work&mdash;to men who are doing nothing, but who are being made unemployable. There is not one of these men but would be quite anxious to work to save their own homes and the homes of their friends from the encroachments of the floods on the River Barrow. So far, we have been met with all sorts of excuses, but nothing practical has been done.</P>
    <P>I have been acting as temporary chairman of the Barrow Drainage Committee.  A deputation from that Committee has gone privately into the matter with the Minister for Finance, but the matter has been shelved every time.  On the last occasion it was shelved with the proposition that a great firm of German engineers were coming over to Ireland, and, so to <Col N="884" /> speak, were going to drain the Barrow by a stroke of the hand.  We were told that that was going to be done by some great German invention discovered in the last war.  We think, as the old woman said, that the old plan is the best plan, and we, ordinary people, think that this flooding is not going to be removed by any sort of fairy tales. In my opinion, we will have to depend on ourselves, instead of on the Germans, and I am of opinion that the engineers who have been engaged on this work know more about it than any German engineer could ever know. That has been given as a reason privately for not going on with the work. We are told that the Board of Works is in favour of the drainage of the Barrow.  Everybody seems to be in favour of it, but no one seems to make any advance.  As regards the finance of the question, we calculate that £400,000 would drain the Barrow&mdash; £300,000 the upper part, and £100,000 the lower part.  The upper portion is the portion affected by the floods.</P>
    <P>The engineers calculate that the floods from the upper reaches will go to the lower part and do an infinite amount of harm.  The engineers have made provision against that.  All the plans are in Dublin Castle or in the offices of the Board of Works.  As far as the finance of the question is concerned, the money that we pay at present for unemployment, if capitalised, would pay 5 per cent. on a million, so that we would lose nothing as a nation financially.  If at the present time we started to drain the Barrow and were to go ahead with the work, we could pay the interest on a million for nothing.  Then, again, from the local standpoint, it is really a good commercial proposition.  There are 408,000 acres in the catchment area, and by levying a rate of 1s. per acre on that area, you would derive a revenue of £20,000 a year.  The area that is most seriously affected by the flooding covers about 70,000 acres, and if you were to levy a rate of 10s. per acre on these 70,000 acres, it would bring in about £35,000, so that the actual resources of the nation would not be taxed to any great extent.</P>
    <P>The inhabitants in the reaches of the Barrow do not want the Government <Col N="885" /> to take the whole thing in hands.  They are quite willing to contribute their share, but what they want the Government to do is to start the work immediately and thus help to relieve the large amount of unemployment in the district.  A Committee could be formed that would demand from the inhabitants of this flooded area a reasonable contribution annually towards the payment of sinking fund and interest. Such a payment would not weigh very much on the inhabitants of the benefited area, because their income if the floods are removed will be greatly increased. I am sure the farmers in the area would not object to pay a small tax, if they were assured that when they cut their crops they would be able to save them and bring them home.  At present they cut their meadows and save the hay, but perhaps in a day or two the floods rise and carry away all the hay.  If this drainage problem were settled it would, I am sure, put from £2 to £3 per annum in the pockets of the farmers by reason of the fact that their crops were saved from all danger by the floods.  At present they may spend £1 or £2 in labour in saving the crops, and when the floods come along not only is their farm produce swept away, but they also lose the amount that they have expended on labour.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Seanad to support this motion and to put it forward to the Dáil.  I hope that all parties in the Seanad will support it.  First of all I call on labour to support it so that work of this kind may help to relieve the unemployment we have in that part of the country.  I call on the farmers to support it so as to help their kinsmen living on the Barrow river whose property and crops have been devastated for years by the heavy floods and finally I appeal for patriotic reasons to all parties in the Seanad to support this motion.  There are at least 100 square miles of land that we can save by undertaking this work from the ravages of the Barrow and I do not see why we should not do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. CUMMINS Mr. CUMMINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CUMMINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in supporting the motion moved by Senator McEvoy.  This question of the drainage of the Barrow has been <Col N="886" /> before the country for half a century. Some very important commissions were appointed by the British Government to inquire into the matter.  The first was the Castletown Commission appointed in 1885; later there was a more important Allport Commission, and some 10 years ago there was the Binny Commission.  Now various proposals were suggested by these Commissions and the first proposal was that the river should be widened and deepened.  That proposal was turned down on the ground of expense because the Barrow at certain seasons has not a great flow of water and the result would be that the bed of the river would fill up with silt and the removal of that silt could only be done at considerable cost.  Then came the Allport Commission in 1887.  That was a very elaborate affair.  A large staff of engineers were appointed to survey the river, and so anxious were the British Government to relieve unemployment at that time, that the staff worked night and day until they got out their reports and laid their proposals before Parliament.  They proposed and Parliament put in hands at the time certain works.  I saw the report which is in the hands of the only surviving engineer who was employed in the works &mdash;Mr. Bergin of County Kildare.  He was one of the three engineers appointed to make the survey and prepare the plans for the execution of the work.  That again occupied three years on the part of the three engineers.  The consulting engineers engaged in the work are well known to the engineering world and in fact they are names to conjure with&mdash;Messrs Dillon, Haddock, and Braithwaite, the latter of whom became Chief Engineer of the Board of Health in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A deputation recently waited upon our Government in regard to this matter, and one of the objections raised was that it would be necessary to get further expert advice on the matter which would involve considerable cost. But the plans that this commission got out are available and the whole thing cost between £20,000 and £30,000.  They are there and available for the Government to act upon them.  One month from hence with the passing of a small Bill by the Oireachtas they would be <Col N="887" /> enabled to work, and on time-and-material principle the contract could be taken up immediately without any further expense in regard to engineering. I understand that was one of the great obstacles they raised.  Senator McEvoy said the Barrow is divided into two sections, both the upper and the lower.  One of the things that caused difficulty in the past was the contention that if the upper section was drained it would flood the lower section.  The proposal of the Allport Commission was to straighten and slightly improve the bed of the river, together with the building of embankments to 4 or 5 feet and in some cases 6 feet, extending along the whole range of the river.  I am informed on the best authority that this work on the upper portion of the river could be started on Monday morning next. These embankments, with the big drains, would convey water from the higher stretches to the lower levels. That could be easily all started without the slightest danger of flooding in the lower levels, if that scheme were carried out.  They might start above Monasterevan in the morning and at the same time start lower down between Carlow and Athy.  It would not be necessary for the Government to advance money.</P>
    <P>The whole scheme would cover the period of four or five years, and if the Government took the matter in hands a small yearly advance would meet the situation.  In view of the amount of unemployment in the country I think that the case was never more urgent than it is now.  Unemployment is the problem which the Government have to tackle.  It is becoming a great danger, and if it is not met the cry of the hungry child going out to the man will drive him into adopting an attitude towards the Government that will not be good for the country.  I would urge the Seanad to accept this motion and press it upon the Government.  It will relieve the immediate wants and from the point of view of health from a national standpoint, and also on the grounds that it involves very little expense, I would urge the Seanad to press on the Government to take up this matter in the way indicated in the resolution.</P>

      <P>I am strongly in favour of the motion.  Senator McEvoy made a most excellent speech, and I wish we heard his voice more frequently. In former days the Barrow was a great barrier against invasion of the country, as its floods prevented people from invading the country, but now the floods have become embarrassing, and we would like to do away with them.  I would like to add to what has already been said.  The drainage of the river is very important, but it is not the only important factor connected with the river.  There are various interests to be considered, and they should all be taken together.  One is drainage, another is transport, another is power, and another is fisheries. All these things work into one another, and when the drainage portion is being carried out one should consider how these other things should also be dealt with.  In this case drainage is undoubtedly more important than the others.  I would suggest to Senator McEvoy that these words be added to the resolution, &ldquo;provided that the interests of fisheries, power and transport are each duly considered.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. SIGERSON</NameTxt>
      <P>What has been said has tended towards the correction of floods, but nothing has been said as to the averting of floods.  That is a very important consideration.  We know that where a country is denuded of trees, rain falls and flows in increasing masses down the rivers, with nothing to lessen its power, but much to increase it, whereas where a country is well supplied with trees, and well planted, when the rain falls it does not flow away.  The forest lies upon the surface of the ground.  Like a vast sponge it absorbs, from the surface and the ground beneath, the water, and carries it up into the air, from which it passes sometimes largely, and is carried away by the winds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wherever there are forests of that kind there are few and small floods. That was perfectly well known for instance in Paris which in recent years has been subject to certain unusual floods and the cause was that the trees along the sources of the rivers flowing <Col N="889" /> into Paris and conjoined in the Seine, have been more or less carried away. Consequently the remedy they suggest and are carrying out is the plantation of trees above the river which will absorb the water to a large extent leaving only a comparatively small stream which flowing down the river will augment its quantity no doubt, but not to a dangerous or sudden extent.  It is, therefore, to this question that engineers and others who desire to see the Barrow amended should turn their minds because there has been no tendency up to the present to increase the growth of forest trees but rather to diminish them.  All over the country trees have been cut down for fuel, the more so because the weather has been damp.  That rain which injures the turf and makes it incombustible would have increased the forest trees which would have served for fuel.  Remember that in France, Germany, Spain, and Italy, these woods are used for fuel and would have been of great service in supplementing the peat.  Want of fuel has been a source of great suffering to the poor.  Want of fire means want of power for cooking food and as a consequence, suffering and disease.  I will support the resolution with the suggestion that efforts should be made to replant the areas of the water-sheds which pour their sources now into the Barrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there is any work that the Government could address itself to with more advantage, or anything that would meet the present needs of the moment more by relieving unemployment and providing work for the great body of the unemployed who are unskilled than this.  This is a class of work where no skill is required, and here the work would be distributed over large areas. Also, there are districts included where unemployment is hard to relieve.  We know that, owing to depression in agriculture, those who formerly relied on employment are now not employed.  A very large percentage of their services are not needed.  It was stated here that work of this sort may be entered on under such conditions that it will not mean any considerable loss or outlay to the State.  I am sure that any <Col N="890" /> of those who hold land which is subject to flooding will only be too eager to enter into any arrangement that may be made by way of an impost per acre on the territory where flooding goes on.  Those people will only be too glad to enter into an arrangement to pay an annual stipend, or other reasonable charge which the Government might see fit to make in working out the finance of an undertaking like this. There are other areas than the Barrow, not so extensive, subject to floods, right throughout the Free State.  Senators here will have areas in their own localities, and I might suggest to the Government in this connection that there is a very great opportunity for relieving unemployment at various points, and particularly giving employment to the entirely unskilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Near the City of Waterford there is a large area within a mile of the city. Part of it is flooded and is within the city boundary.  The rest is in the county.  I am sure the city council and the private owners of that land would only be too happy to-morrow to enter into an arrangement with the Government. It is too large for a private undertaking, and can only be carried out by the Government and the Board of Works.  The need is there, and most of the ten or twelve hundred unemployed in the City of Waterford could be absorbed in that work.  Here to-day one has hardly time to read the titles of the Bills sent along.  Glancing at this list, I came upon the Telephone Extension Bill, which will cost £500,000. That will probably relieve some unemployment. The commercial community may not be very much incommoded by not having this extension, but here are matters which we always understood would, when we had charge of our own affairs, be the first matters to be taken into account.  It would give relief to unemployment, and would give the people work.  Here is an opportunity where they can be most usefully and reproductively employed, and where the people, so far as vested interests are concerned, are only too anxious to help us with the minimum of liability to the State.  Why does not the Government address itself to efforts of this sort and relieve this present need and distress of the moment?  I am sure that if <Col N="891" /> we take a strong attitude in the matter&mdash;this resolution has been already very much supported, and the case for it has been put up in such a way that the arguments used are unanswerable&mdash; we will bring forcibly home to the Government the great opportunity that presents itself at the moment for doing a very useful thing.  It will be a popular measure, and I think the Government could do with a little popular legislation at the moment.  It will be a popular, beneficial and reproductive measure, and it has everything from that point of view to commend it.</P>

He touched on ancient and modern history, but perhaps his modern history is what we should deal with. It showed that it was a scheme which, if entertained by the Government, would really result in producing something that would give a good return for the money expended on it.  Colonel Moore said we have not heard Senator McEvoy as frequently as we would like.  I think we all agree that the case put forward will meet with a hearty response from the Ministry.

      <P>I have genuine sympathy with the desire associated with this motion to bring a large acreage of land under cultivation, also with the desire to give unemployment relief in the form of useful work as against doles.  I cannot vote, however, for this motion.  In fact, I am bound to vote against it.  That may seem, at least to the supporters of this motion, who, presumably know a great deal about the subject, an uncalled for and an unfriendly act on my part, as I do not claim to know anything about it.  It is precisely for that reason that I feel bound to vote against it.  If the Seanad adopts this, it is the same as saying that we all believe there is a satisfactory scheme which ought to be put into operation at once.  I know quite well one member of the Seanad who knows nothing of the kind.  That is myself.  I dare say there are a great <Col N="892" /> many others in the same position.  Before I associate myself with the motion to expend a large sum of money, I want to know what that is going to produce.</P>
      <P>I do not know what it is going to produce because, I believe, that the very fact that this subject has occupied the attention of successive commissions makes it a very difficult question.  We have got no proof that any of these schemes that have been recommended by various engineers have any assured prospect of solving the problem.  I have, myself, talked with engineers of some distinction about this question, though not in a very serious way, because it was none of my business, but I understood from them that it is a very difficult question and the thing that makes it so difficult is the preservation of the navigation of the Barrow. The danger from flooding will remain after this drainage is carried out.  It is well known from experience that highly developed countries, which are drained by ordinary agricultural drainage, are the greatest producers of floods.  Floods are much more serious in most of the highly developed countries of Europe than they used to be. There is an enormous increase in the floodings in such places for the reason that the water finds its way into the river more quickly than it can be drawn off.  The difficulty is enormously increased where you have a river dammed up in a great number of places.  If you continue to have navigation you must have these dams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have strongly supported the motion for the spending of a large amount of public money for the rebuilding of the Four Courts, to be reasonably consistent I wish to give a reason why I supported that.  If we were to spend £180,000 on the Four Courts, we know what we would get.  This matter of the Barrow is a thing that I know nothing about.  I certainly would never urge upon the Government that they should immediately proceed with work about which I know nothing. For that reason I must vote against this motion.  Senator Colonel Moore, in the course of his speech, referred to the necessity for taking all the aspects of a question like this together.  You must do so unless you are to do more harm <Col N="893" /> than good.  It is on that very ground that I think it is very undesirable that we should take a plunge in a thing of this kind, and urge upon the Government to take a step of this kind when, as a body, we know very little about it.  I have been told by people whose word carries weight with me that the drainage and the navigation of the Barrow are diametrically opposed to each other.  It may be that if I knew as much about this question as Senator McEvoy does, I would support his Motion.  Without his knowledge I find it my duty to vote against the Motion.</P>

      <P>Perhaps if these words were added to the Motion it might satisfy Senator Bagwell, &ldquo;Provided that the interests of all fisheries, power, and transport are each duly considered.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If I may speak again on what has been suggested by the mover of this resolution, I would be inclined to alter it in the following way.  It would be so drastic an alteration that I hesitate to make the suggestion. But as Colonel Moore has suggested an alteration I would now suggest that this alteration be made:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad is of opinion that in view of the urgent need for the relief of unemployment, and to prevent the future flooding of the affected area, the Government should consider again the question of the drainage of the River Barrow.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;The Seanad is of opinion that in view of the urgent need for the relief <Col N="894" /> of unemployment in and to prevent the future flooding of the affected area the Government should take into their earnest consideration the question of the drainage of the River Barrow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Motion put, and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Now in regard to our business, I wish to inform the Seanad that there are nineteen Bills for our consideration when we meet to-morrow. Twelve months ago it would have occurred to me that that would mean two days' protracted sitting of the Seanad.  But seeing that we have despatched fifteen Bills to-day in the space of an hour I see no limit to the speed and the powers of this House. Therefore, I think we will be quite able to dispose of these nineteen Bills to-morrow. The question that I want the Seanad to advise me upon is whether they would prefer to sit at 11 o'clock to-morrow or at 3.  We will not require to sit on Friday.  We can dispose of all the available business of this week to-morrow.</P>
      <P>I might point out that while I agree that the majority of these Bills do not provide material for much discussion, at the same time I think it is quite certain that so far as they deal with commercial interests or with questions affecting the interests of labour, that a perusal of them by those Senators interested in the particular Bills would suggest desirable amendments.  When we resume after the Recess it would be well for the Seanad to see whether we could not provide some means by which those Bills should receive a preliminary examination by certain Senators.  I am convinced that there is not a single Bill that we have put through the Seanad but might have been improved.  It seems to me that at present there is nothing for us to do but to proceed with the Bills before us with the same rapidity with which we have been progressing for some days past.  But when we resume after the Recess I would ask the Seanad to consider the suggestion I have made.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.15 p.m., to 11 a.m. on Thursday, 17th July.</P>
