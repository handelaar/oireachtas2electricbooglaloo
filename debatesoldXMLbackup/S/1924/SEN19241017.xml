I do not think it is a very wise precedent, and it is the first occasion on which it is sought to establish it&mdash;I mean in another place.

      <P>So much has been said on the subject-matter of this Bill, it is pretty nigh impossible to say anything further that would be in the least way original or helpful.  The whole problem seems now to bristle with deliberately-created difficulties and complexities.  Moreover, the position has not been simplified by the torrents of burning words that have been showered upon us during the past couple of months.  It seems strange that this question could not have been discussed in quarters outside the Saorstát in a sane and businesslike way without recourse to threats of violence and bloodshed and defiance of the Acts of Parliament to which the people making the threats vow undying loyalty and devotion.</P>
      <P>The mere contemplation of what, at one time, at all events, seemed an exceedingly simple, or comparatively simple, question, has sent certain otherwise apparently sane gentlemen on both sides of the Irish Sea into a veritable frenzy.  Would-be warriors, and even war-time pacifists, have taken to soldiering.  Eloquent Dempseys with Cockney accents have come across to the Border with open minds, mar eadh! to educate themselves on the question in a perfectly impartial way, we are told.  Further, it would seem as if the wine of local oratory got to their heads, because before many days of impartial investigation the stolid Saxons were conducting themselves like intoxicated parrots.  There was at least one honourable exception, and that was Dr. Haden Guest&mdash;the only Labour M.P. who formed part of the troupe.  Then almost everybody outside the Saorstát has taken to expounding Constitutional Law, none more assiduously than those who have vowed that they will break any and every law with which they do not happen to agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Well-intentioned amateurs, learned attorneys, and eminent political lawyers have each and all given their interpretation of Article XII, unsolicited, and amazing to relate, even without a fee.  It just shows that in certain circumstances even a lawyer will do <Col N="1029" /> work for the love of it.  Their ability, in the profession, to misinterpret law is, of course, too well known to need any comment.  There is another eminent politician within the Saorstát, evidently a disciple of Professor Coué, who professes to solve the problem by auto-suggestion.  He says: &ldquo;Keep on saying there is no boundary; that there never has been one, and you will find there is none.&rdquo;  In short, the Boundary question seems to be a fight in which anybody can take part, and the less one knows upon the subject the more competent he is to intervene, because then he need place no boundary to the extravagance of his nature, or the violence of his threats.  In my opinion, there is no justification for all the heat and noise and threats of blood that have been generated.  If those who have been talking of bloodshed, of heaps of dead bodies, of wrapping themselves fore and aft in the Union Jack, and dyeing it with the richest blood, could only see themselves at a distance, they would hardly fail to laugh at themselves for being a ridiculous lot of serio-comedians.  The whole thing must appear to foreigners as savouring of the narrowest form of parochialism&mdash;a thing exceedingly funny, without the actors being aware of the fact.</P>
    <P>The slippery antics of the British signatories show them to be politicians more or less of the three-card-trick type, capable of bringing any States for which they act down to the lowest depths of national dishonour.  Each of the signatories on the English side is supposed to be a gentleman of England whose word is his bond.  If the signatories are types of English gentlemen, then Britain should be grateful for having a Labour Government of ordinary men.  Too much importance may be attached to the vapourings of out-of-office politicians of this type.  Of course, it is possible that they may, to a certain extent, prejudice the decision of the Commission.  To my mind, what is more important is the fact that the Labour Government of the day has in this question acted in a perfectly straight and honourable way.  If that were all that was necessary to settle <Col N="1030" /> the Boundary problem, there would be no cause for anxiety.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I am afraid this is not going to be the case.  We are told that before the Commission can even ascertain the wishes of the inhabitants of the disputed territory that further legislation in the British Parliament and in the Oireachtas will be necessary. I do not know if this is so.  Certain lawyers say it is.  I hope they are wrong, because otherwise there is great danger of the whole question degenerating into a series of thrilling episodes bordering on the grotesque.  In this democratic age it seems strange for anybody to question the right of homogeneous communities freely selecting the Governments under which they are to live.  Seeing that the object of the Boundary Commission is to give effect to the principle of self-determination, there can be no objection to it except objections which are directly subversive of freedom and which certainly will not bear even the most elementary test of democratic principles, as understood in these days.</P>
    <P>Whatever the results, there are grave doubts at present in the minds of the majority that the Commission will be able to function in a fair and impartial way because of the discreditable attempts of the British signatories to influence its findings.  Moreover, we have, as already pointed out, the unique spectacle of one party to the arbitration declaring that they will only abide by the findings of the Commission if they give them all that they require.  Personally, I have no quarrel with the Saorstát Government in agreeing to abide by the findings because no other policy would, in my opinion, be consistent with the demand that the Boundary Commission should be set up, and any other attitude would justify the defenders of the present boundary in the indefensible attitude which they have adopted.  It will be the duty, I believe, of the British Government to give effect to the findings as far as Northern Ireland is concerned.  If they fail in this respect, any turmoil or trouble which may ensue can hardly be laid at the doors of the Free State Government.  But while saying this, I do not believe, personally, that the <Col N="1031" /> Free State Government or the Northern Government will benefit by the findings of the Commission.  No matter what the results, partition, with all its evils, will remain.  The declared object of every true friend of Ireland is ultimate national unity in all matters affecting the country as a whole.  Such union, to be of any use, will have to come, needless to say, by mutual consent. But such agreement is impossible until there is created on both sides of the Border, between the respective people of the two Governments, a spirit of goodwill and of mutual accommodation. Now, the creation of such an atmosphere will be extremely difficult, and in my opinion impossible, while the Boundary Commission remains in its present uncertain position. Interested politicians will make use of of the situation in order to keep up an atmosphere of hatred, bigotry and distrust. In the past, professional politicians in the North utilised Home Rule and the Pope to keep alive the fires of religious bigotry and political animosity.  In later days the Boundary question has furnished the necessary material.  If we remove this question out of the region of controversy, the professional politician will find himself, like Othello, with his occupation gone.  It was his object in the past to get the Presbyterian of the North to look upon his Catholic fellow-countrymen as the inveterate enemies of his mortal body as well as of his immortal soul.</P>
    <P>Therefore, for that reason, and because I hope that the result of the work of this Commission will be to remove that question out of the region of controversy, and, thereby, give a chance for an atmosphere of goodwill, I feel personally justified in voting for the Bill, although I believe that its findings will not satisfy the requirements of justice. We ourselves can help to bring about a state of affairs in which real patriotism and goodwill can get a chance for the first time for generations. We can help to do that by not looking upon our Orange fellow-countrymen as devils incarnate, as they certainly look upon many of us.  They have been the victims of an extraordinary <Col N="1032" /> set of political circumstances, and they have been the tools of political intriguers, who have fed them with all sorts of religious and political bigotries and narrowmindedness.  These are largely responsible for the fact that these two sections of the community have never coalesced.  Materials upon which the Orange Grand Masters worked in the past having been removed, their power for evil will have departed, and there will then be an opportunity of some sort of an agreed arrangement being decided upon, which will be at least the equivalent of National unity.  Personally I see no reasons why we should put on our coats and fold our arms until such time as there is a National Parliament.  We are not going to foster the idea of ultimate unity by sitting idle until the Orangemen and the Nationalists throw themselves into each others arms.  I believe that if the worst happened and National unity was never achieved, that it would yet be possible to have a happy and prosperous Free State if the citizens of the Free State willed that it should be.  Anything that would tend to divert the minds of our own people into channels of a constructive and progressive character would be a blessing. Hitherto, and even at the present time, we find that the biggest crowd generally follow the man with the loudest voice and the most dramatic gestures.  They are constantly told that there is no earthly use in working or performing their ordinary avocations of daily life until some scheme, generally unattainable, of his own feverish imagination is accomplished.  And he will hint then that even after that it will not be necessary to work, because there will be such a state of affairs as will pave the streets with penny loaves and thatch the houses with pancakes.</P>
    <P>Denmark had her two richest provinces torn from her by Germany.  She did not throw up her hands in despair and wait for National development until these provinces were restored.  On the contrary, she proceeded to try to make up for the loss by making all the more use of what remained of her territory. She succeeded.  Consequently, I believe that whatever the ultimate solution of the Boundary problem is <Col N="1033" /> going to be, that our own social, economic and political destiny rests in our own hands, and that the less gunmen and professional politicians have to do with the matter, the better for the nation as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLOUGHLIN Mr. McLOUGHLIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLOUGHLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that I can do anything but support this Bill, as the attitude of the Craig Government has been so impossible up to the present as to leave our Government no other alternative but to press for their rights under Article XII.  Whilst taking up this position, I am, of course, aware that the Boundary Commission is by no means a satisfactory solution of the Ulster difficulty.  No matter what is done, it will leave behind it bitterness, disappointment, difficulties, and may so embitter the existing position, bad as it is, as to render all hopes of Irish unity incapable of realisation in our generation.  That is a result which all thoughtful Irishmen would deplore and which all patriotic Irishmen must do their very utmost to avert. Accordingly, one must be careful in discussing this matter not to say anything likely to engender bitterness.  I will, therefore, try to discuss it as dispassionately as possible, notwithstanding the malicious propaganda that is being broadcasted in England and in Ulster in regard to what is described as the unreasonable attitude of the Free State in the matter of the Boundary. From the amount of organised clamour and clap-trap that has been going on for the past six months, one would think that President Cosgrave was some wildly unreasonable man&mdash;some kind of &ldquo;Nowater Slim,&rdquo; who wanted to &ldquo;rodeo&rdquo; or lasso into his territory all the peace-loving loyalists of the Six Counties.  We know that President Cosgrave wants to do nothing of the kind and we know that nothing could be more reasonable or could be fairer than the position that he and his Government take up.  They say: &ldquo;We are prepared to deal, if you will have it so, on the basis that Ulster men are not to be coerced, and so we have asked for an independent Tribunal, before which can appear those Ulster men who want to be freed from a yoke which they detest, <Col N="1034" /> and who desire to be united with the majority of their own fellow-countrymen under the government of the Free State.&rdquo;  What could be fairer than that?  What simpler application of the great principle of Self-Determination for which the war is supposed to have been fought?</P>
      <P>But if the Belfast Government contends that the application of the principle in their case would leave them such a small governmental area as to render their position untenable, we could meet them on another basis.  We could say to them: &ldquo;Keep your territories undiminished and all the powers vested in you at present, and join with us in a federal scheme, under which a common Irish Council will control the services at present reserved in your case and all the services common to the whole country.&rdquo;  Under such a scheme, Sir James Craig's Government would actually have more power than it has at present, because, in addition to exercising its present powers over its own area, it would in the common Council have an equal voice with the representatives of the Saorstát in the control of the reserved services of the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of making the representation from the Six Counties equal to that from the rest of Ireland, always provided that the members are chosen according to the principle of proportional representation.  What could be fairer than this offer?  It involves an injustice to our own people in Tyrone, Fermanagh, Derry City and elsewhere who have shown their anxiety to be governed by this Oireachtas. But for the sake of national unity, I am certain that they would sacrifice their feelings in the matter and allow themselves to be governed by a Parliament in Belfast, provided that the Parliament was a member of the federalised Irish Free State.  As a sop to Ulster sentiment, and to meet the objection of the Belfast Die-hards, to whom the word &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; means all sorts of unspeakable horrors, I would suggest that the Government should agree to the Council of Ireland having its location in the City of Armagh, the Ecclesiastical Capital of Ireland, <Col N="1035" /> which could be neutralised for the purpose.  One result of the adoption of such a scheme would be that we would at once get rid of the land customs frontier which is such a barrier to Ulster trade and which is at present &mdash;and I know what I am talking about &mdash;strangling the economic life of Derry City.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that if the plain people of Ulster, Protestant and Catholic, had an opportunity of giving their independent opinions on such a scheme it would be accepted with alacrity.  I am myself an Ulster business man, and I am in daily contact with Ulster business men of all shades of thought, and I say deliberately that the mass of my fellow-provincials are most anxious for a reasonable settlement, and are especially anxious for the abolition of the Customs cordon which is the result of Partition.  If Sir James Craig, or any outstanding Northern politician, had the courage to come out with a strong lead for peace and to disregard the shrieks of bigoted fanatics, I am certain he would get a great backing from the mass of his own people, who know quite well that the problem of peace can only be solved, finally and satisfactorily along these lines.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are some who are sincerely anxious for Irish unity, who are genuine friends of the Free State and who consider that the interests of Ireland as a whole, would be best served by the adjournment of the Boundary Commission for two, or three, or five years.  I am a believer in the healing influence of time, and I recognise that, at present, too many passions have been inflamed to render the time opportune for the deliberations of such an ex-judicial body as the Boundary Commission should be.  It must be remembered, however, that the Northern Government by their shortsighted, stupid and narrow policy forced the Boundary question to a head. Had they shown even-handed justice in their area, there would not have been the overwhelming demand that exists to-day for the setting up of the Commission. That demand is so passionate and insistent that no Irish Government <Col N="1036" /> could resist it and survive.  If, therefore, the healing effect of time is to be given a fair trial, the Belfast Government would first have to remove the causes that made this question so pressing. They would have to give securities for the lives, and liberties, and rights of our people in the Six Counties.  These securities would have to be real ones and not mere paper guarantees.  We have seen too much of the shameless gerrymandering tactics of the Northern Government in the last year or two to trust to its sense of honour or of fair play.  All over the Six Counties Nationalist majorities in the local councils, where such majorities existed, were transformed into minorities by the simple device of treating one Unionist vote as the equal of two, and sometimes seven or eight Nationalist ones.  Catholic teachers, including priests and nuns, have been compelled to swear an abject oath not only to the king, but to his Government of Northern Ireland as well. Imagine the outcry that would take place in England, if Mr. Ramsay MacDonald forced the Archbishop of Canterbury, on peril of being deprived of his emoluments, to swear allegiance not merely to King George, but also to their Imperial Highnesses Messrs &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; Thomas, Clynes, Wheatley, Henderson and himself.</P>
    <P>These are only some of the indignities that have been heaped on Northern Catholics, and flesh and blood will not stand such treatment for long. So that we would have to get real guarantees, and the first and most obvious would be the restoration of Proportional Representation, or at least the fixing of constituencies on a strictly democratic basis by an outside authority. Besides, we would require safeguards for education and, of course, the political prisoners held by Sir James Craig's gaolers would have to be released.  There should also be as much co-operation as possible between the two Governments on matters of common interest.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any indication of willingness on the part of the Belfast Government to give these guarantees, I cannot see how we could consent to the adjournment of the Commission, <Col N="1037" /> although I know that, with peace and fair play guaranteed to the Catholics of the Six Counties, with good government, sound sense, and straight dealing prevailing in the Twenty-six Counties, the Boundary problem would soon solve itself, and a path would be opened for the ultimate attainment of Irish unity.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if Sir James Craig and his colleagues display the least goodwill or give the least earnest of their desire for peace, I am sure President Cosgrave and his colleagues will go to the very limit of reasonableness for an amicable settlement.  But if Sir James Craig, while expressing his willingness to go into a conference, keeps on talking about &ldquo;mere rectification,&rdquo; which will only make the position worse, and unsettle a lot of people who have accepted the existing position&mdash;if he persists in his &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; attitude&mdash; it will be plain that his object in resisting the setting up of the Commission is to be able to hold in subjection the unfortunate Catholics whose rights are being trampled on in so barefaced a manner.  In that event the only thing for the Government to do is to push on with all possible speed its preparations for the setting up of the Commission. A fair and impartial Commission will at least reduce the evil that is wrought by the intolerance of the Belfast Government.</P>
    <P>A disgraceful attempt has been made in England to ensure that the Commission will be neither fair, nor impartial. Mr. Justice Feetham has been practically drenched with &ldquo;Rectification.&rdquo; In last Tuesday's <i>Daily Mail</i> an article appeared which was a most flagrant attempt to pre-determine the decisions of the Commission.  This article purported to convey the intensity of the feeling among the inhabitants of Donegal for inclusion in Northern territory &mdash;chiefly on account of the vexatious restrictions of the Customs barrier and the 6d. duty on parcels.  It professed great sympathy for the wives of farmers and farm-workers in Donegal in their sad fate, which left them outside the beneficent rule of the Northern Government, under which they were just dying to come.  It proceeded to give no less than two &ldquo;forgone conclusions&rdquo;<Col N="1038" /> which the Boundary Commission must find.</P>
    <P>(1)  In view of its historic association, the City of Derry itself will remain with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(2)  Inishowen and East Donegal, if not the whole county, will be retransferred to Ulster.</P>
    <P>This is what Americans call &ldquo;throwing the bull.&rdquo;  Whether that is the game or not, when the proper time comes, Donegal will have something to say about these &ldquo;foregone conclusions.&rdquo; In the meantime, they do not perturb us in the least, but just give us some idea of the width and depth of the false propaganda that is being put in circulation.  One does not wonder at the <i>Daily Mail or Morning Post</i> descending to such tactics, but it startles one to find that the cream of England's proud nobility have not scrupled to attempt to intimidate Mr. Justice Feetham &mdash; to prejudice his Commission in advance, and to bully it into regarding as a mere scrap of paper the solemn Treaty to which the representatives of England put their hands, and which was formally adopted thereafter by the King, Lords and Commons of England.  Most of us remember the plot in England that encompassed the destruction of the Boer Republics.  The same gang are now plotting against the Free State. They then regarded Majuba as a humiliation for England, and they now regard the Treaty as another Majuba. They are backing up Craig in his unreasonableness; they are doing their utmost to ensure that if the Boundary Commission is ever set up it will return a partisan verdict; they are encouraging fools in this country to believe that England will wink at the establishment of a Republic in the Twenty-six Counties&mdash;all in the hope that we will do something that will involve us in irreparable disaster.  &ldquo;In vain is the net spread in sight of any bird.&rdquo;  If the attempt to prejudice the Boundary Commission were to succeed and the Commission were to find against the evidence and against facts &mdash;which is, I hope, a very remote contingency&mdash;I would still be hopeful that this country, profiting by bitter experience, would not be tempted into the paths of folly which her enemies are so <Col N="1039" /> eagerly pointing out to her.  I am confident that the counsels of wisdom would prevail and that nothing would be done to jeopardise the great measure of freedom already won.  Ireland will not play the game for her enemies on this occasion.  But as a State internationally recognised &mdash; as a member of the League of Nations and a co-equal of the other States forming the Commonwealth of Nations&mdash;she will realise her strength and know how to deal with any breach of faith or any tampering with her rights.</P>
    <P>I have spoken frankly, as I consider the time has come when every man should speak out his mind frankly and honestly on this matter, which is fraught with such tremendous consequences to our country.  It may be that some of my friends in the Six Counties who, exasperated by their treatment, demand that there should be no compromise or no settlement except through the Boundary Commission, may consider what I have said as the views and suggestions of a defeatist. They are the views formed after a very long and close study of the problem on the spot and brought to a head by the very remarkable letter written by John Devoy on the eve of his departure for America.  Nobody could, I think, accuse John Devoy of being a defeatist, or of even lacking courage in the cause of Irish independence.  At any rate, I have put forward these views and suggestions without consulting anyone, with a sincere desire for peace, regardless of whom they may please or whom they may offend.  Most of you who know your Bible history much better than I do recall an occasion when St. Paul was asked to declare himself.  He said he was for Christ.  I hope I may say, without irreverence on this occasion and on the question of the Boundary: &ldquo;I am for Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that on this occasion there would not be much necessity for speaking at all if the matter had been treated with the common decency with which all these great matters ought to be treated, or if this Bill you are now asked to pass were likely to be the last on this matter.  But that <Col N="1040" /> does not seem to be likely.  As Lord Carson said in the House of Lords, the Commission has no power to hand over territory or to hold censuses or anything of the sort, and before any of these things can be done properly other Bills will have to be passed.  We do not know who will be in power then. Of course, we all regret any question of a Boundary in Ireland, but it is a corollary of the Act of 1920 to which no Irishman had anything to say whatsoever. A very shameful and treacherous Act was passed on that occasion by English Members without the vote of a single Irish Member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what authority members of the English House of Commons had to hand over territory in this country or to divide it in this way.  Ireland was an undivided country long before the historical period.  It was an undivided country before Hengist and Horsa landed in Kent, and 500 years before Edgar was made head of the Heptarchy.  Whatever may be said of the Act of Union, Ireland was an undivided country at that time, and the Treaty of Union was between two independent nations.  At no time was the right of the English Parliament to divide Ireland recognised.  In my opinion, the Act of 1920 was an unconstitutional Act and a breach of the Act of Union.  We are faced with this difficulty now, and we must consider between ourselves what is the best plan to get out of it.  The Act of 1920 was passed so that England might be enabled to get over some of her difficulties. It was done deliberately and treacherously for the purpose of dividing Ireland.  The English Government was in a difficult situation at the time, and they had to do something.  What they did was to divide Ireland in order to conquer, and in order that, when leaving, they might leave a bone of contention between the two parts of a divided country.  They did that so that they might be enabled to step in again whenever they thought well to do so. That, as far as I can see, is the only reason they had for making the division under the 1920 Act Lord Carson said at the time that the Act was passed in order to give England a jumping-off ground in the North to attack Southern Ireland whenever it suited her to do so. <Col N="1041" /> Now we are asked to engage in a new Treaty.  What we ought to consider is, whether we should make Treaties with people who are not trustworthy or with a Government which does not keep its Treaties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson, in the Dáil, pointed out very properly that, if what the English signatories to the Treaty say now is true, there was no common basis of understanding between the Irish signatories and the English signatories. The Deputy quoted certain judicial authorities to show that, if the two parties looked upon Article XII. of the Treaty from an entirely different point of view, the Treaty is invalid.  With a great many of the statements made by the last Senator I entirely disagree. He has enunciated all sorts of propositions as to how we can make peace, and lays down certain conditions which are all very fine to state in fluent language, but there is not a single one of them with which Sir James Craig will agree.  What, I ask, is the good of talking about a compromise and a settlement with people who will make no agreement?  Another point about these compromises and settlements is: Who is to make them?  As far as I see we cannot make them.  The only people to make them are the Government, and I have some hesitation, I must say, in trusting the Government to make these arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Government has not always been very strong in these matters.  The Government gave away absolutely the Council of Ireland without, as far as I know, anything being gained instead. The Council of Ireland was the last slender link between the two parties in the North and the South.  Under the Council of Ireland the railways could be governed, and probably many other things as well, but the Government suspended the Council of Ireland for five years.  What their object was in doing so I confess I cannot see.  The Minister for Justice, in the Dáil the other day, made a slight attempt to defend it by saying that the Council of Ireland was no good.  If it was no good, why, I ask, was it suspended?  To my mind, and to the minds of other people, it was a matter of very great importance to keep some sort of a link between the <Col N="1042" /> North and the South.  When we come to the other new Bills that are to be brought forward, how, I ask, are we to trust that we will be treated with any more honour than we have been in respect of this one by England?</P>
    <P>Lord Grey stated publicly that England was in a great difficulty and he hoped the Commission would get her out of it by voting his way.  Lord Birkenhead stated that only a lunatic would have any other opinion except his.  Everything possible is being done to intimidate and bully the unfortunate Commission.  The curious part of it is that the English signatories to the Treaty are the very people who made exactly opposite statements at the time the Treaty was signed.  Now they go back on these statements.  Lord Carson said they did it just for duplicity, in order they might gain an object at the moment.  Their object was to get the Treaty through, and that being over, they are doing their best now to twist this and to turn it around.  This, unfortunately, is not a new thing in English diplomacy.  I will read a passage from Burke where, speaking about India, he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To satisfy the Marattas, he agreed that an Article should be inserted to admit Hyder Ali to accede to the pacification, but in the instructions for the drawing-up of the Treaty he desires him (that is, the person drawing up the Treaty) to insert a vague article in favour of Hyder Ali.  Evasion and fraud were the declared basis of the Treaty. These vague articles intended for a more vague performance are the things which have damned our reputation in India.  Hardly was this vague article inserted than a negotiation was entered into for the partition of this Prince's territory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think events tend very much towards a repetition of the same thing with regard to the people of Ireland.  On no single occasion has the English Government behaved in a straight way towards Ireland.  A Senator on the opposite side spoke words of great praise of the present Government in England.  It passed this Bill, no doubt, because it suited its purpose to do so, but I care very little whether it is a <Col N="1043" /> Labour, a Liberal or a Tory Government that is in power in England, they are all much of the same kind and they will do certainly what suits themselves. Law or anything else is a matter of indifference to them.  That has always been the case.</P>
    <P>I propose to give another quotation from Burke.  In describing the dealings of England with the native princes of India, Burke says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;First I say that from the Himalayas, on the Northern frontier of India, to Cape Comarin in the South, there is not a single Prince, State or Potentate, great or small, in India with whom we have come into contact whom we have not sold.  I say sold, though sometimes we have not been able to deliver according to our bargain.  Secondly, I say that there is not a single Treaty we have ever made, which we have not broken. Thirdly, I say that there is not a single Prince or State who ever put any trust in us who is not utterly ruined, and that none are in any degree secure or flourishing, but in the exact proportion to their settled distrust and irreconcilable enmity to this nation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our President has stated on a few occasions that he places great trust in the English Government, and that he is quite sure that they will behave honourably. I would call his attention to what happened to men of much more experience in politics than he, men of great ability whom we always reckoned as our leaders.  Every one of these men was betrayed.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to contradict the President, and no doubt what he says is perfectly true.  If he limits himself to that I shall be perfectly satisfied.  But I fear he may do what I know other Irish statesmen did before&mdash;John Redmond and O'Connell <Col N="1044" /> and men of that stamp.  They placed their trust in the English Government, and every one of them were betrayed, and I would like the President to be careful before he places any trust in them in the future or gives away anything that he could avoid giving away. Of course, we must pass this Bill.  I suppose there is no help for it.  We must do the best we can, and, as Senator McLoughlin said&mdash;and I believe has was quite correct in saying it&mdash;there are a great many people in the North of Ireland&mdash;sedate, quiet people like ourselves, who are perfectly willing to come to an agreement with us.  I was in Derry City in 1914, when there was worse feeling and more trouble than there is at the present time.  I met Senator McLoughlin there, and I met a good many Unionists there, and they told me that the last thing they wanted was trouble, and they were quite ready and willing to come in and work with us.  I only wish to say that we are only at the beginning of a very difficult time.  The Act that we are passing to-day will not be the last on this subject; there will be many more and we will have to keep up all our courage for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are in honour bound to abide by whatever conclusion or decision the Boundary Commission may arrive at.  Of course we are very much concerned with anything that might affect that decision. When this Commission is set up, its members will be confronted with the duty of interpreting Clause XII. and much of what will follow and ensue from their deliberations will hinge upon the interpretation that will be put upon that clause.  There are factors mentioned in the clause that they will have to take into account. They have to take into account the will of the people in particular areas, small or large&mdash;the size is not defined.  But machinery can be set up.  They have to take into account economic considerations and geographical considerations. As to what weight they will decide to attach to these factors, we have no guide or lead.  That procedure is left entirely to themselves.  The clause, as it is worded, is very open, very <Col N="1045" /> vague, and very loose.  It is open to a variety of interpretations.  Reference has been made here to the opinions expressed by the signatories to the Articles of Agreement subsequent to the implementing of the Treaty.  I do not think we are concerned at all with those opinions; they do not affect the position.  The signatories were not the contracting parties; they only came to a certain general agreement as to certain headings on which the Treaty was based.  The contracting parties were the two Parliaments&mdash;the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of Ireland, representing respectively the British and the Irish peoples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now to any student of the time, following the deliberations of both Parliaments and the very exhaustive discussions that took place both in the one Parliament and in the other leading up to the passing of the Act, there seems to have been undoubted unanimity and agreement as to the whole intention of the Treaty at that time and as to the interpretation of every clause of the Treaty.  Deputy Johnson, whom I had the pleasure of hearing a night or two ago in the Dáil, quoted from a learned and high authority the definition of a binding contract, and he instanced a certain essential condition that rendered such contract binding.  That condition was that the parties to the contract must be of the same mind; they must be in agreement as to the interpretation of the language used, and they must have the same intent.  What was the signatories' intent?  So far as the signatories acted, they agreed as to the text of the Articles of Agreement; they were concerned in the wording of it and there was no dissent, seemingly, in any of their minds.  And I presume that in the conferences that took place they looked at every line and every clause from every angle.  But, subsequently, some of the signatories discovered that they had some mental reservation even at the time of signing, although it was unexpressed at that time.  Well, according to this learned definition, if the signatories were parties to the contract, there might be something to be said as to the invalidation of it.  But it passed away from the Signatories to the Parliaments who <Col N="1046" /> were the contracting parties, and again in the whole range of the discussion in these Parliaments there was not a single note of dissent or want of unanimity as to any line or clause or word in the whole of the Treaty as finally decided upon and ratified as an Act of Parliament.</P>
    <P>Now, what is the point at which I wish to arrive?  I have said that much will depend on the interpretation put upon this clause.  Our hopes in the immediate future and for the far distant future are entirely centred and concerned with that interpretation.  Inevitably the Commission will, at the outset of their proceedings, consider this interpretation, and as there is no guide given to them by the legislatures concerned as to what weight they are to attach to the relative factors I have already mentioned, they must of necessity look round them and try to arrive at some decision as to what was in the mind of Parliament at the time.  Where there is any ambiguity in an Act of Parliament, if we take the procedure of the courts, the learned judges try to understand the law and try to read between the lines of the Act in the endeavour to see what was present to the minds of the Legislature when it was passing the Act.</P>
    <P>They do their best to arrive at what was in the mind of the Legislature. That is the only reference they can make, and the only means they have of dispensing justice as it should be dispensed. These men must inevitably fall back upon something.  They must go outside the text, go back to the source of the thing.  What will they find?  They will find that signatories on one side have given expression to opinions and interpretations of a certain clause diametrically opposite to the signatories on the other side.  If the Parliament of one of the contracting parties&mdash;Great Britain&mdash;or if this Parliament has subsequently expressed disagreement with the interpretation, that would be a matter which would have a bearing upon their interpretation of the clause.  The House of Lords &mdash;I submit very indecently&mdash;added a rider to its decision with regard to the Bill.  Nothing has been expressed by <Col N="1047" /> the House of Commons or by any authoritative person in the Government of Great Britain repudiating that rider or what it connotes.</P>
    <P>It is on record; we cannot blot it out or obliterate it.  It was an indecent, contemptible thing to do and without precedent as you, sir, said.  But it is there and it is only human to suppose that these Commissioners will be affected in coming to a decision as to the interpretation of that Clause by what is on record.  I say that irregular and all as it was, and a bad precedent which you, Sir, say we should not follow here &mdash;I think you had some doubt as to whether you should allow a certain resolution or not&mdash;we are at a disadvantage in this whole matter if we do not off-set the effect of what has been done by the House of Lords by way of passing a resolution.  We occupy a position analogous to the House of Lords as we are the Second Chamber and we should pass a resolution to off-set or minimise the effect of that expression of opinion of the House of Lords, which certainly places us at disadvantage when it comes to the interpretation of this Clause.  I do not see that we will be stultified or compromised in any way, even though we may follow their irregular procedure. I think that our people and our Government are entitled to try and minimise it.  We cannot undo what has been done, but we should, at any rate, try to minimise as far as we possibly can, the effect of that irregular procedure.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the <Col N="1048" /> suspension of the Standing Orders in order to move a Resolution pertaining to the matter which we have been discussing and which, I think, in view of the whole position, might reasonably be claimed to be one of urgency.  The Resolution is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That this Seanad is of opinion that the interests of the country as a whole would be best served by an agreed solution of outstanding problems affecting the relations between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>In asking the Seanad to consider and, I hope, pass unanimously the Resolution which I have read, I do so because I believe that in general terms it represents not only the opinion of this Seanad but the opinion of the vast majority of the people both in the Free State and in Northern Ireland.  I should like to emphasise the fact that this Resolution is being proposed after the Seanad has unanimously passed a Bill which ratifies a further agreement for the setting-up of the Boundary Commission.  By the act of passing that Bill it has shown that if no reasonable agreed arrangement can be made, it is going to stand behind the Government in whatever steps may be necessary to see that Commission through.  At the same time, it expresses what is a deep conviction, that at its best the Boundary Commission does not solve, and cannot really solve, the outstanding problems between the Free State and Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past few weeks I have been spending most of my time in the United States, and I have been greatly impressed there by the disproportionate importance that the Boundary question has assumed in relation to all other matters affecting Ireland, either North or South.  On my return, listening to the debates in the Dáil and here, I cannot help feeling that here, too, we are placing a wrong proportion, a wrong sense of importance simply on the Boundary, whereas the Boundary itself <Col N="1049" /> is really an evil that has followed partition, that has followed want of trust, want of accommodation, want of co-operation between the Irish Free State and that section which is politically called &ldquo;Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  Personally I would rather have a long period with a bad boundary and with really good co-operation, goodwill, friendly feeling between the two sections.  I would rather risk a long period of a bad boundary, if I was sure there was going to be co-operation, goodwill and fair play to the interests of minorities, than the most theoretically perfect boundary, the best Commission in the world could create, with ill-feeling on each side of it.  Even if this Commission is to meet, even if this Commission is to be absolutely fair, even if it is to take the opinion of the speeches made at the other side that we take of them, it still leaves a big problem to be solved.  But the real danger is that it may leave that problem harder to solve even than now.</P>
    <P>I ask you to pass this resolution for two reasons; first, because it is not for us to give up hope that there may be a desire&mdash;perhaps even as a result of some of the things that have been happening at the other side recently, a desire, in spite of the unsatisfactory nature of the public utterances&mdash;to make at least a bona-fide effort to settle some of the outstanding problems.  Our President, in a moving speech at the end of the last debate, made his position perfectly clear as regards his willingness, and he did not state that there must be any specific terms or that any particular resolution must be put forward, but he hoped that settlement might be by means of an agreement.  I admit that the passing of this resolution, if you take its actual words, does not say very much, but the manner in which it is passed, and the time chosen for its passing, may achieve what is my second object in asking you to pass it.  That is, it may help you to show what we know but what the people outside Ireland do not know, that there is really a strong and almost unanimous desire, if it is possible by any means, that there should be an agreement rather than a settlement by a Commission, <Col N="1050" /> even if that Commission did far better than we can hope from the present Commission.</P>
    <P>The resolution states that the interests of this country as a whole would be best served by an agreed solution of outstanding problems.  The country as a whole&mdash;and by that I mean the country North and South&mdash;is not going, I think, to gain anything, or very little, indeed, during the months that must elapse while this Commission is meeting and discussing its problems; but&mdash; and this is a point I want particularly to emphasise, as I believe it has a real appeal both to North and South&mdash;during that period there is a grave danger that the problems of development, that the possibilities of extension of economic enterprises, both North and South, may be arrested owing to the uncertainty felt not only here, but that will be felt elsewhere, where we get our trade as to what is to be the outcome and the solution.  I agree with Senator O'Farrell, who said that if this is going to lead to further legislation, it will be a most irritating and unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>
    <P>At a play in New York, a comedian, referring to the United States election, said that President Coolidge was trying to get the ticket on efficiency; that Mr. Davis had another good ticket, honesty; and that La Follette was appealing to the discontent of the other parties, and he thought that he had the best ticket, because for one man that was honest or efficient he found ten that were discontented.  I firmly believe that this question of discontent, due to unemployment, is as&mdash;if not more&mdash;pressing a problem in North and South as even the Boundary.  I am inclined to think that if our Government could meet some of our Northern friends and talk business with them, that some way would be found, not just to settle the Boundary &mdash; because I do not believe it can be settled by itself&mdash; but to settle the problem of future co-operation between the Northern area and the Free State, as long as partition is to remain.  Then, I believe, we will have done good to ourselves.  Whether we succeed or not, I am not sufficiently a pessimist to say that there is no hope.</P>
    <P>Personally, I do not much like the attitude <Col N="1051" /> taken by many people in the South in which they express their affection and love for our friends in the North. I do not think in the North they quite understand these terms, and I do not think they understand why we should be all along hankering after them.  If, on the other hand, having reluctantly accepted the fact, that whatever stand we may take on the Boundary, we are not going to press or coerce any section to be governed in the way we want them against their will&mdash;having faced that fact and stood by it, I think our attitude should be this: &ldquo;For longer or shorter we have got to live beside you. You gain and we gain, if you find some method of co-operation.  But if there is nagging and trouble, if you place difficulties in our way, we will place them in yours, that will hinder both our development. We have frankly admitted that you have a right to be governed in the way you have now chosen, and we expect you to recognise the same with us.&rdquo;  Is there not a way of co-operation now?  I suggest that if that attitude were taken there might be a possibility of reaching so much co-operation during the next four or five years, together with the safeguards which have been outlined by Senator McLoughlin, or some other safeguards&mdash;I do not care what they are, if they are satisfactory for the minorities&mdash;that we could afford to talk about the Boundary after that problem had been settled, instead of following the British politicians in their anxiety to settle the Boundary first, which I think is the wrong way.</P>
    <P>I am leaving England out of this debate, because in this debate almost every speaker has quoted some English politician.  It reminds me of a friend who suggested that one curse in this matter was that it was causing England to pay far too much attention to us, and we on our part to pay far too much attention to England.  In America you find that this problem of the Boundary has been exaggerated to the extent that there are people there who believe that to-morrow there is going to be an outbreak of Civil War. Others believe that Ireland is split into two equal parts waiting to have a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at each other.  When I was in <Col N="1052" /> New York one of the papers&mdash;it was followed by most of the others&mdash;came out with a long account of Lord Birkenhead's recollections.  I was going up an elevator on the same day when a lift-man, who I did not think knew me, whispered in a Cork accent: &ldquo;I can tell you a story of Lord Birkenhead.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;So can I.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That sort of thing is not going to solve anything.  I give that as an illustration of the fact that while long paragraphs of Lord Birkenhead's recollections were published, two lines of President Cosgrave's statement appeared in the same paper, and even Mr. de Valera's marvellous description of burning bridges did not get into the papers.  So that anything attaching to the Boundary gets a prominent place. That interferes with our business, as I know to my cost.  I will conclude with a quotation of a very prominent man in this country whom I happened to meet the other day, and with whom I discussed the Boundary question.  The gentleman who brought us together thanked some of those present for giving their valuable time to the consideration of that question, and my friend, in reply, said: &ldquo;If you settle this problem we will all make money.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I beg to second the resolution and, in doing so, I am conscious of the very grave responsibility that rests on every member of this House in regard to this matter just at this time.  I am convinced that the resolution proposed by Senator Douglas should, for the reasons he has given, be adopted by the Seanad.  I am also satisfied that this resolution gives expression to what is really the heart-felt desire and hope of the great majority of citizens not only of the Free State, but I am sure also of the citizens of Northern Ireland.  We have just passed a Bill which confirms the recent agreement with reference to Clause XII of the Treaty, but is it too much to hope, even at this late stage, that it may not be necessary that the Commission which has been pledged by this Bill should be asked to give a decision.  I am one of those who very much regret the effect of such a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> It is not that I am afraid of civil war, for I do not believe that there will be anything of the kind between two parts of Ireland.  But no matter what decision is given by the Commission, you cannot please everybody.  I think it will please nobody, but we will have a result which will lead inevitably to bitterness and hardening of hearts.  That is a conclusion which we ought all do our best to avoid.  There is a very large number of outstanding questions between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland.  The question of the boundary is only one of them. I do not think that this is either the place or the time even to indicate what those outstanding problems are, but there are some of them so important and vital to the future welfare not only of the Free State and Northern Ireland but to the whole of our common country, that I believe that if they were settled the question of the boundary might very easily become negligible.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly conscious of the difficulty that lies in the way of settlement of these outstanding problems, other than the Boundary question, but at the same time I do believe that there is on both sides sufficient good sense and, what is of very much more importance, sufficient goodwill to enable a solution of these questions to be made.  In the interests of our common country, a great and honest effort should be made to arrive at a solution, and I believe if such effort were made on both sides, with God's help, it would succeed. Therefore, without saying any more, I beg to second the resolution, and I would ask the Seanad to pass it unanimously.</P>

      <P>I feel that the importance of this Resolution and what it may mean is so great that from a sense of duty, as well as from a sense of responsibility, I wish to state the reasons why I make this strong appeal to my colleagues in this House to give it their whole-hearted sympathy and support.  I brush aside the many side-issues that have arisen out of this Boundary controversy, because I wish to grapple at once with the one real and living issue&mdash;namely, will the functioning of this Commission be a factor for good or for evil?  It has already aroused great uneasiness and suspicion in the minds of many, both in the North and in the South.  The North is smarting under a sense of injustice, in the belief that the setting up of this Commission is an invasion of its rights under the Act of 1920, and is a violation of the pledges which they state, and I believe, with truth, they received from certain prominent British statesmen, although these statesmen now deny or disown them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Free State, our Government is entitled to point with satisfaction, as an indication of the justice of their claim, to the desire of the people of Great Britain, as distinct from its politicians, to keep faith on this Treaty.  Nevertheless, suspicion and uneasiness have been aroused here owing to the concerted action of certain politicians and sections of the Press in England, who by a mischievous and ill-advised crusade, have attempted to prejudge the decision of this Commission and to anticipate the interpretation that is to be placed on Article 12.  This unconscionable campaign&mdash;because I can not describe it in any more complimentary terms&mdash;I believe may defeat its own ends.  There is an old saying about the effect of excessive protestation, <Col N="1055" /> and I think it may well be that in the minds of sensible people these protestations may have the very opposite effect to what they were intended to produce and may suggest that those who have been indulging in them have thereby given the very best proof of their own want of belief in their sincerity.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, human nature being what it is, this campaign has undoubtedly weakened, in the minds of many people in the Free State, their confidence in the independence and partiality of this Commission.  I do not myself, for one moment, question either the courage or the honour or good faith of the distinguished South African jurist who has been called upon to preside over it, but I believe he, most of all men, is entitled bitterly to complain on behalf of himself and his colleagues &mdash;whoever they may prove to be&mdash;for being placed by this campaign in the dilemma that if they give their decision one way they will be charged with having yielded to clamour, while if they give it on the other it will be said that they are in conflict with expert opinion. Under those circumstances, speaking for myself, and speaking, as I hope I always do when I address this House, with the utmost frankness and sincerity, I see no hope of finality in the findings of this Commission, nor do I see that any government, however willing it may be, will be able to persuade its people to accept or submit to them. I assume for the moment that the hopes that are entertained by so many in reference to this Commission may be fulfilled, and that, as a result of its findings, a substantial portion of the territory at present in the possession of Northern Ireland is to be transferred to the Irish Free State.  I ask how is that thansfer to be made, and by whom?  The territory will not be surrendered willingly; that is certain, and I very much doubt if any British Government can be depended upon to use the forces of the Crown for the purpose of compelling them to surrender. Only one other method of effecting this remains.  But the mind of every Irishman shrinks in horror from the idea of being engaged in civil <Col N="1056" /> war in such a cause and in such a manner.  Such a war will be internecine in its character, and would de-story for centuries the ideal of a peaceful and united Ireland.</P>
    <P>History will, I believe, not fail for all time to characterise the present generation of Irishmen as criminally culpable if, before such a dread alternative is resorted to, they fail to exhaust every avenue which would result in the settlement of these matters by goodwill and by mutual understanding. Surely our fellow countrymen in the North and South are not so bankrupt in statesmanship and patriotism as to resort to any remedy like this for the solution of matters of this kind, which only require goodwill and honesty of purpose on both sides to be capable of solution, and, certainly, of a much more permanent and a happier solution than will ever arise from the findings of a Commission superimposed upon this country by the action of the British Government.  What are the obstacles which seem to loom so large in the minds of some people in the way of such a conference as is suggested? Is it religion?  To me it has always been unthinkable and unintelligible how people who share in their belief and reverence for all the fundamental truths of our common Christianity, and who differ only in the ritual and ceremony which give expression to this belief, can find in this an obstacle in the path of peace in Ireland and goodwill between North and South.  Are these obstacles to be found in any claim on behalf of the South for a monopoly of patriotism?  I know the people of the North well, and, I say this confidently, that nowhere will you find men more proud of their Irish birth and traditions than in the North of Ireland, or more zealous in the defence of all their country's interests both at home and abroad.  Are those obstacles again to be found in the monopoly of allegiance to the Empire?  I point as my witnesses to the graves not only of William Redmond, Thomas Kettle and Arthur O'Neill, but to those of the thousands of gallant soldiers from all counties of Ireland who now sleep side by side with no boundary between them in the cemeteries of France and Gallipoli.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> Lest it may be said that these obstacles are to be found in the fact that there still remain, both in the North and South, sections of the people who are the victims of political duress or political disabilities, I know that they exist, but do they exist in greater number than was to be expected in the case of a country recently emerging from the fever of violence and disturbance? Are they of such a character, or are they anything but the temporary, if inevitable, aftermath, of the necessity for punishment and repression which now has passed away, and which, with its consequences, could be adjusted and redressed as the result of a few hours' deliberation amongst Irishmen who are anxious and desirous for peace and goodwill.  I do not want to be misunderstood as suggesting that the time is now ripe for an ambitious scheme of reunion between the North and South Recent events and the anger and passions that have been aroused would discredit and destroy any such attempt.  But I do, in my heart and conscience, believe that the time is opportune and ripe for a mutual conference to consider how best these outstanding problems, which at present distract us and divide us, may be amicably adjusted.  Their number is many.  I will just give a few illustrations. Take the matter of the Customs and Excise, the great question of transport by rail, by road, by canal and by sea, our inland and coast fisheries and development of our water-power. There are many subjects which, undoubtedly, in my opinion are capable, I will not say of simple adjustment, but of early adjustment by conference between Irishmen, if they will only enter into it with honesty of purpose and with goodwill and not for the purpose of securing a political triumph over each other.</P>
    <P>I believe that the respective Governments of the Free State and Northern Ireland can safely trust each other, and may be certain of the fact that either will carry out everything that it has undertaken to do, and in attempting to do so each Government will have its people behind them and with them.  I would appeal to my fellow-countrymen in the North to trust to the people of the Free State, because I am certain <Col N="1058" /> they will not let them down, nor will they have to complain that, on every occasion, they have been betrayed by them, as they do complain of their English friends.</P>
    <P>I would like, in conclusion, on behalf of the Southern Unionists, who as a result of the assurances extended to them by the Free State Government, remained in this country, and determined to throw in their lot with their own people, to say and to make clear that the Free State Government has made good these assurances in every particular.  Speaking from the experience derived as Chairman of this Chamber, of the legislation that has been passed by the Free State during the last three years, I wish to state absolutely that I know of no single instance in which Southern Unionists have been prejudiced or ill-treated by that legislation either in person or property or by any discrimination of any sort or kind.  To-day the North and South stand at the parting of the ways. Each is faced with a choice either to take the path which leads to mutual co-operation and goodwill&mdash;the only road, however long the journey may be, that can eventually lead to reunion&mdash;or the path which will speedily plunge both into the depths of disorder, disruption and despair.  I have intervened in this debate solely for the purpose of expressing my own hope and wish that the Government of the Free State will no longer stand on any ceremony as between themselves and the North, but that they will stretch out&mdash;I do not say that they are not willing to stretch out, because they have said it very often&mdash;but that they will, in fact, stretch out the hand of fellowship to the Government in the North.  I have spoken, as I have said, frankly.  I have said, I hope, nothing that would in any way offend the susceptibilities or the ideas of any members of the Seanad.  If I have, I have signally failed in my purpose.  But at the close of a fairly long and strenuous public life, I should have no happier, no more pleasing memory than to think that I had contributed, be it ever so little, to a better understanding and a more intimate relationship between the North and South, believing in my heart and soul <Col N="1059" /> that upon that foundation alone can we build with any hope either now or in the future a peaceful, prosperous and united Ireland.</P>

      <P>Before the resolution is put, I would like to say that I am opposed to it, and if necessary I will challenge a division on it, even though I may be in a minority of one.  We are dealing with the carrying out of an agreement arrived at between President Cosgrave and the Prime Minister of England, regarding the setting up of a Boundary Commission that has to do certain work.  This resolution proposes that we should ask for a conference. There is no use in shutting our eyes to the facts, and there is no use in our saying nice things when we do not mean them.  There is no use in talking about goodwill with people who are not prepared to meet us in a spirit of good-will. The people that it is suggested we should meet in a spirit of goodwill are not prepared to meet us.  They have stated over and over again that they are prepared to meet us and to discuss matters with us if they get everything that they want.  That is their position, and, personally, I am not going to be a party to having the Seanad pass a pious resolution seeking a further conference in connection with this Boundary problem.</P>
      <P>I am essentially a man of peace; I do not blow hot and cold; I have always been an advocate of peace; I have never wanted to see one Irishman against another, and I do not want to see it now.  I do not want to see civil war, but at the same time there is a certain dignity that we ought to uphold on behalf of the people whom we represent. It is not by craving or begging people who are not prepared to meet us in a friendly spirit that we can get ahead.  We ought to stand up to them like men and demand our rights on behalf of our unfortunate fellow-countrymen who are being terrorised and blackguarded by those people whom we are asked to enter into conference with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the Catholic population of the North of Ireland is not a safe position to-day.  We have got to assert our manhood and set aside all <Col N="1060" /> this kind of humbug and nonsense about goodwill and toleration for people who will not have toleration, and who will not meet us in a spirit of good-will. The more you endeavour to placate the people responsible for trouble in the North of Ireland, the more will they be prepared to kick you.  The only one Ulsterman I ever knew was James Connolly, and he told me that you could never placate those people. The only way you will ever get them to have goodwill or to understand the situation is by standing up to them and letting them have all they want. I do not want civil war, and I am not anxious for fighting.  Neither do I want cant or humbug, and, therefore, I will oppose the resolution and vote against it.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Senator who has just spoken fully understands the resolution.  We are not asking the Government to withdraw from the Commission, and we are not asking that the Commission should come to an end.  We perfectly understand the Government's promise to those people.  The Government promised those people the Treaty and they are bound to give the people of this country the Treaty; they cannot give anything else but the Treaty.  What the resolution suggests is that before the Commission has reported, President Cosgrave, without giving anything away whatever, should make another appeal to the North to meet him in counsel.  He is surrendering nothing. I think we quite recognise that nothing will probably come out of that appeal of President Cosgrave.  To some extent we have to think of the future; we have to think of educating the next generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Results of a very evil kind may happen from the report of the Commission, no matter what way it reports, and it is exceedingly important that no responsibility for those results should lie with the Government of the Free State. I have no hope of seeing Ireland united in my time, or of seeing Ulster won in my time; but I believe it will be won in the end, and not because we fight it, but because we govern this country well.  We can do that, if I may be <Col N="1061" /> permitted as an artist and a writer to say so, by creating a system of culture which will represent the whole of this country and which will draw the imagination of the young towards it.</P>
    <P>Now, I have spoken very seriously but I want to turn from seriousness to a fact which has been burning in my imagination since this meeting began &mdash;a discovery I made which has lightened this serious subject for me.  I have been looking for a historical precedent for the remarkable fact that certain Englishmen who afterwards became Cabinet Ministers and in other ways rose to the highest positions in the State went over to Ulster about 15 years ago and armed the people at a time of entire peace and urged them, and are now urging them, to use these arms against us.  I have found a historical precedent which establishes that it is an old custom of the British Government.  I have found that Edmund Burke in the middle of the eighteenth century drew attention to a very remarkable item in the Estimates of the year.  It was an item of so much money for the purchase of five gross of scalping knives, which scalping knives were intended to be given to the American Indians that they might scalp the French.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but some remarks that have fallen from Senator Farren make me think it is really a fact that he has not seen the point of this resolution.  He seems to speak from the point of view that if the Commission is appointed the various areas in which our Catholic fellow-citizens live, will be undoubtedly restored to the Free State.  Now, what lies behind this resolution is a great fear that is in many of our minds that no such solution or no such decision will be arrived at by the Commission, and that it is extremely probable that after the Commission has concluded, things will be very little better than they are this minute.  If that is so, and I have no doubt it was in Senator Douglas's mind when he proposed this resolution, a very unsatisfactory state of affairs would result.  I would ask Senator Farren to consider for a moment what <Col N="1062" /> really lies behind this resolution.  If it had been possible to take up any subject or any matter upon which it was certain that there would be a tremendous difference of opinion, and almost an impossibility of agreement, between North and South, it is this very Boundary question.  That subject has been picked out solely, and has been used enormously against us by certain political parties on the other side of the water and by the Press.  It was a magnificent thing to give them to use in that way.  Why I like this resolution is that it records the fact that in the opinion of the Seanad, that is not the position the Boundary problem ought to occupy.  We who have been living now for two years under the conditions of a Northern Government and a Free State Government know that there are standing in the way of progress both for the people of Northern and Southern Ireland, large numbers of questions which can only be settled properly by a body upon which the North and the South are represented.  That these problems and the settlement of these problems are vitally connected with the welfare of every one of us, we are convinced, and that these problems in reality are far bigger and greater than the Boundary problem in any way that it is likely to be settled, is an undoubted fact.  That being so, we think that it is wise that the Seanad should say that there are these great difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McLoughlin undoubtedly foreshadows that if such a discussion took place, he at any rate could foresee the settlement of this area question and this Governmental question as regards what I am calling our Free State citizens, because they wish to come back into the Free State.  Therefore, I refer to them as fellow-citizens of ours.  If an inquiry took place on some such lines as these, I understood Senator McLoughlin to mean that probably an arrangement could be made with the Northern Government which would secure them a standing such as they would be willing to accept, and that there was a possibility that the Boundary question might be settled not by drawing a hard-and-fast line and saying <Col N="1063" />&ldquo;It is there,&rdquo; but that we might make such an arrangement for mutual working on the Boundary question and all the questions connected with the transferred services and everything else as would take it away from being ruled on by a Commission such as this, with one Chairman sitting between two other individuals, each arguing all he can for his own case.  A far better tribunal would be a set of men meeting to discuss these great problems which really deal with the whole welfare of the North and the South of Ireland.</P>
    <P>They would be far fitter and far better than any judge, no matter where he came from or how great he may be, than any arbitrator putting the Southern Irish case or any arbitrator putting the Northern Irish case, far better and more fitted to deal with matters tied up in all these questions, and to see if it is not possible to get a settlement on some such grounds as these.</P>
    <P>I am quite with Senator Farren in saying that we do not wish, in any shape or form, to see these fellow-citizens of ours cut off from us.  I doubt very much if Senator Farren, thinking over the matter in that way, would oppose such a resolution as that which points the way in which Irishmen themselves can settle their own differences and solve the very great problems that are troubling us, impoverishing us, and making us enemies one with the other, and which we are fighting against to the best of our ability all the time.  I do not think Senator Farren is right when he talks as he does about good-will and everything of that kind.  I do believe that there is, both in the South and in the North, that good-will existing, if it can only be put into the right channels, to settle this matter as it ought to be settled, and I do believe that the Seanad is doing right in passing this resolution, and in recording their opinion that the Boundary question is not by itself the one thing that should be held up for us to fight about, but that we should couple it up with the other great outstanding questions with regard to which the North and the South should put their heads together and establish a body to deal with&mdash;a <Col N="1064" /> body containing both Northerners and Southerners in any proportion that may be settled.  Then we really will see Ireland managing her affairs properly at last.  Eventually, it may be that the North may find out that in the South we are as reasonable as they require, and that we are managing our affairs so well that, to help to develop the whole of Ireland, they will join us. The day for that is not yet.  But there is nothing to be got by our trying to see the faults of the Northerners and the Northerners trying to see ours.  It will be got by men of good-will, searching out the problem and doing their best to follow what is pointed out in this resolution&mdash;that is to say, to put the Boundary question in its proper perspective, its proper place, and make it part of a settlement which I hope this Seanad will aid in every possible way.</P>

      <P>With the spirit of the resolution I think there are very few who disagree, but Senator Douglas threw out a suggestion, following upon the lines of Senator McLoughlin's speech, that certain guarantees should exist.  I think, Sir, nothing can be done unless Proportional Representation and the old electoral divisions are restored in the North of Ireland. Until these things are done I think there can be very little co-operation, even for the benefit of the whole of Ireland.  With the spirit of the resolution I would be in thorough agreement if it were a little less vague, and if we knew absolutely in what terms co-operation was to take place.  I think we ought to know that, and I presume that Senator Douglas will enlighten us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is very much for me to say in reply. With regard to the point of view of Senator Farren, I do not know that there is so much fundamentally between us.  If the willingness which has been again and again expressed to enter into a conference with regard to out outstanding problems means taking up the attitude that he says, I would not vote for my own resolution. But I do not believe it means anything of the kind.  I think the statements that are frequently made that to talk <Col N="1065" /> with a man whom you do not understand and who does not understand you, to suggest that the Boundary question is not of your making, that you were willing to confer all along&mdash;I do not think that weakens our case&mdash;I, at any rate, on that question would clearly and absolutely join issue.  My resolution was moved not entirely on my own initiative, but after consultation with and on the suggestion of several members of the Seanad.  I do not claim any personal credit in the matter.  But the main reason why I was glad when asked to move this resolution was because I believed, particularly in view of my experiences in America in the last few weeks, that an assiduous propaganda has suggested everywhere that the difficulty with regard to the Boundary is of our making.  I think that every step we can take, even by somewhat vague resolutions, which because they are resolutions of the Seanad will be published, as they would not be if they were simply speeches, will, I believe, be strengthening our position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely agree with Senator Mrs. Wyse Power, who states that we cannot settle outstanding problems by ignoring the feelings and the wishes of the people on the Boundary, and by not making adequate provision for their safety, and seeing, at any rate, that they have proper safeguards to assure them that they will be at least able to carry on their business, their worship and their occupation with absolute freedom <Col N="1066" /> or with as much freedom as it is possible for the Government to achieve for them.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Wyse Power asked why there is not more detail in the resolution. That is the fate of all resolutions. Personally, I could draft a resolution with more detail to suit me.  This resolution was drafted by a group, and it was felt in its general terms that it expressed a fundamental idea without attempting to set out specific details.  On the whole, I am inclined to think that if, in the present set of circumstances, we have no wish to do anything more than to stand behind the Executive Council, this is the wise way to frame the resolution.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to say in view of comments made in the debate, that I do not visualise this resolution or any such conference as might take place as being in any way properly used to put off whatever preparations that have been made for the setting up of the Boundary Commission.  My view is that the Commission must, and ought, to go on with its work, and that there should be no unnecessary delay, but that while preparations are being made, a further effort, if such can be made, should be made, to create such a set of circumstances in which either it need not meet, or if it did meet, it would meet in a different atmosphere and with the hope of achieving something substantial.</P>

      <P>Before the Seanad adjourns, perhaps Senators would be interested to know that I received, after the Adjournment some weeks ago, the report of Sir Edward Lutyens as regards the existing arrangements for protection against fire in connection with the Museum and the adjacent buildings.  He sent that report to me direct, and on receipt of it, as the Seanad had discontinued its sittings, I wrote to him acknowledging it and thanking him on behalf of the Seanad for his courtesy in the matter. I have had this report typed, and copies of it are in the office of the Assistant Clerk, to be obtained by any Senator who feels an interest in the matter.  I may say, that while Sir Edward suggests certain things to be done, his report is not at all of an alarmist character, and any Senator who is anxious or interested in the matter can obtain a copy of it by applying at the office of the Assistant Clerk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other matter I wish to mention is, that perhaps some Senators may be rather surprised to find that they are still located here.  The explanation is: immediately after the Recess began I took up the matter and went into it with the President.  He naturally referred me to the Board of Works.  I found that the hands of the Board of Works were tied, because they could not do anything to the Chamber and the adjoining rooms that are being allocated to us until they were first vacated by the Royal Dublin Society.  The Royal Dublin Society were engaged, during all the period <Col N="1068" /> covered by the Recess, in negotiations with the Government with the view to getting alternative accommodation, and while these negotiations were going on they retained their occupation of all these premises.  The result is that until about a week ago that particular chamber had not been vacated. In that state of affairs I consulted with Senator Douglas, and our idea is that it is quite plain that the necessary changes and alterations which we will require to have these rooms adequate for the accommodation of the Seanad will take some weeks.  Consequently we could not hope to have the use of them to the full extent when we meet again.  It was suggested that we might see if the Board of Works could so temporarily equip them as to enable us to have at least the use of the large room as a meeting-place until the Christmas Recess, and that during the Christmas Recess all the necessary extra constructive work might then be carried out.</P>
    <P>It is a question really as between remaining on here as we are until Christmas, or utilising the incomplete accommodation that is to be provided in Leinster House.  My own impression, after carefully going into the whole matter is, that it would really be wiser for us to stay on here as we are and not have a half-finished job.  Then the Board of Works could take the matter in hands at once and complete the entire thing before we meet again in January.  If that is the wish of the Seanad, I shall so communicate it to the Board of Works.  I may mention that I arranged to meet the architect of the Board of Works on Monday next, at 3 o'clock, at our new habitation, and I should be very glad if any Senators who find it convenient to do so would come there on Monday next at 3 o'clock, because the object of meeting the architect is to suggest to him and to give him an outline of the alterations and changes that we propose to have effected.  I do not want that to be left entirely on the shoulders of the Vice-Chairman and myself, because we might have to bear the brunt of it later on.</P>
