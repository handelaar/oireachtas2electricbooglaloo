      <P>I have notice from Senator Joachim Loughrey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to indicate when it is proposed to replace the present prefabricated buildings in Donagh Protestant National School, County Donegal with a proper brick building.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Loughrey as suitable for discussion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed to take all Stages of Item No. 2 today?  In view of the fact that the Independent Senators have withdrawn their original motion on Northern Ireland, can I have from the Leader of the House a definite commitment that next week we will be taking Item No. 7 on today's Order Paper and that there will be adequate time given <Col N="574" /> for that debate?  Also on the Order of Business, last week and the week before I, and many other Senators, asked that we get some indication of upcoming legislation from the Leader of the House.  In regard to the present Order Paper, the amount of work we are being asked to do would bring a moderate county council into disrepute.  We are simply not getting the work.  We want to do it.  Surely the Leader of the House can ascertain whether the legislation is there and he can put pressure on the Government to see that we are given the work which this House wants to do.  These are the points I wanted to raise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two issues which I wish to raise.  First, I reiterate the question which was asked by the Leader of Fine Gael in this House, that we get a commitment from the Leader of the House that we will be dealing with the question of Anglo-Irish relations next week.  I would like to have that on the record of the House, as we agreed earlier in the week.</P>
      <P>Again, I reiterate what has been said for three consecutive weeks about the total lack of effort by the Government to provide this House with suitable initiated legislation in order to produce a legislative programme to keep us going until Christmas.  I am sure we will hear the old answers again, that the House does not normally produce a programme of legislation, that the House has sat more often this year than any other year, etc.  The fact is that after three weeks of labouring the mountain has finally produced a mouse in the shape of a piece of legislation which is being dealt with this afternoon which if the title is subtracted has precisely 22 lines to be dealt with over the afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just one point. I would say until such time as we get a proper programme of work, properly organised in an efficient manner, this will come up week after week.  It is just not <Col N="575" /> good enough.  What it appears to show to us is that the other House have upstaged us in the business of initiating legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the request by Senator Manning about the debate on the North of Ireland, I would welcome an early opportunity for this House to discuss this subject particularly having regard to the statement by the Leader of the Labour Party in another place today which he is communicating to the Taoiseach. It is important that Members of this House would have an opportunity to discuss all aspects of Anglo-Irish relations.  Could I also ask the Leader of the House in his capacity as an international president of the Euro-Arab parliamentary group if he is aware of the Government's intentions regarding the recently declared Palestinian State in view of the fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask about two matters.  One is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>In a very simple way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a very simple man. The first is to ask when the motion concerning the position of Soviet Jews will be taken again.  It was given time last week and we were very grateful for that. It was a most serious debate and it would be helpful to know when it will be taken again.  Will it be taken tomorrow or next week?</P>
      <P>The second specific matter is the question of the Incitement to Hatred Bill.  I raised this before and the Leader of the House said he would make inquiries with his Government because a firm commitment was given by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, to this House that an Incitement to Hatred Bill would be introduced, as a result of attempts that were made to amend the Video Recording Bill.  As a result of pressure applied in this House, legislation was promised. We are entitled to see if it would be appropriate to have it introduced in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to support what Senator Manning has said with regard to the debate on Northern Ireland, particularly <Col N="577" /> as one of the signatories to the motion that was withdrawn in consultation with the Government party.  I believe we got an undertaking with regard to that matter.  As far as the question of Soviet Jews goes &mdash; to return briefly to that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is part of my simplicity and I am glad to have guidance.  I would have said that I welcomed the implicit recognition of the State of Israel, to which Senator Ferris referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also should like to hear an assurance from the Leader of the House that we are taking Item No. 7 next week and that we are taking it without the usual imposition of time restraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just two brief questions, one is to ask for an indication from the Leader of the House as to when he expects us to take Item No. 5.  We began a very interesting debate on that last week.  The other question is to ask if he could give us an advance indication of what Item No. 4 relates to.  We are not actually taking it today.  We will be required to take it before 7 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Item No. 4, a report has been circulated.  If the Senator has not got it we will ensure that she will get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It refers to Standing Orders.  We will take Item No. 5 on Wednesday next when we will continue that debate.  Item No. 7 is an open-ended debate.  We will spend all day Thursday on it.  Regarding the Incitement to Hatred Bill, I will get in touch with the <Col N="578" /> Department of Justice and the Minister in this regard.</P>
      <P>This time last year there was a problem that we were taking too much Government business and that motions were not being taken.  Senator J. O'Toole mentioned the question of Government business. This year there is rather a reversal in the sense that we will get rid of many motions on the Order Paper in the next couple of weeks.  We will have quite an amount of Government business between now and Christmas.  I cannot say exactly what Bills will be in.  I apologise for that and I make no bones about the fact that, like other people, I am in the dark as to what business will be coming forward.  There will be a number of Bills, including a major labour Bill, coming before this House before Christmas.  I can guarantee that the Opposition parties will be informed in good time as to when we will get it.  They will get time to have a look at it.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris and Norris mentioned the agreement that was reached in Algiers by the Palestinian National Council. Senator Norris said that he was delighted that at last the Palestinian National Council had recognised the State of Israel.  I wish that the situation could be reciprocated.  It is about time the Israelis recognised the Palestinian National Council.</P>

      <P>On section 1 and the reference to the Minister for Finance which we touched on when debating Second Stage, I, and the other speakers, <Col N="580" /> referred to the fact that there was something faintly inappropriate about this Bill being taken by the Minister for Finance, in that it dealt closely with issues of overseas development assistance to Third World countries.  I, and many speakers queried whether it would have been more appropriate to have it taken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and should not the reference here indicate the Minister for Foreign Affairs rather than the Minister for Finance.  While I accept that it is a money Bill, I would be very interested to hear detailed comments from the Minister as to the appropriateness of the legislation coming under the Ministry for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia argued in favour of this point on Second Stage.  Section 1 is a definition section which assigns responsibility for our relations with MIGA to the Minister for Finance.  The position is that the Minister for Finance has statutory responsibility for our relationships with the World Bank and its existing affiliates.  This responsibility derives from the Bretton Woods Act, 1957, the International Finance Corporation Act, 1958 and the International Development Association Act, 1960.  Therefore, it would be anomalous, if in the case of MIGA alone &mdash; also a World Bank affiliate &mdash; a similar responsibility was not established.  Basically, what we are saying is that we have been consistent under the various international Acts to which we subscribe, that the Minister for Finance has responsibility for all World Bank affiliates.  MIGA is another one of those affiliates.  It would be a conflict in financial management and with our whole involvement with the World Bank if we were to take MIGA and make it the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  That would not be in order.  Consequently, this is the reason why the Minister for Finance is handling it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mr. Bulbulia Mr. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, I accept what the Minister has said.  Can he give an indication that there will be extensive <Col N="581" /> consultations between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs about this, and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; and in particular the part of that Department dealing with overseas development matters &mdash; will know about the operations of MIGA and about the funding?  Can he indicate from which Department the funding will come and the mechanisms for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was constant discussion between the Department of Finance officials responsible for this Bill and the Development Co-operation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Prior to this Bill coming before any of the Houses of the Oireachtas or gong to Government, there were very detailed discussions between the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs. There are always discussions on any decisions that are to be taken at World Bank level or at MIGA level pertaining to Third World development and so on. I assure the House that that will continue to be the situation.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 2 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister explain to me under what circumstances it is envisaged that the State would receive moneys from the agency?  I am referring to section 3 (4) which states:</P>
      <P>Any moneys received by the State from the Agency shall be placed to the credit of the account of the Exchequer...</P>
      <P>Could the Minister explain to me under what circumstances our State would receive money from the Agency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It could happen that we would be obliged to put 10 per cent of the money which we have committed <Col N="582" /> upfront by way of a cash contribution. The balance of that would be in promissory notes and callable capital.  If, for a particular reason, some Third World country defaulted on its commitment to a project investor and those promissory notes or capital had to be called, we might forward our money to make up for that default as our contribution to MIGA.  If, in return, the Third World country came along a year or six months later and the moneys came back into MIGA, they could then be returned by MIGA to Ireland as part of Ireland's contribution of the on-call money.  When that money came back it would be a matter for the Minister for Finance to decide what would be done with it.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say to the Minister that subrogation rights are a natural principle of insurance.  In this case, section 4 clearly makes the point that subrogation rights of the agencies shall be recognised by the State.  By definition we are dealing with Third World countries.  They are poor countries.  In the knowledge that we are dealing with poorer countries, how will investors feel about subrogation rights?  In the normal insurance contract there should be no difficulty, but in the knowledge that one is dealing with much poorer countries, where there is less chance of getting money back and, unfortunately, where there is a tendency to take rather than give, does the Minister see this particular section as being one that might in the future cause problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not visualise any problems with it because any country subscribing to MIGA must automatically accept the subrogation rights.  That is part of the whole acceptance of the convention and its structure.  Once you accept anything, you accept everything. Consequently, the subrogation rights <Col N="583" /> have to be recognised.  Article 18 of the convention requires that MIGA subrogation rights be recognised by all members of the Agency.  In essence, this means that the event of compensation being paid by the Agency to an investor the Agency would then be entitled to assume all the rights of that investor against the host country in which the event giving rise to the claim originally occurred.  This section makes the necessary provision for the recognition of MIGA subrogation rights, should an Irish firm be involved in a compensation claim. Therefore, we do not visualise any difficulties there.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 5 and 6, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SCHEDULE.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Schedule be the Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like your guidance, a Chathaoirligh, on this.  I have a long number of questions on the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite open for discussion but one decision only.  It is open to whatever length of debate or discussion you wish with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  May I begin by asking a question about the payments of subscriptions under Articles 8 and 9 of the Schedule?  Article 8 deals with the payments of subscriptions and states that they may be made in freely usable currencies and also that 25 per cent of the paid-in cash portion of developing member countries may be paid in their own currencies.  That sounds very helpful, except that Article 9 states that the value of one currency in terms of another shall be reasonably determined by the Agency after consultation with the International Monetary Fund.  Does that effectively mean that the official exchange rate of a developing country <Col N="584" /> will not be allowed to be the criterion for the valuation of currency, but the valuation of the International Monetary Fund?</P>
      <P>It seems that the benefits of allowing people to pay their subscriptions in their own currency will be effectively removed if they have to accept the IMF's valuation of their currency which is often, in many developing countries, quite different from the valuation that the country themselves put on it.  Many countries have very serious exchange controls in order to protect what would otherwise be a very vulnerable currency.  I would like some clarification from the Minister on that.</P>

      <P>The exchange rate situation does not come into it.  Each developing country may pay, in its own currency, 25 per cent of the amount it is obliged to pay.  The balance of the money is on call as required.  That would be paid in the country's own currency.</P>

      <P>The subscriptions that are listed in Schedule A of the convention identify subscriptions as being paid in millions of special drawing rights.  I am not an expert in international high finance but there must be some anomalies between the valuations of special drawing rights and the relationship with the individual currencies of different countries.  I cannot imagine that countries would be allowed to define their currency with respect to the special drawing rights.  I would presume that the reverse is the case.  Perhaps what I need is more education on special drawing rights.  Are they, in fact, determined by the country or by the Agency because the currency cannot be paid in their own currency.  It must be paid in special drawing rights. Is the relationship between a developing country's currency and special drawing rights determined by the country or by the Agency?</P>

      <P>One could answer simply and say that both the country and the Agency will be involved.  There will be consultation between the country and <Col N="585" /> the Agency.  Whenever it shall be necessary for the purposes of this convention to determine the value of one currency in terms of another, such value shall be reasonably determined by the Agency after consultation with the International Monetary Fund.  There will be consultation between MIGA &mdash; being the Agency &mdash; and the country.  If there are difficulties there, then there will be consultation with the International Monetary Fund and an agreement will be reached.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that there is no guarantee to the developing country on the status of their currency.  I am familiar particularly with countries like Tanzania which, when I visited them, I found that the international exchange rate for-their currency was quite different from the domestic exchange rate.  There were good, if very painful domestic reasons for that.  It is necessary, if this is as benevolent an agreement as it is represented, to understand how well protected are the interests of developing countries.  Are they being drawn into the IMF's version of their role in the world or are they being allowed to maintain their own identity, because the IMF has a quite different view of how a developing country should develop from that of the governments of many developing countries.</P>
      <P>I find the reference to &ldquo;after consultation with the International Monetary Fund&rdquo; objectionable. It has been responsible already for the destabilisation of many countries and indeed for the enormous oppression of the poor of many countries.  I find the role of the IMF in determining or contributing to the determination of the value of a local currency quite ominous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to the preamble in the Schedule.  Underlying all this is the need to strengthen international co-operation for economic development.  We saw from the list under Schedule A that South Africa was entitled to membership of MIGA by virtue of its membership of the World <Col N="586" /> Bank.  While the Minister indicated when he was speaking last week that South Africa had not, in fact, taken out membership or put up its papers and taken out its shares, nevertheless, I find it extraordinary that South Africa can be involved in something like this, given that the whole purpose of it is to strengthen international co-operation for economic development.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to indicate to me if he feels there is something extraordinarily irrational and strange about this because everybody knows that South Africa is involved in a policy of massive destabilisation in southern Africa, that because of its activities in Mozambique that country is on its knees and has the highest infant mortality rate in the world and enormous problems of poverty.  It is an unnatural disaster in that country as opposed to the natural disasters which it manages to cope with admirably.  I fail to understand how Ireland can involve itself in MIGA side-by-side with a country like South Africa which is entitled to participation in MIGA and whose actions and activities are quite the contrary to what MIGA is all about.  I would be very interested indeed to hear the Minister comment on that and I would like to ask him whether he shares my reservations, my concerns and my feelings of disbelief that this should be so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I simply add to what Senator Bulbulia has said?  There is apparently a view in the world that certain areas of activity are exempt from morality.  One of those is in the operation of international finance.  Matters that would be very harshly judged in other areas are apparently exempted.  We will, for instance, advocate a total sporting boycott of South Africa&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are, a Chathaoirligh, and we are talking about very precise details of the Schedule of a Bill in specific terms.  I want the Minister give this House what it deserves, which is an elaborate and detailed justification for an extraordinary decision to allow the most malign force in one of the poorest continents of the world to masquerade as contributing to development aid.  That is a moral question.  It is not a political question.  It is not a financial question.  It is a moral question.  Any good that comes out of this Bill is completely undermined by the gratuitous granting of respectability to what is the most malign and destabilising force in the whole of the African continent.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot hide behind international conventions.  There is some evidence of how international politics operate in these businesses in another part of that Schedule, which I will come to later on.  Would the Minister explain to me how we can, on the one hand, claim to be concerned about issues and, on the other hand, apparently sit down around a table and contribute to the masquerade that South Africa is somehow a benevolent contributor to international development?  It is the single greatest cause of destabilisation, of poverty and of economic underdevelopment in the whole of southern Africa.</P>
      <P>Ask the leader or anybody who works in any of the frontline States what their greatest problem is &mdash; it is South Africa. It is absolute and utter nonsense to suggest that somehow they can contribute anything other than spleen, malice and destabilisation to the process of development. It is an immoral association to allow them to be there.  I would suggest to the Minister that either we pretend, as we like to, that finance is somehow something separate or else this Bill is fundamentally flawed, as I said on Second Stage, because of the philosophical acceptance of South Africa as a possible contributor to world development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Senator's points of view and I can share them indeed, but the situation is that South <Col N="588" /> Africa is a member of the World Bank and that gives it rights to be part of the MIGA structure.  We cannot, as a country, deprive South Africa of being a member of the World Bank; neither can we prevent them from qualifying for membership of a subsidiary organisation of the World Bank which deals in financial matters, the primary purpose of which in this case is to improve the situation in Third World countries.  It is a matter for South Africa to decide its involvement with MIGA.  As far as I know, they have not signed or even ratified MIGA as yet.</P>
      <P>We are there from a contributory point of view, making our contribution to, improving the standards, opportunities and livelihoods of people and dealing with the difficulties which the people in the Third World encounter.  The Agency itself, its staff or its president, cannot interfere in the political affairs of any member.  Without prejudice to the right of the Agency to take into account all the circumstances surrounding an investment, the Agency shall not be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member or members concerned. Considerations relevant to their decisions shall be weighed impartially in order to achieve the purposes stated in Article II.</P>
      <P>While I can identify with what the Senators say, the main thrust and purpose of this Agency is to improve the opportunities and to expedite development in Third World countries.  It is a World Bank structure and member countries of the World Bank are entitled to gain MIGA but that is at their discretion.  We cannot interfere in that situation.  It is up to us to decide what part we play.  We are playing our part in a very honourable way.  We have agreed to the convention since 1985 and we are now about to take the steps necessary to enable us to ratify it here.  I think it is in the interests of the Third World that we do it.</P>

I understand that <Col N="589" /> the Committee Stage of any legislation involves asking appropriate questions of detail on the section or Schedule and I would ask you to try to stick to that.  I am not hassling any Senator, that is not my style, but I do not want to go back over the Second Stage.  We are on Committee Stage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept the point made by the Minister but the arguments of the two previous contributors are irrefutable. As a country who has taken a stand in many areas, particularly relating to South Africa, ahead of other very important nations including Great Britain, we would have expected that our Government in entering into this convention, as a contracting State, would at least have expressed reservations about the participation of South Africa.  We know we cannot stop them but if all the nations involved, as we are, in this area did that it would create a climate of opinion that might change the administration in South Africa or at least make them conscious of the world's demand that they should perform within certain guidelines.  We accept it is difficult but can we have any assurance that the Minister expects any reservations at all about South Africa's participation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from what Senator Ferris has said, part of the difficulty is that the Minister of State in the Department of Finance is dealing with this and the questions we are asking could perhaps, because they involve matters of Irish foreign policy, be more comprehensively dealt with in a philosophical fashion by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I understand the Minister must stick to the financial brief and specifically to the measures in the Bill but, at the same time, you cannot absolutely divide matters of principle from any legislation and what we are raising here is a matter of principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given Ireland's publicly stated attitude towards South Africa, the question <Col N="590" /> Senator Ferris put is a very reasonable one.  Have we demurred at all at seeing South Africa listed as being a member of MIGA?  Have we said that it in some ways contravenes our attitude and our knowledge of the activities of South Africa or are we content to hide in the thickets of diplomacy?  Have we decided that this is merely a financial measure and, as such, we will not query and we will not rock the boat?</P>
    <P>I hope that is not so.  I hope, if this debate yields anything that the Minister will be able to give us an assurance that the Irish voice will be raised in query as to why South Africa is to be involved in MIGA which is essentially about development in the Third World when the world knows that South Africa is involved in massive destabilisation and destruction in southern Africa.  I want to know that the Irish Government will point out the ambivalence, the ambiguity and the inconsistency in the position of South Africa <i>vis-à-vis</i> MIGA.</P>

      <P>Before I call the Minister, you admitted yourself, Senator Bulbulia, that you were discussing a principle. You even used the word &ldquo;principle&rdquo;. The Second Stage of this Bill was agreed in this House.  I want the House to work properly; I want every Senator in it to be happy and every Minister but we cannot go back into pinning, and I use the word &ldquo;pinning&rdquo; carefully, a Minister for Finance on something that you feel a Minister for Foreign Affairs should be answering.  The Second Stage was agreed.  I appreciate what an excellent Senator you are.

I have had ample opportunities in the past and will have in the future to debate that issue <Col N="591" /> extensively in the House and elsewhere but the fundamental question is still there because South Africa is listed and it is entitled to participate, as we are, and I want to know whether our voices have been raised in protest or query.</P>

      <P>I appreciate very much what the Senators have said but we commenced negotiations on the convention as far back as 1985 and signed it in 1986. I presume the Minister for Finance of the day was fully aware of the situation and voiced whatever reservations he had pertaining to any country being involved.</P>
      <P>We are left with two options really, as a result of what the Senators say.  One is that because of the involvement of South Africa in the World Bank which gives it the right to be involved with MIGA, we opt out of this situation because we do not like South Africa and we renege on our contribution to MIGA.  The other option we would have is to resign from the World Bank and I am sure nobody is suggesting that.  Our record is there in the field of human relations and human rights.  Ireland will continue, no matter what forum it is involved in, national, international, European or whatever, to voice what we believe at any time to be Ireland's position pertaining to any country's abuse of power or rights of individuals. I hope we will always continue in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, the question is that we have, on the one hand, had an assurance from the Minister that South Africa is there because it is there.  That is fair enough.  The position about Democratic Kampuchea is that it does not exist. It is a figment of a conspiracy between the United States of America and China to refuse to recognise a Government which runs a country called the People's Republic of Kampuchea which actually has a capital, a government and people.</P>
      <P>There is no such place as Democratic Kampuchea.  I would like to know why one puppet regime which does not exist, which is in fact controlled by the greatest mass murderer since Hitler, is allowed to masquerade not as a government but as a country; that is what the Schedule says. It does not say Governments, it says countries.  I am entitled as a Member of this House not to have my intelligence offended because people will not tell me that we are actually talking about judgments being made.  Article 34 of the Schedule is the one that is made a mockery of here.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to the right of the Agency to take into account all the circumstances surrounding an investment, they shall not be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member or members concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What an appalling joke when the legitimate Government of Kampuchea is kicked out and a puppet, a conspiracy of terrorists with a record of genocide only <Col N="593" /> exceeded by Adolph Hitler, are allowed to masquerade as a country because it happens to suit the global interests of certain super powers.  Our Government have a reasonably good record on this issue in the United Nations I do not want to talk about the Government's position.</P>
    <P>I want to know under what circumstances can a non-existent country or a non-existent regime, funded only by the United States, and China, be allowed to masquerade as a government of a country which is sorely in need of overseas aid.  The whole thing defies description and raises, as I said before, fundamental questions about the background to legislation such as this.  Democratic Kampuchea is a name for the greatest genocide since Hitler and it is quite disgraceful that they should be allowed to be involved in this.  They would not be allowed to be involved in this if the spirit of Article 34 of the Schedule meant anything at all.  It does not mean anything at all, it is a joke.</P>

The very fact that they are named here &mdash; their names should be withdrawn and expunged from the record.

We as public representatives are currently being very actively lobbied by an organisation which has the highest credibility in this country for its marvellous work for the people of what is sometimes referred to as the Third World.  They have made strong representations on the question of Kampuchea particularly because at the start of 1989 there will be a lot of media attention focused on this troubled country because <Col N="595" /> of the tenth anniversary of the overthrow of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge and I particularly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is before this House to enable Ireland to make its contribution to further Third World development. We either accept what is now before us and enable Ireland to make a further contribution or reject it and deprive us of the opportunity of making that contribution.  Of course, we take into account what the honourable Senators have said about the various situations. Ireland, of course, in every situation would take that into account and has taken that into account, but we either accept this convention or reject it.  We <Col N="596" /> cannot change the convention.  It has been negotiated and agreed internationally and it is now before each country which wishes to get involved for ratification.

      <P>I am endeavouring not to be disorderly but my feeling is that there are matters of detail in this agreement and the only place you can tease out the detail of an agreement is on Committee Stage.  I would like the Minister to explain to me how Article 34, which says in fine flowery language that &ldquo;They shall not be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member or members concerned&rdquo;.  That is admirable. It is written in, it is in fine form, but the Schedule is quite clearly affected by the political character of mythological countries that do not exist.  Can the Minister explain to me how he can reconcile Article 34 which says there should be no concern about the political character with the fact that because of the political character of the People's Republic of Kampuchea it is excluded from this agreement and the so-called Democratic Kampuchea, which does not exist, is made a party to the agreement?  How can he reconcile the phraseology of Article 34 with the actual political intent and practice in the Schedule to the convention?</P>

I would like to have an assurance that the World Bank, which I gather is the administering body on this occasion, will be made very clearly aware of the strong feelings which are reflected here in the House, the strong feelings of a very large majority of people in this country, particularly those who are aware through aid organisations and so on of the extraordinary situation in Kampuchea.</P>

      <P>I can give the assurance to the Senator that I will discuss it with my ministerial colleagues.  I will be asking my officials to discuss it with their counterparts in Foreign Affairs and we will bring the very serious reservations which have been very clearly expressed here to the notice of the relevant organisations and personnel involved.</P>
      <P>In answer to Senator Ryan, Article 34 clearly refers to the president and the staff of the agency.  They must take into account all the circumstances surrounding an investment, they shall not be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member or members concerned.  They are an executive body with control on the investment that is being made and they have to make their decision based on the financial viability of the project, the security of the finance and the risks that are concerned. It is obvious that there will be certain risks to be taken into account, but because the project is being done by a certain person from a certain country or a certain company from a certain country or the investment is being made in a certain country, they cannot discriminate against either the company, the investor or the country. They cannot do that.  They must make it on the clearly laid down guidelines that are there and take into account the risks that are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other subsidiary bodies. There is at least one World Bank affiliate involved in similar work.  It has taken risks and losses but overall it has been able to balance its books.  It is the contribution of the developed nations to improving the lot of the underdeveloped <Col N="598" /> nations.  We are obliged to help and as a small country we are doing our job and doing it reasonably well.  I think it would be the wish of the Senators and the Irish people that we would continue to help in whatever way we can with the Third World development.</P>

      <P>At this stage, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach has come into the House I want to propose a vote of sympathy to Senator McDonald on the sad loss of his mother.  All I can do is to say he was one of the lucky ones because she lived to be a wonderful age.  I know it is not going to be easy in the weeks ahead for him.  I was not as lucky because I lost my mother at seven.  My deepest sympathy goes to Senator McDonald.  I deeply regret I was not able to attend his late mother's funeral because I was tied up.

The greatest tribute that could be paid to her and to the McDonald family was the large attendance of people from all over the country.

I lost my father in 1940 so I had a very close relationship with my mother.  It is a big loss.  However, when one is over 80, I presume one has to accept that one is on borrowed time.  She had the blessings of a very long and healthy life.  Only last week I renewed her driving licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She had a very peaceful passing.  She was a politically active person inasmuch as she always maintained a great interest in the country and she devoted a lot of her time to various charities and parish work.  She attended practically every Cumann na nGaedheal and Fine Gael branch meeting from the twenties right up to the very last one.  I think it is lovely that people can retain an interest in public affairs like that.  It is lovely to have such interests and be able to live out one's life to the full.  So, in the sorrow there is great consolation.  She was a very holy and <Col N="600" /> pious person and we have that great consolation and happiness.

One can imagine the howls of outrage if a rump of Nazi Germany was claiming to represent Germany in any institution &mdash; or a rump of exiled Nazis.  We have a similar position here. It is a depicable reflection, not on our Government who have to deal with realities but on the nature of international politics.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a few more questions about the provisions of the Schedule.  It is only fair to go through it in some sort of serial order.  I am particularly concerned about the covered risks and the provision on expropriation and similar measures which states:</P>
      <P>any legislative action or administrative action or omission attributable to the host government which has the effect of depriving the holder of a guarantee of his ownership or control of, or a substantial benefit from, his investment, with the exception of nondiscriminatory measures of general application which governments normally take...&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that if one government enters into what many people would have interpreted as, for instance in the case of the multinational oil companies with the Middle Eastern countries, an unfair arrangement about the valuation and exploitation of a country's natural resources that we have now guaranteed to them that if a subsequent regime refuses to expropriate those resources they will be compensated and that this is what is called funding international development?  In other words, if we have a regime like the one in Chile at present, which is well disposed to international companies and they get involved in the coppermining industry in Chile, and then if a future government decides to take it back, are we actually going to pay off the international corporations who do that?  It seems that expropriation is a case for compensation.  If find that rather peculiar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I want to clarify, as I did last week in my Second Stage speech, is that no investment can be made in any country without that country agreeing to it.  It must have the agreement of the host country.  That is the only way it can be made.  There will be no investment or agreement with MIGA unless agreement is reached on the investment proposed for that host country by the host country.  The Senator has talked about a situation where an investment is made and the government of that country at that time agrees to it and a subsequent government does not agree to it.  I cannot visualise a situation where it would be possible to renege in that situation. MIGA is there to secure the investment that is made.  If a new government in a particular country reneges or wants to change or opt out of an agreement already made by a previous government <Col N="606" /> then, of course, MIGA would have to be called in to act and pay off the investor affected.</P>
      <P>The Senator also talked about the expropriation risks and the involvement. Article 11 (a), Chapter III defines the expropriation risk.  It would encompass measures attributable to the host government, such as nationalisation, confiscation, sequestration, seizure, attachment and freezing of assets.  The phrase &ldquo;any legislative or administrative action&rdquo; in the provision includes measures by the executive but not measures taken by judicial bodies in the exercise of their functions.  Measures normally taken by governments to regulate their economic activities, such as taxation, environmental and labour legislation as well as normal measures for the maintenance of public safety are not intended to be covered by this provision unless they discriminate against the holder of the guarantee.  That is very important.</P>
      <P>In defining these measures the Agency's practice would not be meant to prejudice the rights of a member country or of investors under bilateral investment treaties, other treaties and international law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 12 came up on Second Stage but the Minister's answer, while it was a response, was hardly adequate.  Article 12 is about eligible investments and it says, under paragraph (d):</P>
      <P>In guaranteeing an investment, the Agency shall satisfy itself as to:</P>
      <P>(i)  the economic soundness of the investment and its contribution to the development of the host country;</P>
      <P>(ii)  compliance of the investment with the host country's laws and regulations;</P>
      <P>(iii)  consistency of the investment with the declared development objectives a priority of the host country; and</P>
      <P>(iv)  the investment conditions in the host country, including the availability of fair and equitable treatment and legal protection for the investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (iv) makes considerable sense and (iii) is reasonable.  I want to know where, in the Agency's assessment of a project, is there any reference to the ecological effect of a project, any reference to the impact on local indigenous populations of, for instance, a major infrastructural investment, as in the case of the building of dams which have resulted in significant expulsions of indigenous tribes in many developing countries and any effect on the world ecology by the destruction of rain forests &mdash; which is a form of development &mdash; any impact on indigenous food suplies by multinational investment in say cash crop farming.  I am well aware that the World Bank has begun to be concerned about those things but I understood that the Agency was independent and took its own decisions independently.  There is nothing in this Schedule which obliges the Agency to be <Col N="608" /> concerned about ecological, social and other consequences of what might appear to be, in global terms, an economically attractive investment.

      <P>I think the Senator will agree that the Schedule itself could not have all the technical details that one would like in order to cover every aspect but all projects, under the supervision of the World Bank, have an environmental assessment impact built into them.  Any subsidiary bodies would carry the same type of emphasis on their assessment of a project.  Of course the normal environmental and labour legislation and other legislation of the host country would have to be taken into account and negotiations, discussions and dialogue would have to ensue between the host country, the developer and MIGA before MIGA would be satisfied that the investment was justified and did not have any detrimental effect.</P>

      <P>The difficulty then is that we do not know what we are ratifying because we do not know what other areas of regulation by the World Bank are applicable to the Agency because they are not written down.  I assumed &mdash; which was reasonable &mdash; that the Schedule described what they were supposed to do and it would not have been impossible to talk about the economic soundness and the ecological soundness of a particular investment or the social and cultural consequences of a particular investment, if that was intended.  I have to say that I suspect that neither the ecological impact nor the environmental impact nor the impact on the indigenous population were thought about because this was drafted by the Minister for Finance and by the financially clever people rather than those with an expertise in the area of development.  That I suspect is why it was left out.</P>

We will be represented.  We will have an opportunity through the executive director to make our input into every project and proposal and we will be able to take into account the views of the Senators here, the views of Ireland in any situation. We will be able to say that we want certain conditions in to protect the environment and its people and to help countries in a broad, human way rather than in a totally commercial, avaricious way and that will be done.</P>

      <P>I am very interested in this aspect of the debate.  I have listened carefully to what has been said but I would have thought that some comfort could be found in some of the clauses here in Article 12 in that the development must always be consistent with the development objectives and priorities of the host country.  In other words, the host country &mdash; it would appear from this &mdash; has a very strong say in what it considers to be acceptable, suitable and consistent with its own objectives.  I see in this convention something of a partnership and a co-operation between the investing country and host country.  I feel less doubtful than Senator Ryan and I am reasonably hopeful that with that kind of co-operation and joint approach, the mistakes we have all seen being made and which have been made will be averted in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to say I do not share Senator Bulbulia's optimism in this matter.  I say this because Senator Ryan has very valuably raised matters such as the destruction of the rain forests and the record is perfectly clear on this.  The Amazon Basin has been raped, with the active participation and co-operation of the government in that region.  Nobody who is aware of the situation could take the slightest comfort from the fact that there will be discussions and negotiations involved in the host country.  The authorities in many of these countries, particularly with regard to the destruction of <Col N="610" /> natural resources, are the guilty parties and I share strongly in what Senator Ryan has said with regard to the necessity to protect these resources and to ensure that money from funds such as this are not applied in a way which would damage the interests of the majority of the citizens of any of these countries.  That has happened in the past and it must not be allowed to happen again.  I agree 100 per cent with Senator Ryan.  It should not be beyond the wit of man to include at least some gesture in this regard in the terms of the framework of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the dangers of letting international agreements go through without the benefit of either a foreign policy committee or a committee on Official Development Aid where these matters could be discussed in considerable detail.  The reality is that most developing countries are so heavily indebted at this stage that they can no longer operate autonomously in putting together a development plan or identifying development objectives.  Most of them are under considerable pressure from the International Monetary Fund to adopt a form of development or plan and that usually involves considerable disengagement of the State from the process of development and involves reductions in things like labour protection and in all sorts of the much-vaunted deregulation philosophy which is fairly widespread in the world today.</P>
      <P>There is no guarantee here, given the pressures that are on developing countries, given the nature of the régimes in some of them and given the active collusion of the governments of many of these countries in the destruction of their environment.  It was not western predators who deforested large parts of Africa; it was decisions by governments in those countries.  It would appear to me that private investment &mdash; this is what we are talking about here; we are not talking about international aid by international agencies &mdash; will be judged by very narrow criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no guarantee that any environmental issue or any ecological issue will <Col N="611" /> be considered in this because we are not talking about money from the World Bank.  We are talking about guarantees to private investment.  There is nothing in this; there is no point in us deceiving ourselves but there is no guarantee in this.  The World Bank would not directly be involved because the World Bank will not be providing any funds.  This is a guarantee against commercial loss.  The emphasis it appears will be on minimising risk and cost and one of the areas will be an assumption that because countries are poorly developed, a higher level of environmental damage can be tolerated.</P>
    <P>It is almost too late to straighten out the world's environment before irreprable and irreversible damage is done. That irreparable and irreversible damage is as likely to be done in the attempts at wrong kinds of development in developing countries as by anything that will be done in the so-called developed world.  A classic and simple example of the sort of decision that will be judged on quite excessively narrow terms will be the decision of international or multinationals to set up cigarette factories to manufacture tobacco products to sell to citizens in the Third World.</P>
    <P>It is well documented at this stage that the tobacco industry has launched an enormous advertising campaign, as western countries become agitated about the dangers of cigarette smoking, to develop a new demand in developing countries. There is nothing in these criteria &mdash; if a developed country is desperately seeking investment &mdash; to suggest they would refuse to allow in a company which wanted to generate industrial employment manufacturing cigarettes.  Similarly, it could be a proposal to manufacture baby food as a substitute for breast feeding which is a major matter of controversy between many international agencies and the multinationals.</P>
    <P>Have we any indication that an issue such as that will affect the decision to give guarantees?  They are all issues that are equally important in terms of development to any spuriously aggregated growth and gross national product. <Col N="612" /> Growth and gross national product which does not involve meeting the needs of people on the ground can often do more harm than good.  It took us a long time to realise that in the western world but people are beginning to realise it now. There is nothing in this to guarantee that the environment and the culture of developing countries will be respected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the World Bank's record in its contribution to the environment and its evaluation of projects pertaining to the environment has been very good.  I am confident that MIGA which will have basically similar staff particularly from the member countries, will continue the same policy in its assessment of the various projects.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan has outlined a number of industries.  It would not be possible to name every specific industry in a convention Schedule and say &ldquo;This can be done but that cannot be done.&rdquo;  I do not think &mdash; I cannot say &mdash; that the processing of tobacco products would be taken as productive investment or making a productive contribution to the Third World. Each project will be analysed and assessed. The environmental impact I am confident will be taken into account because the World Bank is involved.  I do not think we need to worry on that score. The thinking in modern times is that the importance of people, their environment, and heritage must be taken into account in overall investment.  I am confident that the World Bank, as the supervisory authority, will ensure that will be the way, particularly with MIGA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Good intentions are admirable but the truth is that large areas of the developing world are ecological, wastelands at this stage because of local governmental policy and also the activity of multinationals.  As Senator Norris said, the rain forests of the Amazon Basin, which are critical to our survival as much as to anybody else because of their role in maintaining the proper levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere, are being destroyed with the <Col N="613" /> collusion of a domestic government.  Further international investment in such an appalling act of destruction will not be prevented by this but may well be encouraged by it because a future government in Brazil which decided to halt such activities in the interests of the environment would presumably enable an agency or a company to claim guarantees under this fund.</P>
      <P>The Minister can say all he likes about good intentions but from what I have read of this Bill I did not think that the World Bank has any supervisory role.  I understood that there was an agency with a directorate which operated under the terms of this convention.  If the convention is only part of a greater convention then perhaps we should have been told that on Second Stage but, as it stands, the economic soundness of the investment is the major criterion; otherwise we trust the host countries which are severely in debt and under severe pressure.  I do not think it is right that we allow private investment to be judged on the criteria of a domestic country which may be under pressure and in such narrow economistic terms.  There is more to development than economic growth. There is no point in developing a country at the expense of its own people.  This may well happen.  The history of multinational investment in Third World countries is not a pretty one.  It is not the sort of highminded ecologically concerned investment that the Minister is dreaming about.  It is a record of exploitation, destabilisation and ecological destruction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there are a couple of other things that need to be stressed. I wish to ask the Minister about Article 44 on legal processes which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Actions other than those within the scope of Articles 57 and 58 may be brought against the Agency only in a court of competent jurisdiction in the territories of a member in which the <Col N="614" /> Agency has an office or has appointed an agent ... No such action against the Agency shall be brought (i) by members or persons acting for or deriving claims from members or (ii) in respect of personnel matters ...</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain what that means.  It appears to me that an Irish citizen working for the agency in this country would not be protected either by the Irish Constitution or by Irish laws in any personnel matter because of this exemption.  I found the reference to personnel matters quite intriguing.  We have a range of protections for employees with regard to equality, maternity leave, holidays and so on which I would have understood to be personnel matters. What we are saying is that Irish citizens who perhaps are working here for the Agency cannot take legal action against the Agency.  I might have misunderstood it as I am not a lawyer but I would like to know what it means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for that is to create an incentive for the best brains in the world, if you like, serving in the public service in various countries to give of their time in international work and to make up for the fact that they would have to leave home, move to a foreign country, travel a lot, investigate projects, write reports and make recommendations and do the normal duties of any international public servant.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a classic example of the case that in order to make the poor work harder you reduce their incomes and in order to make the rich work harder you increase their incomes.  This is why you cut social welfare, this being the view of the International Monetary Fund.  I am fascinated by the fact that the Agency and all the well off people who work for it get all these perks and at the same time the people who work in those countries, the ordinary citizens, must be paid less because of the appalling financial state of the countries.  What the Minister has said is the greatest load of old cod-swallop I have heard in a long time.  I do not mean the Minister in any personal <Col N="616" /> sense but that argument is a load of rubbish. This is one of the perks of the international development industry and it should be seen as such.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the Senator's very narrow commercial attitude to this.  If MIGA is set up as an international body no country has a right to have all the staff in that organisation and unless there is an incentive for staff to work in the organisation they will not do so.  If professional people with expertise are available to make a contribution the experience they gain can be used when they return to their own home country.  It is a double-edged investment. It is an investment in people to improve opportunities, to improve standards of living and to improve resources in developing countries.  In return, the expertise that is acquired by people who go and work with those agencies and authorities in these Third World countries or with international organisations must stand to benefit the developed country when that person comes back to make a contribution in their home country. International co-operation and development demands that and it would be foolhardy of us if we were not prepared to create incentives that would allow the best brains to make their contribution.  I do not think anybody can say that these people are going out to live off poor people or that poor people's standard of living will be lowered.  These people will contribute towards improving the standard of living and opportunities for those in less well off countries and that is admirable.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan simply called a spade a spade.  It is no harm sometimes to strip away some of the verbiage and mystique surrounding this aspect because clearly it is a perk.  There are perks and it is a motivating factor for many people who will go abroad and contribute for three or four years.  They come back very comfortably off and are well able to establish themselves at home.  Senator Ryan is right to describe <Col N="617" /> this simply for what it is.  If, in the process, good work is done overseas, so be it and all to the good but I would not, on top of all of that, invest any great sense of virtue in people who make this great sacrifice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any great quibble with people who work in developed countries, given the disruption to their careers at home and the discomfort that most of them suffer.  I had the good fortune of visiting Irish workers working in developed countries and many of them were paid what they would not regard as excessively large salaries.  None of them that I know of became very rich but it was adequate compensation for the disruption that was involved.</P>
      <P>They were at least working in developed countries.  We are not talking about that here.  We are talking about people who will probably be located somewhere around the headquarters of the World Bank, in New York on Washington. In order to give Irish people an incentive to work in a country that we are told has the lowest taxes in the world we are going to tell them that they will have to pay no tax at all.  Who in God's name are we fooling?  This is an international perk to persuade international civil servants that life is really worth living.  It is a joke.</P>
      <P>The people who impressed me particularly when I visited Irish people were the volunteers from Concern &mdash; young Irish people of about 19, 20 and 21 years old who were working for virtually nothing.  They did not need international perks and international tax breaks to persuade them to work for developed countries. We are turning this into another career for international civil servants which is even more rewarding than the last big international career for international civil servants which was our membership of the EC, out of which virtually every senior member of the Irish political establishment did well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a particularly pretty sight to see an agency being set up which will be based in Washington, in a country which already has very low taxes, and say that <Col N="618" /> no taxes at all will have to be paid.  That does not smell very well.</P>
    <P>In Article 59 which refers to amendment of the convention, I could not find any reference to ratification of amendments to the convention by the Houses of the Orieachtas.  We have ratified the convention as it stands.  Article 59 states:</P>
    <P>This Convention and its Annexes may be amended by vote of three-fifths of the Governors exercising four-fifths of the total voting power, provided that ...</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, any amendment so made does not require any further reference back to the member countries who ratified it.  Are we being sold a pig in a poke?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <P>No, we are not being sold a pig in a poke.  We know exactly what we have entered into, we know where we are going and we know the obligations that are on us.  This amendment is part of the structure and part of the Schedule of the convention.  It is an enabling device whereby if a change is to be made, three-fifths of the governors exercising four-fifths of the total voting power may make the change under the various provisions therein.  This ensures that if a situation occurs for any given reason and there is need for a change legislation does not have to go through the Houses of Parliament in every country that subscribes to this convention before the change can be made.  It is to ensure that they can adapt to a situation that perhaps was not provided for in the legislation or adverted to at the time.  It is this enabling device that we are asking to have ratified.</P>

    <P>The trust built houses in many parts of Ireland but with the passage of time the number of beneficiaries declined considerably and the vacant houses were sold.  As a result the trust accumulated surplus funds and in 1983 it put forward proposals to the Irish and British Governments for the disposal of these funds.</P>
    <P>Discussions then commenced and in 1986 agreement was reached for the repayment of the surplus funds in the ratio of 68 per cent of the British Government and 32 per cent to the Irish Government. These percentages were based on the original contributions of the two Governments.  The British Government had given the trust grants of £1.3 million in the period 1923-25 and the Irish Government had, without payment, transferred land and houses to the trust in 1923.</P>
    <P>The arrangement I have outlined was satisfactory to all concerned and its main terms were incorporated in legislation passed by the British Parliament in 1987. Following the enactment of this measure it is necessary to pass legislation here to enable the trust funds to be received into the Irish Exchequer and to be disposed of.</P>
    <P>I should stress that the trust is not being wound up at this point.  The British Act enables a winding up to be effected on the making of a ministerial order but this is unlikely to be done for a few years yet. When the trust is eventually wound up, our legislation in this area will be repealed and the Bill before you provides for this.  I would emphasise that its provisions will not in any way affect the rights of remaining trust tenants of whom there are 15 here and 70 in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill has two main sections.  Section <Col N="622" /> 2 provides for the acceptance by the Minister for Finance of any money payable to the Irish Government by the trust.  A sum of £1.6 million approximately was in fact paid over by the trust last January and this, together with a recent payment of £747,000, has been lodged to the Exchequer.  These payments were accepted in anticipation of this Bill as the trust was anxious to pay over its surplus funds as quickly as possible.  It is expected that there will be a small number of further payments of much lesser amounts over the next few years until the trust is wound up.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also provides for the disposal of the money paid into the Exchequer. During discussions which lead to the agreement in 1986, the Irish Government indicated that it proposed to use its allocation of trust funds for North-South and Anglo-Irish co-operation or for projects with an all-Ireland dimension.  Last April, the Taoiseach announced that the Government intended to allocate a portion of the funds to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution to enable it to purchase a relief lifeboat which would serve the entire coastline and also to expand its search and rescue facilities on the west and north west coast.  This commitment by the Government will involve expenditure of between £1 million and £1.1 million of trust funds.  I am confident that Senators will approve of this support to the RNLI which is, of course, organised on an all-Ireland basis.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill, as passed by the Dáil, refers to the RNLI and specifies that the funds will be disposed of for projects in the area of North-South or Anglo-Irish co-operation or co-operation projects relating to the island as a whole. A number of applications have already been received for co-operation projects in the educational, cultural and social fields and these will be considered following the passing of the legislation.  A sum of £750,000 has been provided in the Estimates this year to cover an initial payment of £500,000 to the RNLI and to provide grants for those co-operation projects which may be approved between now and the end of the year.  It is expected <Col N="623" /> that the moneys will be allocated over a three to four year period and will cease once the funds paid by the trust have been drawn down.</P>
    <P>The British Government, in accordance with their legislation, are allocating 40 per cent of their portion of the trust funds for the support of ex-servicemen's charities, North and South.  At an early stage in the discussions with the trust and the British Government, consideration was given to the question of allocating the money received by the Irish Government to ex-servicemen of the Irish Army. It emerged, however, that this would have created a number of difficulties at the time and would have inhibited the chances of a successful outcome to the negotiations.  In the circumstances, the previous Government decided that the best course of action was to use the money in the way I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill will enable our earlier legislation on the trust to be repealed once the British Government make an order for its dissolution.  The remaining provisions are standard and do not call for specific comments.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which we are discussing today repeals a Bill which was <Col N="624" /> introduced in the very earliest days of the life of these Houses of Parliament.  It was the 25th piece of legislation brought in 1923, just two months after the Civil War had ended.  It was the beginning of a return to some sort of normality here in the Free State.  The memory of the participation of the people in the Great War who were to be affected by the Bill was still very vivid in the minds of the vast bulk of the Irish public because, of course, almost 150,000 Irish people fought in the First World War and 50,000 died.  It is interesting that among those taking part in the debate, especially in the Seanad, were a number of people who had themselves taken part in that great conflict.</P>
      <P>The origins of the Bill, as the Minister has pointed out were based on pledges made during that war, to provide houses and land for servicemen.  By the time of the Treaty, considerable progress had been made in this country, and quite a number of the houses were already in place.  At the time of Independence, the British Government made £1.5 million available.</P>
      <P>During the course of the debate in the Dáil, on more than one occasion the then Minister for Finance, Ernest Blythe, said that there would be no contribution from the Free State, no contribution from our Exchequer whatsoever, that the entire cost would be borne by the British Government.  The sum was £1.5 million. During the course of the debate in the other House, one of the points made on a number of occasions was that the amount of money coming to this Government is in direct proportion to the amount which was paid in by the separate Governments in 1922 and 1923.  It is a matter of historical interest just to know whether Ernest Blythe was not being fully frank with the House in 1923 or whether there was a subsequent change to the legislation which makes the current divide out of the funds take the shape it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time, 2,500 houses were to be built in the Free State and just over 1,000 in Northern Ireland.  The Minister said that 15 of these houses exist here and 70 <Col N="625" /> exist in Northern Ireland.  Clearly the degree of longevity in Northern Ireland has been greater than that in the Republic.  It is interesting to note that one of the Saorstát Éireann representatives on the first trust was a Member of this House, General Sir Brian Mahon who was, of course, also a former serviceman and was the nominee of the Irish Free State Government to the trust in 1923.</P>
    <P>Perhaps at this point it is no harm to point out that he was one of a number of very prominent Unionists who had been nominated to the First Free State Seanad by W.T. Cosgrave, an indication that the then Government saw the Unionists as having a very full role to play in the building up of a new Free State and a guarantee to a place in the life of that State.  Indeed that is one of the original reasons this House came into existence and it is a great pity that that initial gesture did not come to fruition in the way which it deserved to over subsequent years.</P>
    <P>It is also important at this stage to bring to mind once again the people for whom this legislation was designed.  To a great extent, the Irishmen who went off to fight in the First World War are the forgotten, and in many cases the excluded men of this century.  They left to fight.  Who knows why they went?  They went to escape the poverty and the lack of opportunity at home.  They went because they heeded the appeals of the parliamentary party, the Nationalist Party, and the appeals of John Redmond and John Dillon and others who believed that Ireland's participation in the war and a victory for the British forces would result in the speedy granting of Home Rule for all of Ireland.  They went, perhaps because some like Tom Kettle and others believed they were fighting for the freedom of small nations or perhaps they went as young people would go out of a sense of adventure.</P>
    <P>For whatever reason they went, they went and those who were lucky to come back came back to a very changed situation. They found themselves as I have said to a great extent excluded in their <Col N="626" /> own country.  Those of us who are now in what we call middle age would have known a great number of these people.  I knew them growing up down in Bagenalstown, County Carlow where some very fine soldiers' cottages were built under the provisions of this particular Bill.</P>
    <P>I often wondered about them because to me they were no different from anybody else.  They were certainly as Irish as anybody else was and yet they seemed to be excluded in some strange way from the Nationalist orthodoxy.  There was something about them that made them less than full participants in their own country.  I always regretted that.  I regret, too, that recent events have shown how deep seated in certain quarters is the antipathy to what these people represent and to the choice they made in 1914.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I was finishing off a point about the people who were the beneficiaries under the original legislation and how they came back to a very different country from which they were in many ways excluded.  It is a great shame that the memory of these people cannot be honoured today in an unambiguous way, in a way which does not bring in all sorts of undertones, imputations and implications.  While I do not often find myself in agreement with Mr. Gay Byrne, over the past week or two he has done the public some service by bringing this issue into prominence and at least allowing some sort of rational debate on something which is not a matter of which we can be inordinately proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before coming to the Bill itself, may I say a quick word about the houses that were built under the original scheme? Today many of them are very highly desirable properties.  They are often built in quite scenic areas and were of very high quality.  They have stood the test of time.  I suspect that if many of them come on the market they will become highly desirable in some of the upper reaches of <Col N="628" /> the market, but certainly those houses stood the test of time.  They were very well built and generally enhanced the areas in which they were built.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is very straightforward. As the Minister mentioned, it had largely been negotiated by Lord Killanin, the Irish trustee who has held that position for almost 35 years.  As in everything else which he touches, he has performed his duties with a great sense of integrity and commitment and a lot of style as well. Our thanks are due to him in all of this.</P>
    <P>I have no objections whatsoever, in fact I very warmly welcome the fact that the RNLI is to be the main recipient of the largesse which will now appear and the provision of a new lifeboat on the west coast is to be greatly welcomed.  I have no objection either to the rest of the money being used to further cross-Border co-operation, or to have it used for projects of an all-Ireland nature, so long as these projects are real.  There is often the danger that when money like this appears people are encouraged to go out and invent projects, or projects of a less than substantial nature being to appear.  I hope there will be a fairly rigorous assessment for these projects and that the money is not simply used to rescue organisations who have over-budgeted.  One such project was mentioned already by the Minister in his speech in the other House, but I certainly would not like to see it being used in that way.  If the money is to be used to promote cross-Border co-operation and projects of reconciliation I hope they are real and genuine ones, substantial in nature, and not just created for the sake of getting money which is available.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his speech the reason the trust did not devote some of its money to what in many ways was its original intention, that is the care of ex-servicemen.  I know Dr. Garret FitzGerald explained in the Dáil the reasons as why when the Bill was being negotiated it was thought inappropriate at the time to include some provision for ex-servicemen. Perhaps this was a mistake.  I think it would be appropriate and there would be all-party agreement at this stage <Col N="629" /> if some of the money could be provided for the very purpose for which it was originally intended &mdash; to cater for the needs of ex-servicemen.  I would certainly include ex-servicemen from our own Army.  In fact, they would be the main beneficiaries as I see it.  There must be many of them indeed there are many of them represented by ONE who are in need of better housing, and help in different ways and who are not being adquately catered for at present.  Now the Bill has passed through the Dáil &mdash; it is unlikely to be changed, but it is a pity that the opportunity was missed to provide some part of the money for ex-servicemen.</P>
    <P>My main point of criticism with the Bill is one which has been partly rectified or addressed by the Minister in the amendment he brought forward in the Dáil. The original draft of the Bill was not sufficiently directional as to how the money should be spent.  We were told it would go to the RNLI and that it would be used in ways which would help projects involving co-operation between this State and Northern Ireland, but it would be as the Taoiseach would decide, with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Clearly in the other House it was considered &mdash; even though the Minister said very specifically on the record of the House that the moneys would be used in this way &mdash; that something stronger was needed and the Minister introduced an amendment which meets part of this case. But it does not, I believe, go sufficiently far.  What is missing here is any sense of parliamentary accountability.</P>
    <P>We are talking about this on the same day as another political party &mdash; not represented in this House &mdash; is bringing in a Bill on the national lottery.  That Bill also is about accountability of public moneys. I would certainly disagree with a great deal of that Bill because I believe that judges as far as possible should be kept in the courts, they were appointed to administer the law as fairly as possible.  I do not subscribe to the view that when in trouble or when a veneer of respectability is needed in public life one rushes for the nearest judge and establishes a board. Judges are just as fallible as the rest of <Col N="630" /> us; they are probably less in touch with the realities of life or public opinion than those who are in politics and so the idea of rushing for a judge is not something which commends itself to me.  However, I believe there is, as in all aspects of public life, a great case for strengthening accountability to Parliament.</P>
    <P>I believe that politicians for the very great part are honest and do their best, that Parliament is the place to which they should be accountable, because in almost every case there is accountability and the case can be explained in detail.  I believe it would strengthen Parliament itself &mdash; only in a very small way in this case &mdash; if the moneys to be disbursed under this scheme were to be made directly accountable to the Dáil rather than simply left to the discretion and the wisdom of the Taoiseach of the day in consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>For that reason I have tabled an amendment to section 2 of the Bill which would introduce this element of parliamentary accountability.  I can tell the Minister it is not because I believe there will be anything untoward in the way in which the allocations will be made, but I believe that it would strengthen the overall effect of the Bill if this element of accountability were built into the legislation. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment which I will be putting forward. I am quite sure if he does, there will be very little difficulty in having the other House agree to it.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is useful, and with the small amendment I am proposing it could be an even better Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is short and has received a great deal of debate in the other House.  In fact, the Bill was amended in the other House and for that reason my contribution will be quite brief.  The original purpose of the trust was to build houses for Irish ex-servicemen who fought in the First World War.  There is evidence of those houses right across the country and I am sure at the time there was a great need for building those houses.  As I understand it, the trust took on the work of what was <Col N="631" /> then a local government board and in all something like 2,000 houses were built. The problem of housing national ex-servicemen has reduced and we have a mere 15 tenants in this country at present, so obviously the problem is not very great.</P>
      <P>At present, as we all know, our Army personnel occupy many of our local authority houses throughout the country.  In addition, the Department of Defence have built many fine housing schemes for Army personnel.  They have always been, as far as the local authority is concerned, excellent tenants.  They have got involved in the community life and in the various tenant purchase schemes.  They have brought their houses, as is right and, indeed at one stage in my town of Athlone, something like 25 per cent of the tenants of the local authority were Army personnel.  That, in itself, is an indication that all Governments over the years have shown concern for the Army personnel in the provision of houses for them.</P>
      <P>There is one problem I would like to refer to.  Indeed, I noted what the Minister has said when he made the point that following the enactment of this measure it will be necessary to pass legislation to enable the trust funds to be received into the Irish Exchequer and to be disposed of.  In the next sentence says: &ldquo;I will stress that the trust is not being wound up at this point&rdquo;.  This sentence has prompted me to refer to many Army men I have known over the years, who were single and whose life centred around the barracks where they lived.  They had no families and when they retired or were about to retire they found themselves in a dilemma about where they would live. Indeed, I can recall a case not very long ago of one Army bandsman with whom I was friendly.  His big problem at the time was where would he go when he retired.  Within the barracks there was a very real move by both the NCOs and officers to provide a little place where he might continue to reside, so that he could stay in the old surroundings, even though at that stage he was a civilian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might look at this matter <Col N="632" /> in the light of the fact that the trust is not being wound up at this point.  It would be in keeping with the spirit of the Bill if this could be entertained.  I do not think it would cost a lot of money as there are not too many of those people in the Army at the moment.  If a sum could be left aside to provide for the kind of situation I have outlined, we would all welcome it very much.  If possible, perhaps the Minister will see what can be done, but if he cannot do anything I am sure he will tell us.</P>
    <P>The meat of the Bill is contained in section 2, which provides for the disposal of the money that would be paid into the Exchequer.  Like the previous speakers, I think there would be very widespread support for the purchase by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, of a relief lifeboat which would serve the entire coastline and which would provide search and rescue facilities on the west and north-west coast.  It is very commendable and has received widespread support.</P>
    <P>The other aspects of the Bill are in keeping with the thoughts of Lord Killanin. Indeed, I join with Senator Manning in paying tribute to Lord Killanin &mdash; he was the Irish Government's representative on this trust &mdash; not only for his work on the trust but for his work with the Olympic movement and with the bloodstock industry.  Recently we had a fairly important debate in this House on his report on the bloodstock industry and I would like to compliment and congratulate him for his great work over the years.</P>
    <P>Section 2, which was discussed at length in the Dáil, specifies that funds will be disposed of for projects in the North-South and, for Anglo-Irish co-operation projects or co-operation projects relating to the island as a whole. That is very commendable and I support it.</P>
    <P>Few of us disagree with the Bill.  I welcome it and wish it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I will not detain the House long.  Senator Manning has ably evoked the historical context of this Bill and the House will be <Col N="633" /> glad to hear that I feel that dispenses me from having to give the mandatory historical lecture.</P>
      <P>The Bill evokes battles long ago and boyhood memories of the soldiers' houses being pointed out, with the slight implication &mdash; growing up as I did in a republican house &mdash; that somehow these were less than perfect Irishmen.  As Senator Manning has said, the Bill now before us reminds us of those people who went off to fight for all kinds of reasons, many of them for the motivation so nobly expressed by the poet: &ldquo;for a dream born in a herdsman's hut and the secret scriptures of the poor&rdquo;.  No doubt most of them were not so heroically inspired as that but whatever their motivation they came back to an Ireland in which everything was changed utterly and in which they were judged harshly by the very narrow criteria of nationalism which came to be established in this country. The RIC, together with the ex-servicemen, became regarded as not quite perfect Irishmen, as by other criteria people who did not speak Irish or people who did not practice Catholicism and so on were denied the full credentials of nationality.  In passing this Bill let us spare a thought for the people who are the subject of the original trust.</P>
      <P>I should say in passing that if our defintion of Irishness were too narrow, the definition of Britishness or Ulsterness were also too narrow.  Please God, we are moving towards a better accommodation in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Bill reminds us that in this, as in many other areas, there is a great deal of good sense and welcome co-operation in everyday matters between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland and for that we can only be truly grateful.  On the Bill itself I, like Senator Manning, was wondering to what extent the disposal of the moneys will involve approval by the Oreachtas?  The dimensions of the fund are not great but that does not diminish the principle of parliamentary representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the Minister's speech I also wonder to what extent the Taoiseach's office would accept representations from <Col N="634" /> Members of the Oireachtas on behalf of causes which they deemed to be worthy? My own deductions from the Minister's statement are that the funds so far total £1.6 million of which £1.1 million will be given to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, but there is a further £740,000 and were will be further sums to come. Therefore, we are talking about another £1.5 million?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum will be £300,000 extra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The dimensions are not large by comparison with the disposal of other funds, but it is entirely appropriate that their disposal should be subject to parliamentary sanction.  I also think that worthy as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution cause is, and no one can quarrel with the decision in that regard, the remaining funds should be earmarked for organisations which are devoted to peaceful purposes, cross-Border co-operation, British-Irish co-operation, peace studies, the work carried on by the School of Ecumenics &mdash; all of these could be said to come under the general rubric of co-operation between North and South or on an all-Ireland basis.</P>
      <P>It is entirely appropriate that funds which originally arose out of providing for war-like men should in their ultimate disposal be devoted to peaceful purposes. That is an entirely appropriate paradox and is what these ex-servicemen themselves would have wished.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill and I support Senator Manning's reservations on that one point about parliamentary sanction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming the Bill.  I would like to pay tribute to Lord Killanin for his work in getting us a portion of this money for use in this country.  As a small boy I knew many ex-servicemen, because I lived on that narrow passageway between North and South, now known as the N15.  Convenient to where I lived was a pub owned by a big farmer.  There was always a loft or a barn available for those men to stay <Col N="635" /> overnight.  They were very entertaining and they told tales, yarns and so on. When asked, many men said they went because they genuinely believed they were fighting for the freedom of small nations, while more went for adventure. However, when those people left the Army they had a choice of a pension of a half crown a week or a lump sum of £20.  They were sold the idea of taking the lump sum, which needless to say left them on the road in very poor circumstances. When they got their £20, which was a lot of money in those days, most of them were fond of a drink and they had lots of company: &ldquo;in times of bounty friends are plenty, but in times of adversity not one in twenty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This trust was set up to alleviate that type of problem.  These men were called knights of the road and many of them had no home to go to.  I remember one poor man whose name I do not know &mdash; I am sure he must be a saint in Heaven today &mdash; who travelled along the road. He had no legs, but he had an old bacon box with four wheels and two little short bits of sticks.  He propelled himself a couple of miles a day.  He travelled between Donegal and Sligo and back again.  There were always plenty of people walking on the roads in those days and children would push him uphill. Some of those men fared out very badly. I always remember a poem I heard a man reciting.  He quoted the Robbie Burns poem &ldquo;Man was made to Mourn&rdquo; and I never forgot the lines: &ldquo;When man is useful to his kind, supported is his right, see him on the edge of life, all cares and sorrows worn, for age and want a well matched pair shows man was made to mourn.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trust was originally set up for these people.  The trust built a number of houses in Sligo and an option was given some years ago to those people to buy out the houses.  I know one family in Sligo who have done a very nice reconstruction job on the house which they bought out. This trust distributed suits of clothes at Christmas.  I remember a neighbour of mine used to go to Sligo to the market <Col N="636" /> on Saturday and at Christmas he would come home with a suit of clothes that he had got from the late Councillor John Fallon whom I am sure Senator Manning would have known.</P>
    <P>The trust has served its purpose but now it is in surplus.  Naturally all of those people have gone to their eternal reward and I sincerely hope they are geting their just reward in heaven.  In those days nuns and priests were very kind to those people, despite how some of us might have a go at Catholicism.  They looked after those people.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that now that the trust is in surplus that the funds are going to be used in this manner.  The RNLI is an organisation that deserves our support. We have a very active group in Sligo. Their collection boxes, a plastic boat, are placed throughout the area and make a very good collection.  I am delighted they are getting some money out of this fund. It is a very good idea to give it to the lifeboat service.  The Minister in his speech said a lifeboat will operate in the west.  A lifeboat is certainly needed on the west coast and I am delighted that the money is being put to this use.  I agree with Senator Manning when he said we should not run for judges to do everything. People who stand for election, who stand on the platform to be elected from among the ordinary citizens, are appointed to do such work and they should do it.  I have no apologies to make to anybody.  We are elected.  There is an option once every five years to make another decision if people think we are not doing the job properly.</P>
    <P>Cross-Border projects are very near and dear to my heart.  Political problems will never be solved until we solve the economic problems that exist in that region.  On the Border regions, North and South, we must get the economic strategy working and get jobs for people in those ghetto areas.  If we do that it will help.  I am delighted that some of the money is going towards that purpose.</P>
    <P>I see also that some money is going towards educational, cultural and social aspects.  When there is money to be spent <Col N="637" /> we all think of the projects nearest to our hearts.  I have in mind the physically and mentally handicapped, for whom we are in the process of building a holiday home and an assessment unit in Bundoran.  It would be within the heading of co-operation. The Minister might think of giving that section of the community some money towards a project such as this.  It is a North-South project.  We would be catering for people from the North and providing holiday facilities for them.  If some money was allocated to that project no Senator would oppose it.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that something is being done in regard to co-operation between the North and South.  Since the pupils of schools in my area started visiting the North and some of the pupils from Northern schools started coming to the South a big change has taken place.  There is no doubt about that.  I remember a few years ago people did not want to go further than Enniskillen.  Now people go to Belfast and have no qualms about it. Co-operation between the North and South helps to break down those barriers. What really causes trouble almost everywhere is fear of the unknown.  If we knew what was there I do not think we would be half as much afraid of it.  The more we can get people to co-operate with Border projects, tourism and educational projects the more we can help the situation. It is very important.</P>
    <P>I am glad that education was mentioned. Many schools at present are running cross-Border co-operation trips. They have to try to raise funds locally. With the present cost of transport, insurance, etc. the schools are finding it harder to run these trips.  For that reason I am delighted that education is included. The youth of Ireland is better today than ever before.  Given a clear insight of what is happening North and South, they will come together and bring that unity and peace which we all long for and towards which we are all, in our way, working.  I believe it can be done and I believe it will be done.</P>
    <P>In 1967-68 we had terrific cross Border co-operation.  The ESB had to do work across the Border &mdash; unfortunately it was <Col N="638" /> interfered with &mdash; and there was a tourism drive with great movement of people North and South.  The same friendliness and comradeship can again be achieved.</P>
    <P>It was encouraging to see both Protestants and Catholics coming together on the issue of the Enniskillen bombing.  The more we do in co-operation projects the more we will help to bring peace and harmony to the troubled part of Northern Ireland.  I am very pleased that the Bill is before the House and that the money is being used in that way.  I give my wholehearted support to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one principal point to make.  I make it in the context of the fact that I am a trustee of a number of organisations.  I serve on a number of organisations dealing with funds and I know the kind of machinery, in outline, that is proposed here.  Of course, in many ways I welcome it.  I welcome clearly the kind of thing that Senator Ferris paid such eloquent tribute to, that is, the capacity of two Governments who have experienced some difficulties over many years to demonstrate their ability to co-operate over a considerable period in the interests of the citizens of both countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am surprised at one thing. The Minister may be able to reassure me on this matter.  Section 2 provides for the disposal of the moneys paid into the Exchequer.  They are sums of some moderate size.  There are certainly some hundreds of thousands of pounds &mdash; up to £750,000.  It is a substantial sum of money but it is not the kind of money that is going to make a huge impact in terms of large policy areas, such as the co-operation between North and South. That is unrealistic.  This amount of money in a matter like that would, to use a good Dublin expression &ldquo;get lost in a hole in your tooth&rdquo;.  It is not going to have any impact whatever, so let us be realistic about it.  I have no doubt that there is an economic aspect to the situation in the North.  If the Americans, for example, were serious about it then they should do something in terms of massive investment, and the same with the British.  A <Col N="639" /> couple of hundred thousand pounds here or there is just simply irrelevant.</P>
    <P>However, if you put it into context there is a clear obligation on people who fulfil the role of trustees or members of a board of a fund to see that the intentions behind the original setting up of that fund are fulfilled.  In some ways I can see that the Minister has lived up to his obligation. It is perfectly appropriate to spend money on a lifeboat &mdash; not perfectly, because nothing in this life is perfect and I could even quibble about the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, worthy although it is &mdash; but at least a very clear argument could be raised to suggest that this was in a direct and proper line of inheritance from the original intention of the trust.</P>
    <P>I am less and less happy as I go down the list.  I am not particularly happy that in this instance the application of these comparatively small funds to North-South co-operation is within the specific intention of the framers of the measure. I do not think it has anything whatever to do with the sea, for example.  When we get down to the exceedingly worthy causes mentioned by Senator Farrell, I agree 100 per cent that these holiday homes for the mentally handicapped are very important, indeed.  In fact, I am involved in fundraising in precisely this area over the next couple of weeks.  It is something that is desperately necessary but I do not think it is germane to this issue, particularly when there is an outstanding matter to be resolved.</P>
    <P>I would look to the Minister to satisfy the House that he is sensitive on this issue.  There is a clear obligation.  I am speaking, of course, of the rights and interests of the former employees and pensioners of Irish Shipping.  Surely, the Minister will agree with me that if the disbursal of these funds were to go anywhere they ought to go to those people who are so clearly covered by the words of the poet, Robbie Burns, quoted so eloquently by Senator Farrell.  These are the people who have given their service sometimes, over, 40 years to an institution of this State, which gave great service to the State in the merchant navy <Col N="640" /> of this country.  They have picketed both Houses of the Oireachtas in recent months, looking for their just rights and deserts.  They have been chiselled and swindled out of their pensions with what I can only describe as State connivance. Here we have a golden opportunity to provide for these people to whom we owe the most serious debt of honour and responsibility, and yet there is no mention of them.</P>
    <P>There is all this waffle of North-South co-operation.  Applications were made from the floor of the House on behalf of very worthy causes.  I would say to the Minister, as somebody who has acted responsibly in terms of honouring a commitment to a trust, and to a foundation, and so on, that he must be aware that there is, in most cases, a legal requirement that the bodies which inherit the fruits of this should be something of clear consonance with the original intention of the framers.  I am not at all happy that this is indicated in all the aspects of what is laid out here in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to make a statement that a substantial proportion of these funds will be allocated to honour the obligations.  This is the case.  We, as a people, have an obligation to the former employees of Irish Shipping which was would up in an outrageous fashion.  I would like to feel that rather than creating a rag-bag of worthy causes which would each have a kind of lottery allocation made to them, that this matter which is so clearly within the intentions and in line with the purpose of the trust that is being broken up and having its funds dispersed, will be settled.  I hope that the Minister who is a humane, sensitive man will be able to make this commitment.</P>
    <P>This is a wonderful opportunity.  It is a golden opportunity.  There can be no question but that this is an appropriate use of the funds and I am sure the Minister will be able to assure me that this will be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy and Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Members who have <Col N="641" /> contributed to the debate, and to Senator Manning for putting the Bill in its historic context, going back to the time of Ernest Blythe and the situation where he made a comment that there would be no contribution by the Free State.  The situation is that the Irish Free State transferred lands and houses to the trust after 1922 without seeking repayment for them.  There were 1,508 houses involved at that time.  The trustees, through Lord Killanin's good offices, gave the Government credit for these houses.  The share worked out at 32 per cent.  The British share was 68 per cent including credit for their grants of £1.3 million and houses in Northern Ireland, which numbered about 652 at the time.  That is the situation.</P>
      <P>The point was raised both by Senators Manning and Murphy in relation to accountability.  It is appropriate to the amendment to be put down by Senator Manning.  What is happening here is that the trust's money will be transferred into a subhead within the Taoiseach's Department and the Taoiseach's Department subhead and Estimate is the subject of annual debate within the Dáil.  All public moneys, no matter which Department they come under, are the subject of annual review and debate by the Dáil.  If there is anything that Dáil Members feel is incorrect in relation to any subhead or the allocation of money under any subhead it is the right of the Dáil to vote against the Estimate.  There is total accountability under the terms of the normal practices and procedures of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>We argued and debated in the Dáil the amendment the Senator has proposed and at a later stage I will not be able to accept it.  I will not be able to accept it for another reason apart from accountability. If we accept it as it is &mdash; I accept the worthy motives of Senator Manning &mdash; it means that if we want to allocate a sum of £50, £100, £200 or £1,000 it has to be brought back to the Dáil every time to get the approval of the Dáil for that sum of money, which would make a nonsense of the way this trust will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to assure the House as to the manner in which this trust will work and <Col N="642" /> the allocation of the funds.  What is happening is that an interdepartmental committee is being established between the Taoiseach's office, the Department of Finance and the Department of Foreign Affairs because they were the three Departments involved.  The Taoiseach's Office was involved mainly because it was the Taoiseach's Department which appointed the trustee of the fund.  This matter was always handled in the Taoiseach's Department.  The Taoiseach and succeeding Taoisigh appointed Lord Killanin and re-appointed him to the trust and it was through the good offices of Lord Killanin that this money has been negotiated for us.  The Department of Finance were involved because of accountability of public finances.  The Department of Foreign Affairs were involved because of the terms of the agreement that was arrived at between the United Kingdom Government and ourselves.  The agreement was that the money would be spent for such purposes as were laid out for North-South projects for Anglo-Irish co-operation or for projects with an all-Ireland dimension.  That is the reality of it.</P>
    <P>To answer Senator Norris' point on this, the reason that it is being done in this manner of North-South, Anglo-Irish co-operation or in the context of all-Ireland co-operation is because of the terms of the agreement that was hammered out by Lord Killanin after a lot of difficult negotiations.  The reality is that if he had not agreed it in this manner, subject to the approval of the previous Administration &mdash; I do not criticise them; I applaud them for the agreement and that is why we are bringing it through in this legislation &mdash; we would not have got our 32 per cent share.  It is as clear and as simple as that.  It would have been taken by the British Exchequer.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Fallon's point in relation to houses for soldiers, the main responsibility for housing of former members of the Defence Forces who are unable to house themselves is primarily a matter for local authorities.  However, the Government are very conscious of the needs regarding living acommodation <Col N="643" /> for our Army personnel.  The provision made in 1988 for accommodation was £6 million for capital works and £2.8 million for refurbishment and maintenance.  The allocation for 1989 comprises £7 million for capital works and £2.8 million for refurbishment and maintenance, an increase of £1 million on this year's figure. Significant improvements have been made in standards of accommodation available in many barracks and progress in continuing.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Murphy's point. It is nice to see this level of co-operation between two Governments that have in the past been accused of megaphone diplomacy rather than getting down to ordinary day-to-day business.  This is a classic example of what can be done and should be done on a regular basis.  For example, the RNLI proposal we have is something where there will be a new lifeboat on the west coast which can be used, and will be used, in the future to save the lives of people off the north and west coast.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Norris' point in relation to the trustees, it is important that the intentions of the trustees should be seen out.  That is what is written into the Bill.  The trustees' intention was that the money would be spent on the three areas mentioned, North-South, Anglo-Irish and the whole of Ireland projects and clearly Irish Shipping staff would be outside that framework.  That is not to make any judgment on the point made by Senator Norris in relation to the State's responsibility to the Irish Shipping staff.  I do not make a judgment one way or the other on that.  I merely say that in the context of what the trustees, and our trustee, Lord Killanin, who is doing <Col N="644" /> an excellent job for us have negotiated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to establish diplomatic relations with Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the House, Senator Murphy and I have reversed roles.  I am proposing the motion and Senator Murphy will second it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is a particularly appropriate time to propose a motion of this sort on Nicaragua and Central America.  In the past week there has been a presidential election in America which, rightly or wrongly, should give us some sort of hope for a new departure in American policy towards Central America. Many will say that the advent of Vice-President Bush to the Presidency of America will be a simple continuation of President Reagan's policy towards Nicaragua, but I hold out in some optimism for Vice-President Bush's arrival in the White House because it gives him a <Col N="645" /> chance to remedy the mistakes of the past, which have undoubtedly been made under President Reagan.  Indeed, American foreign policy is full of surprises of this sort.  Who would have thought that Nixon would have withdrawn from Vietnam and that Kennedy would have been the person who had entered it?  What we say here tonight, and if Ireland opens diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, may carry some message to the new regime in America.  It may give them some encouragement to take a new course and not to continue on the same stale, unsuccessful, defeatist and destructive course which the Americans have been intent on for almost the past ten years.  Let us hope that this chance will be taken up by the new incumbent in the White House and that a clean break will be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Fat chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate to underline here the real role which Ireland can play in this particular conflict.  If we were to raise our voices, and we have not done so so far, it is likely that we would be listened to in the White House.  It is appropriate that we should consider and realise that we have leverage in America, that we have influence in America and we have a special relationship with the United States.  We send thousands of emigrants there every year.  Our people constitute a large percentage of their people and it should be realised by the Cabinet and by the Government that the United States needs us just as much as we need them.  Indeed, they possibly may need us more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an aside, I am tired of American Presidents paying little attention to this country until they want to come over here for re-election purposes.  We have had that experience with President Reagan, with President Nixon and, unfortunately, with the late President Kennedy.  If the United States Presidents need us to welcome them when they come over here for re-election purposes, then they can certainly listen to our criticisms of their foreign policy.  But we have made no such criticisms and that is the problem.  Our <Col N="646" /> relationship, while being special is, unfortunately, subservient and it is high time we symbolised the end of this subservience by opening formal diplomatic relations with Nicaragua.  While I do not believe that the concrete results of that formal opening of diplomatic relations would be great, it would be symbolic in showing our independence and in showing our neutrality.</P>
    <P>It is relevant in this debate to ask whether our neutrality is a real neutrality or whether it is a neutrality which is subservient to the United States because on this issue it is appropriate that we should look at the similarities that we as a nation have with Nicaragua.  We are a small nation, we have a similar-type population and a similar kind of history to Nicaragua. We are ostensibly a non-aligned neutral country, although very often we do not show any such signs.  What we should ask ourselves, and I would like the Minister's comments on this, is whether we are comcompromising our neutrality by refusing to make any independent statements on Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>We have consistently followed a European Community line on this and it is a consistent umbrella of defence on this but in that surely we are compromising the sort of neutrality which we so often talk about.  Neutrality does not involve simply sending troops out to trouble spots and saying that we are neutral between various countries in the Middle East or various factions in the Middle East. Neutrality involves a positive stance in favour of democracy wherever in the world and a positive stance against oppression, whether it be with a so-called friendly state or not.  I believe we are guilty of a serious double-think on this issue.  We are all in favour of democracy in certain areas but we are not in favour of democracy if it offends certain powerful trading and ideological partners of ours.</P>
    <P>I do not say that the regime in Nicaragua is a perfect regime.  I do not maintain that in Central America there is some sort of Utopia to which we should all aspire.  Indeed, there are glaring faults with the Nicaraguan regime as it stands at the moment, no greater than possibly <Col N="647" /> exist in this country or in Britain or in many European countries, but it is very easy to pick those faults and to say that the regime is not worthy of support or of diplomatic relations.</P>
    <P>I will point out one or two of those faults.  There was a state of emergency in Nicaragua until January 1988 which involved serious restrictions on freedom. It involved restrictions on movements of political opposition groups and on activities in which they could indulge.  It involved restrictions on movements in war zones, it involved restrictions on freedom of speech, especially in the press.  When I was in Nicaragua for one day during the elections the regime made a serious mistake in closing down for one day the opposition newspaper.  The regime has made a serious mistake in its displacement of the Miskito and Sumu Indians, a mistake which it admits, where it moved them out of all their homelands. It created a terrible problem for themselves and it recruited many people for the Contras as a result, many of whom have since made use of the amnesty which has been introduced.</P>
    <P>The regime is not a perfect regime and it never will be but it compares fairly favourably with any single democratic country which has within it a terrorist force.  Having pointed out those faults I should say that it has many great assets and it has many great qualities.  I was privileged to go there and witness the elections there in 1984, the first test of democracy in Nicaragua.  That all-party committee, to which the Government never responded satisfactorily, which included a member of the present Government, reported unanimously that the elections carried out there were fair and democratic.  It is only right that I should point out that that particular report was not the only one which stated this.  More conservative parties, the Conservative Party in Britain, people of a more conservative hue, people who would be naturally anti-Sandinista reported to their own countries that these elections were almost impeccable and that they certainly compared favourably <Col N="648" /> with the principles of democracy and the workings of the democracy in their own countries.  The result of that, it must be remembered, was a 66.8 per cent vote in favour of the Sandinista Government. They got an overwhelming vote of support from the people of Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>One of the perceptions which I did not hold before I went out but which was put across in much of the press was that the Sandinistas were a totalitarian, Communist regime, who for some reason were Russian supported and were blatantly anti-American.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  What I found out was that there was very little, if any, support for the Contras.  Despite the fact that their particular brand of political thought &mdash; whatever that is &mdash; boycotted the elections, it was quite obvious to those of us who were there that there was simply no support for the Contras whatsoever.  That revolution was a spontaneous uprising against the oppression of the Somosa regime which preceded it.  It was not in any sense a Communist revolution although the Americans interpreted it as such; it was indeed a nationalist revolution.</P>
    <P>It was a very exciting revolution in that it was a people trying to express personality.  It was a revolution against the corruption, the oppression, the torture and the killings which happened beforehand.  It was not a revolution in favour of a particular form of foreign ideology but what followed that was, unfortunately, a reaction in the US which was paranoid.  Whereas they had supported the corrupt regime they then, with a sense of guilt, reacted and branded this revolution as some sort of a Communist revolution.  Nothing could have been further from the truth.</P>
    <P>Neither did this revolution or the revolutionaries involved in Nicaragua want to threaten the United States.  Indeed it was quite obvious from the start that the Nicaraguan people wanted good relations with the United States.  When I was there I continuously came across people who had been educated in the United States and who knew the United States well &mdash; the native Sandinistas &mdash; and they said <Col N="649" /> they liked the United States, they wanted good relations with the United States but they detested the Reagan regime.  They felt that as a result of what the Reagan regime was doing they were being driven against their will straight into the hands of the USSR and the Cubans who, at that time certainly, were welcoming them into their hands because they simply had nowhere else to go.</P>
    <P>Those of us who were out there came away with the firm suspicion that whereas the Contras &mdash; the creation of the United States &mdash; could not win the war, the United States was still looking for an excuse to invade Nicaragua because it was the only way it could maintain its total influence there after Somosa.  That has not come to pass and I hope it will never come to pass but it is a continuing danger.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking, in this context, at the Contras, the group which has been created by the CIA and by the United States.  The Contras were created post-1979, but it is worth looking at who they are and what they are doing.  They are CIA-backed, they are US-supported. They are terrorists and nothing else, they are bandits.  They have enormous similarities in my view to the Provisional IRA because the Contras hide under the rather romantic title of freedom fighters when they are simply terrorists who maim and shoot at will.  They have no democratic mandate nor are they likely to have.  Both are supported by an outside régime &mdash; in the case of the Contras, by the United States, in the case of the IRA, by Libya.  They are a group of malcontents and ex-Somosa men with basically nowhere else to go.  Nothing could be more apparent to anyone who visits there than that the Contras are not only representing a small group of people there, to my mind, they are representing virtually no-one except themselves, but they are representing a destructive course intent upon devastation.  We found as a group strikingly no support for this particular brand of terrorism.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that when we were there we were allowed almost total freedom of movement, if not total.  I <Col N="650" /> cannot remember being refused to go anywhere; we were allowed freedom of movement to question who we liked, talk to who we liked, inspect who we liked at any time at all.  We could simply not find support for the Contras.  However, the Contras have managed to do an enormous amount of damage because of the external support which they have been receiving.  The economy of Nicargua is in tatters because of the war of attrition and the destruction being wrought by the Conras there.</P>
    <P>It is not only that.  The trade embargo imposed by the United States has caused an enormous disruption to the Nicaraguan economy.  Nicaragua did most of its trade with the United States pre-1979, found it was reduced in 1983 and now it is brought to a complete standstill.  Having absolutely no trade with the United States has again mean that Nicaragua has had to look elsewhere for markets and where else would it naturally look but to the eastern bloc?  The eastern bloc, and western Europe to a lesser extent, has been willing to start trading with Nicaragua and not surprisingly.</P>
    <P>That is not all that has contributed towards the disruption in the Nicaraguan economy.  It has been a particularly unlucky and unfortunate history.  Following the earthquake in 1975, international aid was squandered and stolen by Somosa.  This year there was a devastating hurricane which has left appalling damage in its wake and I deplore the reluctance, and indeed refusal, of the Government to give massive aid following this particular hurricane.  The amount of damage which has been done is difficult to estimate.  The numbers rendered homeless as a result of the hurricane vary between 200,000 and 300,000 but in an economy which is already so damaged and devastated, this sort of natural disaster is really unfortunate.</P>
    <P>Nicaragua spends 63 per cent of its GNP on arms which is a tragic figure for an economy which is short of all the basic raw materials.  Twenty per cent is allocated to be spent on the needs of the children and the elderly and 17 per cent is left for all the other services which a <Col N="651" /> State would normally provide.  As a result, the State cannot provide them and the State is suffering enormously.  Nonetheless, it has achieved great strides in one or two areas and it should be noted that it has succeeded in reducing the illiteracy rate from 50 per cent to 30 per cent. It was 50 per cent when the Sandinista revolution took place.  It has concentrated nearly all its available resources on the education process and, as a result, teachers have quadrupled in the past ten years.  It has had to conduct this particular struggle with the minimum of international aid.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say that Ireland contributes aid to Nicaragua through the European Community.  This is true, but Ireland is also free to contribute aid to Nicaragua in a bilateral fashion and bilateral aid from Ireland to Nicaragua, as the Minister and as the Government know, has reduced and reduced very dramatically in the last five or six years.  It was never particularly great but it is now gone from about £25,000 in 1979 to £9,000 which is a paltry and insulting amount.  Indeed, our contribution to Nicaragua is unfortunately and shamefully to depend once again on the voluntary groups.</P>
    <P>The people and the Government cannot claim credit for the great work being done out there by groups like Trócaire and the Irish.  Nicaragua Support Group and other voluntary groups who send people out to work to bring the coffee crop home, or to do any work to support the economy in a voluntary way. The Government are doing virtually nothing.  It should be recognised by the Government that the Nicaraguan regime, despite the restrictions which it has had to put on freedom and which compare extremely well with restrictions on freedom in other countries which are threatened by terrorism inside, including ourselves, has managed to make great progress in the realm of human rights.</P>
    <P>It should be noted, and I cannot emphasise this more strongly, that one of the first things that the Nicaraguan Government put into effect when the <Col N="652" /> Sandinistas came to power was to abolish the death penalty, something which in its wisdom the Government here have not seen fit to do.  In addition, there is a particularly humane prison system operating in Nicaragua, an enlightened one, and a most unusual one which I was privileged to witness which is based not so much on punishment but on rehabilitation. Nicaragua has ratified the UN covenant on civil and political rights and it has, in a very unusual move, guaranteed the rights of indigenous peoples which means giving them the rights to the preservation of their own language and culture.  This was in direct response to the mistakes which the Sandinista Government made and acknowledged it had made in regard to the Indians.  I think in direct response to that it reacted by guaranteeing them these rights.  I cannot emphasise more strongly that while the Government is not perfect in any way, it is certainly happy to recognise its mistakes and it is certainly moving in a direction which must be acceptable to the western world in terms of human rights and democracy.</P>
    <P>There are several things that the Irish Government can do as regards Nicaragua. The first is a general move, to stop hiding behind UN resolutions and EC resolutions and moves.  These are worthy, these are supportable, but they are not positive enough.  I do not wish to anticipate the Minister's reply but I hope he does not say that we have supported all the peace moves which have been made in Central America over the years, that we have supported the UN resolutions and that we contribute through bilateral aid.  That is simply not enough.  That is simply cowardly and that is simply not what the role of truly neutral country committed to democracy and the rights of small nations should be doing.  What we can do is take positive action in several ways.  We can increase bilateral aid by responding to appeals from Nicaragua, such as the recent one after the hurricane. We can break our silence on US policy. Our silence was apparent from the time when the United States mined the ports, to the result of the judgment of the Court <Col N="653" /> of Justice at the Hague which found against the US.  If ever there was a time for us to speak out it was after that particular judgment but we were silent.</P>
    <P>The final way we can do it, in specifics, apart from diplomatic relations to which I am coming, is to respond to the recent appeal after the hurricane.  The response from the Tánaiste to say that one had to compare this with worse disasters in Ethiopia and in Sudan was totally inadequate. In addition, I am a little tired of seeing reports on Nicaragua consigned to the shelves and gathering dust there. Apart from the report to which I contributed from the parliamentary delegation in November 1984, whose recommendations have not been implemented, there was another report from HEDCO in 1985 which made many recommendations on Nicaragua, one of which was the exchange of third level students between these countries and, indeed, I am told that £50,000 was allocated in the HEDCO budget for this. This has not come to pass either.  We could make a positive effort to increase trade with Nicaragua.  Our trading with Nicaragua is extremely small.  It is minimum. We could send out APSO personnel to Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>I am not anticipating the work of the nearly all-party committee on foreign affairs which has been set up by all parties, bar one, in the Oireachtas in the last two weeks.  This committee can take a stand in Nicaragua.  It can investigate and report on Nicaragua.  It can interview on Nicaragua and it can question on Nicaragua and it can pressure the Government on Nicaragua and it will do this.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the issue of diplomatic relations.  First of all, we have no diplomatic representation in Central America at all.  This is a great pity, it is a shame and I do not believe that the argument of expense is adequate to deal with it because it would surely be perfectly acceptable to the Government here and to the Nicaraguan Government if we were to introduce non-resident, inexpensive diplomatic relations with Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan Government, as the Minister will know, have frequently <Col N="654" /> requested that we open diplomatic relations with them and apparently this has been turned down by our Government. We need to introduce some element of consistency into our diplomatic relations with other countries.  I cannot understand how we can maintain diplomatic relations with Libya and not maintain diplomatic relations with Nicaragua. It seems to me there is a glaring inconsistency in our foreign policy but possibly the only reason is to do with trade, that the one criterion is trade.  If we were to initiate diplomatic relations with Nicaragua we would simply assert ourselves as an independent nation in the international world of diplomacy.  We would assert our independence of America, which is what we need to do, because the suspicion persists that our reluctance to make any courageous public pronouncement about an undoubtedly democratic regime in Nicaragua and about the indefensible hostility of the Americans towards it, is simply a cowardly reaction and a fear of some sort of consequences and a fear of America which is unmerited.  I believe we have this great chance with a new regime in America to take this step, this of opening formal diplomatic relations with Nicaragua. We would offend the Americans, yes, and I would like to offend the Americans on this issue but we would thereby assert our own genuine neutrality and independence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  The first thing that strikes me is that a debate like this would be perhaps much better attended and certainly better informed if there existed a joint Oireachtas committee on foreign affairs, as Senator Ross says.  In default of that we have set up an informal committee, but that is not, we must concede, quite the same thing as a prestige committee. No debate on foreign policy in these Houses can proceed properly in the absence of this controlling and informing influence represented by a joint Oireachtas committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, in the abstract, you talked about a small country trying to pursue its own <Col N="655" /> destiny, its own cultural destiny, its own economic philosophy and its concept of social justice, refusing to be cowed by big neighbour and continuing its struggle indomitably in the face of many manmade and natural odds, troubled by disasters and so on, you might well in thus describing such a country, be talking about our own country in times past.  That is one of the strongest moral reasons for what we are proposing in this motion.</P>
    <P>We could have been the same kind of people as the people in Nicaragua and we owe it to them, if you like, to give them our moral support. Indeed, 70 years ago, at the time of the first Dáil Éireann, when Sinn Féin which was the controlling group of the first Dáil Éireann were seeking to establish Irish independence, initially they did not want to, had no intention of resorting to physical force again.  They had no intention of fighting a guerilla war.  How different the history of Anglo-Irish relations and North-South relations might have been if they did not have to have recourse to that desperate resort. One of the things they hoped was that they would receive support and recognition from the international community but, alas, in vain.  Certainly, this is what Nicaragua is now looking for in reverse, as it were, that kind of support.  I suggest that we have a historical obligation to extend this to them.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in thinking about this matter today, I was struck by the way in which Mr. de Valera's stirring words in 1945 in his reply to Winston Churchill now apply to the Nicaraguan situation.  He asked the British Prime Minister whether he had any understanding of how a small country could be battered and bruised and yet recover and have the indomitable will to assert its independence.</P>
    <P>In other circumstances we might have tried the same social experiment as the Sandinistas.  We, too, might have embarked upon a bold experiment in trying to achieve social justice, as they are doing against all the odds.  This was the dream of some nationalists in the past, the dream of people like James Connolly, <Col N="656" /> and it is still the dream of a significant number of Irish people today.  Alas, by the time we secured a measure of independence, factors of culture, of cultural assimilation with the imperial country, factors of class, factors of vested interests and above all, perhaps, the proximity of the geographical connection, made that kind of revolution impracticable.  But there are circumstances in which it might have happened.</P>
    <P>Even though we live in what is largely a class-ridden society, a society polarised between want and privilege, still I think many Irish hearts do beat in unison with the Sandinistas.  Senator Ross has said it is far from a perfect régime &mdash; what régime is indeed?  &mdash; and he has outlined its faults.  Nevertheless, despite its imperfections, there is a genuine grassroots rapport between the people of Ireland and the people of Nicaragua.  It is evident in the number of people who go there as voluntary workers, it is evident, for example, in the remarkable number of support groups throughout the country, pro-Nicaragua groups.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross has spoken quite a lot about the need to stand up, as it were, to American interests in this regard.  I would strike a slightly different note.  I would say that pro-Nicaragua and even pro-Sandinista sentiments are not necessarily anti-American sentiments.  It is extremely important to distinguish between a particular kind of American foreign policy, a particular kind of American imperial adventurism on the one hand and the greatness of America and the sentiments of ordinary American people on the other.  As one who participated very actively in the demonstrations against President Reagan's visit here in 1984, I was proud that on the whole that distinction was maintained, that there was very little rabid anti-Americanism <i>per se</i>.  I do not think that it really arises in this case.</P>
    <P>I found &mdash; and I have much experience, I would suggest, of ordinary public opinion in the United States &mdash; that opposition to the policies of Reagan and the CIA in Central America is widespread in the United States.  Americans vote for <Col N="657" /> their President for particular reasons; they vote at a whole lot of other levels for their representatives and we have to observe the distinctions they are making there.  There is a great deal of reservations about American foreign policy in Central America and it is reflected, of course, in the repeated sentiments of Congress, which has differed very much from President Reagan's policies and the persistent refusal of Congress to back his obsessive pro-Contra adventures in Central America.  We should keep that in mind, it is a very important distinction.</P>
    <P>When I was in Boston in the winter of 1984-85 where I was I might say in political exile at that particular time &mdash; now happily restored to my rightful place &mdash; I had the opportunity of hearing on a number of occasions the spokespersons of the Sandinista Government.  It is one of the anomalies of the United States-Nicaraguan relationship that despite the hostility and the state of war, these people are free to travel to centres of America fora, like universities and so on to express their opinion.  On all those occasions I was struck by the sympathy expressed by very representative American audiences &mdash; not, if you like, extremist students or radicals &mdash; with the Sandinistas.  Let us then take comfort in that distinction.  I am sure it is a distinction which is well recognised in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I share Senator's Ross's hope rather than confidence that with a new régime in the White House this may be an opportune time to try to see whether the characteristically Reaganesque hang-up about Nicaragua has transferred or otherwise to his successor.  There are indications, in fact, despite our reservations and our natural suspicion, that there may be a new policy in the offing there.</P>
    <P>There is no shortage of our favourable sentiments to the Sandinistas, as Senator Ross has indicated.  When the parliamentary delegation of 1984 returned here and made a very favourable report it was well received in Dáil Éireann.  The Dáil on 5 November 1987 welcomed, on an all-party basis, the Arias initiative <Col N="658" /> which was very much in the news at that time but which, alas, failed to come to fruition.  At least at the level of parliamentary expression and so on, there is a sense of identification with the Sandinistas.</P>
    <P>Our performance at the United Nations is also, it seems, favourable to the Sandinistas if we are to judge by the history of the motions that we have supported there in favour of Nicaragua. It could be said that the resolutions of the European Community are also favourable to the Nicaraguan Government as in the commitment of the Foreign Ministers meeting in February 1988 in Hamburg with their Central American counterparts and expressing motions approving in general the principles of peace and democracy in the area.  There would seem to be no shortage of our sentiments of sympathy but they lack any hard application, as Senator Ross has pointed out.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross has also referred to this matter as being a test of our independence. That is true.  I would again point out in the matter of the triangular relationship between us, the United States and the Third World that when President Kennedy addressed the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1963 he paid particular tribute to Ireland's independent foreign policy which was, perhaps, at its peak at that stage.  In other words, we stand to gain more respect from American politicians by exercising our independent muscle, no matter how small it is than by being, in some vague way, fearful of the consequences of stepping out of line with White House policy.</P>
    <P>What is asked for in practice in this motion will not commit the Government to any great expense because what is asked for is a moral commitment.  What the Nicaraguans want is our moral support, non-resident diplomatic contact. What they want is moral support rather than any kind of a lavish resident embassy representation.  I will submit that it is the test of our independent policy, or what remains of it under European Political Co-operation, that we should use our good offices with our United States <Col N="659" /> friends and I think it will be well received, hopefully under the new régime especially.  Above all, it is the kind of recognition and moral support which our forebears would have eagerly accepted 70 years ago at the foundation of this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. S. Haughey Mr. S. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I warn the next speaker that I will be brief and that there are just a few points I would like to make in relation to this Motion.  I would like to thank very sincerely Senator Ross and Senator Murphy for their excellent assessment of the situation in Nicaragua.  Unfortunately, it is not a country I know a lot about.  I have just the sort of general information that one receives from time to time in our media.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what the Senators had to say in this regard and found it highly informative.  A number of arguments were advanced on why this motion should be supported.  The fundamental aspect which we need to look at is the economic situation of this country.  I know, no matter what motion is proposed, at the end of the day the Government will always raise our economic situation and, in particular, the state of the public finances in some way or other in relation to the motion.  As a small nation, this must be of major concern to us.  There is no need for me to outline the position regarding our financial situation and the endeavours being made by the Government to bring that situation under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going away from the motion, all parties and all interested groups realise our situation and the very tough measures which need to be taken to get the public finances under control.  We have to ask ourselves, is it wise at this stage to open diplomatic missions in countries throughout the world, given the state which we find ourselves in at home. We are a small nation of 3½ million people.  We have a very proud tradition. We could describe ourselves as having an empire throughout the world in that Irish people have found themselves all over the world and have made a great contribution <Col N="660" /> but at the end of the day we have to ask ourselves if our economy can support diplomatic missions in many countries given the difficult situation which we have at home.</P>
    <P>There are many requests to the Government to establish diplomatic relations with various nations and each one of them has to be looked at.  I would suggest that of all the countries seeking to establish diplomatic relations with us, Nicaragua must be down the list somewhat. That is not to take away from the arguments advanced by Senator Ross and Senator Murphy, and the moral argument in particular which they have put forward.  Maybe to establish diplomatic relations would be the moral thing to do; I do not know, but at the end of the day we have to ask ourselves, can we afford it?</P>
    <P>Another issue which has been raised is the issue of Irish neutrality.  This was bound to come up in a debate such as this. Irish neutrality is a positive neutrality. It is not just the avoidance of military alliances.  It is also the positive promotion of peace and justice throughout the world.  Ireland has a proud tradition in this regard.  Going back to the endeavours of de Valera and Aiken in the early stages of the formation of this State, a proud tradition was established.  Ireland, as a nation, has used every forum to promote this moral mission and to promote peace and justice throughout the world.  We have used the United Nations for this purpose.  More recently, we are using the whole process of European Political Co-operation to promote peace and justice.  We are a very important nation involved in that process because with a different tradition from our European partners we can bring that tradition to the European process and promote our views in relation to world relations in the various fora at our disposal.  Our nuns, priests and missionaries have gone out throughout the world and endeavoured to establish peace and justice and have come down on the side of those who are oppressed and so forth.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments advanced as to why we should support this motion is that <Col N="661" /> we should demonstrate we are not slaves to the American Administration and foreign policy.  This does not seem to be a very good argument.  We do not have to demonstrate to anybody our proud tradition and our role.  It would seem it is quite an expensive way to demonstrate that we are not slavishly following American policy and dictates.  There are other ways in which we can demonstrate it, if that is necessary, but I do not think it is.  There are many aspects of American foreign policy with which Ireland would disagree and would say so should the situation justify it.  To argue that we should open diplomatic relations with Nicaragua to show our position is not a good argument.</P>
    <P>The whole issue of trade has also been mentioned.  Trade is also a major factor to be taken into account when opening diplomatic relations.  This is seen in the case of the countries with which we have opened diplomatic relations at this stage. Libya was mentioned by Senator Ross. Trade is important.  If we are going to spend money on promoting our country, trade must be taken into account.  Unless I am mistaken, I did not hear one product mentioned with regard to Nicaragua as a reason to open diplomatic relations with them, and this is a factor to be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I do not know just how beneficial opening diplomatic relations with Nicaragua would be from the point of view of trade.  Maybe other Senators in the House can advance arguments for this but at the end of the day, those two arguments, the economic reasons and the trade reasons, must also be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe this proposal is a priority for the Government, either in <Col N="662" /> terms of their overall objectives or in terms of their foreign policy objectives. There are many other nations which would be higher up on the list.  At the moment, because of our economic situation, we are closing down foreign missions. Senator Ross, I understand, supports in general the economic policies being brought forward by the parties in Dáil Éireann and by the Government. To open diplomatic relations in this way, either in Nicaragua or in Central America as whole, would cost us money and it cannot be a priority.  I do not think any good reasons were advanced as to why we should support this motion at this time.  I thank Senators Ross and Murphy for outlining the position as it is in Nicaragua. I found their contributions extremely educational but to open diplomatic relations at this time I believe would be impractical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael have no problem with this proposal to establish diplomatic relations with Nicaragua.  We would go a little further and say that we should establish diplomatic relations with all Central American Republics.  Since Nicaragua, with a population of 3.5 million, is the largest of the Central American Republics, we should, when economic conditions allow, establish an embassy in Managua and accredit our ambassador there to the other capitals in Central America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are aware that on three occasions since 1981 Nicaragua has sought to establish diplomatic relations with this country. On all occasions the request was not acceeded to because the resources of the Department of Foreign Affairs did not allow any extension of our diplomatic presence overseas.  In fact, last year we closed our embassy in Kenya, one of the key countries in Africa, which was, I think, a most retrograde step.  We made that move in the name of economy.  But we committed an even worse betrayal when the Government cut our overseas aid budget by 21 per cent in the current year of 1988 over 1987.  In the coming year of 1989 we have a proposal to cut <Col N="663" /> our bilateral aid programme by 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Our party feel that there is every good reason why this country should have formal diplomatic relations with a developing country like Nicaragua, as we should have with all Central.  American states and the Caribbean countries and with those countries in Latin America who do not violate human rights.  We share a common historical experience with most of these countries, except in most of their cases they have failed to oust the colonial overlord.  A few generations ago we experienced much of their economic and social experience nowadays, such as poverty, poor housing, poor health among the population etc.</P>
    <P>Nicaragua, like ourselves, has had a very unhappy history.  Indeed it is located in an unhappy, violent and poverty-stricken region of the world.  The modern state of Nicaragua emerged after 1838. Prior to that it had over 200 years of Spanish dominion.  For years it was part of the Central American Federation.  In 1912 there commenced an unhappy period of American intervention in the country, which lasts to this day.  We might add that American invasion in 1912 was at the instigation and the invitation of the then Nicaraguan Government.  The US forces stayed on in that country until 1933.  The notorious Somosas seized power there in 1935 and a series of father, uncles and sons &mdash; all members of the Somosa family &mdash; imposed the most brutal dictatorship on this unfortunate land and people until 1979 when the last of the Somosa dictators was driven out on 17 July of that year.</P>
    <P>In the Sandinista revolution which led to the overthrow of the dictatorship &mdash; which had lasted from 1970-1979 &mdash; it is estimated that 50,000 people died in the hostilities.  In December 1972 one of the worst natural calamities of this century, an earthquake, hit Nicaragua, killing 10,000 in the capital city of Managua and possibly countless thousands outside the city who, for all kinds of reasons, could not be counted.</P>
    <P>After the liberation in 1979 the Junta, <Col N="664" /> as it was then called, issued a statute of rights and guarantees, providing for basic personal freedoms and restoring of freedom of the press and broadcasting.  Civil rights were formally restored by law in 1980 but elections promised for that year were postponed.  The situation in the country worsened in the period 1981-82. There were protests by the opposition about the continued postponement of the elections and what the opposition perceived as the increasing political hegemony of the Sandinistas.  In 1982 a group of about 2,000 guerillas, who were formerly members of the Somosa National Guard and who had fled at the time of the revolution to Honduras and had regrouped there, began attacks on border posts and other government installations in Nicaragua, operating out of the neighbouring country of Honduras. Meanwhile, relations with the United States of America, under Ronald Reagan, grew worse and worse.  In April 1982 the US Government cut off all economic aid to this poverty stricken country, on the excuse that the Sandinista Government were trying to overthrow the regime in neighbouring El Salvador and also because it seemed to the Americans that the Sandinistas were establishing a client state of Cuba and the USSR.  That was the perception of Ronald Reagan's America at that time.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, in 1982, the United States gave £10 million to the Contras operating out of Honduras.  They also provided $19 million to the Central Intelligence Agency for covert operations inside Nicaragua, to destabilise the political and economic situation there.  Ostensibly, the Reagan administration would say that this money was spent to frustrate the traffic in arms by the Sandinistas to anti-government guerillas in neighbouring El Salvador but in reality this was a lie.</P>
    <P>First, the Sandinistas did not help matters internally.  This has been referred to by Senator Ross and I might repeat much of what he said in relation to the handling of one problem by the government.  I refer to the very hasty and insensitive attempt to integrate and relocate about 120,000 Miskito Indians who live along <Col N="665" /> the Atlantic coast.  This relocation proved to be a complete disaster and led to demands for a separate independent Miskito nation and led to internal insurgence. The 10,000 Indians forced to move by the regime mostly went to Honduras to join the Contras and the remainder of the Miskito nation in Nicaragua became supporters of the Contras.</P>
    <P>In the early eighties a group of countries in the region Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela attempted to bring about a peaceful solution to this Nicaraguan tragedy.  They were called the Contadora group.  Sadly, their efforts failed as their efforts to solve other problems of external intervention and internal insurgency throughout Central America failed.  The later initiative by Costa Rica's President Arias, is presently being applied.  While it made very significant progress initially it would appear to have lost a lot of its steam nowadays and that is a terrible pity.</P>
    <P>The fact that the US Congress stopped aid to the Contras and also stopped funding the CIA for covert operations within Nicaragua in 1987 after the appalling revelations in the Iran-Contra scandal, was another step in the right direction.  It coincided with the Arias plan for peace in the region.</P>
    <P>Less than two months ago the terrible forces of nature again struck this unfortunate country.  I refer to the terrible devastation which was wreaked on this country by hurricane Joan.  While the death toll was mercifully low by 1972 standards, because of the early warning system, the economic devastation to this country is staggering.  It is estimated that 350,000 people are homeless after the hurricane.  That is 10 per cent of the total population of this unhappy land.  The important port and trading centre of Bluefields was completely destroyed and 50,000 people are homeless in this city alone as a result of the hurricane destruction. Forty five per cent of the working population of Nicaragua are directly involved in agriculture and about a further 20 per cent of the working population are indirectly involved in the agri-food related industries.  The hurricane <Col N="666" /> destroyed thousands of acres of the most productive agricultural land by blowing away the fertile top soil.  No-one knows yet the exact extent of this disaster or what, if anything, can be done to reinstate the land.  The fishing industry was destroyed by the tidal destruction of the oyster and shrimp beds along the Atlantic coast during the hurricane. Exports of these fish species especially are an important part of the country's exports.</P>
    <P>Much propaganda has been waged in the west and in this country against the Sandinista Government because of its Marxist approach to the land question and the internal distribution of wealth in the country.  Its good relationship with Cuba and other Marxist governments has been used along with the allegation of internal oppression.  It is up to the Nicaraguan people to choose the type of government they want.  That is their business and the business of nobody else.</P>
    <P>Much has been made about the state's conflict with the Catholic Church but close examination shows that many young priests and clergy support the government as do Catholics who support the new doctrine of liberation theology. The belief in liberation theology is widespread in the Church nowadays especially in Central and Latin America.  The conflict with the Church has most often been with the more conservative hierarchy.  A delegation from Trócaire, the Catholic Agency in Ireland for World Development, visited Nicaragua in November 1985.  The members of the delegation were Bishop Eamon Casey of Galway, chairman of Trócaire, Bishop Michael Murphy of Cork, Brian McKeown, director of Trócaire and Sally O'Neill, head of projects in Trócaire.  I will read to the House a seven point conclusion which they published after their return from Nicaragua:</P>
    <P>Although the Nicaraguan Government appears to be containing the threat from the Contras, the economic effects on the country are serious.</P>
    <P>Throughout Nicaragua popular support for the government remains high. <Col N="667" /> That continued US support for the terrorist actions of the Contras, despite worldwide criticism, indicates there can be no peace until the US ceases its aggression against Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>That, after initially giving support, the hierarchy now opposes the Sandinistas, believing the Church to be under threat; that there is, however, widespread support for the &ldquo;people's Church&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That the hierarchy should be prepared to break its silence on the Contra atrocities.</P>
    <P>That, the Contradora peace initiative must be given every encouragement as offering the best possibility of lasting peace in the region.</P>
    <P>&mdash; that, as I have mentioned, will be more or less replaced by the Arias plan&mdash;</P>
    <P>That tensions between Church and State can be resolved only by full and frank dialogue under the auspices of the proposed Church/State Commission.</P>
    <P>I have read from a report on the visit of a Trócaire delegation to El Salvador, Nicaragua and Cuba in November 1985 and published by Trócaire, the Catholic Agency for World Development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to support this motion for a number of reasons. Nicaragua is one of the nations which have not only signed but also ratified the UN convenants on social and political rights.  These convenants, which were drawn up in 1966, were presented for ratification ten years later.  Ireland has signed them but has yet to ratify them.  I have always felt that was a great defect because it has some importance on the way we look at the problem at home as well as the way we look at problems similar to the one in Nicaragua.  The Nicaraguans have gone further.  Senator Connor mentioned the disastrous way the Miskito Indian affair was managed.  Since then the Nicaraguans have brought the <Col N="668" /> rights of indigenous peoples into the constitution with a view to guaranteeing them their place in the country at large and seeing the development of a true pluralism.</P>
      <P>For some years, I have been trying to have this matter debated in Seanad Éireann but the motion never reached the point of debate.  If we affirm the right of all peoples to self-determination in accordance with Article 1, clause 1, of the UN covenants, then there comes a point where you have a section of the country affirming its right to self-determination, another section affirming its right and you have a recipe for chaos, or at least conflict and you cannot have that right which was important in the decolonisation of the world without qualifying it by the need to achieve consensus.  I see in the Nicaraguan scene an attempt to grapple with the concept of consensus within the context of the right to self-determination. I applaud that effort, unsuccessful or unfulfilled though it may have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I applaud what has happened in Nicaragua for a number of reasons.  The wealthy and privileged part of the world for a brief moment in 1968 was trying to say from a point of privilege what the people of Nicaragua have been saying from a point of under-privilege.  When the French students went out on the streets of Paris in 1968, they were rejecting institutional imperialism, they were rejecting bureaucratic centralism, they were rejecting unaccountable autocracy and they were saying, &ldquo;Let us give power back to ordinary people who are now better educated, more globally aware, more inter-communicative than ever before with new technology and let us have a say in our own affairs and give us the power to make that say effective.&rdquo; Unfortunately, what happened in 1968 was almost a watershed.  It did not succeed in Europe and, in fact, it is in the Third World countries where people have least but where they have the greatest need to do something about their condition that we have seen strides, always under pressure, to try to create a new form of participating democracy.  The <Col N="669" /> tragedy is, of course, that they start off from such an insecure base and very often at great disadvantage because the country has previously been penetrated by perhaps the most exploitive forms of international capitalism, neo-imperialism and neo-colonialism.</P>
    <P>Whatever one may say about the defects in the Nicaraguan situation and the failures that exist &mdash; and like any society there are failures as well as successes &mdash; one has to recognise the enormous struggle that has been taking place there for people to rise from their knees, stand on their feet and give expression which will ultimately gain them self-respect. This is a small nation about which we are talking.  We are not talking about 50 million people let alone 400 million people.  We are talking about three million people, a pimple, if you like, in the context of the world population and yet that nation has been subjected to the most extraordinary attitude and action by its very powerful neighbour, the USA.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear what Sentor Murphy had to say about America because it is very easy to criticise America and Americanism, but let us not forget that America and its constitution managed to survive in the last few decades both Vietnam and Watergate.  It has managed to last for 200 years and has given freedom and prosperity to many peoples of the world but, for some reason since 1945, it seems to have taken upon itself a new role in world affairs; perhaps paranoia with communism would be the most charitable way of looking at what has taken place in many parts of the world. But this terrible fear of difference, of change, of challenge of a different political philosophy on its backdoor step, albeit from three million people trying to rise from poverty, trying to obtain self-respect, seems an extraordinary overreaction on the part of such a powerful and successful nation as America.  I hope and trust that this new presidency, the new Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate, will address themselves to the problem of Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>It seems a total irony that we have Irish Americans in North America preaching <Col N="670" /> about the appalling excesses, as they see it, of injustice in Northern Ireland when, in fact, they pall by comparison with the injustice that the Nicaraguan people have suffered as a result of the USA support for the Contras.  In the next St. Patrick's Day parade in New York, I would like to see an Irish delegation asking &mdash; preferably behind some delegation asking for justice in Northern Ireland &mdash; for justice for the people of Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the delegates from Ireland who went to look at the Nicaraguan elections.  They were Deputy Michael Higgins, Senator, as he was then, Liam Hyland, and Deputy Bernard Allen and the illustrious proposer of this motion, Senator Ross.  They represented a very broad spectrum of political opinion in Ireland and it goes without saying that they came back, even those who might have been sceptical, fairly convinced that in as far as it was possible in the conditions that prevailed elections in Nicaragua had been very fairly administered.</P>
    <P>Let us just look briefly at what has been achieved and I emphasise that the achievements have been in spite of enormous pressure, pressure of trade embargoes, of support for anti-Sandinista forces and the disruption of years of a most terrible war in a country with very limited resources.  They have held, as far as one can detect, full and fair elections.  A new constitution has been created and there is now a much greater appreciation, since the debacle of the Indian problem, of the need for pluralism.  We could certainly learn from that lesson.  They have lifted their state of emergency.  They have sought earnestly and genuinely some ceasefire with the Contras.  They have a non-aligned foreign policy.  As a country which claims to be pursuing a positive neutral policy in world affairs, let Ireland not forget, before we should be subsumed by some other influences, that there is a great need for the small nations of the world to remain non-aligned, to form a federation of small non-aligned nations in order to put pressure on the big nations to try to help in the disarmament process <Col N="671" /> which thankfully seems to have made some sort of a beginning.</P>
    <P>Nicaragua is symbolic of man's desire for freedom; it is symbolic of the desire of the little man and the little country to have a say in the affairs of the world and not to become part of a great amorphous conglomorate.  Ireland supports a joint European declaration that extra-regional governments providing aid to non-regular forces should discontinue such aid. Therefore, I would ask the Government what are we actually doing about that in relation to America's aid to the Contras?</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned and how we as a people relate to Nicaragua, there are a number of things that can be done. Let me say again, as I said before, through the tremendous network of the Catholic Church around the world, we have an <i>entrée</i> into many countries in the Third World that are in a state of distress and it is vital even if we cannot, for financial reasons, as Senator Haughey suggested, establish diplomatic relations immediately, that we establish quasi-diplomatic relations through encouraging our youth into exchanges with the youth in Nicaragua.  After all, Spanish will become a very important language in our role as Europeans: I know people in Northern Ireland who have already participated in exchanges with Nicaragua. We could have exchanges at university level.  There could be trade union exchanges, cultural exchanges and professional exchanges.</P>
    <P>Our profession is trained brilliantly to meet the requirements of the high-tech super-medicine of the western world. While we pride ourselves on a lower infant mortality rate and a longer life expectancy if taken in a global sense we are living in a world where the life expectancy is less today than it was 20 years ago and infant mortality is greater.  One only has to think of the population explosion and the inability to cope with the social conditions that exist in a world of depleting natural resources because of the way in which they are being exploited.  The fact is that the biggest explosion is in Third World countries where there is <Col N="672" /> least capacity to sustain that explosion. There is a need for professional people to learn from Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>We could go there and learn about the co-operatives, about the mixed economy and how the inter-relationship that exists between the private state section and the co-operatives works and see if it might be relevant to our country; to decentralise our society and give back to our people the power, self-respect and self-esteem that is so badly needed where we live and where we work so that we are not so dependent on remote bureaucratic forces, certainly in the North of Ireland, which are totally unaccountable to us.</P>
    <P>I applaud the struggle that has been taking place in Nicaragua to give people self-respect.  I recognise the difficulties, the dangers and the failures.  There have been failures.  We must be able to monitor those failures and we must be able to chastise where it is necessary.  For those reasons we need to establish diplomatic relations with a country where we will have the respect of that country because, in a sense, Ireland is the bridge between the privileged world and the Third World for many reasons which were mentioned here before.  It is vital that we apply ourselves to the possibility to establishing diplomatic relations.  In the meantime we should urge the maximum contact with Nicaragua in order to learn from and help Nicaragua and also perhaps to act ourselves as a respected monitor of what is happening there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very honoured to have my name associated with this important motion.  The fact that it has been selected and taken by the Independent group indicates our seriousness with regard to the whole issue of foreign affairs.  There have been a number of foreign affairs debates, including some which the Government made time for, which originated from this side of the House and this clearly underlines the importance, recognised widely, of the establishment of a foreign affairs committee. We are very glad that we have done this, that it is up and running and <Col N="673" /> we believe that it will be a very important committee.</P>
      <P>It is generally felt throughout the House that there must be an accountability in foreign affairs that is lacking at the moment.  I wonder sometimes, listening to responses from various Ministers in this area, who precisely is writing the foreign policy of this country because there is very little accountability.  I have looked back over the Official Report of previous parliamentary sessions and there is a suspicious consistency of tone. For example, I have looked back to the period when this situation was brought to the attention of senior political figures in the past.  As far back as 1984, a very distinguished member of the Dáil, Deputy Frank Cluskey, raised this matter outside the immediate context of a parliamentary debate but looking for further information in correspondence with Deputy Peter Barry.  I have a copy of the letter that he received in answer to his query.  The letter states that &ldquo;with regard to the question of establishing diplomatic relations with Nicaragua the present position is that due to limited financial and personnel resources we are not in a position to establish diplomatic relations even on a non-resident basis with Nicaragua at this time.&rdquo;  It was pointed out, however, that formal diplomatic relations in the sense of having a mission accredited to a country on a resident or non-resident basis are maintained by us only with a minority of countries up to the present time.  The absence of formal diplomatic relations does not in any way affect the recognition by us of the Government of Nicaragua as the legitimate Government of that state nor does it constitute any barrier to the continuing friendly contacts between Ireland and Nicaragua and various international fora in which words of support were uttered on behalf of this country or trotted out here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That aspect of the matter is pathetically weak.  It is easy to lend one's voice in the comfortable camouflage of a European context to protect us from the wrath of those who may be offended, for example, in Washington.  I note that on 24 March 1987 a similar response was given by <Col N="674" /> Deputy Lenihan in response to a question from Deputy Proinsias De Rossa of The Workers' Party.  Deputy Lenihan replied saying:</P>
    <P>The question of diplomatic relations is kept under continuous review in the light of our international interests and the availability of the necessary resources. The Government have no plans at present to establish formal diplomatic relations with Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>We heard this evening from Senator Haughey that while it might be the moral thing to establish formal diplomatic relations with Nicaragua he asked if we could afford it?  Is that not an interesting question?  Is the basis of Irish political morality based on what we can afford and only what we can afford, particularly when that question amounts to virtually zero because we are talking about a situation in which the Nicaraguan Ambassador in London would be accredited to Dublin and some similar arrangement would be made with regard to our representation in Nicaragua.  Let us not have any of this nonsense about expense.  That is just a smokescreen.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that there is such a consistency of line here and it suggests to me that certain significant areas of the foreign policy of this country, because they were not subject to scrutiny until quite recently, and at the moment not with Government recognition by any foreign affairs committee, can escape into an area where they are dictated in an arena and by people who are not apparently accountable to the Oireachtas.  This is very worrying.  It is particularly worrying when we are told that there is a kind of simoniacal situation in foreign policy by which I mean that we can only afford that kind of morality for which there is a precise financial equation.  That is shameful particularly when it is placed in the light of what is happening in Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>I will not rehearse the history of it in detail.  There has been a lot of information given to the House with regard to the situation in Nicaragua but surely this country is in a position, better than any <Col N="675" /> other, to appreciate the situation of Nicaragua. As a neutral country, we are in a position to have a moral influence.  It is important that we, as friends of America, and we are friends of America, live up to our obligation to tell those friends when they are making serious mistakes.</P>
    <P>The mistakes of the American Administration over a long period of years have been mistakes so serious as to place them within the realms of international criminal aggression.  There is no doubt about this and the Americans know it. Some of the most conservative Americans know it to such an extent that their language becomes unusually vulgar. Barry Goldwater, a Presidential candidate, who was regarded as one of the most right-wing of all people responded to the situation when in 1984, the CIA, acting on the instructions of the Reagan Administration had placed mines in the harbours of Port Corinto, Porto Sandino and El Bluff, an act of military aggression against a friendly neighbouring State without a declaration of war, without the consent of Congress and in flagrant defiance of international law by writing to the Director of the CIA.  At this point, Senator Goldwater was Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and his terms were rather strong.  He said &ldquo;I am pissed off &mdash; this is an act violating international law.  It is an act of war ...&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for attending this debate.  Donagh national school, a Protestant school, is situated in north Inishowen.  It is the result of amalgamation and closure of three other smaller Protestant schools.  The condition of the schools first came to my attention in July or August of this year when I visited that area with the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Alan Dukes.  As a result of visiting the school, I had the following correspondence from a parent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I met yourself and Alan Dukes on your visit to Carndonagh a month ago and we discussed the problem we are facing at our local Protestant school. We were sanctioned a brick building in April 1984, by the then Fine Gael Government after one of our two chalets was flattened in strong gales. The chalets had been used for 24 years.</P>
      <P>I am not sure whether the same chalets were used continually for the 24 years but this is what it would appear to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were granted a third teacher last February which was at least a help as the teachers and children were under the same cramped conditions even though she (that was the third teacher) was placed in a derelict building over a mile away.  Now we received another blow which I think has since been solved.  We have heard that we will be back to two teachers again in September which means that two teachers will have 36 children each in two small chalets which were originally designed for 20.  Can anyone please explain why we are having these added difficulties thrown at us?  Surely the Department <Col N="678" /> should be compensating us for the closure over the years of three other local Protestant schools.</P>
    <P>Some of the children are doing a round trip of 25 miles each day on overcrowded mini-buses.  When my first child began school, she was home at 3.20 each day.  Now my fourth child is not collected from school until 3.40 after the mini-bus, which was put on for the Protestants of the area, has served two other schools first, with the result that she does not get home until 4.10 each day.  Added to that she has to have one of the younger children on her knee each day as the bus is overcrowded.  In September three new pupils will be starting.  How much more of this have we to put up with?  I am seriously thinking of getting extra tuition for my child to prepare her for secondary school in Raphoe.  Why are we supposed to accept less than our neighbours?</P>
    <P>I presume the neighbours she is referring to are her Catholic neighbours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt you, Senator Loughrey.  It would be better if you made your own contribution rather than reading a letter in total.  I do not mind a quotation from a letter to make your point, which I appreciate, but I do not think it is proper to read the full letter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect that ruling. My reason for doing it in that way is to try to impress upon the Minister how that parent felt about the education of her children and the frustrations she feels about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things I would like to say is that in that letter, and in another letter from a member of the parents association, there is an inference &mdash; to say the very least &mdash; that there is an anti-Protestant bias in the area.  I know that the Department of Education regulations down the years have a built-in pro-Protestant bias.  For example, fewer numbers are required for school bus services than are for Catholic children.  As far as I <Col N="679" /> know, the numbers for retention of teachers are lower than for Catholic children, so I understand there is no negative bias there.  It is not important that I understand it; it is important that the Protestants in that area who are affected understand it.  Because of their closeness to Northern Ireland both physically and through the various relationships they will have with people in Northern Ireland, it is very important that we make it absolutely clear as the old saying goes that &ldquo;not alone has justice to be done but it must be seen to be done&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The pro-Protestant bias, which we know exists, must be made clear to them but it can hardly be clear if there are 72 children in two small chalets.  In fact, that situation has now changed, in one sense for the better, but in another sense, maybe for the worst.  The third teacher has been reinstated after the revision of the numbers but this teacher has moved to another building over a mile away. From what I can gather, the teacher who volunteered to go is the principal of the school.  It seems strange to me that the principal is in one building with her class while her two assistants are in another building over a mile away.  We would all agree that that is not a desirable situation.</P>
    <P>In the correspondence they say they asked if a new school was being built, but the answer from the Minister was no.  I quote from the correspondence as follows:</P>
    <P>I have been in contact with Deputy Frank Fahey's office this week and have been told that there are no plans to give us a new school ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is despite the fact that they were granted the school four and a half years ago.  The measurements of the chalets are important.  They measure 29ft. X 16ft. X 7ft. 10 in. and 20ft. X 24ft. X 7ft. 10 in. with a tiny play area which is dangerous for smaller children.  They have the problem that four children are in need of remedial teaching.</P>
    <P>I referred already to the blowing down of the chalet.  That chalet was blown <Col N="680" /> down by a gale 15 minutes after the children had left school.  The parents are asking whether they have to wait until a similiar disaster occurs again before somebody will sit up and take notice.  At the time this letter was written, on 9 September, the secretary of the parents associations had been waiting three months for the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, to meet a deputation only to be advised that the Minister was too busy. In these times of cutbacks it is understandable that all Ministers are busy, but I think the Minister should not have been too busy to meet this deputation &mdash; however, I gather that she met them earlier today, which I find very strange.  It is possibly pure coincidence but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge they only became aware of the arrangement three or four days ago. I became aware of it only this afternoon on meeting Deputy Hugh Conaghan.  A little to my surprise he did not invite me to be on the deputation either beforehand or when I found out coincidentally today from a chance remark which was passed that they were meeting a deputation.  I pointed out to Deputy Conaghan that I was raising this matter on the Adjournment in the expectation that he would say I had better come along, but he did not.  I did not want to push myself because I was not a part of the setting up of the deputation, but I felt that I might have been invited.  Which Minister did they meet today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">

    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the results of that meeting, but I will put a few figures before the Minister.  Apparently his Department are volunteering an increased grant to them.  I do not have that grant figure.  They have a site with full title and £20,000 and they contend that building a new school, according to <Col N="681" /> estimates provided to them by a chartered quantity surveyor, would in fact save the Department money.  To remodel the existing school at Glebe would cost £100,000.  To build a new school on their site would cost £154,000, admittedly a differential of £54,000, but that does not take into consideration the provision of the site.</P>
      <P>Finally, I am sure that they have made their case well today to the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke.  I am attempting to add, not just my voice but my support to the case, whatever case they have made.  I wish to emphasise the two most important things in it: first, the danger that exists to those children and, secondly, the importance that they will not feel any negative bias but rather that they should feel and know of the positive bias.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Loughrey for his very fair contribution. My information is that Donagh national school at Carndonagh has an average enrolment of 72 pupils drawn from the Protestant communities in the locality.  It has a staff of two teachers. The present building comprises two prefabricated classrooms, one of which was provided in 1984 with grant-aid from my Department to replace a prefabricated classroom damaged during the storm. The present site is reported to be somewhat restricted.</P>
      <P>My Department in 1985, on the basis of enrolment forecasts made at that time, indicated to the school authorities that they proposed to request the Commissioners of Public Works to design a new three classroom school which would have a general purposes area and the usual ancillary accommodation.  Subsequently, due to pressure on the commissioners' personnel, the commissioners agreed that the school authorities might engage their own architects for the design work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, the 1985 decision envisaged an increase in the staff level of the school. <Col N="682" /> The plans which were subsequently submitted were acceptable from an architectural point of view, but on cost grounds could not be proceeded with because of pressure on the capital available for national school building.  Apart from this factor, it began to be a bit doubtful that the staffing at the school would, in the long term, reach the level envisaged when the brief for the project was first settled.</P>
    <P>It is accepted generally that the present accommodation is unsuitable, and in line with the Department's current policy of avoiding duplication of scarce resources, and with a view to improving accommodation, it was suggested that the school should explore the possibility of using a vacant national school building in Carndonagh, the improvement of which my Department would be willing to grant-aid if acquired by the Donagh national school.  My Department's costings for the improvement works suggested a satisfactory job could be done at a modest cost, and would result in a significant improvement in working conditions for the school.  This suggestion, however, did not find favour with some of the parents of the children attending the school, who held that the correct solution was the original one of providing a new school on a new site.</P>
    <P>The present position is that a deputation from the school met the Minister for Education this evening and a discussion of the case in some detail took place.  The points made to the Minister at this meeting will be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>The Senator will appreciate that I do not wish at this stage to pre-empt matters by attempting at this point to speculate on the outcome of today's discussions. A decision will be conveyed as soon as possible to the school authorities about the latest representations, and in view of his interests in the matter I will have the Senator informed of the developments.</P>
    <P>With regard to the transport problem raised by the Senator, I am not aware of any difficulties, but I would appreciate it if he would give me the letter in regard to the transport.  Is it correct that the <Col N="683" /> bus is overcrowded and that therefore a bigger bus is required?</P>

      <P>The transport was laid on for Protestants but it would seem that they must be collecting Catholic children on the way before the Protestant children get on.  Her daughter is not now home until 4.10 p.m. and has to nurse a younger child, which suggests that there is overcrowding there.</P>
      <P>I forgot to mention that in one of the two locations, there is only one toilet bowl available for a mixed group of older children.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Minister is aware that the accommodation is not good and she is certainly undertaking to deal with <Col N="684" /> the problem as quickly as possible. Senator, may I take the letter from you in regard to the transport, and I will bring it to the Minister's attention?  Indeed, the Minister shows her great concern for all minorities and I know that she will be keen to act in this matter as quickly as possible.  Certainly I would be keen that those people do not feel they are treated in an inferior way to anybody else.  I will bring that to the Minister's attention immediately and if there is a reasonable case to be made, I have no doubt but that she will respond positively in regard to providing an improvement.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 23 November 1988.</P>
