      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael Ferris that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make urgent representations to the Belgian Government concerning Fr. Paddy Ryan's release, where extradition to Britain is to be decided by that Government this week.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Ferris as suitable for discussion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed that we take items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 today, item No. 4 to be taken from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.  It was our intention to take items Nos. 5, 6 and 7 tomorrow.  I regret we will not be taking item No. 6 tomorrow for reasons outside our control but I am sure the House will agree that it is preferable that the Tánaiste should be here for the debate on item No. 6, which will be taken next week.  Item No. 7 will be taken tomorrow with item No. 5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business, such as the business is for today &mdash; and it is a very slight amount of business &mdash; is agreed but I have the most serious reservations about what the Leader of the House has told us about tomorrow. On item No. 7, the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred Bill, 1988, the Explanatory Memorandum to that Bill has not yet been circulated so I do not know how we can be expected to take the Second Stage of the Bill tomorrow when, as yet, we have not got the Explanatory Memorandum. The abandoning of item No. 6 goes back on a solemn pledge given to us last week by the Leader of the House after a great deal of pressure.  I cannot understand why this has happened and we will not agree to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I explain personally that I have taken three days holidays and I have an arrangement with people to come down from Northern Ireland tomorrow to listen to this debate and here we are at the last moment with the whole thing changed and whole organisation that is involved in trying to attend an important debate like this has got to be reversed.  I feel there is something wrong with the management of this matter which is possibly the most important matter in the whole country.  I am referring to item No. 6 on the Order Paper.  We have been waiting for it: we were led to believe it would take place <Col N="687" /> tomorrow and now at the last moment we are told it will not take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of grave concern.  It has been discussed, and discussed and discussed.  Last week we had this matter down for debate in Private Members' Time and once again we got a solemn commitment from the Government that it would be dealt with on Thursday of this week, namely, tomorrow.  It is untenable for us to be asked to live with a situation where at five or six minutes notice we are suddenly told that the whole planning and the whole commitment of the week is thrown awry without any adequate consultation. We have always been reasonable on these matters but I think this goes beyond the bounds of reasonableness &mdash; to ask us to live with this.  It is disgraceful.  It is insulting to the Members of the House, on both sides who have gone to a lot of trouble preparing for this debate tomorrow, probably the most important debate that we have faced up to for quite a period of time, to be told it will not now take place.  I cannot accept that this is any acceptable way of running business.  I would plead with you, a Chathaoirligh&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would request of you, a Chathaoirligh, that for the sake of the good name and reputation of this House you would comment on this type <Col N="688" /> of slipshod arrangement and the lack of accountability&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot involve myself in a comment on this.  I understand the atmosphere at the moment, but in fairness to the Leader, of the House, if I heard him properly, he did say that the Tánaiste was out of the country and that the House might like the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to be here. I am not taking any sides now, but I do think that it is the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs who should be taking this debate.  I still want to get back to today's business and let us have another discussion tomorrow morning on tomorrow's business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that there might be a compromise available to us, because obviously it is important to us that we discuss this subject as soon as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Leader of the House has introduced the problem to us now on the Order of Business, perhaps we might just try to clear it this way publicly, because the public expect us to debate this tomorrow.  May I suggest that, as it is an important subject, possibly two days will be required, and perhaps we could begin the discussion and allow all parties to contribute so that we can wind up the debate in the following week with the Tánaiste present?  I am suggesting a two-day debate on this with the Tánaiste present on the second day.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>But could the Leader of the House possibly respond further on this?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are rules here that I have to adhere to; but because I give way a bit every Wednesday to all of <Col N="689" /> you, whom I consider my friends, I find the thing going out from under me.  We have to get back to today's Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general conduct of business &mdash; and my remarks are not meant to be the slightest reflection on yourself, a Chathaoirligh, because as some of us know, ruefully, you run a very tight ship, nor are they supposed in any way to exonerate me from what I want to say &mdash; I have noticed again within recent weeks &mdash; the amount of general inattention in the House in the course of debates in general, and I find it very irritating.  I admit being at fault myself.  I am not above facetiously colloguing with my colleagues here at the back on whatever takes my fancy, but I must say at the same time there seems to me a lot of consultations going on which are not at all urgent between Senators, between the Chair, if I may say so, the Clerk and the Minister's advisers.  I just want to draw attention to this to see if we can embark on a general campaign of reform in which I hope to amend my ways also.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I do not wish to embark on discussion of tomorrow's Order of Business, but in a sense when we come here on Wednesdays we are talking about the Wednesday and Thursday package.  It is relevant to say, briefly, that I hope the Leader of the House will change his mind on tomorrow's Order of Business.  There is an atmosphere of expectation.  To defer this debate tomorrow or even to interrupt it by substantial other business tomorrow would be an outrageous insult to this House and one on which we on this side of the House should take some exceptional action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must, first of all, appeal to the Cathaoirleach to remind us of the rules of the House, because I did not understand that we could have a situation where the Leader of the House could say something and we would not be allowed to comment on it.  If there is a rule of the House that I am unaware of, which conveys such a privilege to the Leader of <Col N="690" /> the House, then I would be extremely grateful if you drew my attention to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I allowed Senator Lanigan to make the remarks so as to try to bring some kind of harmony back into the House.  Every week Members want to know what is happening the following day and the following week.  Today he mentioned what was happening tomorrow. Perhaps I should not have allowed him to mention what was happening tomorrow and it would have made it easier for myself, but I thought it would help everyone.  Therefore, I allowed it. It is a no-win situation for me.  The only decision is on today's business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say, in response to what the Cathaoirleach has just said, that when I was a Member of the previous Seanad the then Leader of the House was able to tell me what we were doing this week, the following week and as far as four weeks in advance. There were exceptions.  It is not normally a role that I take on to defend members of the Fine Gael Party, but the then Leader of the House did manage under difficult circumstances, and with a Government that had difficult problems, to let us know what we were going to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody had more respect than I for Senator Dooge but, with the greatest respect to him, I do not want his CV here this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Chair should object to these remarks.  I was simply responding to what the Cathaoirleach said about the way this House is conducting its business.  I did not know, a Chathaoirligh, that I was precluded from doing that, either.  I cannot accept an excuse that the Minister is not going to be present.  Any Government Minister is capable of articulating Government policy.  We have collective responsibility, and Government Ministers have replaced the Minister for Foreign Affairs at meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference and apparently did the job quite adequately. I absolutely reject the fact that this <Col N="691" /> debate is not taking place simply because the Minister for Foreign Affairs is away. It is a matter, obviously, that does not suit the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Government.  I respectfully suggest to the Leader of the House that if the Government will not take him seriously, then he ought to consider his position because if he cannot be taken seriously by the Government he is not doing either himself or this House any good service by continuing on as Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask with regard to the business ordered for today whether the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will be in the House to take the motion on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the motion on Developments in the European Communities and the motion on diplomatic relations with Nicaragua.  These three motions are highly important and significant matters.  If the Minister is not going to be here in the House to take them, why has the Minister told the House that his presence is a <i>sine qua non</i> for holding a debate that was signalled for so long and for which assurances were given?  I would like to put on the record of the House that I think it is monstrous that such an insult should be offered to the one Member of this House who actually lives in the area of the country where this problem is most urgent and who has made special arrangements to be here.</P>
      <P>I would like to say that I would also take it as deeply insulting to those of us who have spoken repeatedly on matters of foreign affairs if we are told that other Ministers are not competent in some way to deal with this business.  This appeared to be an implication.  It would be very pleasant, very nice and very informative to have the Tánaiste here but, as Senator Brendan Ryan said, there is collective responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also to say this will have further consequences because we all attempt to order our lives so that we can pay the greatest respect to this House and to the office held by your good self. It would be very difficult if there were to <Col N="692" /> be a sudden shift in the timing of the racial hatred Bill for example, for which I have made arrangements to be here.  I would appeal for a proper ordering of every day's business in order to avoid what the Cathaoirleach has deplored, that is continual wrangling on the Order of Business which, however, is not undertaken lightly but is undertaken in the interest of the dignity of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to ask one or two questions about the Order of Business today and about the Order of Business generally.  I will be specific as to what Senator Lanigan raised if that is what he wishes.  It is quite obvious to me that the business of this House is in a state of complete chaos.</P>
      <P>I accept to a certain extent what the Chair has said, that we should have restricted ourselves to discussing the Order of Business today but the logical conclusion of that is that we do not know what we are discussing tomorrow until 10.30 a.m. tomorrow.  The way the business of this House is being run means we can have any Bill sprung on us at a moments' notice and it means the Seanad cannot do justice to any debate or any Bill at all.  It is not unreasonable that we should know in advance, on the Order of Business today what is coming tomorrow, and what is coming next week.  That would be treating Senators as intelligent human beings and we are not being treated as such at the moment by the Leader of the House.</P>
      <P>As regards tomorrow's debate, I would like to make two suggestions.  One is that we take the Northern Ireland debate possibly today and the second is that if we cannot take it today, the Minister for Justice who, presumably will be taking the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred Bill, 1988, tomorrow is quite acceptable for taking the intitial part of that debate tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business and specifially with regard to Item No. 6, I have never considered that because of my proximity to Northern <Col N="693" /> Ireland I know that much more than anybody else in this House about it, neither do I think because I live at a point more northerly than possibly anybody in this House, including my colleague Senator Robb, but I have an ordinary and a genuine concern about Northern Ireland and I cannot understand why this debate has been continually postponed.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say that the Explanatory Memorandum has been circulated on Item No. 7.  If the Leader of the Opposition did not get it his post must not have got to him because every other Member of the House has got it.  It is intended that Items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 will be taken today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of comment made about the fact that there is a change in the Order of Business.  Basically I have been doing the House the courtesy of telling them what is happening.  If I did not offer them that courtesy they would be attempting to have a go at me because I did not do that.  I have indicated what the Order of Business will be for tomorrow and because of that, apparently there has been some flak.  The Order of Business for today is Items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 <Col N="694" /> and we will take Item No. 4 from 6.30 p.m. to 8 o'clock.</P>

Unless we get an assurance from the Leader of the House that the Order of Business tomorrow will include the long-promised debate on Northern Ireland, I will have no other course open to me.  I have been patient; I have talked to the Leader of the House; I made my request in a very reasoned way, as have other Members.

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 25, after &ldquo;determine&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and as the Dáil may approve&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> This amendment is a very simple one.  It was covered to some extent in the Second Stage debate and the Minister addressed the issue also at that time.  As I say, it is a very simple amendment.  It is to lay down the principle that as far as the disbursement of public funds is concerned there should be specific parliamentary accountability.  I know the Minister has said that we are talking about projects which will have some sort of an all-Ireland dimension, will be aimed at promoting better relations between North and South and that they will have been examined by the Taoiseach, approved by him and then approved by the Minister for Finance.  What we have is a very simple amendment which would ask that such a decision would need to be approved by the Dáil.  Clearly, the Government of the day and the Taoiseach of the day would have the confidence of the Dáil and there would not be any great difficulty about having this approval given; but we feel that the old principle of parliamentary accountability is one that needs to be strengthened in every way possible.  I spoke last week about the current fashion to rush out, to set up judges to supervise this, that or the other, and the constant playing down and playing out of the role of Parliament in that matter.  It is to establish this particular principle that we have put forward this amendment.  A similar amendment was discussed but not voted upon in the Dáil.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment in the spirit in which it is intended.  It is not a criticism of the Bill but it is aimed at strengthening it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy and Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment was put down in the Dáil in order, as has just been explained by Senator Manning, that there could be accountability to the Dáil for the expenditure of the balance of the funds involved.  I pointed out that I could not accept the amendment then and I cannot accept it now because I think it is unnecessary.  There is already total <Col N="698" /> accountability to the Dáil for the expenditure involved.  As outlined in section 2 of the Bill the purposes for which the funds are to be used, are specified.  There is a specific subhead in the Vote for the Taoiseach's Department and the accounting officer of that Department will be answerable for the correctness of expenditure to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The subhead can also be debated at Estimates time and voted upon in the Dáil on the Taoiseach's Estimate. The Comptroller and Auditor General will be responsible to the Dáil for the accuracy and regularity of the accounts and the matter can be raised on the Appropriations Bill and the Adjournment debates at Christmastime this year in the event of any expenditure between now and then.</P>
      <P>Since no decision has yet been made as to who might benefit other than RNLI, we are not in a position at this stage to give further details.  During the debate in the Dáil I did, however, mention some of those who have already applied to give an idea of the type of projects which might benefit.  An interdepartmental committee consisting of representatives of the Department of the Taoiseach, Finance and Foreign Affairs will examine the applications within the confines of section 2 of the Bill before any decision is taken.  These applications will result perhaps in small amounts being made available for various projects and undertakings. You could have amounts for £50 or £100.  It would not be practical to seek the approval of the Dáil on each and every occasion it is proposed to approve such a small application or any other application.  You have full accountability in the way that I have just outlined for the Seanad.  I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points arise from the Minister's reply.  He mentioned that already there have been a number of applications for moneys under this heading.  In the debate in the Dáil I think the Minister mentioned some of the types of applications that have been made.  But will the availability of these <Col N="699" /> moneys be made public, will invitations for subventions be invited through public advertisements, or is it simply a question of people knowing that there is a few shillings in the Taoiseach's Department and if an organisation feels the need for some money it then makes an application in the hope of being subvented in that way?  Is this the procedure which will be followed?</P>
      <P>I do not accept that this will be a question of the Taoiseach having to come down to the Dáil every time £50 or £75 or £100 is disbursed.  What we are saying here is that at the end of each financial year an account would be rendered of moneys disbursed under this and the account would then be voted on <i>in toto</i> in the Dáil.  It is important that the Dáil does have a full view of what is being voted upon and has the opportunity on a specific occasion to comment on the use of these funds.  For that reason, apart from asking the Minister for clarification on the way in which the availability of this money will be brought to attention, I have to say that for this party the amendment is seen as a principle and will be pressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just put this into perspective?  We are talking about approximately £2.5 million altogether, roughly half of which has already been earmarked for the RNLI.  Senator Manning asked if we will be going through the process of advertising etc.  Already, as a result of the debates that have taken place both in the Dáil and now in the Seanad, there have been further expressions of interest in securing some of the available funds.  Assuming that the interests that have already come in are sufficient to take up the balance of this modest sum of money, there will be no need to advertise but if there are not sufficient applications or if the applications that are in are not considered by the interdepartmental committee to be worthy of support then an advertising process will be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as concern for a vote in the Dáil is concerned, I have already explained <Col N="700" /> through the Chair to Senator Manning that there can be a vote in the Dáil.  The Dáil has not only a right but an obligation and a duty to examine the Estimates of the various Ministers and that includes the Taoiseach.  This sum of money from the trust fund will be a specific subhead in the Taoiseach's Estimate on which there will be a vote, as there is on the overall Estimate of the Taoiseach, and if any Member wants information in relation to the allocation of the sums of money all he has to do is table a parliamentary question and it has to be answered on the basis that it is a subhead of the Taoiseach's Estimate.  When it comes to a vote on the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department, if any Member of the House is dissatisfied or if any party is dissatisfied with the way the money has been allocated it is their right and their duty to oppose the Estimate.  There is full accountability not only to the Dáil but all through the other procedures I have mentioned.  At the Committee of Public Accounts, the Accounting Officer of the Department has a responsibility and the Comptroller and Auditor General has a responsibility so there is transparency and accountability right through the whole procedure of allocations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The longer the Minister goes on the less happy I have become with this because, as I now understand it, this money is there.  Different groups who have heard about it through the grapevine or through close perusal of parliamentary debates are now making applications for some share of this money.  This is not a transparent process. That is not the sort of process we would like to see where all comers have a fair chance of having their case judged on its merits so that, in itself, arouses a certain unease.  The Minister has not answered the basic question because we all know that when the Estimates are being debated there are a very large number of subheads and very large sums of money involved and quite clearly a small sum like this will either be focused upon by some group and will distort and get out of proportion all that remains in the rest of the Estimate &mdash; which people are quite <Col N="701" /> entitled to do &mdash; or it may well be ignored altogether.  The principle of transparency and accountability would be enhanced by the acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would be very conscious of public accountability.  All of us would be but I am quite happy, having listened to the Minister's comments in regard to this aspect, that normal channels of accountability are gone through. As the Minister said, in the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department it will appear as a subhead which is a normal Estimate arrangement.  There is a good deal of accountability in the Bill.  The Minister made the point about other organisations looking for funding.  That is a normal process where you have a fund.  I mentioned on Second Stage that an area that might be looked at would be the question of finance for single Army people who are retiring and who might not have family ties in the town in which they retire.  I suggested there might be some small fund to help them build homes or provide accommodation in some way.  I am sure there are other areas which will be mentioned in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is not necessary.  The Minister has positively outlined that there is a great deal of accountability and I am <Col N="702" /> happy that the line taken by the Minister is the correct one.</P>

      <P>You will forgive me if what I have to say is perhaps wide of the mark because I have not been listening as fully as I should have to the exchange between the Minister and Senator Manning. I am in favour of Senator Manning's basic point about accountability.  On the other hand, as the Minister may recall, in my Second Stage contribution last week I commented in passing on the smallness of the sums involved which leads me to suggest that the principle of accountability in the Seanad could be well met by accounting for this expenditure in the Appropriation Bill which comes before us in any case and which gives us an opportunity to debate all kinds of matters. I am beginning to wonder if that would not meet the case.</P>

    <Title>Jewish Community in the Soviet Union: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann &mdash; recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Recalling the final act of the Helsinki conference on security and co-operation in which the participating States undertake to recognise and respect religious, cultural and national freedom and to deal in a positive and humanitarian way with applications to emigrate of persons who wish to reunite with members of their families or to go to their national homeland, and recalling that the concluding document of the Madrid meeting reaffirms and strengthens these undertakings.</P>
    <P>&mdash;While welcoming recent positive developments in the attitude of the Soviet Union towards its Jewish minority nevertheless is disturbed by reports of continuing harassments and anti-Semitism towards Soviet Jews.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Noting that the Jewish community in the Soviet Union is still an oppressed cultural minority subject to systematic discriminatory action by the authorities and considering their position to be a cause for international concern.</P>
    <P>(1)  Calls on the Soviet Government to permit all Soviet Jews applying to leave the Soviet Union to do so without impediment and to ensure that the presentation of such applications does not prejudice or modify the rights of the applications or of members of their families in the areas of employment, housing, resident status, access to social, economic, or educational benefits or any other rights.</P>
    <P>(2)  Calls on the Soviet Government to permit Soviet Jews full freedom to pursue Jewish religious, cultural activities which includes the teaching and learning of Hebrew as a national dimension.</P>
    <P>(3)  Calls on the Soviet Union to limit refusals for emigration based on secrecy to a defined period of time.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Norris.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate, at a time when there has been movement in the Soviet Union on human rights in general and an acknowledgement by them that things that happened in the past in the Soviet Union were not as they should be, that we should recognise there are changes taking place within the Soviet Union but that they have quite an amount of ground to make up to bring them into line with what we in western countries <Col N="705" /> and indeed in the civilised world agree would be a recognition of the human rights of all the citizens of the states in which they live.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that people in the Soviet Union should feel the necessity to leave that particular union of states because they feel they are being oppressed and they are not getting equal human rights.  The Jewish people in particular, are mentioned here, but we should recognise there may be other minority groups within the Soviet Union who are being oppressed equally with the Jewish minority.</P>
      <P>We appeal from this House that any negation of human rights within the Union of Socialist States should discontinue. It is hardly likely that these people would want to emigrate if they were happy and were allowed to live in freedom and that they could practice their religion without let or hindrance. Like the people who put down this motion, I call on the Soviet Government to permit not alone Soviet Jews but all minority groups within the state to have full freedom to pursue their lifestyle in a free and open manner.</P>
      <P>A number of people have been singled out as being oppressed in the Jewish community and those who have been most vociferous are the intellectuals.  They are the people who have taken the high ground in this fight.  That is natural but there must be quite a number of people of the Jewish minority in the Soviet Union who do not have the intellectual or word capacity to declare themselves as have the small number of well-known emigrés or of well-known intellectuals. In addressing ourselves to the problem I do not think that we should address ourselves to the intellectuals.  We should address ourselves to the totality of people of the Jewish faith in the Soviet Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we speak about calling on the Soviet Government to permit full freedom for Soviet Jews, we should not forget that in Europe there were terrible pogroms over a number of centuries.  Therefore, we cannot say that Europeans have clean hearts and clean minds.  Even in Ireland in the past there have been times <Col N="706" /> when the Jewish community have been treated badly.  Therefore, when we call on the Soviet Union to change their attitude towards Soviet Jews we, equally, suggest that the countries of Europe and any country which in the past has had anti-Semitic feelings should change also. This motion is not strictly a motion aimed at the Soviet Union.  It is a motion that asks that we fully support the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt but that the Government are cognisant of the facts behind this motion and will attempt to pass on the feeling of this House to the USSR. There is an acknowledgment that changes are taking place.  The changes that have taken place in the Soviet Union over the past number of years have been dramatic and nobody could suggest otherwise.  There is not a huge number of Jews in the Soviet Union who wish to get out but if they want to get out they should be allowed freedom of movement. They should be allowed, without harassment, to go to countries of their choice and if they wish to leave their homeland the Soviet Government should allow them to leave without impediment. If they are allowed to leave there should be no harassment of their relatives or friends or people of the same faith who are left behind.</P>
    <P>It is an unfortunate fact that if all the Jewish people leave the USSR there will be a Jewish-free series of states and I do not think that is what the proposers of this motion would wish.  We would like to see a situation where Jewish people who wish to leave would be allowed to leave and those who are left behind allowed to live and to practise their religion without let or hindrance.</P>
    <P>This House supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  This House calls on the USSR to bring in the elements of this motion before us.  We recognise that changes are taking place and we urgently appeal to the Soviet Government to permit the Soviet Jews full freedom to pursue Jewish religious and cultural activities which include the teaching and learning of Hebrew as a national dimension.  I support the motion <Col N="707" /> and I am sure that the principles of the motion will be acceptable to the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to refer to item No. 37 on the Order Paper which states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann requests the Government to consider conferring honorary citizenship upon Raoul Wallenberg in recognition of his outstanding services to humanity.</P>
      <P>This has already been mentioned by Senator Norris in his opening speech and I am sure it is something that will command the support of all of us.  I certainly want to be included in that support.</P>
      <P>This is an appropriate motion in many ways.  At the moment it is fair to say that the balance of international opinion and sympathy is inclining somewhat against Israel, for obvious reasons.  Just because at the moment Israel happens not to be the favourite nation, as it were, of what you might call impartial western mankind, it is very important to draw our attention to a continuing injustice in which Soviet Jews are involved, without being at all affected by the considerations of politics in the Middle East.</P>
      <P>I support this motion for various reasons, not least because in a particular and profound way anti-Semitism is indeed the enemy of the people.  We are all guiltily aware that we have recourse to scapegoats whenever we are confounded by a complexity of problems.  In Ireland the obvious scapegoat, of course, is Britain, British injustice etc. but historically Europeans, in general, have had recourse to the Jews as scapegoats.  The phrase &ldquo;scapegoat&rdquo; is biblically appropriate in view of its origin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not only Hitler's Germany which has the burden of guilt for the infamous treatment of Jewry in Christendom.  In one way or another all the nations in Christian Europe must carry some responsibility for this.  I recall growing up that anti-Semitism was a minor drumbeat of much that I read and was taught. Hilaire Belloc and G.K. Chesterton <Col N="708" /> were, for example, part of the staple reading material of what you might call Catholic intellectualism at that time in the forties and there was a very strong vein of anti-Semitism there.  We were exposed to it, of course, in as simple matter as the Penny Catechism.  After all, the damning phrase &ldquo;Pontius Pilate did it at the desire of the Jews&rdquo; must have made an impact on many a childish mind.</P>
    <P>A recent book by my distinguished colleague Dr. Dermot Kehoe, University College Cork, <i>Ireland and Europe 1919-1948</i> reminds us that there was quite a steady pulse of anti-Semitism in Iveagh House at one particular stage.  Fortunately, Eamon de Valera, towards whom I am inclined more and more to be sympathetic in my historical judgment in the large matters perhaps, had the vision to put in the Constitution in 1937 at a time of heightened anti-Semitism, at a time of the holocaust and less malignant forms of anti-Semitism elsewhere a specific recognition of the Jewish community in Ireland.  Whatever other faults there were in our views of the Jews, we should take some small legitimate pride in that.  Nonetheless, the overall picture is one of a mainline bias against the Jewish people in Christian history.</P>
    <P>Last week I said we should support the pro-Nicaragua motion simply because in other circumstances we might have been Nicaragua; in other circumstances we might have experienced their brave experiment in social justice.  There is a relationship here that we, too, owe it to make some little recompense for the general guilt.</P>
    <P>I object in any case to the principle of a state exercising such totalitarian power over its citizens as refusing their legitimate and proper wish to leave that state. That is a fundamental transgression of freedom and of the relations of citizens and their State.  What Senator Norris is talking about here is the ringing cry of &ldquo;Let my people go&rdquo;.  I am reminded in a minor key that it is a rich irony that our clamour in this country should be &ldquo;Let our people stay&rdquo;.  However, be that as it may.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has been to the Soviet <Col N="709" /> Union and who has had discussions with Soviet people about the whole matter of refusing to allow their citizens in general to emigrate, not just the Jews, although perhaps the prohibition on the emigration of Jews has a special point because they are an élite throughout the general citizenry because of their particular traditions and distinctive assets, will hear the answers being given that you cannot allow people to emigrate indiscriminately from the Soviet Union because of alleged dangers to Soviet security or because allowing total unrestrained emigration represents a grievous loss of human resources to the Soviet community, that you invest so much in the citizen's education and then he is allowed to go elsewhere and give other countries the benefit of that rich investment in education.  Again, this has ironic undertones for us in our particular plight about emigration.  Finally, the Soviets say it is anti-patriotic of these people to want to leave the Soviet Union, that in a fundamental sense they are being anti-patriotic.</P>
    <P>One appreciates some of these arguments. For the Soviet Union, with all its history of travail and achievements tempered by ferocious setbacks, the idea of people abandoning the motherland is a much stronger feeling in Russia than any accusation of theoretically betraying Marxist-Leninism, so there is this feeling as well.  I have some sympathy with this attitude.  We must remember to look at it on the other side of the ledger that the Jews in human history are uniquely exclusive in their culture and in their theology. One might say that they are uniquely superior in their fundamental theological outlook.  I believe part of the reason for anti-Semitism generally is this resentment of a group which refuses to admit other people to its circle in any meaningful way.  There is resentment of this.  There are other levels of resentment. Karl Marx, and therefore Marxist-Leninism as a whole, resents Jewry because of their real or imagined connections with international capital.</P>
    <P>This is not to admit the force of these anti-Jewish accusations but there is <Col N="710" /> enough truth in these Russian answers to your query not to vindicate their policy but to excuse it to their own uncritical public.  One tries to argue with the Soviets about this whole matter, to say that on balance it would be far better to let the people go but up to now at any rate, up to the Gorbachev régime, one got very stubborn answers indeed.</P>
    <P>The one small reservation I have about this motion is that this is a time of peculiar crisis in the Soviet Union and that the naked enemies of the Soviet Union are gloating in Gorbachev's difficulties, are hoping that Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia as well as the other turbulent states in the south east, the Armenians and so on, will break up the Soviet Union. There is economic pressure from its super-power enemies at this particular moment which does not make things any easier for the whole Gorbachev policy of <i>glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i>.  The one small reservation I would have about Senator Norris's motion is that it might seem to lend fuel in a small way to the general fire of criticism of Gorbachev when all sensible people in western Europe should be pro-Gorbachev at the moment.</P>
    <P>I hope that the dramatic liberalisation of the past few years will extend to a fundamental change of attitude in the matter of enforced internment of Soviet citizens, and particularly this attitude to letting the Soviet Jews depart if they so wish.  This is a very small reservation and on the whole I am very glad to support the motion.</P>
    <P>I may end by reminding the House of an historic County Cork comment on Russian tyranny a long time ago in that at the time of the bloody riots in St. Petersburg the editor of the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> solemnly warned the Tzar of Russia that it had its eye on him &ldquo;Let the Tzar of Russia beware, this <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> has its eye on him&rdquo;.  Whether that story is apocryphal or otherwise, there is another aguisín to that, a recent addendum, that in 1917 after the success of the storming of the Winter Palace the Editor of the <i>Southern Star</i> which was the successor of the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> received a telegram from Lenin simply saying, <Col N="711" />&ldquo;<i>spassiba kamerad</i>&rdquo;, &ldquo;thank you, comrade&rdquo;. I hope that in due course when the Soviet Jews are free to depart that their leaders will similarily acknowledge Senator Norris's contribution to remedying their plight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a particular interest in this motion not because Senator Norris put it down but because it took him to remind me, who had witnessed some of the difficulties of the Jewish people in other parts of the world as far back as 1937 and 1938 of the way they are still being persecuted.  It is in that sense that I am stirred about this.  It is not the first time we have done something about it because we sent a man to Russia to make case studies and we were satisfied that everything that was being alleged was true.  Not only was it true but in some cases we had not been aware of the gravity of the problem and the difficulties the people in the Soviet Union were faced with.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy mentioned the question of security risks.  For example, they can use the argument that the Jews are a security risk up to 20 years after they have finished a particular job.  There is an inclination to label all Jewish people as dissidents rather than the other way round.  For example, there is the dissident movement there and probably 70 per cent of people of Jewish origin would be active in it.  The Jewish movement is a separate question.  It is a Jewish question and it distinguishes itself very much from the dissidents.  The difference is that the Jewish movement does not in every case wish to change the laws of the Soviet system.  On the contrary, in many cases they want to see them implemented in so far as it applies to their own demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They want the very same consideration other people in the Soviet Union get. They want the very considerable harassment they suffer at the hands of the KGB and others to cease.  They would like the same criteria to apply to them in teaching as it applies to other Soviet citizens.  For example, if a Jewish person <Col N="712" /> qualified to teach Hebrew in an American university he would be denied by the Soviets the right to teach on the grounds that he had not got a Soviet qualification. This does not apply to anyone else in the Soviet Union.  When you do not apply that criteria to other people it is a clear indication that it is a selective thing and that it is just another step in the harassment of the Jewish people in a way that is reminiscent of what happened to them in pre-war Germany.  It may not be as bad but the problems are the same.</P>
    <P>There is a consistent decline in the social standing of the Jewish people in the Soviet Union.  They are also very concerned about the concentration by the KGB on their movement which is still vibrant, for example, the Hebrew language, as Senator Murphy mentioned. However I do not know the up-to-date position on that.  Even though Mr. Gorbachev is doing his best to do a lot of good, the Jewish people are still in a vulnerable situation.</P>
    <P>Over the years the cumulative effect of the decline in visas to almost zero and the increasing level of anti-semitism has presented difficulties for some people. For example, where both parents are Jewish for them and their children to change nationality is a big step.  It is a big step anywhere but it is a very big step in the Soviet Union and it is extremely difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the coin, if they do that it means that minority is being further reduced and, for the people left behind, things become totally intolerable. When you have got a small minority people become extremely aware of their cultural identity and nationality much more so than they did when their number was larger.  Since the Jewish people already suffer exile for their cultural activities it means that greater pressure will be placed on those remaining in the Soviet Union.  This is a sad development. As far as the Labour Party can gather, anti-semitism is growing in the USSR and, of course the social standing of the Jewish people continues to drop. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the sons and daughters of Jewish families <Col N="713" /> to get into top grade third level educational institutions.  The cultural activities of Jews have been successfully repressed.  The remaining activity, which I mentioned earlier, the teaching of Hebrew, is now more likely to come under attack than ever.  This is despite the law.</P>
    <P>That is why I said earlier that all of them do not want to change the laws. They just want the laws that are right for everybody else to be applied to them. The law in the Soviet Union takes two forms, the written code of the law and the directives issued by the authorities from time to time.  There is provision for private teaching of many languages, including Hebrew, but many activities which are permitted legally in Soviet law have nonetheless been prevented by the KGB authorities.</P>
    <P>Many things are happening to the Jewish people of which we are not fully aware.  I would like to stress two points.  They are not all dissidents.  They want the same laws to be applied to them as apply to other people in the Soviet Union.  It is not all a question of overthrowing the Soviet system or its laws.  One of the problems is that some Jewish people opt to go to Israel but when they leave they settle in America or Canada or other places like that.  That obviously made the situation worse for the remaining Jewish people.  It had a negative effect on the prospects of people who wished to get out and settle in Israel.  They do not want to be used as pawns and this happens in some particular cases.  It is not anti-Soviet but the Soviets do, in fact, try to use them in another respect.  In the Labour Party we think now that there is this talk of reformation it is an opportune time for the United States and the Soviet Union to work out a system whereby Soviet Jews wishing to emigrate to the United States would be treated in the same way as any emigrant who makes application to go to any other part of the world.</P>
    <P>This is the real problem.  I mentioned earlier the type of harassment the Jewish people have been faced with for a long, long time.  In 1938 when I was stationed <Col N="714" /> in what was then known as Palestine, the Jewish people who came there from Poland, Germany and other places at the time were trying to build up communication systems and to do a lot of things.  They were trying generally to build a very good community and were starting to build homes and settle on lands.  They suffered a lot of harassment.  It was nothing to hear of some fellow who was trying to put up telephone wires being shot down off the wires.  They were many atrocities.  People were being mined on the way home and so the story goes on. I felt very strongly at that time about the way they were treated.  I feel strongly about the way they have been treated in history.  I feel strongly about the way they are being treated now in the Soviet Union but it does not follow that I agree with everything that is being done in the presentday Israel.  It is a totally different situation.</P>
    <P>I see the two things as being different. I am talking about the situation in Israel and about what is right for everybody, rather than what is right for just the Jewish people.  Specifically, I am anxious about this terrible, violent treatment the Jews have been given down through the years.  Everything is relative.  It is no joke to be taken off the street because you protest about something and to be sent to a labour camp for three or four years and suffer many other indignities.  In this day and age in a world that is supposed to be working towards more freedom it is bad to see anything like that.  Certainly, I would always support the Jewish people in their efforts.</P>
    <P>You can never forget what happened to the Jewish people in Nazi Germany.  I was a prisoner of war in Germany and I remember coming home and soon afterwards going to a cinema.  I had just been released from a hospital and I went to the Carlton Cinema which had been rebuilt.  I had been only two, three or four miles away from a concentration camp and I did not know such a thing existed.  I nearly died when I saw the Pathe-tone news at that time on the screen.  It was revolting. It was something that will never leave my mind for the rest of time.  The idea that <Col N="715" /> people with a culture are still being harassed and chased inevitably introduces a little emotion into the debate about their rights and future development.  The Jews are treated disgracefully.  What happened to them before the war in Germany was dreadful.  Equally, in this day and age where there are so many people so vigilant and where we have the United Nations, it is terrible to think that people can suffer the harassment they are suffering at present in Russia.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party state that those who wish to leave the Soviet Union should be allowed to do so.  If the Soviet authorities are given a list of people who wish to emigrate, one of the problems is that they will be selective and allow only certain people to leave.  It has got to be done in some other way.  It has got to be argued that the Soviet Union should be no different from any other country.  If a quota has been accepted for emigration to America, then some of that quota should go to the Soviet Union.  The Soviet Union, in this day and age and in view of their new stance should be pressurised in this direction.</P>
    <P>I wish the people involved good luck. There is not a lot we can do by resolution except to let them know they have our full backing and full support.  We should try to arouse the interest not only of the Irish public but of our Government to a greater extent so that they will heighten their activities to try to make the problem less acute and work towards a solution of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>As the second spokes-person for foreign affairs for my party in this House I welcome this motion.  It deals with what has been a major area of international concern for a long time. Speakers already in this debate have given some of the historical background to the Jewish problem in the Soviet Union and the Jewish problem in the Russian Empire because it is something that did not start today or yesterday.  In Tsarist Russia there were periodic and quite frequent pogroms against Jewish people living in Russia and these very often had <Col N="716" /> a cultural and, indeed, a religious source so that oppression against the Jewish minority in Russia or in the modern Soviet Union is nothing really new.</P>
      <P>It is strange where you had a system that changed and changed utterly, how prejudices deeply rooted in the system and in the minds of people did not change.  On the face of it, oppression of a minority would appear to be the very antithesis of what Mr. Lenin and company stood for in 1917 but in practice that has remained in the Soviet Union.  Indeed in many ways the repression we see today and the restrictions placed on the Jewish community have little to do with ideology very often or the modern ideology of that state but have more to do with the ingrained prejudices which have their roots far back in history.</P>
      <P>We might mention to the House that at the present time it is estimated that there are about 2 million Jewish people in the Soviet Union.  Like the Jewish diaspora across the world, the spread of the Jewish people in the Soviet Union is not found in any one great concentration. They are found in the cities, in the Baltic Republics of Esthonia, and Latvia in Byelorussia and the Ukraine, of course, and in Georgia and Armenia, too.  You find them, in fact, right across in Siberia. I think there is in Siberia &mdash; I am open to correction on this &mdash; an area where some autonomy is allowed to the Jewish people.  It is probably not a very hospitable part of the Soviet Union &mdash; a long time ago I picked up that piece of information and I hope it is still correct &mdash; but an area of autonomy still exists for Jewish people somewhere in the far east of Russia or somewhere in central Siberia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am saying that in the context that the Jewish minority in the Soviet Union are recognised as a nationality.  In the Soviet constitution they are recognised as a nationality.  Senator Harte mentioned the gap between Russian law in code and Russian law in practice.  They are not given any nationality rights.  Many people in the Soviet Union find a great gap between what the law says and what the constitution says, what the code says and <Col N="717" /> what happens in practice, in terms of the way the law applies and relates to people if you are a minority or if you are out of step with what the régime is doing or saying.  You find that what is stated in the code and in the book is quite different from what may be applied to you.</P>
    <P>It is timely, too, that we should discuss this motion in the House at this time because great changes are taking place in the Soviet Union at present.  <i>Glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i> certainly have brought about major changes and we only have to look at the Baltic Republics in recent days to see the effects of <i>glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i> are having on that part of this vast culturally diverse country.  Much more than even its culture is diverse.  There are local parliaments in Latvia voting that they will no longer accept ordinances laid down in Moscow; the parliament in Estonia are not going as far as that but are certainly threatening.  Now there are urgings and movements in Byelorussia.  We also know what has been happening in Georgia and in the southern parts of the Soviet Union earlier this year.</P>
    <P>This is a major watershed in the history of the Soviet Union, and certainly in the recent history of the Soviet Union, that that kind of thing has been allowed to develop and has been allowed to happen. Five years ago it would have been quite unthinkable that you would see people in Latvia laying flowers at the national monument.  Incidentally, the national monument of Latvia is a monument which commemorates the independence of Latvia from Poland over a hundred years ago.  Suddenly, it has become a focus of national feeling in that country. The KGB are no longer there to take away the flowers or, as was mentioned last week, to take away the people who are laying the flowers.</P>
    <P>Suddenly, the régime in Moscow are allowing national expression within the Soviet Union.  It would appear and he very often appears to be beleaguered on this, that President Gorbachev, a man whom I admire, is under tremendous pressure from people of the conservative elements within the party structure for allowing this kind of thing to develop.  Let <Col N="718" /> us face it; if it goes wrong for President Gorbachev he will be very quickly removed.  All these movements, this sunburst or flowering of national movements, of freedom movements, the right to free expression, the right to express national identity such as the Jewish people <i>et cetera</i> would be very quickly suppressed and we would be back again to the terrible times of the 1930s, the 1940s and right up to the present time. We must hope and pray in this House that Gorbachev and the people who support him and the people who now have the reins of power in that country, will continue to have power and that they will be the people who will continue to influence events.</P>
    <P>We might go back, too, to 1975 and the Helsinki Agreement.  At that time it was Brezhnev and Kosygin who were in office in Moscow, I think it was Kosygin who went to Helsinki and he signed the Helsinki Agreement.  One of its major requirements was that ethnic minorities within any country would have the right to their own national expression, to their own religious expression or cultural expression and that there would be no restrictions placed against people who wish to emigrate or leave a country.  Certainly that was part of the Helsinki Agreement to which the Soviet Union and this country and many other countries were signatories.</P>
    <P>There was an interesting development in the Soviet Union after that.  There was some increase in the number of Jewish people allowed out of the Soviet Union but there was a major increase in repression of the Jewish minority in the Soviet Union from 1975 possibly into the early 1980s.  Kosygin had died in the late 1970s but after the demise of Leonid Brezhnev and his two successors Chernenko and Andropov, strangely, matters went upon ice.  There was more suppression of the applications of people who wished to leave the Soviet Union.  Certainly, the repression of the Jewish minority might have lessened somewhat.</P>
    <P>All our informants tell us nowadays, since the advent of <i>perestroika</i>, while things are certainly not as we would want <Col N="719" /> them to be there has been some amelioration of the situation of Jewish people: more emigrant visas &mdash; I am taking that parlance from our experience, our present emigration experience and our young people going to the United States &mdash; more visas are being issued now, albeit a small number, by the authorities than there was.  It does appear that some of the repressive measures, that is, in regard to the teaching of Hebrew in schools, and so on, have been greatly lessened.  We are heartened to believe that at least in a private capacity it is now possible without fear of the KGB, or whoever else it might be, to hold classes to impart Hebrew or any other cultural expression to Jewish children or adults who may wish to learn it in the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>It is strange that one has to say these things in the context that the Soviet law, the Soviet code, the Soviet Constitution recognises the Jewish people as a nationality in the same way as their Constitution would recognise Estonia or Latvia.  It is also an oddity of history that many of the Jewish people are some of the most Russified of the minorities in the Soviet Union.  That strangely in these republics along the west coast&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I always address the Chair.  I also put a certain amount of body language into it and I apologise if you are offended if I looked away from you. Many of the Jewish minority have become the most Russified of the minorities in the Soviet Union.  One often finds discrimination and prejudices against them in places like Lativia and in the republics along the Baltic coast.  It is more rooted in the resentment of people on the Baltic side of the Russification, and the easy Russification, it would appear, of the Jewish minority in the Soviet Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While many of the ordinances of the laws which are repressive of Jewish identity may come from Moscow many of them <Col N="720" /> had a local origin from local administration. Many of them have their roots in local prejudices.  It is a strange oddity of history that that is the case.  Anti-semitism in the Soviet Union has some roots &mdash; and this might be strange to say &mdash; at the time of the Nazi invasion.  It is surprising how successful Nazi anti-semitic propaganda was in those western states of the Soviet Union because they were in the front line after the invasion in 1941.  It is surprising how persuasive it may have been to many people, Lativians, Estonians, Bylo Russians and so on.  Many people will tell you that that propaganda, and remains of that propaganda, remain on ironically in those parts of the Soviet Union until this day.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion is to call upon the Soviet Union to permit Soviet Jews full freedom to pursue the Jewish religion, their cultural activities which include the teaching and learning of Hebrew as a national dimension; and it calls on the Soviet Union to limit refusals from emigration based on secrecy to a defined period of time.  I have here that something like 9,000 Jewish people in the very recent past have been refused exist from the Soviet Union they are the ones that are well recorded.  It is estimated by some people that there are probably at least another 6,500 or 7,000 who are not known about.  These are refuseniks, people who were not going by outside invitation but who nevertheless had their application to leave the Soviet Union refused.</P>
    <P>Last year alone there were 75,000 people who asked for invitation to go to Israel.  Somebody else was making that point and it is one of the things that has been used against the Jewish minority in the Soviet Union, that if those 75,000 were allowed to go perhaps only a small proportion of them would go to Israel at all, that maybe most of them would go where they felt there were better economic chances of doing well for themselves, maybe to the United States or some of the western countries.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, the spirit of Helsinki quite clearly is that a minority in any country who wish to leave that country <Col N="721" /> and go to their homeland, or what they perceive to be their homeland or to any other country in the ordinary way that men, women and races have gone all over the world since the very beginning of time, should be allowed to do so.  That is the very principle in that particular section of the agreement signed in Helsinki and the ink was not even dry on that agreement when the Soviet Union, from day one were in breach of that part of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Essentially, what we are doing is calling upon the Soviet Union &mdash; and we are not calling upon them in any hostile way but in a spirit of friendship.  This country has very friendly relations with the Soviet Union and we welcome particularly the developments recently in the Soviet Union and the spirit in which the recent movements have been received officially in Moscow.  There has been a sunburst and a flowering of movements of national expression.  We hope the Soviet Government would look upon the Jewish question in the same new benign way as they seem to be looking upon the nationalities question, that is, the nationalities who have official nations within the Soviet Union, because the Jewish people see themselves as a nationality, too, within the Soviet Union.  We would hope they would see them in the same benign and generous way as displayed, indeed by President Gorbachev.  That is our appeal and we make it in no sense or spirit of hostility towards the Soviet Union.  It is Members in a House of Parliament in a friendly country asking what we consider a friendly government to take this particular piece of advice from us.</P>
    <P>We are being very heartened by what we see happening in that country in recent times.  We would certainly be very heartened if we felt that Moscow would regard in a benign way Jewish people who wish to leave or who wish to have a full ethnic cultural expression, the right to education which takes account of their culture etc. and their history, within the Soviet Union.  That is what we are asking: not merely the right to leave if you want to but the right to be educated in what Jewish people hold dear in terms of their <Col N="722" /> history, their culture and their language especially.</P>
    <P>In any civilised State today there is no need to be afraid of minorities.  A state certainly that has grown up &mdash; and I am sure the Soviet Union has grown up after about 60 or 70 years with its independence &mdash; has no need to be afraid of minorities and it should no longer be afraid of international pressure.  I know part of the problem might have been that the Arab countries &mdash; and I wish to make this remark in no unfriendly way to the Arab states &mdash; would always keep a certain amount of pressure on the Soviet Union not to allow the exits because they felt it would be augmenting the population and the size of Israel.  Until very recently most Arab states did not recognise the right of Israel to exist and they felt it was a further threat to them if tens of thousands or more than one million Jews were allowed to leave the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>I might just digress slightly to mention that Item No. 37 on the Order Paper says that Seanad Éireann requests the Government to consider conferring honorary citizenship on Raoul Wallenberg in recognition of his outstanding services to humanity.  Raoul Wallenberg was Swedish.  He went to Budapest in 1944 to try to save the remains of the Hungarian Jews from Eichman's final solution. Although he was unarmed, he faced the Gestapo and he was bundled into the cattle trains which took the people to Aushwitz.  As a diplomat he used his position to try to smuggle many Hungarian Jews out of Hungary, which was in the centre of the Nazi empire at that time.  He saved between 30,000 and 100,000 Jewish people.  I do not wish to pre-empt the debate which we are going to have on that but I think this debate should not go without mentioning the fact that that is one of the items which will soon be coming up for debate in this House.  It is a motion this House should have no difficulty in adopting in recognition of the outstanding services to humankind on the part of this very brave Swedish Jew, Raoul Wallenberg; in fact he is still alive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> It has been my pleasure to speak in favour of this motion.  I want it to be known that we are offering advice to a friendly country; we are not making this appeal in any hostile way.  We are asking that the winds of change that are now very evident in the Soviet Union for many people and many movements would also blow in the direction and in favour of the Jewish minority in that country.</P>

Caithfidh go gcabhraíonn sé sin linn ó thaobh bheith ag smaoineamh faoi chúrsaí an domhain, cúrsaí cearta an duine agus ceisteanna mar sin.</P>
      <P>It is right that we should discuss a motion like this.  It is also right that such a motion should be seen in its context. I do not think this is the happiest of opportunities, or the happiest of times, to launch into a criticism of the Soviet Union.  It is as if somebody who had a serious drink problem for a long time was in the throes of trying to reform himself or herself and is suddenly told &ldquo;you must do it faster or we will not play ball or talk to you&rdquo;.  That is not to say I have anything against the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever I feel is wrong with the Soviet Union, and particularly with its <Col N="724" /> history, one has to acknowledge the enormous impact on the world of the Soviet Revolution.  The fact that so much has gone wrong there, and that so much has been done wrong there, should not force us into a position where all we will ever say about the developments of the Soviet Union since the revolution is negative. We are likely to fall into the trap.  It is quite clear that in recent times the ante is being successively stepped up by some of the western powers, and particularly by our nearest neighbour, about what is expected of the Soviet Union before we are prepared to talk to them about human rights.  We have the extraordinary position of the British Prime Minister demanding an end to internal exile in the Soviet Union while, at the same time, her own Government have on their Statute Book a provision for precisely that within the United Kingdom whereby people can be deported from one part of the United Kingdom to another because the Government regard them as a threat to the security of the State.  There is something ironic in giving one country a lecture about internal exile while retaining to yourself the right to do it, not even by judicial process but by the arbitrary opinion of the Home Secretary.</P>
    <P>At this stage what we are saying is a continuous raising of the ante of demands on the Soviet Union for reform.  It is necessary to remind ourselves that it was the Soviet Revolution more than anything else that scared the political establishments of most of western Europe and North America, and was probably the major impetus that made things like universal welfare, universal health services, workers' rights and the role of the trade union movement, so much more acceptable &mdash; the fear of something worse, inspired by the revolution in the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that whatever appalling things may happen in the light of a major historical convulsion, the long-term effects must be judged in precisely those terms.  It is very fashionable now to welcome the French Revolution as the single biggest impulse towards the extension of democracy.  It is not so <Col N="725" /> fashionable to remember the reign of terror that followed immediately or to remember that most of the aspirations of the French Revolution &mdash; democracy and equality &mdash; were almost abandoned within a short period of 30 or 40 years with the restoration of the monarchy and the coming of Napoleon, but that does not get away from the fact that what happened in the French Revolution was an enormous liberation of the aspirations of ordinary people.</P>
    <P>It is safe to say that a similar analysis could well apply in the future to the Soviet Revolution with all its imperfections, and that is not to attempt to avoid condemning without reservation all that has been done in the name of that revolution, particularly during the reign &mdash; and I use the word &ldquo;reign&rdquo; deliberately &mdash; of Stalin.  It was a disgrace to socialism, it was a disgrace of democracy and it was, in particular, a disgrace to the brave people who had fought for the Soviet Revolution.</P>
    <P>It is also true that during the Soviet Civil War the western powers intervened in order to attempt to defeat the Bolshevik Revolution.  That is part of a continuing Soviet history of paranoia about the aims of the western powers, not just towards the Soviet Union but towards Russia as a nation.  When we are rightly critical of abuses and indeed the absence of basic human rights within the Soviet Union, we have an obligation to do a number of things.  One is to be very careful to be even-handed and to remind ourselves that human rights are not just something about which you give lectures to those of whom you disapprove.</P>
    <P>Human rights are universal rights.  It is equally wrong to abuse human rights in South Africa, Chile, Central America, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union or the Republic of Ireland.  Human rights are not something you can shake out of a laundry bag in a convenient political climate and wave at somebody you want to embarrass.  There is, to a certain extent, an impression developing in my mind and from reading the newspapers that human rights are going to be a continuously increasing demand that the <Col N="726" /> western powers are going to make on the Soviet Union in order to deflect western public opinion from an appreciation of the fundamental changes that have taken place in the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>It is important also, when we focus on the rights of the Jewish people in the Soviet Union that we avoid any sort of attempt to suggest that there is some sort of coincidence with the political and economic philosophy of the Soviet Union and anti-semitism.  Anti-semitism is, unfortunately, perhaps the most painful heritage of Christianity.  It is not a failing of the Soviet Union; it is a failing of people who come from a much deeper and longer established tradition in the Soviet Union, and that is, regrettably, the Christian religious tradition.</P>
    <P>It is a fact of history that the Jewish people have been treated with far greater tolerance under Islam than under Christianity and that the history of the most shameful pogroms, the most shameful attacks, the most shameful politically inspired attacks, has been evident among so-called Christian societies.  While I would not for one second pretend that the experience of the Jewish people under Islam has been pleasant, they have not suffered the same intensity of persecution, the same intensity of pogroms until recently.  Historically the Moslem countries while not being particularly well disposed towards the Jewish people, did not have the history of persecution, did not have the history of anti-Semitism. Given that many Moslem countries would have been semites themselves that would have been particularly difficult, but the history of anti-Jewish feeling was not as deep.</P>
    <P>It is important to say that all of us &lsquo;Christians&rsquo; have an obligation of penitance towards the Jewish people because the religious tradition we subscribe to is guilty either by neglect or by deliberate manipulation of anti-Semitism.  We have either used the existence of the Jewish people to give us a convenient whipping boy for all sorts of appalling allegations, or we have allowed our scriptures to be interpreted in a way which justified the most appalling pogroms against the <Col N="727" /> Jewish people.  As Christians we cannot now suddenly say that because we have discovered the evils of anti-semitism in the last 40 years that somehow we are responsible for nothing.</P>
    <P>We are all products of our history and we have a profound obligation to be quite clearly aware of where we came from and the appalling history we have with respect to the Jewish people.  Many of the most awful things that were done against the Jewish people were done on the basis of their allegedly being responsible for the death of Christ, etc.  The leader of the Church to which I subscribe goes to great lengths to deny that Christianity in any way is culpable for the history for anti-Semitism.  I think that is a load of nonsense.  It is quite clear to me that even a cursory reading of history indicates that the church, of which I am a member, has an appalling record in terms of how it historically dealt with the Jewish people.  In my view, the proper and Christian thing to do is to acknowledge the truth, say we are extremely sorry and commit ourselves to trying to make sure that that never happens again.</P>
    <P>The rights of the Jewish people within the Soviet Union is a simple issue.  Of course all the rights addressed in this motion should be granted forthwith.  I would say that about any minority group prepared to operate within the general legal framework of a society, wherever that country was, irrespective of its social and political order, whether they be a religious group, an ethnic group or another minority.  I would say it about the travelling community and about the gay community in this country.  Any minority group should be allowed to live according to their own traditions, using their language and in a position where they are able to practise their own religion without any discrimination, overt or covert.  Given the experience of our co-religionists in the Northern part of this country for the past 60 years, we have a particular obligation to be sensitive about the rights of minorities.</P>
    <P>However, when it comes to the issue of emigration from the Soviet Union, <Col N="728" /> there is a legitimate problem to be considered, that is the problem of a country which cannot offer the same standard of living as a competing country.  I am talking in this case of the contrast between the standard of living in the Soviet Union and the standard of living in the United States of America.  Would we be happy if the United States announced that it would accept every Irish person who wanted to emigrate?</P>

      <P>The more vulnerable partner in an unequal economic relationship like that must have the right to be concerned about the enticement away from it of those to whom education and skills have been given.  In particular, since the motion refers to secrecy, there must be legitimate reasons to protect State secrets.  All these things can be abused, and have been abused, but I am not aware, for instance, if the Jewish minority in, say, any of the North African countries, or anywhere else in the world, wanted to emigrate to the United States that they would get the same enthusiastic welcome that Soviet Jews would get.  As Mr. Gorbachev has said on more than one occasion, if the United States are so worried about the rights of emigrants, why do they not allow all those Mexicans on their borders who would like to emigrate to the United States to do so?  It is not just the rights of emigrants that are involved here, it is an issue which is being used by one side in the Super Powers <Col N="729" /> struggle to embarrass the other side.  Of course, that is not a complete answer but I think the perspective ought to be retained here by way of a contrast.</P>
      <P>Everything that has been said about the abuse, misuse, of the Jewish people inside the Soviet Union is true and it is correct that it should be condemned.  It is also true that in the United States a far more serious attack on a racial minority continues without much criticism, that is, the quite clear discrimination in the United States where a disproportionate number of its black population are the victims of the death penalty.  That is also a very serious assault on a racial minority within the United States which deserves equal criticism and equal condemnation as do the quite appalling abuses that the Jewish people have suffered in the Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>I was in Jerusalem last April and had a few interesting experiences.  One of the most interesting was when I read a copy of <i>The Jerusalem Post</i>.  It quite clearly suggested that a lot of the enthusiasm of Soviet Jews to emigrate was not motivated by an enthusiasm to move to Israel but to get far enough to be able to change their destination to the United States.  In order to minimise that, the point at which they would be given their visas to enter Israel was being shifted from Vienna to Bucharest because there is no Israeli Embassy in Moscow.  The idea was that people would not be able to change their destination in Bucharest with the ease they could do it in Vienna, and the people who left the Soviet Union because they said they wanted to migrate to Israel would have to go and live in Israel.  <i>The Jerusalem Post</i> speculated it was quite likely that if people were only assured of migration to Israel the requests for permission to emigrate might be quite drastically reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was an interesting insight into the debate on emigration from the Soviet Union that apparently a considerable part of it has more to do with the quality of the countries they go to in terms of standards of living than it was about fine and noble aspirations to live in freedom. I am not entirely convinced that Israel is <Col N="730" /> a free country in any sense that I would define a free country, but I am concerned that if we are going to give lectures to other countries about human rights &mdash; something I subscribe to since I spend a considerable part of my political career doing it anyway &mdash; we should talk about the issues as they are, not the issues presented in the most favourable light.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to oppose this motion as I subscribe to that what is sought in it.  It is to be hoped that at some stage in the immediate future we can look at other countries who subscribe at least in theory to the same political and social values we subscribe to and identify, as I have said in the case of the United States, the quite clear and fundamental racial bias that operates there in the exercise of the death penalty.  That sort of issue also deserves to be addressed.  If we feel we have the right to give a lecture to one Super Power about human rights in that country, and we do and I subscribe to that, then we also have an obligation to identify abuses of human rights on the part of another Super Power.  There are human rights in that country that are in severe need of reassertion, and particularly the most fundamental of all, the right to life, because it besmirches the name of the greatest democracy, as many people would describe it, that it exercises the death penalty on such a frightening scale.  There are almost 2,000 people awaiting execution in that country.  I will circulate a motion to all Members of the House seeking all-party support for condemnation of the continued use of the death penalty in a racially discriminatory manner in the United States.</P>
    <P>Saying that and putting the motion in perspective, I am quite happy to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to participate in the debate on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, proclaims unequivocally a number of rights which are of particular relevance to this <Col N="731" /> motion.  These include the right to freedom of religion, the right to leave one's country and the right to enjoy one's human rights without discrimination. This declaration is one of the basic instruments setting out the human rights and fundamental freedoms which the 35 CSCE participating states committed themselves to respecting when at Helsinki they signed the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Helsinki Final Act and the concluding document of the Madrid meeting are not treaties and do not legally bind the 35 signatories, which include all the states of Europe, with the exception of Albania, together with the United States and Canada.  They represent, however, a political commitment by these states to implement in full the provisions of these documents and give the other participating states the right to review the extent to which this commitment is being honoured.</P>
    <P>In the area of human rights the Final Act provides that the participating states will respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.  As the motion recalls, it mentions specifically freedom of religion and commits the participating states to recognising and respecting the freedom of the individual to profess and practise religion, either alone or in community with others.  The signatories undertook to encourage the effective exercise of human rights and freedoms and at Madrid they stressed their determination to assure constant and tangible progress in this field.</P>
    <P>The Final Act also devotes a lot of attention to the question of human contacts, particularly the reunification of families and marriages between citizens of different states.  The participating states commit themselves to dealing in a positive and humanitarian spirit with applications from people who wish to be reunited with members of their family. At Madrid it was agreed, specifically, to decide on such applications &ldquo;in normal practice, within six months&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The extent to which the Soviet Union <Col N="732" /> has complied with the commitments it adopted in the CSCE process has varied somewhat over the years since 1975, but it is clear that at no time has its implementation of the Final Act been entirely satisfactory. In the early eighties, in particular, the Soviet record in the area of human contacts deteriorated rapidly. While the period immediately following the signature of the Final Act has seen increasing numbers of Jews being permitted to leave the Soviet Union each year, the numbers declined sharply after 1979, when emigration peaked at 51,000. By comparison, the 1986 figure was only 914.  The decline in Jewish emigration was coupled with repression of persons who had applied for exit visas and the continued denial of the possibility for Jews to give expression to their particular culture.  In other areas too the provisions of the Helsinki and Madrid documents were violated &mdash; for instance, through the systematic suppression of groups set up to monitor their implementation and the repression of religious believers.</P>
    <P>As Senator Norris stressed when he introduced the motion and as was mentioned by other Senators, in particular Senator Murphy, Senator Connor and Senator Ryan, there have been considerable improvements in the Soviet record in the human rights field.  It is particularly important that we would set this on record, that we would recognise it and that, particularly at this time and in the climate that now prevails in the Soviet Government, we should place on record our aknowledgement of those improvements.  Significant numbers of political prisoners have been released and there has been a new, though limited, freedom of expression that would not have been possible in the past.  Since January 1987 the number of visas issued to enable Jews to leave the Soviet Union has increased substantially.  Last year, they numbered just over 8,000, while in the first nine months of this year approximately 11,500 have been issued.  There are reports that reforms in legislation, at present in preparation, will make emigration somewhat easier.</P>
    <P>These developments, and the prospect <Col N="733" /> of reforms in Soviet society after the 29th Conference of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are encouraging, but there remains ample scope for concern at the current situation.  The most recent figures for emigration are still well below those prevailing throughout the seventies, and are small compared to the number of Soviet Jews who wish to leave the country.  Regulations introduced in 1987 limit emigration to those who have a direct relative abroad, although there are indications that for the present these are not being fully enforced.</P>
    <P>Many persons have had visas denied to them on state security grounds.  In many cases the act of applying for permission to leave leads directly to discrimination against not only the applicants but their families as well.  Continued harassment and restrictions on the use of Hebrew, as mentioned by Senators Norris, Harte, Murphy and others, makes it difficult for Jews to practise their religion and pursue their culture.  The anti-Semitic sentiments of such nationalist groups as &ldquo;Pamyat&rdquo; are disturbing.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as well as our partners in the Twelve and other CSCE participating states, has availed of the opportunities offered by CSCE meetings to express our concern at the deficiencies in Soviet implementation of the Helsinki and Madrid provisions, most recently at the review meeting which has been taking place in Vienna since November 1986.</P>
    <P>Together with our partners in the Twelve, we have also sought to strengthen significantly the commitments undertaken at Helsinki and Madrid by making specific and detailed proposals for measures that the participating states must take to ensure the freedom of the individual to profess and practise religion.</P>
    <P>These measures include the right of religious communities to establish freely accessible places of worship, to organise themselves according to their own institutional structure and to solicit and receive financial contributions.  States would also commit themselves to respect the right of everyone to give and receive religious education in the language of <Col N="734" /> their choice and to respect the liberty of parents to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions.</P>
    <P>The Twelve have also made proposals aimed at strengthening the provisions relating to travel for family meetings, family reunification and marriage, and where there is an urgent humanitarian reason.  The Twelve, including Ireland, have also co-sponsored proposals aimed at preventing the abuse of national security grounds for restricting travel and ensuring that any restrictions imposed on these grounds will be for as short a period as possible.</P>
    <P>The Vienna meeting has not yet concluded and negotiations on these and other proposals are continuing. However, it is expected that the Vienna Concluding Document will lead to increased commitments by the participating states in these and other areas which are of particular relevance to this motion.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the Helsinki Final Act confers on all participating states a right to review the way in which a particular state has implemented its commitments.  To date this review has mainly been conducted in the context of one of the three main follow-up meetings held at Belgrade, Madrid and currently, Vienna.  The Twelve, and othe CSCE participating states, consider however, that there is scope for improving the procedures for reviewing implementation of the provisions relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms and human contacts.  With this in mind, we co-sponsored a proposal aimed at strengthening these procedures.  This would allow a state to make representations on particular situation and cases to the state concerned and to bring them to the attention of all the 35 participating states. These cases could also be raised at the normal CSCE review meetings as well as at the annual sessions of a conference on the Human Dimension, which will be attended by all CSCE participating states.  It is expected that the first session of the conference will take place next year in Paris.  The Twelve hope that this <Col N="735" /> increased emphasis on the human dimension will lead to a more thorough implementation by all states of their commitments to human rights and human contacts.</P>
    <P>The appropriate framework in which to raise human rights issues, such as the case of Raoul Wallenberg, referred to by Senators Norris, Murphy and Connor is the CSCE.  This is the context in which the Government raises such issues.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that the subject of this motion is a matter for continued concern to us and one on which we have made our views known to the Soviet authorities, both bilaterally and through the Twelve.  We will continue to press, by appropriate means, for the full implementation of the commitments entered into at Helsinki and Madrid, and about to be undertaken at Vienna, so that Soviet Jews and all Soviet citizens may enjoy their fundamental rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful for the opportunity to speak very briefly on this motion &mdash; very briefly simply because I cannot see what there is to discuss about it.  To me it is a very clear-cut, very open issue.  There is only one issue involved and that is the right of any person of any particular religion or faith or loyalty to a particular country to move freely around the world from one country to another. As the Minister said so rightly in his speech, that is in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I must once again express serious disappointment with the Minister's response because, just as it has been the custom of the Minister on other issues to respond by stating that with the Twelve, or as one of the Twelve we have done this or that, I believe that we are falling into the trap which we said we would never fall into, which is that our foreign policy and the foreign policy of this and the former Government is simply the foreign policy of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great shame that we should not, not just as one of the Twelve but on this <Col N="736" /> issue and on the issue of Nicaragua &mdash; which I raised last week &mdash; speak out individually, loud and clear; and if the Twelve do not agree with us or feel as strongly as we do, so be it.  There is a tendency for us to make a great deal of noise about our neutrality, to say it is precious to us and yet be quite happy to take common foreign policies, common stands which are by their very nature diluted in situations of this sort and hide behind the umbrella of the Twelve.  I would prefer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  I did say that we have done it bilaterally and through the Twelve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw that and what I should point out is &ldquo;bilaterally&rdquo; is mentioned once in the speech, &ldquo;Twelve&rdquo; is mentioned six or seven times already.  That is the whole point I was trying to make, that it is mentioned as an afterthought. If we are to be consistent about our neutrality our whole foreign policy should be bilateral and independent.  I believe that the statements that are constantly coming from the Department of Foreign Affairs about our foreign policy are safe but diluted; whereas I myself feel, and have felt in the past, that maybe our neutrality is bogus and therefore we should be honest about it and say we are not neutral. The Minister and the Government are continuously grooming us day by day by not making a courageous independent stand.  Having said that, I should say that I think the Minister's speech could have been a great deal stronger.  Having said last week that I think we are a bit frightened of offending the United States on Nicaragua, I think I can say this week we are a little bit frightened of offending the Soviet Union on the Jewish problem there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear to me that this is a well-drafted and cleverly-drafted statement, but it does not refer strongly to abuses; <Col N="737" /> it is diluted.  I would like to quote one paragraph on page 2: &ldquo;It is clear that at no time has the implementation of the final Act been entirely satisfactory&rdquo;.  The fact is that the implementation of this Act in the Soviet Union has been a dismal abuse.  I would prefer it if the Minister were to say this.  I know we are a small country.  I know we defer in foreign affairs to larger countries, but I think our weight is far greater than we actually estimate, if we are to use it.  So long as we defer to the larger powers and so long as we defer to the Twelve and so long as we are to have a common foreign policy with the Twelve, we will not carry this weight.  It is time that we had open protests to the Soviet Union about the treatment of Jews in Soviet Russia.  I think we are entitled to do that if we are going to protest about human rights in other parts of the world.  That is what our neutrality should mean.  It should be neutrality, not against anybody but neutrality for human rights regardless of whom we offend.  I agree with what Senator Ryan said about the death penalty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Having said that I would like very briefly to get on to the substantive motion.  This issue is so clear that I cannot understand some of the things which Senator Ryan said.  Senator Ryan gave qualified approval to an issue of this sort. I believe that that sort of an argument <Col N="738" /> takes into account the whole Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East.  I know where Senator Ryan's sympathies lie on that. My sympathies do not happen to lie in the same place.  I do not believe that red herrings should be allowed into a debate of this sort.  It is simple; it should be seen to be simple.  For Senator Ryan to use this particular motion to make an attack on the death penalty in the United States &mdash; which I totally agree with &mdash; I think is a deliberate and misleading diversion and red herring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator make his own contribution and let Senator Ryan stand alone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is outrageous.  He was allowed to make a statement of that sort without interruption from the Chair.  If I am not allowed to even speak in reply to what he said without interruption, I really do find it difficult to function in this House under those circumstances.  I would like to ask Senator Ryan what would happen and what would be the situation and how we would feel if Irish emigrants overseas were not allowed to return home?  That would be outrageous; for that, there could be no excuse.  I do not accept for one moment the Soviet reason, which is simply that it is a matter of security.  You cannot possibly not allow so many people making so many applications out for security reasons nor should the Soviet authorities be allowed to use these people as some sort of leverage. When the West puts pressure on, they let a few out and they let a few more.  When the pressure comes off then they are incarcerated and imprisoned again.</P>
      <P>It really is not enough even now in the present delicate situation, which I acknowledge the Minister said exists in Russia, that we should soft-pedal on this issue.  We should not soft-pedal on this issue.  It is only right that, whatever the situation and whether the doors are being opened or not, the pressure should be kept up.  That is why I welcome this debate here.  That is why I welcome the apparent unanimity in this particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> Finally, I would like to congratulate Senator Ryan and put it on the record that he here today relegated himself from ownership of his Church to just being a member of it.  It is something on which I should congratulate him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this motion I want to make one or two points.  First, I want to recognise some of the things that have been done and I want to refer to a meeting between the representatives of Amnesty International and the Soviet Public Commission on International Cooperation on Humanitarian Affairs and Human Rights held in Paris in May this year.  The Secretary General of Amnesty International and a staff member met people from the Soviet commission.  The chairman of that commission is Fyodor Burlatsky and Professor Yelena Lukasheva is a member.  Generally, Amnesty International welcomed the move that had been made by the President Gorbachev and his advocacy of a strong United Nations role in promoting and protecting human rights and indeed the unprecedented public discussion on human rights in the Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>We must also look at what has not been done.  There is no doubt that the Jewish people who live in the Soviet Union &mdash; their numbers is given variously as numbers between 1½ million and 2½ million; I am not quite sure which figure is correct: there are various estimates and it is probably closer to 2½ million &mdash; have been discriminated against in a way experienced by no other national group in the Soviet Union.  The Soviet Union contains so many different groupings of nationalities who speak different languages and have different cultural and different religious practices and the Jews seem to be the ones who are discriminated against, as they have been discriminated against for as long as anybody can remember.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must support the motion.  I would like to say one positive thing and I would <Col N="740" /> like to point out that we could make a gesture which perhaps would highlight how we feel about this.  In doing so we could follow the lead of three other nations.  On 25 October this year I was in Jerusalem and I visited a place called Yad Vashem which is a memorial to the six million Jews who were destroyed &mdash; I suppose that is the only word &mdash; in the holocaust by the Nazis.  It is a very stark memorial and indeed up on the hill there is a piece of sculpture the memory of which will always stay with me.  It is a stark piece of sculpture of Jews caught on the barbed wire of the concentration camps.  It stands out against the skyline of Jerusalem and it is a horrific sight.  On the way up to it there is a road called the Avenue of the Righteous and there are about 600 trees along this road.  It was a balmy evening and there was a nice wind blowing when I was there and as you walked along you were in good humour but you came out rather sad.</P>
    <P>This Avenue of the Righteous contains 600 trees and below each tree there is the name of a gentile who helped the Jews at that time.  One of these trees bears the name of a man called Raoul Wallenberg. He is a Swede.  There are many different versions of what he has done for the Jewish people during the war but he is reckoned to have saved about 300,000 people, some people say 100,000 people &mdash; it does not matter.  He disappeared into the Soviet Union and persistent efforts to locate this man have been met with the reply that he died in 1947.  Other people have reported seeing him from time to time and having evidence of his existence.  For his work he was recognised in 1981 by the United States and made an honorary citizen of that country.  In 1985 Canada did the same thing and in 1986 Israel did the same thing.  I would like to ask the Minister if he would consider making him an honorary citizen of Ireland also.  It would highlight how we feel about people who are discriminated against in general and it would certainly highlight the Jewish situation.  It would not cost us anything and it might mean a great deal to some people who are suffering at the moment in the Soviet <Col N="741" /> Union because they are not permitted to practice the faith in which they believe.</P>
    <P>It is well known that Soviet officialdom does in many ways allow them to practice somewhat, but really when it comes to learning Hebrew and to having their own practices they do not get the same freedom that other groups do.  For that reason I think it would be a fitting memorial if we could perhaps honour this man, make him an honoroary citizen of Ireland, and maybe highlight the plight of Jews who are still suffering, particularly in the Soviet Union.</P>

      <P>I would like, first of all, to thank the Senators who took part in this very important and indeed, I think, historic debate.  I would like to thank in particular members of a committee of the Jewish community who supplied myself and other Senators with information which was most helpful in this regard and to note the presence in the Chamber of a member of that distinguished group, Mrs. Lynne Jackson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also to welcome the very careful and detailed speech by the Minister which I have just read.  I am particularly heartened that it addresses itself in some detail to many of the issues which were raised, not just by myself but by other Senators, the issue of the right of the Jewish people to educate their children in their own cultural tradition, to have access to the Hebrew language and also, of course, the right to emigrate.  I am very glad that such detailed information was provided as has reassured me that this important matter is being carefully monitored.  I am very heartened indeed that the Minister underlined the continued harassment &mdash; and I use his own words from his speech &mdash; and restrictions on the use of Hebrew which makes it difficult for Jews to practice their religion and pursue their culture.  I am very pleased that he actually named a particular offensive publication called <i>Pamyat</i> because I think that the action of naming is important.  It is important to name the organs which we find offensive and it is also important to, as I was able to do already, name some of the individuals <Col N="742" /> who have been awaiting exit visas for a very long time, the so-called refuseniks.</P>
    <P>I think nothing puts a human face more clearly on this kind of debate which otherwise can appear to be rather academic.  I did go to great trouble, as the Minister is aware and has understood, to place this whole debate in a framework, first of all, of international agreements and protocols and various other international instruments, to show what violations were occurring there and then in the context of the Soviet constitution and finally in the context of the laws of the individual Soviet Republics.  That can appear academic and it is when one puts a human face on these matters that one pierces behind the apparently academic mask and realises the human suffering that is the reality for many people in our world today.</P>
    <P>I am most interested in what the Minister says with regard to the case of Raoul Wallenberg and the Minister will have noted, as I did and I was most heartened by this, that speaker after speaker from every side of the House urged the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Minister and the Government to take on board this practical issue of Raoul Wallenberg and to consider Item No. 37 on the Order Paper today in my name which is to grant citizenship of this country to that great man.  I know that the Minister said that the appropriate framework in which to raise human rights issues such as the case of Raoul Wallenberg referred to by myself is the CSCE.  This is the context in which the Government raises such issues.</P>
    <P>I wonder if I can have an assurance that the Government will, as a matter of urgency raise this matter.  It is not enough I must say merely to indicate that a certain forum exists if that forum is not currently being used.  I am very glad to see that the Minister is nodding and perhaps he will be able to take this up.  It has been raised by Irish Members in the European Parliament and in the Council of Europe.  I am very glad to say that Irish Members from different parties played an important role in raising this issue but <Col N="743" /> there is nothing to prevent the Government of this country, acting on behalf of its people, conferring citizenship on Raoul Wallenberg.  I have to say that a number of other countries, including Canada and the United States of Amrica, have done so.</P>
    <P>I would particularly like to welcome the speeches of my fellow Senators. Without being invidious, I would like to isolate one particular factor that I felt was enormously hopeful and that was that nobody took the opportunity, which might 20 or 30 years ago, have been taken, to launch a blistering attack on the Soviet Union.  It is now accepted that the Soviet Union is a Government with which it is proper to have friendly diplomatic relations.  There was no attempt to be antagnostic.  I think that is most important and I certainly would not wish to be associated with any attack on the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>I note with some interest that the Russian periodicals and films are currently being censored, but I note with even greater amusement that they are not being censored in holy Catholic Ireland, but they are being censored in East Germany. They are being censored precisely because of the operations of <i>perestroika</i> and <i>glasnost</i> because the administration in East Germany is apparently afraid of the release of liberal ideas into the local political context, including not just economic ideas but the raising of the whole question of the emigration of Soviet Jews.  One of the films that has recently been placed on the banned list is a film dealing with the plight of the Jews wishing to leave Russia made by a Soviet film maker and distributed apparently with the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Soviet Government.  That, I feel, is an interesting indication of where <i>perestroika</i> and <i>glasnost</i> are bringing us and it is something I welcome as I welcome very much the sight of President Gorbachev in Siberia encountering the reality of political life &mdash; people in queues for goods, people in the workplace and having patiently to explain directly to an aggrieved public precisely what the implications of <Col N="744" /> this policy of <i>glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i> are.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, we should, Senator, have it here; and, in some small measure, I think we perhaps do.  I would like to just simply say because it is important that we put it in a positive context, how welcome was the speech, among others, of the Leader of the House, Senator Lanigan, who occupies an unusual position because he is leader of the Government party in this House, I was certainly very pleased by the fact that Senator Lanigan, who is well known and is very proud of espousing the cause of the Palestinian people in the Middle East and of the Arab States in general in that area of the world, very carefully and very appropriately and properly drew a distinction between the fate of the Jewish people in the diaspora, and particularly in the Soviet Union, and the situation in the Middle East about whom we are all concerned.  It showed a great responsibility on the part of all Senators and I am sure that the Jewish community in Ireland and throughout Europe will be very pleased, if and when they hear this debate, to realise that the Irish people and their representatives have the political sophistication, which is not widespread, I am sorry to say, to be able to draw this distinction between the Jewish people and their rights as citizens of various countries &mdash; in this case the Soviet Union &mdash; and the situation currently prevailing in the Middle East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to be repetitive, and I know that, even did I so wish, the Cathaoirleach would not allow me to be so, I think it has been a very full debate and I am most grateful to the Senators who spoke.  The subject was dealt with in considerable detail and the response of the Minister was also considered, positive and hopeful.  It is the intention of those who sponsored this motion to seek to advance the matter one degree further by looking for a meeting with the diplomatic representatives of the Soviet Union at <Col N="745" /> which both Members of this House and representatives of the Jewish community in Dublin and the Committees of that community, who are specifically interested in this issue, may also be present.  I did telephone the Soviet Embassy during the afternoon but, unfortunately, I was a little bit late and the very courteous lady to whom I spoke did not have sufficient command of English, at least in my Irish accent, to enable her to deal with this in any great detail.  She invited me to phone again tomorrow and I shall certainly be doing so.</P>
    <P>I hope and believe that this form of non-confrontational dialogue with the power which is, I believe, in a friendly position with regard to this neutral Republic of Ireland is a positive way forward. I do not believe it will be resented and I very much hope that such a meeting can take place in the immediate future. I wonder if it is possible to get some information on one or two of the points that I have raised such as whether, for example, the Government intend to use the machinery of the CSCE to inquire into the case of Raoul Wallenberg and whether there is any possibility that the machinery will be set in motion for conferring citizenship status upon this man.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Ross.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned on the last sitting day there was a certain wrangle about the use of unparliamentary language.  I used a word which had a certain vulgar flavour about it.  I was quoting from Senator Barry Goldwater.  I would like to take up that point because I think one must evaluate the significance of that small unparliamentary expression and place it in the context of the real obscenity of what is going on in Nicaragua.  I think it is important that we underline that point.  I will not try the patience of the House by reading into the record precisely what this kind of obscenity consists of, but a book recently published called <i>Nicaragua &mdash; an Unfinished Canvas</i> contains eyewitness accounts of multiple rape and mutilation of bodies.  It seems that this rather than any parliamentary language should be the subject of our delicate considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that I feel, as a friend of America &mdash; I consider myself a friend of America, it is a great country, there is no doubt about that &mdash; that it behoves us as friends of America to point out where their foreign policy has gone seriously wrong.  I am reminded of a text by the great French novelist, Emile Zola, called <i>J'accuse</i>&mdash; I accuse.  I would like to say that on the basis of the evidence that I have seen recently it would be appropriate to accuse the American administration of certain irresponsible behaviour amounting to an aura of international criminality.  I would have to place on record, with regret, the fact that a book recently published, which I referred to the last day, <i>Out of Control</i> by a very distinguished television journalist, a woman called Cockburn, clearly places on the record the fact that the American administration have flagrantly violated international and domestic laws and the rules of their own parliament. Among the other things in which this <Col N="749" /> administration has engaged appears to be the massive importation of cocaine, with which they have drenched the young people of their own population, in order illegally to acquire money to fund arms for Nicaragua.  That seems to me to be a seriously worrying prospect.  It indicates to me that Contragate is a much worse and much more far-reaching scandal than ever Watergate was; and if Watergate was sufficient to indict an American President, President Nixon, there should surely be some serious examination of the situation in the light of Contragate. However I am an optimistic person.  I believe it is possible even for the most deluded to learn and I hope, although I am not particularly confident, that Vice-President George Bush, soon to be President of America, will learn from his experience in Contragate.  I am not under any illusions that he will read the record of this debate, but I believe that as concern grows internationally about the American treatment of Nicaragua these issues will surely rise to haunt the American Administration.</P>
    <P>What can we do?  Why am I mentioning this here?  I am mentioning it because it seems to me that we as a small country with many similarities to Nicaragua in terms of population, size and history can in fact extend a degree of protection to this valiant and brave country by granting to them the proper recognition by according full diplomatic status to our representation there.  I am encouraged in this by virtue of the fact that this is called for in many documents originating in this country by Irish groups and in particular a publication of the Irish Nicaragua Support Group, an important briefing document just entitled <i>Nicaragua</i> which is published and circulated to all Members of this House, I understand, this week and the final page carries a series of eight recommendations to the Irish Government. I am not going to put them all on the record.  The Minister, I am sure, will by now be familiar with them but it will not surprise him that item no. 3 states that the Irish Government should establish formal diplomatic relations with Nicaragua on a non-resident basis.  This also <Col N="750" /> formed a principal plank of the report compiled by distinguished representatives of both Houses who supervised Nicaraguan elections.</P>
    <P>Some Senators have mentioned some of the errors made by the administation in Nicaragua.  One has to admit that there were errors but in the context of the appalling situation in Latin America they were small and marginal errors and they have been corrected.  I think it would be wrong to emphasise the existence of these errors.  For example, it was indicated that a state of emergency had been declared and there were certain censorship regulations. I need not remind this House that we have section 31 in this State; that we are still in the last number of decades in a state of suspended animation as far as the declaration of state of emergency is concerned.  We still in this country have a state of emergency and I think it would be quite extraordinary if we were to criticise too severely this small, fragile and vulnerable state simply on the basis that it has a state of emergency in existence. It is clear that without a political solution the Nicaraguan people will continue to suffer and die.  As war cripples the economy further, the poorest will be worst hit.  We have had the example of the hurricane.  I appeal to the Minister to put in context the remarks of Senator Haughey, which I was most surprised to hear in the last day's debate, that while establishing diplomatic relations may be the moral thing to do, he asked the question: can we afford it?  I would like to feel that this country in the exercise of its foreign policy options makes international morality an important plank and answers that question by saying that we cannot afford to support a foreign policy that is not moral.  On this occasion I am in the unusual situation of agreeing with and applauding the position of members of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy who have courageously, with dignity and quite correctly supported the Nicaraguan people and the Nicaraguan Government. I need not say that the foreign minister and a number of other prominent political people are Roman Catholic priests. The final thing I would like to say is that <Col N="751" /> there is, in this excellent book, <i>Nicaragua &mdash; an Unfinished Canvas</i> a definitive answer to the charges of atheism, corruption and communism levelled against this small and vulnerable state in an article by Father Miguel D'Escoto, a distinguished Jesuit priest who says: &ldquo;I am a man, a Nicaraguan, a Christian and a priest, all of which demand of me certain things but not contradictory demands&rdquo;.  I honour a country which is able to reconcile these various and strong demands and I urge that the Minister should live up to the obligation placed on us by our own tragic history and do the decent thing by extending full diplomatic recognition to the State of Nicaragua.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to hear so many glowing tributes to the Church and to priests because in this House on that same side at times, down at the lower end anyway, I want to be careful in saying where I am talking about, we hear criticism of what the Catholic Church and the priests and the bishops are doing.  It is nice to hear someone appaluding them for what they are doing.  I have always done that and maybe my little bit of gospel has not fallen on deaf ears, that certain people listen and realise that they do a lot of very good work.  Nobody can deny that.  There are many people who would say that we have more embassies than we can afford at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 160 states in the world and we have 67 embassies.  There are 93 states without embassies.  If we were to carry this to its logical conclusion and put an embassy in every state you would be talking about spending £100 million.  Can this country afford that kind of money at a time when we are trying to get our finances right and when the Government are doing a great job to try to rectify our financial problems and get the country on a sound and prosperous basis?  I would hold that embassies should follow and contribute to trade.  Our trade with Nicaragua is very small.  Last year our exports amounted to £123,000 and our imports to £349,000.  I do not think that kind of <Col N="752" /> trade would in any way justify an embassy in that country.</P>
    <P>Some Senator said that he did not believe there would be any concrete results but that it would be symbolic in showing our independence and our neutrality. Can we afford this type of symbolism? I do not think we can.  It is right and proper for this nation to show solidarity with any oppressed people and we have done that on all occasions.  We do not do that by throwing taxpayers' money away on expensive embassy structures. That would be very foolish.  If we were to have an Irish embassy in Nicaragua, would it be any advantage to the Nicaraguan people?  How many of them would even know we were there?  In a country that is squeezed between two big states, we would be of no assistance and no speaker so far has put up any case to suggest that we would be of any assistance to the ordinary people of Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that Ireland has been cutting back on aid.  That is not true.  It is only true if Irish aid is seen as only coming from official sources or from the Government.  That is an unfair angle because the Irish people are extremely generous.  As a people, both through our taxes and through voluntary contributions to bodies like Concern and Trócaire, we contribute on a <i>per capita</i> basis more than any other people in the EC.</P>
    <P>We do not need the vanity of embassies to express our neutrality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  Our neutrality is expressed in this House and it is expressed in the actions and policies of our Government and past Governments. <Col N="753" /> It was expressed particularly by this Government when the <i>Belgrano</i> was sent to the bottom of the South Atlantic with the loss of hundreds of young men.  The expression of our neurality on that occasion was not welcomed by all those who posture about it now.  It is like religion; we always play the ball to suit the particular game we are playing.  We are not consistent in our views and our arguments.</P>
      <P>In my opinion neutrality is not expressed in bricks and mortar.  It is expressed in the spirit of the people.  I am fully convinced that what is proposed here would be a very foolish move because it would not be of any advantage to the Nicaraguan people.  Unless we do something that is positive and will be a help to those people there is no good in doing it for the sake of vanity or for the sake of honour or for the sake of saying we have an embassy there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a lot in common with Nicaragua.  We have roughly the same population of about three and half to four million people.  A hundred years ago in Ireland we suffered the same social and economic hardships which they now have, inadequate housing, poor health care, lack of proper schooling, etc.  Their history is not dissimilar to our own.  The present State of Nicaragua was ruled by a foreign country for over two centuries.  It was under Spanish control.  Also, like Ireland it is mainly an agricultural country with about 50 per cent of its population actively involved in working on the land &mdash; a higher percentage than in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For most of the 1970s Nicaragua was under a type of dictatorship which only ended in 1979.  It really came into the world news in October 1972 when it was struck by a massive earthquake killing thousands of people in the capital of Managua. The death toll was estimated to be over 12,000 people.  Recently it was in the news again when it was stuck by Hurricane Joan.  Great damage was caused to housing, crops and large sections of topsoil were literally blown away in the central plain.  It was believed that up to <Col N="754" /> half a million people were left homeless as a result of that hurricane.</P>
    <P>In 1979 after the dictatorship was overthrown civil rights were restored to the people by law in 1980.  Elections were promised but postponed despite protests and in 1982 guerrillas began to attack Government installations in Nicaragua. In 1982 the United States Government cut off economic aid to the country apparently connecting this to the troubles in neighbouring El Salvador.  A delegation from Trócaire in Ireland visited Nicaragua in November 1985.  This deputation included the Bishop of Galway, Eamonn Casey, and I will quote part of the document this deputation published on their return:</P>
    <P>Although the Nicaraguan Government appears to be containing the threat from the Contras, the economic effects on the country are serious throughout Nicaragua.  Popular support for the Government remains high. The continued US support for the terrorist actions of the Contras, despite worldwide criticism, indicates that there can be no peace until the US ceases its aggression against Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>Those are not my words but the words of the deputation which visited Nicaragua in 1985.  That deputation included two Irish bishops.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, our country and Nicaragua have a lot in common. Therefore, why not diplomatic relations, why not diplomatic relations with all other Central American republics?  One Ambassador would cover the capital cities in Central America.  I am aware that on three occasions since 1981 Nicaragua has tried to establish diplomatic relations with Ireland and the answer on each occasion was that the resources of the Department of Foreign Affairs did not allow any extension of our diplomatic presence overseas.  That is a diplomatic way of saying we have not any money to do this.  In fact, the present Government has cut back overseas aid by 21 per cent in 1988 over the figures for 1987.  Senator Farrell said this is being partly made up <Col N="755" /> from the general public.  I do not think we should pass on what is our duty as a Government to the general public.  Whatever contributions come from that source &mdash; I know they are generous and good &mdash; should be over and above the contibution from the Government for overseas aid.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for 1989 it is proposed to reduce our bilateral aid programme by a further 10 per cent.  That action shows how little chance this motion has of becoming a reality in the present economic climate.  Last year we closed our Embassy in Kenya, one of the important countries in Africa.  While we would support the motion that we establish diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, the evidence of Government decisions regarding the cut backs in foreign aid would indicate that it may not become a reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the motion really talks about an Embassy.  Senator Farrell seemed to think that the inevitability is an Embassy.  The inevitably is not a Embassy at all.  There are many ways in which you can play a role.  For example, Mr. Frank Aiken played a very good role for Ireland as a neutral nation. He exercised great influence over people, events and situations and was trusted because he was neutral.  There is no reason why Ireland cannot get into some sort of a similar role in this case.  It is not on the basis of going into opposition against America, because you cannot cut off your nose to spite your face.  We have a problem in dealing with this situation. We are probably the friendliest of nations with the US.  For that reason the time is right for us to suggest to the United States that we are thinking seriously about opening diplomatic relations with Nicaragua and in that way we could assert some pressure on the American people and open up dialogue in a wider way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As long as guerrilla war is being waged against people you cannot follow a philosophy that we are just bystanders.  You cannot claim to be free as long as there are other people who are in trouble.  The situation is that in guerrilla warfare there <Col N="756" /> are no bystanders and the guerrillas do not look on innocent people as innocent bystanders.  Therefore, small democracies like our own have a role to play particularly in the light of our own history. We should say to America: &ldquo;You are saying one thing, the Contras are saying something else and the Sandinistas are saying other things.  The problem, will not go away; therefore you need the assistance of a friendly nation like us. We believe the best way to go about this is for us to open up discussions with Nicaragua with a view to having diplomatic relations with them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Diplomatic relations do not mean an Embassy.  It does not matter that we are not going to get into a good trading situation with them, but there is no reason at all why we cannot invite the Nicaraguan people here to enter into talks and discussions with them.  We have a right to bring them in.  We have a right to bring in the PLO if we wish to see how they stand with regard to the new state and what sort of assistance we can lend. We are entitled to do that.  That is a form of diplomatic relations.  It is not all down to the question of an embassy and trade. We do not have to get caught up in the argument by taking sides.  Obviously, we would have to observe all the wrongs that are being done inside the country, but that does not mean we have to come down on the side of one or the other in the course of our discussions with them. We can say in a friendly way to the Americans: &ldquo;We believe you are doing this and we believe it is wrong.  We believe that because of the money you are paying to people there are thousands of innocent victims being killed on a regular basis. We believe the course of action you are following is one that is not followed by any other nation in the world to this extent.&rdquo;  A major leading nation in the world is supplying millions of pounds to terrorists to overthrow the legitimate government of that particular country. That does not happen anywhere else.  We must whether we like it or not, whether the Americans become a little disenchanted with us or not, start bringing those things home to those people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> In America about 60 per cent of the people are not in favour of money going to the Contras.  That is a difficult argument to establish.  But when President Reagan was elected a second time he got about 60 per cent of the vote of the 30 per cent of the people who voted.  Here we have somebody in a minority situation in America who is actually pursuing this policy.  One might say it is against the wishes of the bulk of the American people.  The American people have bitter memories of the Vietnam war and there is a parallel.  The CIA went in to do certain things and suddenly started to control the whole situation and everything got out of hand.  The most brutal events that ever happened in the world happened in Vietnam eventually and quite a lot of it is going on now in Nicaragua. There are people who have had experience of Vietnam and who are fasting on the steps of the Capital building.</P>
    <P>People who have served in Vietnam are prepared to fast to the death.  They know exactly what is going on under the Reagan administration.  They know that the catch cry of &ldquo;unpatriotic lefties&rdquo; is not going to stop them from raising their voices in support of oppressed people.  When you do that you are called a lefty, a coward, an outlaw or a traitor to your country.  These people have fought for their country.  They are now prepared to put their life on the line to see that the atrocities that were committed in Vietnam in the name of American people do not continue in Nicaragua and that eventually the American people will come to their senses and start finding some way of pulling back or some way of coming to terms with the situation.</P>
    <P>You just cannot go in and overthrow the legitimate government of any other country.  How would we feel if the United States decided to go into the North of Ireland, for example, and tried to take control in a political way?  That may be an extreme example.  Nevertheless, it is tantamount to the same thing.  They are in a country that does not belong to them. It has not set out to do them any damage. All the killings and conspiracy, all the <Col N="758" /> bad things that are happening in Nicaragua are American inspired.  The result is that the government cannot function. One cannot talk forcefully enough about what is happening in Nicaragua.  People are prepared to go on hunger strike and die.  There are people who have received the Congressional Medal of Honour.  You cannot make a coward out of a man who has got the Congressional Medal of Honour, yet these people are being branded as traitors and cowards.  All they are doing is bringing their experience of Vietnam, which was a similar situation, right into the hearts of the American public to try to bring it home to them that the lies and hypocrisy of some of the American propaganda is far from the truth.  They are trying to bring it home to them what exactly the truth is.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of us being disloyal to the Americans or asking Irish-Americans to be unpatriotic.  We have a role to play.  Because we have to look for assistance from them now and again does not mean that we have to put a clamp on our views.  We do not have to do it in a sort of blatant, opposing way.  We can put it to the Americans that this is what their forces are into.  We can put it to the Nicaraguans that we have a role to play. We should take our courage in our hands and start thinking strongly about the question of setting up diplomatic relations to assist in this situation rather than do anything else, and assist the American people.</P>
    <P>Some people say that it is only leftists and Church groups who oppose the £100 million funding voted for the Contras. Many of the Churches that are involved are far from being leftist.  Certainly they would be opposed to any action, either in the House of Representatives or in the Senate, that supports the concept of putting millions of pounds into the hands of people who are trying to overthrow the legitimate government and who, in the process, are killing everybody in the way.  There is no such thing as an innocent bystander when you get into guerilla warfare or when you get into these terrorist situations.  We are aware of that from our own experience in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> We could stand by for many years and see a situation developing whereby the Americans may not win in Nicaragua. What happens then?  Do we wait, without expressing a voice, until such time as the Americans decide to send in the Marines? Will it come to that?  If it comes to that, why did we not say something about it earlier?  Why did we not approach the American Government and why were we afraid of getting off-side &mdash; if they said we were off-side on this issue?  What do we do?  Do we wait until the vultures are flying over the dead bodies?  Do we continue forever standing by and reading about legislation that will vote more and more money into it?  With the election of the new President obviously the same policies will be carried out.  Somebody has to stand up and say to him, &ldquo;Look, pull back, we do not want you going in there; we do not want you sending money in there to blow pregnant women up, to burn out villages, to loot all around, to kill children&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have a role to play.  We are always talking about our neutrality in the sense that we should use it to be an influence in certain situations.  Here we have an opportunity.  We can talk to people who are friendly; we can tell them that great concern has been expressed by many of our Senators in this House.  Even though we do not agree with a lot of what they might say, nevertheless grave concern has been expressed on behalf of many of the Irish people.  Therefore, we want to talk to them about the question of Nicaragua, because we believe that if we set up diplomatic relations with them we might in fact be able to play a role.  We should not be frightened of doing that. We should go after the question of diplomatic relations.  It is a long way off establishing an embassy.</P>
    <P>It is a bit of a joke in this day and age, when you cannot get hospitals open, to talk about opening an embassy abroad. We are not talking about that.  We are opposing the closure of hospitals but certainly we are not advocating that a whole lot of money should be spent all over the world on embassies.  We believe we have <Col N="760" /> a right to do something as a small nation which was oppressed for many years. Here we have people who are in a similar situation.  Because the times are different and the circumstances may be different, nevertheless it is relative to the Nicaraguan people who are forced into a situation where they have to put up with the intrusion by another government into the affairs of their country in such a way that it is a blood-letting exercise.</P>
    <P>Even if you put terrorists into a country you cannot say, &ldquo;We only want you to do this, do not do that or the other&rdquo; because once you let people loose with guns and bombs that is the end of it.  The bombs and the guns will go off in all directions.  We should speak up and stand up to the American people and tell the American information service that everything they are issuing on the question of Nicaragua is not believed and tell them why it is not believed and that many people here do not believe it.  We do not believe everything that comes from the Nicaraguan Government either.  Nevertheless, we have a role to play.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank all the Senators who have contributed to this motion and try to answer as many as possible of the points raised. Of the world's more than 160 independent States Ireland has formal diplomatic relations with only 67, with 28 on a residential and 39 on a non-residential basis.  Although our network of embassies has expanded over the years it is still fairly modest.  Almost all our ambassadors are accredited to two or more states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions about the establishment of diplomatic relations are determined, contrary to what has been expressed here, by our own criteria and interests.  Prospective advantages in the political and economic fields have to be weighed against the long-term commitment of resources that would be involved.  In the economic climate of recent years it has become very difficult to justify any increase in the number of states with which we have formal diplomatic relations.  As Senators are aware &mdash;<Col N="761" /> indeed this is a matter which was referred to by many of them &mdash; the embassy in Nairobi had to be closed last year for budgetary reasons.</P>
    <P>It would be contrary to normal international practice to speculate about the establishment of diplomatic relations with any particular country.  However, I can say that some of the arguments advanced in support of this motion would not appeal to any Irish Government.  The suggestion that we establish diplomatic relations with one country as a way of criticising and demonstrating that we are not subservient to another country, one with which we already have long-standing friendly relations, can hardly be taken seriously.  A decision about establishing diplomatic relations should be more firmly based than that.  May I say to Senator Harte that we do not have to tell any Government whether we intend to establish diplomatic relations with another State.  Similarly, the Government have confidence enough in the reality of our independence and neutrality not to want to prove it in this way.</P>
    <P>As I have said, decisions about the establishment of diplomatic relations are determined by our own interests.  We have to have regard to the political and economic interest in each particular case and set this off against the cost in terms of resources, which is long-term.  Even on a non-resident basis this is a matter that was raised by quite a number of Senators &mdash; maintaining diplomatic relations imposes demands on our resources not least on the time of our ambassadors if the establishment of relations is to have any meaning.  Most of our ambassadors are already accredited to several countries and we have to consider seriously the desirability and the good sense of adding further assignments of this kind.</P>
    <P>Of the 20 or so states in Latin America we have diplomatic relations with four &mdash; this is of some relevance to what Senator Connor and Senator McCormack were saying &mdash; with Argentina, where we have an embassy, and with Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela, to which the ambassadors in Lisbon, Washington and Buenos Aires <Col N="762" /> are accredited.  There may be good reasons, indeed very good moral reasons, for having formal relations with other Latin American states and indeed with states in other parts of the world.  Again, this is a point that was made by Senator MacCormack and Senator Connor, that we should establish diplomatic relations as soon as possible with all the countries in Central America.  However, it has been the views of successive Governments in recent years that the limitations of our resources in finance and personnel did not allow any further increase for the time being in the number of states with which we have diplomatic relations. Changes in our representation abroad can be made when circumstances justify them.  We have no plans at present to establish formal diplomatic relations with Nicaragua.  For Senator McCormack's information, this was also the view of the last Government.  Could I inform the Seanad that the Nicaraguan Government are aware of this position.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of diplomatic relations is to serve as a channel of communications between Governments.  The absence of such a channel is not a serious obstacle to good relations with the Government of Nicaragua.  There are regular meetings at Foreign Minister level during sessions of the UN General Assembly and during the annual conferences of Ministers of the Central American and EC States such as took place in Hamburg in February.  I have met my Nicaraguan counterpart and discussed with him some of his country's problems.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made during the debate to Nicaragua's need of our moral support and sympathy.  There has also been criticism of the Government for not condemning US actions and for not giving more aid, although Senator Murphy differentiated between the American people and the American Government.</P>
    <P>The Government share the interest and concern for the welfare of all the people of Central America which is widespread in this country.  Violence and political instability, rooted in long-standing shortcomings in the fields of economic <Col N="763" /> development.  Social justice and respect for human rights, have characterised the region for years.  We believe that these problems can best be overcome in the context of an agreement emanating from the countries themselves and supported by outside countries.  The Guatemala Agreement also know as &ldquo;Esquipulas II&rdquo; or the Arias Accord signed by the Presidents of the five Central American countries in August, 1987 is such an agreement.  It has been endorsed by the UN General Assembly and The Twelve, with our support.  The Dáil adopted an all-party motion expressing support for it last November.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with our EC partners and jointly with other states at the United Nations we are able to exert influence on the situation in Central America.  I know Senator Ross's problems in relation to my continued use of the words &ldquo;with our EC partners&rdquo;.  We and our partners have frequently expressed support for the &ldquo;Esquipulas II&rdquo; Agreement.  Two of the provisions of which are a cessation of outside aid to irregular forces or insurrectionist movements and prevention of the use of territory to destablise other Governments.  We have previously said that all states should refrain from interference of any kind in Nicaragua and we will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>We, and indeed the previous Government, have supported UN General Assembly Resolutions calling for compliance with the June 1986 Judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua.  How often more have we to reiterate our concerns before people will take us seriously.</P>
    <P>We have thus taken position in the UN and among the Twelve on the issues arising in Central America.  What is important is to advance and reinforce the impulses arising within the region itself which tend to a settlement of its problems by peaceful means.  Considerable progress has been made &mdash; there is a cease-fire in Nicaragua, for example &mdash; but a great deal more remains to be done.  I share the hopes of Senators that the <Col N="764" /> immediate future will see further progress towards an overall solution of the problems of Central America.</P>
    <P>As far as aid is concerned, we try to use our limited resources to best effect. Our Bilateral Aid Programme caters for the needs of selected priority countries in Africa.  Projects carried out by organisations such as Trócaire are funded under our NGO Co-financing scheme on the basis of applications submitted.  The number of projects deemed worthy of support in any particular country fluctuates from year to year.  Following the extensive damage caused by Hurricane Joan in Nicaragua and other Central American countries a major international assistance effort was launched which appears to have resulted in sufficient funds to deal with immediate needs.  It included a substantial allocation from the EC to which we contribute.  It may be of interest to Senators that 21 per cent of all community aid to Central America goes to Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>We decided not to make a special contribution on this occasion both because sufficient funds already seemed to be available and because we recently made large contributions (£800,000) for disaster relief in countries in Africa and Asia.  Again, contrary to what has been said, it was the largest sum ever contributed to disaster relief.  In summary, we must take account of the balance of advantage to us in establishing diplomatic representations having regard to real political and economic interests, the resources available to us and the effective and meaningful use of these resources.</P>
    <P>As will be clear from what I have said, we continue to take an active interest in the problems of Central America in the appropriate fora and will continue to do what we can to advance peaceful solutions to the conflicts there, repeating what we feel is necessary and using any help we can obtain from our Community partners to boost our arguments. In regard to aid we find it necessary to focus the resources available to us in a sharp fashion which means in this case that the monies allocated to us have to be concentrated elsewhere.  I might add <Col N="765" /> that the two project proposals submitted by HEADCO for Nicaraguan universities were approved and funded and that about £11,500 has been given up to now this year.  To conclude therefore while I do not wish to speculate about the establishment of diplomatic relations with any country, I would like to restate what I have already said earlier.  We have no plans at present to establish diplomatic relations with Nicaragua.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few words to say in response to what the Minister said and also to make the point again, which has been stated and restated both today and last week, that under international law and in a sense in the way we operate ourselves before we recognise a country or a state, we have certain preconditions that we ensure that that state or country will meet.  Two of those are very simply that the country would have a clearly defined geographical area and also that the country and the Government in control there would be clearly seen to be in control and to be ruling the country. Those are two of the preconditions that we put before we would approve and recognise a state.  There are two more, one of which I will now elaborate on, that is that a country should be in a position to establish external diplomatic relations with other countries.</P>
      <P>We then find ourselves in a situation where we recognise the state of Nicaragua and as one of the conditions which we normally apply through the application of international law, we insist that before we recognise a country that it be in a position to set up external relations. Of course, external relations are a mutual operation and the attitude we take in Ireland towards Central America and similar countries is very difficult to define. For instance, to give another example, as far as I know we are the only country in Europe that does not have diplomatic relations with Cuba.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To fly to Nicaragua from Ireland at the moment or to different parts of South America and Central America is an exercise in international diplomacy because to get to Nicaragua one could get a flight <Col N="766" /> from Shannon to Cuba to Managua otherwise one has to go to the States, go to a neutral country and try and get into Nicaragua.  Because we as a country refuse to open an embassy and exchange diplomatic relations with Nicaragua we are supporting that kind of negative international interaction.  We have a very clear role which goes back historically, the role that we have taken over the years which, unfortunately, has normally manifested itself as a kind of proselytiser, but at least we have sent people abroad for whatever reason over the centuries and we have a very sincere interest in what happens in Central America.</P>
    <P>I recall that on the occasion of the recent visit of the President of the United States to this country a huge group of people under the general banner of the organisation of people opposed to Reagan's foreign policy organised a campaign against the visit and against what the President represented in this country. I spoke to many journalists from the US at that stage and the matter which they found most difficult to understand was that their reporters could walk down O'Connell Street or walk into pubs, do a vox pop with ordinary people and ask them their views on American foreign policy on Central America.  On all occasions they were able to get a cogent and enlightened response from ordinary people on the street.</P>
    <P>It seems that what we are doing in Ireland at the moment by refusing to open an embassy in Managua, by refusing to exchance diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, is supporting American foreign policy, the foreign policy of the States which was defined by President Monroe well over 100 years ago of America for the Americas, which was that no country on either continent of the Americas should in any sense oppose the views and the philosophy of the US.  We are in a sense subscribing to that because it seems to me that the only reason we are refusing to recognise Nicaragua, Cuba and similar countries is because they stand for a different political philosophy than the US at the moment.</P>
    <P>It might be of interest to the House to <Col N="767" /> know that the first the normal American punter heard about the US involvement in Nicaragua was when the mining of the ports of Nicaragua became world and international news some years ago. Before that it was just considered another one of the US operations in Central and South America.  I spoke to a young American student in this country recently whose father had been stationed in Central America and he told me that what he knew about Nicaragua was that when his father worked there some years ago that he could hear the political prisoners screaming and shouting in the jails of Managua.  It was something that was totally unreal and untrue but it was being presented to him as the position of the state and the ruling body in Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>We find, of course, in Nicaragua the epitome of the contradiction of the US foreign policy for Central America to which we are now subscribing, the idea that in one state you support the democratic Government and in another state you oppose the democratic Government. If we look at the precise position between El Salvador and Nicaragua we see this contradiction very clearly.  In order to express ourselves as being non-aligned, in order to express our neutrality in a positive way, in order to manifest in a positive way what we stand for, it is essential that we be seen to act independently in world affairs.  One way we can do that in the area of Central America would be to do it by opening an embassy in Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>I might put it that if the matter was cash, which has been referred to by the Minister in his response, that the very least we might do is that we might nominate the Irish Ambassador to the nearest point, which would be either Buenos Aires or Washington, and for the moment add to the responsibility of that ambassador responsibility as ambassador to Nicaragua.  That would be a first step towards opening an embassy.  It would not fulfil the requirements as outlined in this motion but at least it would be a first step in that direction.  I put it to the <Col N="768" /> Minister that that could be done at little or no cost at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is quite a usual thing.  I believe, for instance, that the Irish Ambassador to Washington also covers Mexico.  It could also be extended beyond that.  I would certainly put that as one step in that particular direction.  It seems that, by not opening an embassy in Nicaragua we are really saying that the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs are merely an extension of the American State Department in Washington.  I propose that this House urge the Minister to immediately open diplomatic relations with Nicaragua.</P>

      <P>I do not think that justice has been done here today to the plight of the Nicaraguans by introducing this motion.  In actual fact, this motion might have been better not to have been tabled. There has been a suggestion by Senator O'Toole that we are subservient in our foreign policy to other states.  I am a person who has involvement in problems outside this state and I must say that I have never seen a subservience by this country to the wishes of outside states. This Government in particular are cognisant of the problems which are associated with the Nicaraguan situation.  It is totally wrong to have it said in this House that the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs are subservient to the wishes of another State.  It is not so and I would sincerely hope that no Government in this country would ever become in its foreign affairs principles subservient to the wishes of another state.  We are not subservient.  We do recognise that there are problems in Nicaragua and the problems in Nicaragua are no less or no more than the problems associated with deprivation and possibly misrule in many other areas in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said by Senator O'Toole that we refused to recognise Nicaragua.  We do not refuse to recognise Nicaragua.  We do <Col N="769" /> recognise Nicaragua but this does not mean that we have to have an embassy in that country.  I have perceived the need to have an extension of diplomatic relations or diplomatic presence in various countries, but I go along with what the Minister says: we are not a country which can afford to have embassies every place that we would wish to have them. We cannot afford to have them and we have to accept that.  I have seen excellent diplomatic personnel who have not alone to deal with the problems of one country but in actual fact who have to deal with the problems of the whole areas.  I have seen how they are extending themselves to the limits in trying to ensure that we have a diplomatic presence in various areas throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The Minister did say that the fact that we do not have an embassy in a particular country does not mean that we do not have contact at both official and nonofficial level.  We have a small number of embassies around the world, more than many countries of our size have, and our viewpoints are well represented by our diplomats abroad.</P>
    <P>There are times when I would have conflict with people in the Department of Foreign Affairs but I do wish that it would go out from this House that because we do not have an embassy in a particular country we do not have friendly relations and are not cognisant of the problems of these countries.  We are cognisant and the Minister made certain that he said that.  He mentioned the fact that relationships are not strained between ourselves and the Nicaraguans. It is essential that we maintain contacts with the Nicaraguans the same as with a lot of other countries.</P>
    <P>The putting down of this motion has not served the people of Nicaragua; it has not served the people of Ireland in our relationships with the Nicaraguan Government, because I think that it has forced a stance to be expressed that we will not at this moment set up an embassy in Nicaragua.  I do not think it is helpful. Diplomatic relations, as the Minister said are a means of communication.  You do <Col N="770" /> not have to have an actual embassy to have communication.</P>
    <P>We are very positive in our foreign affairs attitude.  It is recognised right throughout the world that, even though we are a very small country, our attitude has not been subservient to the wishes of other major powers.  It is one of the hopes I would have in this House that we will never become subservient to any outside power; that we maintain a foreign affairs attitude which is Irish, which serves the people with whom we have connections, that we will not be subservient to major power blocks, whether they be eastern or western.  For this reason I regret that this motion was placed before the House.</P>
    <P>Our independent attitude in foreign affairs is well recognised throughout the world.  There is not a country that we are not allowed to go into and have our troops available in the peacekeeping sphere.  There is no country in the world where there have been problems where we have been asked to serve that we cannot go in, because we have adhered to the foreign policies of one or another of the major powers.  It is not true to say that we are subservient.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs, the Minister and his predecessors have been very strong in their attitude.  Neutrality is not a word to be bandied about in world affairs at present.  Our neutrality is a positive neutrality that recognises the fact that we are a small nation but that we can play a part in international relationships.  We do accept the State of Nicaragua.  We do accept their role in Latin American society.  We do accept that there are problems which are exacerbated by outside influences.  We do recognise as the Minister has stated quite positively, that we have made suggestions and gone along in co-operation with our EC partners and jointly with other states of the United Nations to exert influence on the situation in Central America.  We and our partners frequently express support for the Esquipulas II Agreement, two of the provisions of which are a cessation of outside aid to irregular forces or insurrectionist movements and prevention of the use of terrorism to destabilise <Col N="771" /> other governments.  Interference from outside has created the situation in the Lebanon.  It has created a conflict in Afghanistan.  It has created conflict in Pakistan.  It has created problems in Nicaragua. It has created problems in Cuba. It has created problems in Ireland.  We as a nation can stand with our heads high in regard to our attitude in foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>We mentioned earlier today the situation on the universal declaration of human rights.  We stand over the universal declaration of human rights.  We make no apologies for it.  The universal declaration of human rights to the people in Nicaragua is as important as it is to the Jews in Russia.  We accept the necessity for the universal declaration of human rights.  Unfortunately, a conflict might seem to be arising in this country about our role in Nicaragua.  I would suggest that our role has been very positive in terms of the problems of the Nicaraguan people.  The people of Nicaragua have expressed their knowledge of our concern. They have expressed to a number of people that they are quite satisfied with the situation where they can have consultations with the Irish Government at official and semi-official level at all times.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that the Minister's speech expresses in total what our attitude is and should be and that there is interest and concern for all of the people of central America and in particular the people of Nicaragua.  I would hope that the proposer of the motion would withdraw the motion in the spirit of the statement made by the Minister in reply to the debate.</P>

      <P>What I have to say will be pointed, blunt and quite succinct.  I find it fascinating that people can take umbrage.  It is one of the difficulties of dealing with the Department of Foreign Affairs at present in that both the Minister and the Minister of State are particularly likeable individuals and, therefore, it is particularly difficult and painful to have to take umbrage and to get very cross.  But, I am quite cross, for this <Col N="772" /> reason: we have run around this issue and I know, and I suspect the Minister knows, that while there are many reasons we can put up to justify not establishing diplomatic relations with Nicaragua and while many of them are plausible, they are also extremely convenient because they enable us to throw a cloak over the real one, which is, that our friends in Washington would be absolutely outraged if we were to establish diplomatic relations with Nicaragua.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our friends in Washington have never heard a direct word of condemnation from an Irish Government about what they were doing.  Irish Governments have been very good at expressing concern about what is happening in Nicaragua in diplomatic language but I have not yet heard a Government Minister say that what the United States is doing in Nicaragua is wrong.  I have heard them express concern about what is happening in Central America.  I have heard them put forward various formulae that could be interpreted by sensitive Americans interpreting Irish policy as criticisms.  I have not yet heard an Irish Government Minister prepared to stand up &mdash; and it was not said by the Minister, he expressed all the appropriate concerns that all of us would share &mdash; and to be as explicit in his criticisms of United States policy in Central America, as the Minister here was prepared to be explicit in his criticisms of the abuses of human rights in the Soviet Union earlier today.  That is the sort of explicitness that I welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever my qualms and reservations about that motion which I supported we did have quite explicit statements from the Minister that we were not happy, that we did not like what was going on.  We were not talking then, in that case about the Soviet Union, about systematic massacre of civilians.  We were not talking about army drug pushing mercenaries, who were going to deliberately massacre innocent civilians in the name of freedom and democracy.  We were not talking <Col N="773" /> about arming the ex-agents of state terror and torture to attempt to undermine and destabilise a democratically elected government.  We were talking about serious abuses of human rights but abuses that stop far short of systematic murder, systematic rape and systematic torture. Yet, we are quite happy to tell the Soviet Union that they must get their house in order.</P>
    <P>We have never in the barbarous period of barbarous assault on Nicaragua by the Government of the United States been prepared to issue even a sort of mild reproof to them that we have issued today to the Soviet Union for what is by any standards a lesser offence, however much regrettable.  It is in that context that you have to judge the pussyfooting about the question of diplomatic relations with Nicaragua because Nicaragua has become and is a symbol.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I try to be in order.  This is the context in which this has to be discussed.  Nicaragua is not just a little country in the middle of Central America: it is an extremely important symbol of the past relationships between the superpowers and what they saw were their client states and what many of us would hope to be the future relationship between the superpowers and their formally client states.  The issue in Nicaragua is not actually whether I agree with the Government; it is the right of the people of Nicaragua to build their own country <Col N="774" /> in the way they choose to do it without outside interference.</P>

      <P>The Minister is a nice guy.  It is difficult to get very mad with him.  I am not aware that we did actually specifically condemn the United States and accept that the United States had mined the harbour of Nicaragua.  I would defy the Minister to give me one statement by a Government Minister which actually named the United States as being responsible for anything that has been done by the mercenaries who have massacred women, children and civilians in Nicaragua.  I defy the Minister to give me one reference to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a lot of words which can be interpreted, I said that at the beginning of my speech.  I have heard eminent American historians interpret what Government Ministers have said as being a criticism but you do not need to interpret what the Minister, Deputy Calleary, said here this afternoon, <Col N="775" /> because he named the Soviet Union.  Why can we not say to our friends in America, &ldquo;We think you are totally, utterly and morally wrong&rdquo;?  That is the fundamental issue.  Why can we not say it and name them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, I will accept his two minutes.  This is the crux of this issue a Chathaoirligh: this is a country which for an awful lot of people in this country &mdash; one of the previous speakers mentioned this &mdash; symbolises something.  I saw a Government when President Reagan was visiting here forced against their wishes to move from positions of total silence on Central America to saying something because Irish public opinion would not wear their silence.  I have seen that happen.  Now we have a symbol and that is what this is all about.  This is not about trade or politics or anything else.  This is about the symbolic identification of one ex-colonial power which believes in its own right, and very jealously in its own right, to be sovereign, the symbolism of our being prepared to extend our relationship to a diplomatic recognition based on mutual <Col N="776" /> exchange of ambassadors, to say &ldquo;We understand your history; we understand your problem and are on your side&rdquo;.  That is the one thing we most manifestly have never been prepared to say, that in the conflict between the Nicaragua and the Government of the United States we will not say to the people of Nicaragua who have suffered so much that we are on their side.</P>
      <P>That is what diplomatic exchange of ambassadors and diplomatic recognition is about.  It is about the symbolic statement by one formerly oppressed people, that we are on the side of another people who are struggling to be free.  That is what our Government, both this Government and their predecessor, have been afraid to do because Big Brother in Washington would not approve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a change and no less sincere for the change.  What surprised me a Chathaoirligh, about what the Minister said today was not so much what he said &mdash; which you could not argue with, <Col N="777" /> because he said nothing &mdash; but what he left out, which is important.  What he left out has been touched on very forceably by Senator Ryan in his speech: the Minister did not say anything about the Contras. What he did not say was that he condemned specifically the Contras in Nicaragua and all they were doing.  What he did not say was that he condemned United States policy in Nicaragua.  It is very easy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong of Senator Ross to bring in red herrings here.  The Minister said specifically that we accord to Nicaragua co-operation and that we and our partners have frequently expressed support for cessation of outside aid to irregular forces or insurrectionist movements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  That is exactly the point that I have been making.  If the Leader of the House had not interrupted me I would have more time.  I want to hear him specifically condemn United States policy and not hide behind general language, not hide behind the EC, not hide behind the UN.  What I want to hear him say, and what I would like to have heard him say in this House, was quite specifically that the Irish Government disassociates itself from United States Central American policy.  That is what I want to hear.  I do not want to hear this sort of language and I do not want to hear this sort of thing: &ldquo;The Government share the interest and concern for the welfare of all the people&rdquo;.

What I do not want to hear from the Minister is statements like &ldquo;the Government share the interest and concern for the welfare of all the people of Central America which is widespread in this country.&rdquo;  It means nothing. It means absolutely nothing.  What I do not want to hear from the Minister is things like, &ldquo;What is important is to advance and reinforce the impulses arising within the region itself which tend to a settlement of its problems by peaceful means&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot put the question just because somebody does not like what Senator Ross is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister went on to say that it is not normal practice to comment &mdash; and I may be slightly wrong in the quotes &mdash; on diplomatic relations with a particular country.  This is one of the points which we have just been trying to emphasise.  It is most important that the Minister and the Government should be accountable for foreign policy in general and in detail.  It is very wrong that the Minister should be able to come to this House and say &ldquo;We do not answer specific questions on specific diplomatic relations or specific foreign policy&rdquo;.  That is exactly why the Independents and nearly all the parties in this House have found it important and necessary to set up a foreign affairs committee because we are continually being met by lack of accountability in these issues.  I would have preferred if the Minister had told us specifically why but had not said, &ldquo;Sorry, we do not do it&rdquo;.  I do not know why he has to say that.</P>
      <P>The Minister predicted quite rightly one of my comments on what he had to say.  I think it is a pity that the Minister has come to us twice today and the basis of both his speeches has been that we support EC and UN motions.  That, to me, is not very brave, it is not very independent, it is not very courageous and it certainly carries very little weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am beginning to wonder whether I was wrong in supporting the Single European Act and whether those who said that its passage would compromise our neutrality were not right.  Because, while having been enthusiastic about it and having believed that this was not the case at the time, I see very little evidence of an independent stand of any sort from this Government in regard to foreign policy.  Indeed I, see in the Minister's <Col N="780" /> reply today a great deal of welcome for the fact that we do have the EC to rely on.  It is something which I regret because I genuinely believed, and I still hope, that maybe our neutrality did mean something, that maybe those who made such a loud noise about our neutrality meant it.  However, I am beginning to believe that it served political purposes at the time but had absolutely no genuine use in practice.  That is what I am beginning to believe.  What it does not mean is muteness.  It does not mean saying nothing.  Neutrality, if it means anything, means being positive; it means sticking up as we did this afternoon on the Soviet Union; it means, regardless of great powers, sticking up for human rights.  It means saying to America, &ldquo;This is wrong&rdquo; when this is wrong and saying it without fear.</P>
    <P>What I would like to see is a coherent policy on embassies and on diplomatic relations.  What I do not see is any consistency in what the Minister said or what anybody on the Fianna Fáil side has said. Whatever the quibble about the record is from Senator Haughey, the main defence and the argument against and in opposition to this motion was that it could not be justified on commercial reasons.  That was the argument that was made by Senator Haughey.  The details I do not know about.  If those are the reasons why we open and close diplomatic relations, let the Minister say so.</P>
    <P>I will make a suggestion to the Minister. First, nobody on this side of the House suggested that it was a precondition to this motion that we set up an embassy.  I wish people would not have talked &mdash; and I hope not deliberately &mdash; on that side of the House about setting up an embassy.  We did not suggest it. We deliberately did not put that down because it would have given too easy an &ldquo;out&rdquo; to the Government.  We asked for diplomatic relations.  Diplomatic relations, as the Minister knows, can mean non-residential diplomatic relations.  What I did not see from the <Col N="781" /> Minister or anybody else on that side of the House was a costing of that.  I suggest it would be very small.  If it is very small, which it must be, then it is an obligation on me to suggest how it should be paid for.  I think that is right.</P>
    <P>What I suggest to the Minister is: that we no longer continue non-residential diplomatic relations with Libya and we open them with Nicaragua.  Presumably the cost will be vaguely equal and we have a good deal better reason to have diplomatic relations with Nicaragua than to have them with Libya and the cost will then be paid.  What I do not see is any consistent thought or reasons running through the Department of Foreign Affairs for opening embassies or diplomatic relations.  The cost argument could go if you close down one like Libya who is no friend to this country.  Do I get to ask the Minister a question at the end?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, I want to say that in many ways the opening of diplomatic relations would be symbolic.  Yes.  The material effects might not be great but it would be symbolic.  It would be saying, Yes, Ireland in its foreign policy is not only independent in name but is independent in fact, that Ireland is prepared to do things which the United States of America does not wish it to do, that Ireland condemns in unequivocal form <Col N="782" /> the policy of the United States Administration in funding the terrorists in Nicaragua. That is what it means.  It may not have any great material effect, but we are not talking about commerciality in this particular area.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Minister has turned down a great chance, when a new Administration is coming in in America, to tell them that the eyes of the world are upon them in respect of this disastrous policy in Central America, and that the Irish Government, regardless of what the EC say, which we seem to be so concerned about, disapprove of it and will show this by opening diplomatic relations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise the very important and serious case of Fr. Paddy Ryan of Rossmore, Goolds Cross, County Tipperary, who is at present in the prison of St. Gilles in Brussels awaiting a decision from the Belgian Minister for Justice to a formal request from the British Government for Fr. Ryan's extradition on the by now infamous charge of conspiring to murder persons unknown.  If it is in order, my colleague, Senator Tony McKenna from North Tipperary, has intimated that he wishes to be associated with supporting this motion and I hope there will be sufficient time to allow him to speak about this case.</P>
      <P>As a result of this request from the British authorities, Fr. Ryan decided, after careful consideration, to go on a hunger strike in the knowledge and the belief, and from public references to similar charges preferred against other Irish citizens in Great Britain, that the likelihood of his receiving a fair trial on such an emotive charge was very slim indeed. It does not please me, as somebody who abhors everything the Provisional IRA stand for, to have to put that type of comment on the record of this House.  It is a fact, and anybody who has read all or even part of what has been published by the English media since this case began in Belgium, will realise that there would be a very slim chance of Fr. Ryan getting a fair trial if he is extradited to Britain on this type of charge because already he has been found guilty by some of the English Press and media on facts which are not sustainable.</P>
      <P>Fr. Ryan's family, in particular his brother Joe Ryan and his wife, and Fr. Paddy's sister, have visited Fr. Ryan in this Belgian jail.  Visiting there is extremely restricted because Fr. Ryan has been in solitary confinement for up to 22 hours a day since he was imprisoned.  I want to place on the record of this House my appreciation of the help that has, at my request been extended to the Ryan family, by the Minister and by officers in his Department of Foreign Affairs who have helped, by their intervention, and ensured that Fr. Ryan's family had proper facilities for a personal visit to Fr. Ryan to discuss with him in detail the full implications of continuing his hunger strike.  Fr. Ryan has accepted the consular assistance offered to him by our Embassy in Belgium.  It is appropriate that credit should be given to the Department for their interest and their recognition of the seriousness of this case involving an Irish citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely concerned that Fr. Ryan's hunger strike, which today is entering its 21st day could lead to a very serious deterioration in his health and could lead eventually to his death, particularly as this priest is already suffering <Col N="785" /> from malaria which he contracted during his 15 years in the service of the foreign missions in Africa.  I am told by his brother that he has lost up to two stone in weight, and because of that his age and the fact that he is suffering from this dreaded disease contracted on the missions while he was with the Pallotine Fathers, I am extremely conscious of how important every day is.</P>
    <P>During his time as a missionary in Africa, he was identified with political leaders, with the poor, the needy and the oppressed.  We know that oppression in parts of Africa can be economic and political. We are all acutely aware of the level of political oppression in parts of Africa.  It came as no surprise to anybody in Tipperary when this priest returned to Ireland to retire after an extended period in the missions.  He visited the North and he saw at first hand the deprivation caused for families when the breadwinners are jailed for political offences. The political situation in the North has led other strong Church leaders to appeal in this case, and they have even criticised the system which leads to deprivation for the dependants of people who are imprisoned for long periods.  Every other day we have comments from leading Church figures like Fr. Wilson, and as late as this morning when on our national airwaves Fr. Faul gave a lengthy interview dealing with prisoners and their dependants in the North.</P>
    <P>It is nothing new for a priest, particularly a priest who like many of us considered himself a Nationalist, to have an interest in people who are underprivileged and oppressed politically. These are the same people Fr. Ryan would have given his time, and had given his time, to help by funding them and by fund raising for them in Ireland and throughout Europe.  I am sure he has often condemned the British authorities in the North of Ireland in particular and many of the sentiments he expressed have been echoed by all of us and by many other people in all political parties <Col N="786" /> in the south of Ireland in particular.  None of these comments would ever, we consider, warrant a request from the British jurisdiction for our extradition.</P>
    <P>All of us would admit that if Fr. Ryan has been guilty of anything it is of issuing statements in condemnation of the British authorities for some of the actions in the North of Ireland.  These statements would be re-echoed by many of us and, certainly, by all the political parties in this country.  None of these statements, we would consider, would warrant a request by the British Government for our extradition.  We must bear in mind also that a previous Irish Government made funds available through the Houses of the Oireachtas to help the very same people for whom Fr. Paddy Ryan has been fund-raising.</P>
    <P>However, he was arrested in Belgium on 3 June for offences which, to my knowledge and my information, have been dropped by the Belgian authorities. We would contend, and have argued &mdash; and he has agreed &mdash; that if the Belgian authorities believed that he had a case to answer for offences committed in Belgium, Fr. Ryan was prepared to stand trial in that country on them.  When he was arrested and these offences were read out against him, both the British and Irish authorities at that time stated publicly that they had no interest whatsoever in Fr. Paddy Ryan.  Then, three months after his arrest the British authorities sought extradition on conspiracy charges based on suppositions and generalities.</P>
    <P>I saw a copy of the original extradition warrant and the grounds that were shown on that warrant were <i>associé des malfaiteurs</i> which, translated roughly into English would mean &ldquo;associating with undesirables&rdquo;.  Any of us who know anything about the role of a priest in difficult circumstances know that they all deal with undesirables of one kind or another, whether they are drug addicts, alcoholics, drop-outs or whatever.  I do not think any of us could condemn a priest for being <Col N="787" /> involved with people, particularly those in need.  However, he was represented, when the case was presented, by three eminent Belgian lawyers, Georges' Henri Beauthier, Jacques' Hamaide and Luk Walleyn.  He was also represented by Martine Schemama from Paris, Lord Gifford and Michael Fisher from England and Mr. Elio Malocco from Dublin. Quite a number of eminent lawyers have taken on his case on the basis and the principle of common justice and they have, I think proven their case through the actual procedure, which is not a legal procedure in the Belgian context, but is a type of forum which considers the application from another member state of the European Community.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge this forum recommended a particular course of action in the case of Fr. Ryan.  The original application has since been changed by the British Government to a charge on which it is most difficult to prove one's innocence and that is the charge of conspiracy to murder persons unknown.  The panel which have considered this British request have refused Fr. Ryan political asylum.  I believe that they have recommended to the Belgian Minister for Justice not to accede to the British request for extradition.  I now respectfully request, and hope that the House would agree with me, that the Minister should use his good offices with the Belgian Government directly to intervene and express our wishes in this very serious case.  I am suggesting this type of formal action because it is not a court procedure and would not be considered as intervening in the jurisdiction of another country since the decision finally about Fr. Ryan on the application will be made at a political level in the Belgian Parliament.</P>
    <P>The wishes that I have expressed here have been subscribed to by all political parties in South Tipperary and by elected representatives from North and South Ridings in Tipperary at a recent joint <Col N="788" /> meeting of the two county councils and all other local authority bodies in the area.  Unless Fr. Ryan is charged or found guilty of an offence committed in Belgium &mdash; for which we accept he should stand trial &mdash; we want this Irish priest freed and returned home to his family and his friends.  I hope the Minister can assure this House that he will try to assist us in our efforts.  I have used every possible means at my disposal to forward this cause.  This week the International Secretariat of the Labour Party, which is associated with the Socialist group in Europe, are using their good offices to try to intervene at that level; but I think it is more appropriate that Government-to-Government communication should take place about our wishes for the return to Ireland of Fr. Paddy Ryan from Rossmore, Co. Tipperary.  With that I will allow my colleague, Senator McKenna, to contribute.</P>

      <P>Very briefly I want to support Senator Ferris on this motion. He has outlined in detail the history of this case so far and the plight of Fr. Paddy Ryan and I am not going to go into details again.  I want to reiterate his expression of thanks and gratitude to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State and indeed the Department of Foreign Affairs for the interest that they have taken in this case to date and the efforts they have made to resolve this tragic situation. If only on humanitarian grounds I think it is very important that this situation would be resolved as quickly as possible.  That a priest should be on hunger strike for such a long period of time must be a worry to everybody.  As Senator Ferris quite rightly said, the people of Tipperary, both north and south, are very concerned about it.  I would like to add my voice to urge the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs to do everything in their power to resolve this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Ferris has said, the big difficulty in relation to the extradition <Col N="789" /> sought by the British is that it would appear that he has already been tried in the British media.  It is extremely difficult to counter that type of propaganda.  As he quite rightly says, if there is a case Belgium, then let it be so.  It is extremely important that every effort be made as soon as possible to try to remedy this tragic situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a word also simply because Fr. Ryan comes from my area.  I know him and all his family.  I endorse what has been said by the other speakers.  I feel satisfied that our Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs have done as much as anybody could possibly do in this case.  I feel that eventually what has been done by Foreign Affairs will bear fruit.  There is a lot of talk about the British wanting to extradite him but, as I understand it, he has first to be charged by the Belgian authorities with some offence that he is supposed to have committed there; until that is dealt with the British move for extradition cannot go ahead.</P>
      <P>We condemn British justice, but after all, Britain and Ireland are about the only two countries where people are innocent until they are found guilty and keeping people in prisons for maybe a year or two or three years without trial is most unfair. I hope that does not happen in the case of Fr. Ryan.  I hope that the man will have sense enough to go off the hunger strike because while he is on hunger strike he is not going to get very much sympathy. A lot of people think that by going on hunger strike you get the sympathy of the people; you do not any more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank Senator Ferris, Senator McKenna and Senator Ryan for the manner in which they have put their case and for the opportunity that it gives me to reply.  As Senator Ferris has stated, Fr. Ryan is an Irish citizen, was arrested <Col N="790" /> in Belgium in June.  Our embassy in Brussels have been informed by the public prosecutor in the case that he faces charges in Belgium of forming part of a criminal association, the use of a false passport, public use of a false name and breach of the laws on explosives.  Unlike Senator Ferris, my information is that these charges have not been dropped. We understand also, as mentioned by Senator Ferris, that the British authorities have sought Fr. Ryan's extradition to the United Kingdom to face charges in that jurisdiction.  Both issues are under consideration by the relevant legal authorities in Belgium.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs have been aware of this case since Fr. Ryan's arrest and have provided him and his family with the normal consular assistance. Is such cases our principal consular responsibilities are to ensure that an Irish citizen facing criminal charges has, if he requires it, access to a diplomatic or consular mission, is aware of the charges being brought against him, has an opportunity to take legal advice and to have legal representation, is brought to trial without unnecessary delay and is aware of appeal procedures and has access to them.  Our embassy in Brussels has taken steps to ensure that these responsibilities have been discharged in Fr. Ryan's case and to this end they have maintained contact with the Belgian Ministry of Justice, the prison authorities and the public prosecutor.  They have also provided the necessary assistance to Fr. Ryan's relatives and to his legal representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could I place on record my appreciation of Senator Ferris's remarks on the efforts of the Department's officials both in Dublin and in Brussels in this case. The First Secretary at our Embassy in Brussels visited Fr. Ryan yesterday.  As Senators will be aware, Fr. Ryan has not taken solid food since 3 November.  This was referred to by all the Senators who spoke.  I understand that he is seen by a <Col N="791" /> doctor each day and that in the circumstances he is in reasonably good health.</P>
    <P>Members of Fr. Ryan's family have also visited him in recent days.  As I have already indicated, the legal issues in this case are under consideration by the relevant Belgian authorities.  In so far as the charges in Belgian law are concerned, I understand that an investigation has been completed and that the relevant court will now consider whether or not to proceed to a criminal trial.  A decision in relation to this is not expected for some time.</P>
    <P>In so far as the request for extradition to the United Kingdom is concerned, I understand that the relevant court has prepared an option for the Minister for Justice and his decision is awaited. However, in the meantime Fr. Ryan's legal representatives have lodged an appeal in the Belgian courts in connection with the form and procedure of the United Kingdom extradition request.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> Senators will be aware that the legal issues in this case are matters of Belgian law and fall within the competence of the Belgian legal authorities.  In the light of this, the Government do not consider that it will be appropriate to intervene in the Belgian legal process, as suggested by Senator Ferris.  I would like to assure Senator Ferris and all Senators that all appropriate action will be taken to ensure that Fr. Ryan's rights in this case are protected.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister.  I have just learned the sad news that Fr. Ryan is going on hunger and thirst strike from 8 o'clock tomorrow which makes his situation most precarious.  I plead with the Minister to make the direct contact I have referred to in line with the procedures laid down as it is now even more urgent than when I began speaking.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24 November 1988.</P>
