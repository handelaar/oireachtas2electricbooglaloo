      <P>I have notice from Senator David Norris that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to resolve the anomaly whereby a visually handicapped student (name supplied) in receipt of a blind pension has had that pension reduced substantially as a result of the success in obtaining a higher education grant, thereby effectively preventing him from completing his education.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need to establish a pilot scheme for Teilifís na Gaeltachta because £0.5 million has been set aside from the national lottery by the Government since November last for this scheme.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Paschal Mooney of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of widespread concern about the increasing incidence of alcohol abuse, especially among the young, if the Minister for Health will consider introducing a &ldquo;health warning label&rdquo; on all alcoholic products similar to the <Col N="1782" /> health warning label which appears on cigarette packets.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Norris and O'Toole as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Norris's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator O'Toole may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule that the matter raised by Senator Mooney is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds that it would involve legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to take Items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 and to take Item No. 5 between 4 o'clock and 5 o'clock. Because of the interest that has been shown in Item No. 5, I suggest that we restrict speakers to ten minutes maximum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy that we are taking Item No. 1.  Last week I suggested that we might do something like this but the Leader of the House assured me categorically that there was no need to and that we could take all Stages of the Bankruptcy Bill.  I am glad that he has made a further U-turn which will expedite this legislation through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Item No. 2, at the request of our spokesman on agriculture I ask that only the Second Stage be taken today and that the remaining Stages be taken later in the week.  Throughout the <Col N="1783" /> session, on the Order of Business the Leader of the House has told us that he has no objection to taking the motion on Northern Ireland before the end of the session.  I would like to ask him if this is still his intention and if he can give an assurance on that matter.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to congratulate Senator Jimmy Mulroy on his election as Mayor of Drogheda last evening.</P>

      <P>During the last three or four days I was twice assured, on information emanating from the Whip's office, that Second Stage and the remaining Stages of the Tobacco Bill would be taken on today's Order of Business but suddenly I find this is not so.  This change of mind is bewildering and very inconvenient. Of course, it is not the first time it has happened.  It does not inspire confidence in the competent ordering of business in this House by the Government side.  If I may anticipate an objection by the Leader of the House to the effect that the appropriate Minister is not available, I would not find that very convincing since in the past frequently we have been fobbed off by Government representatives who were neither competent nor relevant to deal with the business and it appears that anything will do for the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a number of points on the Order of Business. The first point relates to what the Chathaoirleach said last week that two weeks holidays were long enough for anybody. Whether or not that is true, I believe there is unseemly haste on the part of the Government side of the House to shut down the business of legislation this week, or so I am led to believe even though I have not been so informed.  The Independent Group are totally opposed to any attempt to stop the business of legislation when we have so much important work in front of us and a full Order of Business.  I want to get an assurance from the Leader of the House that he <Col N="1784" /> has no intention of finishing business this week.</P>
      <P>Second, the Government have not tabled any Private Members' motions this week.  I want to make our position on this absolutely clear.  There is an agreement between the Whips of the groups that Private Members' Business will be taken on a weekly basis and a set number of hours will be allotted for it.  If Fianna Fáil do not have anything important enough to discuss this week during Private Members' Business that is fair enough, but I want it to be clearly established that thy will lose their right to table Private Members' Business in two weeks time.  I want to be absolutely clear on this point. There is an agreement between the Whips and the Cathaoirleach has said regularly that these matters should be sorted out between the Whips of the various groups.  This is a matter on which there is agreement and on which a change has taken place without consultation. With regard to the Companies (No. 2) Bill, for almost a year the Leader of the House has referred time and time again to the need to get through this legislation. I think the world outside is fast becoming removed from us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking on the Order of Business and I will not be shouted down by the Leader of the House.  I believe it is unnecessary for him to interrupt at this stage.  A Chathaoirligh, I understand why you would be embarrassed about the ordering of the business for the week because of the way he has tried to do it.  He assured me in this House time and time again that the Companies (No. 2) Bill would be taken. I want to question the assurances given by the Leader of the House time and again that the Companies (No. 2) Bill would be dealt with and disposed of during this session.  It now appears that it is not even ordered for this week and it certainly is not ordered for today.  I am <Col N="1785" /> sick and tired of referring to this Bill and I am determined that the Fianna Fáil Senators will once more walk through the lobbies today to go down on the record as being opposed to the taking of the Companies (No. 2) Bill.  It might have escaped their notice that insider trading&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some Senators feel that because the other House is not sitting we are all on holidays.  I want to assure them that life goes on irrespective of whether the other House is actually formally sitting. I do not think the comment that we are here is relevant.  All of us have busy lives, as public representatives, whether or not the House is sitting and the media should be aware of that fact as well.</P>

      <P>Those involved in the music business are in a different world. On the Order of Business, I understood the Minister for Health to say, on Second Stage, that he was available today to resume the Second Stage and take Committee Stage of the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection Bill), 1988. Perhaps the Leader of the House would advise us as to what has happened to the Minister for Health and his intentions to be here today.  On the Companies (No. 2) Bill I also understood that we were to debate it further before adjourning for the summer recess and that we would be returning to complete that Bill before the Dáil reassembled.  I am not aware of any changes in that arrangement of business. If there are perhaps I could be informed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to calm the atmosphere somewhat it would be appropriate if the Leader of the House could indicate <Col N="1787" /> when it is proposed to resume the Committee Stage of the Companies (No. 2) Bill and how many sections it is proposed to take before the summer recess.  In a calm atmosphere perhaps we can establish those facts and then decide what action we will take.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by my colleague, Senator Joe O'Toole, if it is true that no motion will be put down in the name of the Fianna Fáil group.  The reason I express this concern is that repeatedly, the Leader of the House has referred people like myself who wanted to move certain important matters up on the Order Paper to the fact that we had Private Members' time in which to do it.  It does seem to be extraordinarily cavalier if the Government side are maintaining that the membership are so devoid of ideas that they are politically bankrupt to the extent that they cannot afford one motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I will move on to the second item just remarking, as I do so, that it is insulting to those of us on this side of the House who do try to put down substantial motions in Private Members' time to be treated in this manner.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House for an indication as to whether it is the intention of the Government to introduce, through this House, an equality of treatment Bill.  Like all other Members of this House I have been greatly concerned by reports that appeared in the newspapers yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be possible to get an indication.  The reason I ask this is that, not only are we apparently falling behind in business for this House, but we <Col N="1788" /> are actually in violation of our responsibilities towards the European Community by not passing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader of the House will give us an indication anyway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the confusion on the Order of Business it would be helpful if the Leader of the House would indicate not just when the Committee and remaining Stages of the Companies (No. 2) Bill will be taken but also what the programme is for the remainder of this week, in what order the legislation will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, may I clear the air somewhat?  There is no confusion about the Order of Business.  The Order of Business for today is: Items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5.  We will take Item No. 5 between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m.  There is absolutely no confusion there.</P>
      <P>Red herrings, being introduced for whatever purpose, will not be replied to. I will reply to the points made.  I am giving no assurance to anyone as to what business will be taken, or when it will be taken, except that, between now and the end of the session, we will take Items Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.  I cannot say when we will take these items. All I can say is that we will sit until 11 o'clock this evening and that we will get as much business done as is possible between now and 11 p.m.  We have wasted quite enough time on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question raised about Item No. 2, I should say that we will not take all Stages of Item No. 2; we will take Second Stage today and will take Committee and Report Stages on a date to be set but it will be before the end of this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions have been raised about the <Col N="1789" /> Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Bill, 1988.  That Bill will be taken this week; I will give that guarantee. Questions have been asked also about Private Members' time.  There is no cavalier attitude being taken by me or by anybody else.  I regret to have to say that there was an inference in the remarks of both Senators Norris and Joe O'Toole that we do not put down substantive motions.  The business of this House is to get legislation through.  We will decide what is put on the Order of Business regarding motions in our name and when they are taken.  Nobody can say, other than ourselves, when these items will be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Far better that they be dealt with than nothing at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two Senators raised questions about the Tobacco Bill.  We will be taking that Bill.  More than likely it will be taken tomorrow but we shall see what business we get through today. Senator Joe O'Toole was shouting a lot about holidays.  I did not give any indication as to when we were going on <Col N="1790" /> holidays or whether we would have holidays. All I am saying is that we will conclude today's business at 11 o'clock tonight.  I do not think there was any other question deserving an answer.  I should like to join Senator Manning in congratulating Mayor Mulroy.</P>

      <P>That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, in view of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the Second Stage of the Bankruptcy Bill, 1982 having been taken on the 10th July, 1984, on the referral of the Bill to the then Joint Committee on Legislation pursuant to the then Order of the House of the 29th July, 1983,</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the Committee Stage having been taken in that Joint Committee pursuant to the then Order of the House of 7th July, 1983,</P>
      <P>the Second and Committee Stages of the Bankruptcy Bill, 1982 be waived and the Bill be set down for Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The purpose of putting down the Bill for Report Stage is in effect to restore it to the Order Paper or to the stage it had reached in the previous Seanad.  For technical reasons the usual procedure for restoring Bills under Standing Order 101 could not be used and this motion is in substitution for that procedure.  The other House took the Bill on Report Stage and the Seanad is only being asked to do the same.  To facilitate Senators I have arranged for a report of the proceedings of the former Joint Committee on Legislation and the debates of the committee on the Bill, nine in all, to be made available in the Seanad Office.  The House must agree that this is the proper procedure to take since this Bill has been around since 1962.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to support this motion for a number of reasons. First I support it because the matter in the Bill is important.  This will be the first major reform of the bankruptcy laws in this country in over 100 years.</P>
      <P>The history of the Bill is a classic example of how public business should not be done.  The reports upon which this Bill are based appeared in 1962.  It was not until 1982 that the legislation itself was published and it languished for a number of years until the last Government, because of the complexity of the Bill, referred it to a special committee, a subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Legislation.  I had the honour to chair that committee and throughout a year and a half the all-party joint committee debated this Bill in great detail.  It was a very good example of the sort of care and attention which can be given to legislation in a committee of this sort.  There were extremely high level contributions from very many people and at the end of the day the Minister was in a position to accept many of the amendments made and the legislation as it left committee certainly was good and very much improved on the original draft.</P>
      <P>The important point is that this legislation was very adequately and comprehensively debated by members of all parties from both Houses in that joint committee.  It certainly would not be appropriate at this stage to go back to Second Stage of this Bill, as it has about 160 sections of complicated and urgent legislation.  It is with enthusiasm that I support the move today to restore it to the Order Paper on Report Stage.  I look forward to a full debate at that point.  The legislation is urgent and I look forward to seeing it on the Statute Book as we have waited long enough for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the device of taking complicated Bills in Joint Committees is one which this Government and both Houses could look at with great profit.  If the Companies Bill had been referred to a special committee we would have made <Col N="1793" /> more progress.  Although the cause of the delay does not lie in this House &mdash; it lies with the Government Department &mdash; nonetheless it is the proper forum within which to debate complicated legislation of this kind.  I commend to the Government the idea that they might look hard at the use of this mechanism.  I also commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and in doing so I congratulate Senator Manning on his procedural vigilance in this matter.  It is a compliment to him as a past chairman of the committee and to the members who discussed this Bill at length.  Could I have an indication from the Whip, who is now acting Leader of the House, as to when Report Stage of this Bill will be taken?  Report Stage is a very limited procedure for the Members of the Oireachtas, we cannot have a full and frank discussion as each member is allowed to speak only once.  I have some reservations in dealing with legislation of this nature as a general principle, particularly as the Labour Party are a small group in this House and by their composition may not be privileged to sit in the Committee Stages of some of this legislation.  Our ability to contribute on Report Stage will be very limited.</P>
      <P>However, I recognise all the work that has been done in this by Senator Manning's committee and I accept that this is how we should deal with the Bill.  Perhaps the acting Leader of the House could indicate when the Report Stage of this Bill will be debated?  Will it be on tomorrow's Order Paper?  I know it could not be on it today as this motion has to be passed, but perhaps we could have an indication when we might see the Bill?</P>

    <Col N="1794" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my appreciation to the House for making time available at rather short notice to discuss this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill involves the amendment and extension of the Córas Beostoic agus Feola Act, 1979, principally to confer on CBF responsibility for the promotion of pigmeat in addition to their existing functions in relation to cattle and sheep.</P>
      <P>For some time the Government had been concerned that the pigmeat industry was not developing to the extent possible. Outmoded plants with low throughput were a common feature.  This was seen as one of the great weaknesses in the sector.  A major development and rationalisation plan for the industry is at present underway.  This programme, which runs for five years, involves a total investment of £140 million, including substantial State and FEOGA aid, towards improved slaughtering and processing facilities.  As many as eight central slaughtering units, each capable of handling at least 6,000 pigs a week and licensed to the highest European Community and US standards will be created.  These units will cater not only for their own needs but also for those of surrounding processing plants.  At present five units are in the course of phased construction and others are at planning stage.  A number of investments in processing facilities are also going ahead.  Already two plants are up to EC and USDA standards and more will come on stream.  Domestically, the Abbatoirs Act has gone through both Houses of the Oireachtas and will ensure the production of high quality meat, capable of competing with imports.  Regulations are being drawn up under the Abbatoirs Act at present and they will relate to structures.  Veterinary standards are being drawn up and it is hoped to have them in operation by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to ensure the success of this investment programme, optimum use of the new plant capacities is necessary.  This will require us to increase pig throughput from its present level of nearly 2.2 million pigs a year to about three million by 1992. <Col N="1795" /> The pig production group which was set up recently by the Minister for Agriculture and Food and which reported to the Minister in March looked at this question of increasing pig numbers having examined all areas of the pigmeat industry. A suggestion made by the group was that the manufacturing sector pay a bonus per additional pig supplied by producers. The manufacturing sector is now looking at this suggestion in the context of preparing detailed development programmes for individual plants.</P>
    <P>These programmes will be required to address the matter of encouraging additional pig numbers as well as covering the other important issues facing the future development of the industry.  I am looking forward to seeing these plans which are now due to be submitted.  The whole idea is that the plants are given very substantial and attractive grant aid, up to 75 per cent, and the onus will be on each plant to draw up a programme to ensure that they will have pig numbers up to 6,000 per seek which will be the minimum required for the optimum use of the facilities concerned.</P>
    <P>Expanding pig output is, of course, only the beginning.  The additional output must be marketed and disposed of profitably.  While the industry itself must put in the main effort in marketing, it is important that it has the right promotion back-up.  For some time past no central agency has had responsibility for promotion or marketing of pigmeat.  CTT have of course provided very valuable assistance to individual pigmeat plants in their export operations.  However, the Government have been conscious of the need to co-ordinate meat promotion activities as much as possible within one organisation.  We believe that CBF which have been doing such fine work in promoting beef and lamb on both the home and export markets are the most appropriate vehicle for taking on the promotional role for pigmeat and all other meat products as well as pigmeat.</P>
    <P>The success of CBF in relation to their existing portfolio is widely recognised. Recently I was delighted to participate <Col N="1796" /> in a symposium which was held outside Dublin.  I would encourage a number of our State organisations to have a look at other locations around the country to see some of the fine facilities we have.  In this case they did not quite go to Cork but they went to the next county which is Kerry.  This international symposium organised by CBF had representatives from each of the continents representing 18 different countries.  The expertise and professionalism was superb and was commented on most favourably by people from all continents.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to meet some of the biggest corporations in the food industries around the world who saw Irish people not only promoting meat but giving a tremendously positive image of Ireland as a country that had a very sophisticated level of communication.  I would encourage a number of other State organisations based in Dublin to look at locations outside Ireland because not alone are they doing a good job for their particular industry but they are doing a tremendous job for the image of the country as a whole.  I am sure my colleague, Deputy Wilson, from a tourist point of view would be very glad to see some of the idyllic spots around Ireland shown off to best advantage on these occasions.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt but that CBF will be equally successful in the pigmeat area on both the home and export fronts.  The home market will continue to be very important, accounting as it does for 70 per cent of output at present.  Adequate promotion is essential if the potential for domestic sales is to be fully exploited while also ensuring that the Irish industry is in a position to compete effectively at home with imports from some other member states of the Community. However, development of export outlets will be the most crucial marketing task in promoting the expansion of the pigmeat sector.  CBF's major input will have to be in this area of promotion and marketing both on the home and export fronts.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for the introduction of a levy by CBF of 20p per pig.  This will generate income to CBF of about <Col N="1797" /> £400,000 in a full year.  In addition, a further £400,000 has been transferred from the grant-in-aid of Córas Tráchtála Teo to CBF for 1988.  In-so far as the existing CBF levies are concerned, it is proposed to increase the rates of £1 and 10p for cattle and sheep respectively to £1.50 and 20p.  This is being done to meet the unanimous views of the board of CBF who consider that these increases are necessary to enable the body to expand and develop their promotional activities. Total levy income, including that from the proposed levy on pigs, will then be about £3-4 million, annually, compared with £1.9 million at present.  That should be viewed against our total exports which are in the region of £1 billion, so that a figure of £3.5 million is really minimal in that context.</P>
    <P>Provision is also being made in the Bill to increase the number of ordinary members of the board of CBF from nine to 11.  This will enable the pigmeat industry to have appropriate representation on the board.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that I am making provision in the Bill for the brief of CBF to be further extended by Ministerial order to other meats at a later stage, should this be considered desirable.  I am thinking particularly of poultry meat.  Poultry meat exports have developed considerably in the past few years with particularly encouraging trends in added value trade.  Exports of poultry meat were worth over £11 million last year, about 90 per cent of which were in added value products.</P>
    <P>The poultry meat industry is a headline for the other meat areas in their added value products.  As far as the poultry meat industry is concerned, the consumer comes first and they tailor-make their products to suit the consumer.  I think this has had a tremendous effect on value added.  There is further scope for increasing exports in this area.  With recent acquisitions by some of our more dynamic meat and food industries, I see tremendous opportunities in the area of poultry meat.</P>
    <P>On the domestic front there are also <Col N="1798" /> possibilities for increasing the home-sourced share of the poultry meat market.  Additionally, I think, there is a developing interest in venison and deer farming which has considerable potential. Venison will become an important meat product over the coming months and years.  There are a number of other alternative farm enterprises such as rabbit farming which I think have potential and will in due course become important. CBF will have a valuable role in promoting and marketing these meat products.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows for all CBF levies to be further increased by Ministerial order and this provision is in line with the existing situation for cattle and sheep levies. Any such orders in relation to levels of levy or for extending the activities of CBF will, of course, require approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>CBF, as a statutory body, have been in existence now for almost ten years. During that time the main provisions of the enabling Act have remained unchanged.  However, there is always room for improvement and I am, accordingly, proposing certain changes and additions to the parent Act.  These are contained in sections 5 to 10 of the Bill and are designed either to improve the efficiency of CBF's levy collection system or to bring the provisions of the 1979 Act up to date.</P>
    <P>In general these sections increase the levels of penalties which may be imposed for contravention of the Act.  There will be a statutory obligation on firms to which the Act applies to keep records for four years; where firms fail to furnish appropriate returns &mdash; which in itself is an offence &mdash; CBF may, in such cases, estimate the amounts of levy due; officers of corporate bodies will, in future, be answerable, in addition to the body, for offences under the Act.  Lastly, the Board of CBF will be entitled to appoint authorised officers who may enter premises covered by the Act and inspect and take copies of records that may be necessary for determining the charging of a levy.</P>
    <P>In recent years CBF have restructured their staffing arrangements by reducing <Col N="1799" /> the number of headquarters staff so as to increase as far as possible the numbers of field personnel operating both on the home and export markets.  The measures contained in sections 5 to 10 of the Bill should greatly facilitate CBF in streamlining and making more efficient their levy collection procedures and thereby contribute to their efforts to reduce administration expenses to a minimum.</P>
    <P>I believe this measure is important in ensuring that our important meat trade is given the support it needs.  In the passage of this Bill through the Dáil it was supported by all sides of the House who were glad to see our meat and livestock trade getting additional support.  The measures here are supported by the board of CBF and by the main farming organisations.  I have, I think, touched on all the provisions of this Bill which I now commend to you.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Minister that on this side of the House we, too, support the general principles of the Bill.  The only difficulty we have about it is that we feel it does not go far enough. Judging by the size of the meat industry or the food industry in this country my party believe we spend far too little on promoting sales abroad and while this Bill is a step in the right direction it is only a small step in the right direction. In the long and medium term more needs to be done.  Anything that helps to strengthen the sale and promotion of Irish meat products abroad is to be welcomed and in so far as this Bill seeks to do that we certainly welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CBF are responsible, too, for the promotion of meat sales here on our domestic market.  We on this side of the House welcome particularly the extension of the remit or mandate of CBF to the pigmeat industry, that is the promotion of pigmeat on domestic and, more important, export markets.  This is a long overdue development.  Since the disappearance of the Pigs and Bacon Commission some years ago there has been a promotional vacuum in the pigmeat area which constituted a classical <Col N="1800" /> crazy situation.  In the past five years vast sums of money have been chanelled into the pig slaughtering and processing industry. In a relatively short time we have brought our capacity to process pigmeat up by one third by extending and modernising our plants yet, because of major gaps in our policy in planning, we find the number of pigs in the national herd barely stable, smaller than five years ago with every indication that they are contracting and becoming smaller during this year with further indications of continued decline next year in the following years. In fact &mdash; this may surprise the House &mdash; there has been no growth in pig numbers in this country since 1974.  In that year the national pig herd reached two million. The figures is about the same for 1988. Unlike in 1974, we have now the capacity to slaughter three million pigs annually, so we have a supply one third short of capacity to slaughter, process or manufacture. Obviously, something is radically wrong.</P>
    <P>It is argued that the numbers of people controlling the industry are too small and, therefore, a too complacent and cosy attitude towards expansion has grown up. This, of course, is to the detriment of the national income interest.  It is interesting to see that in Holland the expansion of pigmeat output in 1987 was almost exactly equal to the total output in Ireland.  In 1987 the Dutch processed 18 million pigs, two million more than in the previous year.  Ireland's total output to processing in 1987 was about two million animals.</P>
    <P>Looking closely at the industry here, you find that our breeding sector is fully in line in efficiency terms with that of the Danes and the Dutch, our major competitors. By this I mean the rate of bonhams bred from each breeding sow.  That sector is as efficient as our main competitors', but in the finishing sector, that is from bonham to slaughter stage, we lose out badly to our competitors.  The time taken here to market stage is much longer and feed conversion both in breeding stock and in pigs for market or export is much less efficient.  Many people remark that the Irish industry operates <Col N="1801" /> under certain disadvantages.  Indeed, other sectors of Irish agriculture operate at certain disadvantages <i>vis-á-vis</i> availability of sheep feed and feed substitutes. The Irish industry uses a great deal of whey for feed substitute which is not available to our competitors.  While in theory this should at least wipe out their advantage in cheaper feed components from abroad, it does not.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that we should move towards larger carcases.  The Dutch in particular have proved in recent years that there is a very large market and far better added value in producing a larger animal for slaughter, so the Irish industry should have a greater mix of larger animals for processing alongside our traditional smaller sized animal for Wiltshire size sides.</P>
    <P>I submit also to the Minister of State, and his Department should be promoting it, that the industry should be using artificial insemination for breeding purposes. Our competitors are all doing so, and so should we.  I make that point because it is argued widely that the root problems we have in relation to feed conversion rates are with our breeding.  Therefore, we suggest that AI be looked at as at least a part solution to that problem in the industry.</P>
    <P>While CBF do a tremendous job with their very limited resources, nobody can be satisfied that they are doing anything like what they could or should be doing in the national interest.  There is often a misunderstanding of the role of CBF. Many people believe they have an actual selling of product role, in other words they identify or find a customer and sell directly to him or her.  Of course, they do nothing of the sort.  Their role is purely promotional and advisory.  The actual selling of our meat product is done directly by the sales staff of our meat plants backed up by CBF's promotional work, advertising, market research etc.</P>
    <P>As is widely recognised, there has been a notable lack of emphasis by the Irish meat industry on marketing and or selling abroad.  There were and are reasons for this, very often not very good ones.  The reliance on intervention in this country <Col N="1802" /> was and is totally disproportionate and bad and is potentially disastrous.  Again, it is difficult to comprehend the readiness with which the industry took aboard the massively expensive upgrading and modernising of their plants costing million of pounds, much of which was admittedly EC grant aid and IDA aid, while little enough emphasis or priority was placed on marketing or going to and capturing areas of market growth.  Too often instead the soft option of intervention was used.</P>
    <P>However, all that is changing.  Every year the Commission puts greater and greater pressure on the amount of beef into intervention.  Give us another three to five years and you may see intervention almost closed off except for the most exceptional cases.  In the light of this I do not believe CBF with their meagre resources or the industry with its weak marketing reputation and inclination towards the soft option of intervention between them will be able to cope with the close down of intervention stores. Notwithstanding falling cattle numbers in this country and the European market that will over the next five years be under-supplied &mdash; that is totally unique in the recent history of the European common market.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to that slight pause I was making the point that the European meat market over the next five years will be under-supplied and this country, because of the weakness of our promotional board for one thing, will be in no great position to take up the opportunities that will be offered to us.  CBF receive less than £1 million in direct State subvention which, incidentally, is only about 20 per cent of their total running cost, the rest coming from levies etc. It is against that background that this promotional body with a staff of no more than 30 to do everything on a meagre budget are given the task of promoting Ireland's greatest export product.</P>
      <P>Córas Tráchtála, on the other hand, will have a budget 20 times as great, and perhaps a staff ten times as great, and no doubt they need it.  They will use the resources they are given well, but one must question why we spend only about 0.2 per cent of the value of our meat exports promoting them on the markets where we sell them, while we spend closer to 2 per cent, or perhaps 3 per cent, of the value of industrial exports in promotion in the areas where they are sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment we sell about 40 per cent of exports of beef and lamb to what we call the continental EC &mdash; that is, the EC without the other major offshore island, the United Kingdom, 20 per cent <Col N="1804" /> to the United Kingdom, and about 40 per cent of our beef and lamb exports go to third countries, mostly in North Africa. All market analysis suggest that the growing market for us to target is mainland Europe.  Downward pressure of the quota restrictions has greatly reduced beef steer numbers throughout the continental EC, hence the growing shortage.  It is there our salesmen, our promoters, our advertisers and market researchers must be working aggressively, full-time to garner a greater corner of that market for the Irish product.</P>
    <P>Years ago the Danes cornered the market for pigmeat and bacon all over Europe, the Dutch, and to a lesser extent the French and the Swiss, the dairy products market, but Ireland, often with far better comparative advantage, made no mark whatsoever, or no market impact, in cornering a share of any of these lines. The only market we cornered, alas, was the live cattle exports to the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Now, all that is history and the situation we operate today is entirely different. It has changed fairly rapidly in the recent past, and it will change even more rapidly in the future.  By 1992 we will operate in a single barrier-free market with all its challenges and all its opportunities. To meet all the challenges and all the opportunities for the food export business, the resources, and indeed the role of bodies like CBF, will have to be greatly extended.  I would like to see one dynamic national promotional body to promote Irish food products, particularly in the export area, and here I mean, the promotion of all our main food export lines, including dairy and milk-derived products.</P>
    <P>I have been brief in my contribution today, because there is little controversial in this legislation, and, as the Minister knows, controversy leads to long-windedness. Basically, I and my party agree with the intent of the Bill, and we will not hinder its progress through this House.  We sincerely wish CBF every success and every good luck in the extension of their mandate to include the promotion of the pigmeat industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it opens up great opportunities for the beef meat industry, the sheepmeat industry and the pigmeat industry, which now comes under the ambit of CBF.  Over the years CBF have done a magnificent job marketing beef for the Irish farmers and have succeeded, to a great extent, in putting Irish beef on the tables of many housewives in Europe who otherwise could not have availed of this very high quality meat.  It is very important that we produce to the highest standards, that we have a product that is recognised on the European market, that we have a product for which there is great demand and which has great potential for development.</P>
      <P>CBF have done a great job marketing beef and sheepmeat.  Pigmeat has been the poor relation because CBF did not have responsibility for marketing pigmeat until now.  I hope they will set about marketing pigmeat with the same vigour and determination they have marketed beef and sheepmeat over the years.</P>
      <P>World and EC pigmeat consumption is growing by 2 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively.  There are opportunities in major European markets, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy, as well as Japan and the United States, as these countries are not self-sufficient in regard to this commodity at present.  Danish and Dutch companies are already well established in these markets. Around 80 per cent of Irish pigmeat is sold on the home market where competition is intense due to the lower cost of unlicensed plants undercutting the export licensed plants.  Competition on the home market will increase as it is now open to imports from Denmark and Holland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growth of the Irish pigmeat industry depends on the development of a number of large, efficient market-orientated companies that can protect the home market from imports and capture an increasing share of the export market. The growth in world pigmeat consumption, together with a well managed and efficient pig production sector in Ireland, is a sound basis on which to <Col N="1806" /> expand pigmeat exports.  By 1992, pigmeat exports can be increased by £100 million creating a demand for 900,000 extra pigs and providing in the region of 1,000 new jobs in processing and 500 in production and related activities within the processing sector.</P>
    <P>This offers great opportunities for the industry.  I hope the new board being set up by CBF can tackle that area and achieve the same success rate as they have achieved in marketing beef and sheepmeat.  There have been a number of weaknesses in the industry up to now. One of those weaknesses was that there was very little export market orientation or awareness in the industry.  The industry has traditionally produced bacon, which is a declining market segment, and will face increasing competition on the home market which is now open to imports.</P>
    <P>Another feature was the fact that Irish pig processing plants are too small.  The industry is dominated by mature low-profit companies and major capital expenditure is required to make the processing sector efficient and able to compete in export markets.  Pig production costs are also pushed up by the high cost of feed in Ireland.  This is an area which could be tackled by the new board, perhaps by subsidising the cost of feedstuffs or otherwise keeping costs down because the high cost of feedstuffs is the biggest problem pig producers face in trying to keep down costs.  The expansion of pig production is also hindered by the high entry costs at 300 sow level, an investment of £400,000.  High interest rates have also been militating against expansion in that area.</P>
    <P>These are some of the problems that the new board is faced with.  The experience in exporting beef and producing suitable products for the European market will help in tackling the pigmeat industry.  I believe they will succeed in developing a brand that will be recognised in foreign markets.  This was never achieved before.  Irish bacon did not get the recognition it was entitled to, particularly on the British market where most of our exports were going in the past. <Col N="1807" /> This was probably our own fault because we did not market it properly as did the Danes and the Dutch over the years.</P>
    <P>Increased levies are being imposed. While we all dislike an increase in levies, I believe it is necessary, and that those increases in levies will be accepted by the industry because they feel CBF will now be able to do an efficient job for them.  If the board is able to secure markets for beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat the producers will benefit in the long run. Nobody will begrudge paying those increased levies provided they get a better service and I believe they will get that from the new board which will be increased from nine to 11.  Again this is a good idea because it will give representation to the pigmeat industry. They will have their voice heard in the new board and be able to put forward ideas for the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Connor, I do not wish to delay the House.  We all realise the importance of this new legislation.  We are approaching 1992 with fear and trepidation in many areas of industry.  Here is one area where we do not need to have any fears.  We have the product; we have the means of producing the best meat in the world.  All that is required is to have an efficient marketing organisation to sell what we are producing.  This will be to the ultimate advantage of everybody in the country because it will create badly needed employment for our young people and a major source of income for the country and for individual producers within the country.  Anything that does that must be welcomed.  For that reason I welcome the legislation that is now introduced here and I look forward to great developments in the four years up to 1992.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to speak on the Bill.  I do not know a great deal about the subject, and such is my ingrained modesty that I would never dream of pontificating on things I know nothing about.  It occurs to me, having listened to the Minister and Senators Connor and Hussey, that I should express <Col N="1808" /> my own support of the measure.  I know enough about it to know that the agricultural economy is underdeveloped, and that it is our greatest potential.  No matter what fashionable talk there may be about developments in high technology and so on, the promise of real development in this country, the only ultimate hope of increasing employment substantially, as Senator Hussey suggested lies in development of the agricultural economy.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that this measure recognises and indeed proposes to promote the pigmeat section of that economy, a very important part of the economy, even though the pig no longer occupies the pivotal place he held in the 19th century for the Irish smallholder &mdash; the gentleman who paid the rent.  I am nonetheless very glad to support this sensible and desirable measure.</P>
      <P>I also want to take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his performance in this Administration to date. I have watched his progress with great interest and, I may say, a pardonable pride.  There is no kick coming&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join, too, in <Col N="1809" /> Professor Murphy's tributes to the Minister of State in welcoming him to the House.  Not only is he a former pupil of Senator Murphy's but he also has a deep knowledge of the agricultural industry. He would be very familiar with the efforts today to promote in an even greater way our agricultural produce in the marketplace in Europe and the wider world. He is giving more powers to CBF to do that.  It is certainly something that I totally and wholeheartedly welcome.</P>
      <P>However, I would sound a serious note of warning in relation to agricultural production generally.  We are facing a crisis in relation to the supply of raw material, particularly in the beef sector.  This has not been recognised fully by the Government in drawing up a programme that could be put before the farming community and the producers of this country to ensure that we have sufficient raw material to satisfy the meat processing capacity that is so large here at the moment.  It is suffering from overcapacity, being underutilised to the detriment of the maximum benefit of the country and of creating maximum employment.</P>
      <P>Platitudes have been used over the past year and a half in relation to the generation of additional employment in the agricultural sector.  I hope we will see the raw material being produced more quickly in order to satisfy those employment opportunities in the meat processing sector right across the board, whether in dairying, beef or pigmeat.  I am very distraught about the future in relation to that matter.  The figures are startling when one considers the December 1987 livestock count.  We have lost 100,000 cows in the dairying sector over the last three years, since the introduction of the super-levy.  This brings about the enormous shortage in beef production that we have at the moment with prices being paid in the marketplace escalating out of all proportion.  The laws of supply and demand dictate that in a scarcity of produce and raw material one will get a higher price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Never was that more evident to the farming community than today.  People <Col N="1810" /> who invested heavily in cattle production are now finding the going extremely tough, to such an extent that they are not prepared to buy and feed cattle during the winter months in the hope of making a profit in the month of April.  That system is on the way out.  What we need is a radical plan to boost beef numbers. I am disappointed at the rate of progress to date and I take this opportunity to appeal to the Minister once again to put the necessary programme of action, which is so essential for the creation of employment and greater viability in the meat processing sector and in farming, in place.  Those objectives are so noble that we must put a radical plan in place as soon as possible.  Come 1992 with the opening up of all the opportunities which have been spoken about I would not like to see us as a nation fail and CBF not being able to guarantee the supply of raw materials and goods to those markets.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the remit of CBF to cover pigmeat.  As Senator Murphy has said, gone are the days when pig production was necessary to pay the rent in many farming households.  Particularly on mixed farms pigmeat formed part of the basic diet.  The tradition of killing the pig at Christmas has gone out of fashion.  For a long time that tradition was part and parcel of the way of life on many rural farms.  The housewife took it upon herself to nurture and feed the pig to the stage where when it was killed it took pride of place on the table.  That kind of pig production is now non-existent in this country.  We now have larger units and greater economy of scale but certainly the pigmeat industry has been treated during the years as a Cinderella industry and wrongly so in my opinion.  I hope the taking advantage of the new marketing opportunities which may be identified by CBF will lead to more stability in the pigmeat market.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State is aware, pigmeat producers have gone through a difficult time in recent years.  With the oscillations in the price of feed, which have now levelled off, they never knew what their profit margins would be if any. <Col N="1811" /> The return from their enormous investment and the time and effort they have put into their enterprises has been very small indeed.  I hope that with greater stability in the marketplace pigmeat production will be more viable in the future. There has been a number of closures of pigmeat units in recent months and in Threecastles a large pigmeat unit had to close down as a result of a difficult trading position, high energy costs and the lack of continuity in the price of raw material. Senator Hussey referred to the high cost of feed but during the last two years or so these costs have levelled out as have energy costs.  I hope that these costs will continue to fall and any reduction in costs, particularly for the pigmeat sector where margins are so tight, would be welcome.</P>
    <P>We must improve the quality of our pigmeat and the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, attempted to rationalise the pigmeat sector and decided to establish eight new units.  It was intended that the Department of Agriculture and the IDA would come together to draw up the standards that each of these eight units would have to comply with before they could obtain a licence to export pigmeat to the United States or other world destinations.  These have not been drawn up as yet.  I am particularly pleased that one of those units is going to be established at Graney in south County Kilkenny.  Work has now commenced and I hope that that plant, which is targeted for IDA and FEOGA assistance, will come into operation during the next 12 months and will export to the United States in particular where higher standards and quality are demanded.</P>
    <P>On a recent visit to the United States I was amazed that consumers, particularly on the east coast, of all the products they could receive from this country, demanded pigmeat products more than any other.  Here I am particularly speaking about rashers, bacon and sausages. The main difficulty is the continuity of supply and I hope that the CBF will seek to resolve these problems with the result <Col N="1812" /> that supermarket chains in the United States will do business with our pigmeat producers.</P>
    <P>The Government have not given enough attention to ensuring that the amount of money spent on marketing in particular sectors of the economy was increased.  With the build up to 1992, when new opportunities will open up to us, it is now more important than ever to put the emphasis on marketing.  We have many advantages over other member states and we need to exploit our clean image.  We do not need to produce more, rather to produce quality produce.  We must sell our clean image to the Europeans. The Minister for Agriculture and Food made a recent announcement on measures aimed at the control of pollution which will go a long way toward correcting the wrong image that some people hold and which could seriously jeopardise the export of many of our agricultural products.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to note that farmers in areas of intensive production, those areas outside of the disadvantaged areas, will not qualify for the higher level of grant which the Minister has boasted and gloated about in the media.  The areas where pollution control is most needed are those areas in which there is intensive production and those areas are outside of the disadvantaged areas.  It is not good enough to create a third border, with those in low lying and non disadvantaged areas being treated differently from those in disadvantaged areas, with a higher level of grant being paid to farmers in those areas.</P>
    <P>Following the incident at Chernobyl we were given the unique opportunity to exploit opportunities in the marketplace but we have not taken them in the way that we should have.  I hope the extension of the remit of the meat marketing board will result in not only continued expansion in traditional enterprises, such as the production of poultry and venison, but that the CBF will also assist in finding niches in the marketplace which are important to create alternative sources of income for many of our farmers today.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann salutes the contribution of Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress to the cause of freedom in South Africa and sends greetings to him on his 70th birthday on 18th July, 1988 and calls for his unconditional release from prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased to see this motion down for debate on the Order Paper today.  I am particularly gratified to be joined by so many colleagues representing every facet of political and independent life within this House.  All of those who signed this motion support it wholeheartedly. It is true to say that Nelson Mandela is a colossus, a world figure, but in South Africa, in particular he is a person who, despite the fact that he was locked away first on Robben Island and then in Pollsmoor Prison outside Pretoria, symbolises for freedom-loving people in Africa, South Africa and throughout the <Col N="1815" /> world, the spirit of freedom, tolerance and an end to oppression.  In the course of this motion today, I would like also to salute his wife, Winnie Mandela, who also is the spirit of the nation and who, outside prison, symbolises hope and all that Nelson Mandela stands for and who continues to give hope, courage and confidence in a rapidly deteriorating situation in South Africa.</P>
    <P>Although Nelson Mandela has been locked away for so many years, he continues to inspire all of those who wish to see an end to that vicious obscene oppression of apartheid in South Africa. It is only fitting that parliamentarians in this Chamber and, of course, the parliamentarians in the other House should salute his achievment, salute him on his 70th birthday and call at the same time for his unconditional release from prison.</P>
    <P>It is important to examine the fibre of the man and what went into making Mandela such an inspiring leader in South Africa.  His life was like that of so many black, deprived people in that country. He spent his childhood in the Transkei region of South Africa.  It is now one of the so-called Bantustands or separate States left in the wake of colonial conquest as a sort of reserve.  The adult residents there had little alternative to subsistence farming, or going to work in the distant white-owned mines, factories, and farms.  That, of course, is what Nelson Mandela did also.  He was more fortunate than many of the blacks in South Africa because he had an opportunity to avail of third level education and went to Fort Hare University in the Eastern Cape, one of the few universities at that time where Africans could study beyond seconday school level.  Even then his intense feeling against injustice was beginning to manifest itself and he was expelled from Fort Hare University in his third year for organising a student boycott of the student representative body after the authorities deprived it of its powers.</P>
    <P>In 1940, at the age of 22, he went to <Col N="1816" /> Witwatersrand University in Johannesbourg. While there, he lived in Alexandra township and had hands-on experience of urban poverty, of overcrowding, of the pass laws, of harassment and of the condition of the migrant workers in that squalid place called Alexandra Township.  In 1944 he joined the African National Congress and was a founder of its youth league which worked for more militant policies.  It wanted to see mass action, strikes, boycotts and civil disobedience, all in a certain Gandhian tradition of passive resistance to oppression.  It must be remembered that Mahatma Gandhi spent many years in South Africa before he became such a figurehead in his own country of India.</P>
    <P>In 1949 the African National Congress adopted a programme of action along the lines of the youth league and there was an historic campaign for defiance against unjust laws.  Nelson Mandela was one of 3,500 people arrested for deliberately breaking the laws enforcing segregation. For that he got a nine month suspended sentence.  He was then elected Transvaal regional president of the African National Congress and the Government served a barring order restricting him to the Johannesbourg area.  Together with Oliver Tambo, the current president of the African National Congress, Mandela set up a legal practice in Johannesburg and he and Oliver Tambo defied the Government, refusing to move their offices to a black township away from the city centre.  Of course, the vast majority of cases dealt with by Mandela and Tambo concerned victims of the apartheid laws.</P>
    <P>In 1955, the congress of the people was held at Kliptown near Johannesburg and 3,000 delegates attended.  There, an historic document was adopted unanimously by that conference called &ldquo;The Freedom Charter&rdquo; and today it is, if anything, more popular, more widely accepted.  It is certainly the very cornerstone of the liberation struggle in South Africa.  Mandela was still under banning order and was unable to be present at that historic adoption of &ldquo;The Freedom Charter&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" /> He was among 156 people arrested on 5 December 1956 and charged with treason. The trial that ensued lasted for four-and-a-half years.  By the time it ended, in March 1961, all the accused had been acquitted.  The charge of treason had not been proved.  Ten years of peaceful passive resistance came to an abrupt end in March 1960 with the Sharpeville massacre in which 69 people were killed and many wounded.  Africa, and South Africa in particular, was in a ferment.  All around the world there were expressions of horror at such an appalling incident of brutality.  That was a turning point and marked the end of peaceful and increasingly powerful mass protests which had been spearheaded by Nelson Mandela. Massive demonstrations ensued worldwide and the South African Government, as it is wont to do, declared a state of emergency.  Twenty thousand people were rounded up by the police and army, including Mandela, and the African National Congress and other bodies-were outlawed.</P>
    <P>In my remaining time I wish to put on record that freedom-loving people here, and elsewhere, revere Nelson Mandela. They understand, sympathise and feel for the oppression which he witnessed and the poverty and degradation which he experienced at first hand in his country, South Africa.  They understand his wish for a peaceful change, his inability to cope with the tightening screw of the apartheid regime which could not cope with the legitimate demands of the majority population in that country and which has consigned him to a life in prison.  He is there as a beacon of hope. Although he is locked away, although he cannot walk the streets of his beloved South Africa, and although he cannot issue statements, his spirit is with the South African people.  The force that he believes in and the force for good and peaceful change which he represents is very much alive and well in South Africa. Together with my colleagues in the Seanad I salute this giant of a man and send him best wishes.  I call on the South African Government, as a measure of the recognition of how people feel about this <Col N="1818" /> man, to release him unconditionally to mark his 70th birthday so that he can spend whatever years remaining to him in the company of his heroic wife, Winnie Mandela, and their family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to take up all the time allotted to me but I should like to join with Senator Bulbulia in issuing a call from the House to the South African Government that Nelson Mandela be released.  As Senator Bulbulia has said, Nelson Mandela in prison has retained the wish for freedom for his people and his wife, Winnie Mandela, has put into words what Nelson has not been able to say since he was incarcerated. Some of the teachers in my school, the De La Salle Brothers, spent many years in South Africa and as young students we were told in no uncertain terms about the apartheid system in South Africa.  Indeed, I can remember my son writing an essay for the De Le Salle Brothers in Waterford called &ldquo;Apartheid &mdash; A Crime Against Humanity&rdquo;.  There is no doubt that the sentiments expressed by that young mind have not changed.  I am sure we all want to see this great crime against humanity changed.  The people of South Africa, black and white, would benefit from changes in this cruel system.  Unless the white people in South Africa come to realise that they are going against the tide of history in maintaining this system they will be the victims of a wave of unrest such as we have not seen in South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The symbolism of what we are doing today &mdash; and it is purely symbolism &mdash; is important because if people in positions of power in Governments and States call for the release of Nelson Mandela and the abolition of the system of apartheid the South African Government will recognise that world opinion is against them.  The title of the recent film, &ldquo;Cry Freedom&rdquo;, is an excellent one for such a film but, equally, it is an excellent way to ask the South African Government to give freedom to Nelson Mandela and all the people who are suppressed in South Africa.  In the media we have read of experiences of people who have come <Col N="1819" /> under the jack boot and we have seen the rise of fascism over the past number of years in that unfortunate country.</P>
    <P>I wish to join with Senator Bulbulia in asking the South African Government to release Nelson Mandela and the people of South Africa from the burden of apartheid and all that is associated with it.  I should like to reiterate that it is a crime against humanity and if the South African authorities do not heed the cry for freedom from the black population they will be subsumed and problems will follow, not alone for the people of South Africa, but for people all over the world.  It gives me great pleasure to second the motion proposed by Senator Bulbulia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that Nelson Mandela is seen as the symbol of human rights and freedom not alone for his own oppressed black people in South Africa but, indeed, worldwide and I accept that he has been honoured internationally. He received the Nehru Award in 1979 and the Bruno Kreisky prize for human rights in 1981 and he has received numerous honorary degrees.  I certainly should be glad to see him set at liberty.  I do not agree with the criticism I have heard that motions of this kind are part of a fashionable and facile trend.  What gives me real cause for concern however, is that Nelson Mandela is also the personification of the African National Congress, some of whose policies and actions I find unacceptable and which, indeed, I must find unacceptable if I am to be consistent in my opposition to terrorism at home and abroad.  The parallels between some of the activities of the African National Congress and those of the IRA are too close for comfort and the distinction between the political and military wings of the African National Congress are as fudged as the distinction between Sinn Féin and the IRA.  My unease is not that Nelson Mandela stands for the overthrow by violence of an evil regime or that the African National Congress were compelled to have recourse to violence when denied other channels of <Col N="1820" /> agitation as, indeed, the United Irishmen were in the middle 1790s.</P>
      <P>Gandhi's life, Terence MacSwiney's sacrifice and Martin Luther King's career suggest that there are avenues other than violence to the attainment of freedom, but it would be absurd and arrogant of me to claim that no oppressed people should ever have recourse to violence.  That is not the source of my unease on this motion.  It is a fact that the African National Congress have not dissociated themselves from the hideous practice of necklacing, and as far as I know, terrorism, notoriously the use of the car bomb in densely populated urban areas, is part of their strategy.  Has Mr. Mandela dissociated himself from these activities? I am not aware that our Government have a national policy favouring the overthrow of the Pretoria Government by force or that they have no objection to necklacing.  Still less am I aware that they condone car bomb outrages involving innocent civilians.  We cannot have one standard for terrorism at home and another, comfortably distant standard for abroad.  For these reasons and because of these implications I greatly regret that I cannot support the motion unreservedly.</P>

      <P>Unlike Senator Murphy, I fully support this motion, and I thank Senator Bulbulia for putting it down at this time.  It is very important that we discuss it now given the wave of sympathy which is developing for Nelson Mandela particularly as his 70th birthday approaches.  I am delighted to support the call for his immediate and unconditional release.  It is important that Seanad Éireann adds its voice to that of the many Parliaments throughout the world who are also calling for his release and the many groups and politicians who are speaking out strongly on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nelson Mandela has been awarded many honours in recent times.  I have a list of some of the more important ones. Rather than going through the whole list, I shall deal with the more important ones to show how much sympathy and support Nelson Mandela has throughout the <Col N="1821" /> world and to demonstrate the revulsion which people have against the apartheid system.  In 1981 he was awarded the freedom of the city of Glasgow.  In 1983 he was awarded honorary citizenship of Rome.  In 1984 he was awarded the freedom of the city of Aberdeen.  In that year also a resolution was sponsored by 135 Congressmen in the House of Representatives in the United States calling for the release of Nelson Mandela and was approved by acclamation by the House Foreign Affairs Committee and approved by the Senate.  In 1987 he was the first person to receive the freedom of the city of Sydney, Australia.  In that year also he was awarded honorary citizenship of the city of Florence in Italy.  Those are some of the more important awards which have been conferred on Nelson Mandela in recent times.  Of course, he has been awarded honorary degrees in a number of universities throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the incoming Lord Mayor of Dublin last night in his address to the City Council state that he hopes to honour Nelson Mandela in a very special way in the coming weeks. That is an important move.  I am delighted that Dublin City Council plan to play a role in that regard.  I look forward to having consultations with the Lord Mayor and other groups in the city council and to adding our voice and support on this occasion.  A monument to Nelson Mandela has been unveiled in Merrion Square, Dublin, and that demonstrates quite clearly where the Irish people stand in relation to apartheid and the system of Government in South Africa.</P>
    <P>Ireland professes to be a neutral country but neutrality means many things to different people.  For some neutrality merely means the avoidance of military alliances and so forth but for me Irish neutrality means more than that.  It means the promotion of peace and justice throughout the world.  That is an important aspect of Irish neutrality.  We have always been to the forefront in promoting peace and justice throughout the world. We have had a sad history of oppression. <Col N="1822" /> We are in a position to understand what exactly is going on in South Africa, and we must, if only because of our history, support the black people in South Africa in their quest for justice and equality.</P>
    <P>There was a revolution in Ireland at the beginning of this century and indeed it was copied by many countries throughout the world.  Senator Bulbulia mentioned Gandhi in India who, of course, closely examined what went on in Ireland at the beginning of this century.  The revolution in Zimbabwe was also based very closely on what happened in this country.  Ireland has a leading role to play in the promotion of peace and justice, and there should be no question of what side we are on in relation to this issue.  Our history suggests that we must do everything we can to smash the system of apartheid in South Africa and I have no doubt that the Government are doing everything possible in this regard in the different fora in which they are represented.  In the whole area of European political co-operation and the EC we are playing our role in promoting peace and justice particularly in relation to South Africa.  I would call on the Government to continue our tradition of promoting peace and justice throughout the world.  I fully support the motion.  I send greetings to Nelson Mandela as he approaches his 70th birthday and call for his immediate and unconditional release.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have much pleasure in joining with my colleagues who have put their names to this motion in which we extend our best wishes to Nelson Mandela on his 70th birthday and call for his unconditional release from prison.  I have no inhibitions whatsoever in publicly stating that I abhor all that the apartheid system in South Africa stands for.  I also have no doubt that the name Nelson Mandela is synonymous with peace and justice for a people who unfortunately are precluded from the democratic process, not because of any difference in political ideology but based on colour alone.  That is why people like Nelson Mandela, and indeed the African <Col N="1823" /> National Congress who have been precluded from participating in the affairs of their own country have had to resort to occasional violence, about which Senator Murphy has been consistent.</P>
      <P>There is a major difference between the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin, as we understand them, in their ability or lack of ability to enter into a democratic process or to achieve everything they want by destruction of human life, ignoring the political process and Nelson Mandela who wants to give people the opportunity to participate in the democratic process. They have been precluded from doing so by a minority white population who have achieved all they want from that country. They have ensured, through their electoral process, that the natives of South Africa cannot either elect their own people or have a say in the running of their country.  What we are trying to do here today is to send our greetings to somebody who has been synonymous with this movement.</P>
      <P>With the exception of some Tories in England who expressed a political reservation about the concert which was held to celebrate the seventieth birthday of Nelson Mandela, I am sure the vast majority of peace loving people who admire the democratic process would have no reservations whatsoever in extending their warmest birthday greetings to this tremendous leader of a downtrodden population who have been precluded from the normal process in Government and of having a free vote, as we understand it.  That is what this motion is about.  &ldquo;Cry Freedom&rdquo;, the film about Steve Biko, gives us an idea of what has to be tolerated by the natives of South Africa, particularly in their dealings with the white regime.  These stories are not told only by coloured people, people like Archbishop Tutu and others who have fought using every public medium available to them, but are told by white people in South Africa who could not tolerate the system anymore because they saw that it downtrod black people who were entitled to a say in their country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1824" /> Even though we understand why Senator Murphy's views in this regard are consistent we should have no reservation in respect of this motion if we have studied what this group of people and, in particular, Nelson Mandela stand for. We hope that some generosity may be shown by a government who have not been very generous in the past and that, if all the civilised countries in the world, including Ireland which is a small peace loving nation that defends the right of freedom, join together and call on that government, they may listen.  We are aware that they have already conceded that the relatives of Nelson Mandela can visit him on his birthday.  That in itself is a gesture but it is a weak gesture when somebody has achieved 70 years and has spent a decade in prison so that black people can have some rights &mdash; the right to vote, the right to democracy and the right to freedom of expression, congregation and demonstration.  These are basic rights and we are fortunate that we have them.  Even though they are not sufficient for some people who resort to other forms of violence and ignore the democratic process, that should not take from the tremendous movement in Africa which I think every western parliamentarian and people throughout the world have aspired to as a beacon of hope for people who have not had too much hope up to now.  I fully support the motion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted when my colleague, Senator Bulbulia, raised this motion as an item on the Adjournment and that the Government party allowed us to have a debate on it.  I was very happy to put my name to the motion which is before the House today and in doing so I think it is very important that we get a glimpse of the man we are honouring here today.  I want to quote from <Col N="1825" /> a transcript of a speech Mr. Mandela made during his trial:</P>
      <P>Our struggle is a truly national one. It is a struggle of the African people, inspired by our own suffering and our own experience.  It is a struggle for the right to live.  During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people.  I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination.  I have cherished the ideal of a democracy and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.  It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve but if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.</P>
      <P>That gives us a clear view of the man, Nelson Mandela, who has been imprisoned for a long period because of the principles he stands for.</P>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia outlined the events that put him in prison.  I am thankful to Senator Ferris for his contribution because he outlined distinctly the difference between the terrorism in our country and some of the terrorist acts in South Africa.  We have seen some of the terrible violent acts that have taken place in South Africa and we are very thankful to our television stations for bringing these pictures, which can be very frightening at times, to our homes.  What frightens me about South Africa is that when the Government there show any initiative for change a right wing approach drives them further away from it and makes the situation even more difficult for them.  In South Africa a very right wing section of the community do not want change of any kind.  Of course, with that in mind there is little or no possibility of Nelson Mandela being released but if all the free loving nations of the world stood up and asked for his release I believe this would make some impression on the South African Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Haughey outlined some of the honours with which Nelson Mandela has already been bestowed.  The most outstanding of these is the resolution for his <Col N="1826" /> release which was approved by acclamation by the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate in the United States.  We in Dublin have also honoured Nelson Mandela.  I remember distinctly on a lovely summer's evening in 1985 when the then Lord Mayor of Dublin unveiled a plaque honouring a prisoner of conscience and that is what Nelson Mandela is.</P>
    <P>Last evening I was very moved when the new Lord Mayor of the City of Dublin, Councillor Ben Briscoe, in his acceptance speech said he wished that Dublin City Council would honour Nelson Mandela in some special way in this year of his seventieth birthday.  We have honoured him already in one special way but there is another way, the total way, in which a city can honour someone, that is, by giving him the freedom of the city.  I sincerely hope my colleague, Senator Haughey, and his group will agree &mdash; and there is agreement among other groups &mdash; that in the near future Dublin will honour the seventieth birthday of Nelson Mandela by giving him the freedom of the city of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in something of a quandary because I had intended to say one thing but I feel obliged now to say something slightly different, and it is something that I very much regret having to say.  I wish that somebody whom I admire greatly like Senator Murphy would be sure of his facts and what he is saying before he makes the sort of remarks he has made.  The position of the African National Congress is that they use violence against military and economic targets.  That is what they have consistently said.  They live in a censored regime.  They operate in an unfree society.  They condemned and denied all connection with the car bombing in South Africa recently.  They have not advocated the use of the so-called necklace.  Winnie Mandela has been pilloried for remarks that she made which I am not suggesting were not remarks made in the heat of the moment.  She has frequently and consistently since then said that she did not intend to advocate necklacing.  That is <Col N="1827" /> the position of the ANC and of those who are qualified to speak for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to remember too that it would not be the first time that a ruthless regime attempted to blacken the name of their opponents.  There is no reason to believe that a Government that send their agents round the world to carry out assassination attempts against the political representatives of black South Africans somehow will be dissuaded, for reasons of morality or respect for human life, from carrying out actions at home.  I do not know who carried out some of these bombings.  What I do know is that those who are authorised to speak for the African National Congress have denied that the African National Congress carried them out.  Having said that, may I also say that we know about South Africa only that which the South African regime &mdash; and I refuse to use the term South African Government &mdash; permit us to know.  They let us know only what suits their propaganda.  Therefore, if there is a military campaign going on against military targets we would not know about it. If there is a successful military campaign going on against economic targets we would not know about it.  I do not have any reason to justify the use of car bombs but to suggest that incidents like that prove that the ANC is a terrorist organisation I find quite offensive, indeed insulting to people who have to live under almost an intolerable burden.  I have heard frequently the depths of compassion and concern and observed the dignity, the extraordinary lack of bitterness of many black South Africans in the face of severe repression.  I know, from many radical and committed white South Africans, of the ability of black South Africans to distinguish between white people on the basis of their commitment to freedom or otherwise.  There is no racist intent in the activities of the African National Congress.  Quite clearly, given the proven sacrifices they have made in the interests of non-racial politics, any sort of indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets which would involve large scale loss of black and white lives is <Col N="1828" /> an entirely inconsistent objective, one that is at variance with everything they have stood for.  It does not require much more than a familiarity with the current affairs columns of any decent newspaper to be aware of that.  Therefore, it is most regrettable that an eminent member of this House would make statements of the kind that Senator Murphy made.  I do not believe they stand up to scrutiny.  Neither do I believe they are worthy of a man whom I respect so much.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, what I would like to have said &mdash; and my time is now almost up &mdash; is that the world ought to look at the extraordinary power of a man who has been in prison for 25 years, at the sort of pathetic incomprehension of a government which on the one hand refuse to release him but on the other hand when he had a relatively minor ailment for a man of his years, called in international observers from around the world to observe the operation because of their fear of what would happen to them if the man died under surgery, who have offered him six hours of continuous contact with his family today.  All of that is because of the pathetic schizophrenic attitude of the South African terrorist regime who perpetually refuse to release the man but, at the same time, are so afraid of him that they treat him almost with kid gloves but keep him locked away.  They are so afraid of one man that the regime cannot survive.  If one man can so undermine the security of the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world, which is what the South African armed forces are, then it is quite clear to me that that regime has no long term future.  I wish to see Nelson Mandela freed in good health, to preside over a free South Africa.  That is why I am proud to support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dangerous that we should become too emotive about a subject like this when the bona fides of everybody in this House should not be questioned even if the interpretation is different.  I refer to the speech just made by Senator Brendan Ryan.  I stand, as I am sure does Senator Murphy, second to <Col N="1829" /> none in condemnation of the system of apartheid.  Having said that &mdash; and I emphasise that &mdash; I am a little tired of the hypocrisy of this House in its ritual condemnation as such.</P>
      <P>I want to spend a few moments on this because I am tired of the unanimity on apartheid and on motions of this kind when apartheid is discussed.  I will give two examples of that in the brief time available to me.  One is that this House has now once, or maybe twice, condemned in the strongest possible terms the possible hanging of the Sharpeville Six.  Yet this House refuses to debate capital punishment in its own backyard. That is an important example of one type of hypocrisy.  Second, this House this evening is putting forward a motion on Nelson Mandela, which will go through and with the sentiments of which nearly every Member agrees.  This House is happy to pass a motion of that sort.  Yet, are we honestly imposing economic sanctions against South Africa?  The answer is, no, we are not.  The answer is that we are guilty of the most gross hypocrisy in this case.  The farther away this is going on the happier we are to condemn it and solve our consciences but, when it hits our pocket, we do nothing about it.  If we were being honest, if the Government were being honest, this criterion would be applied across the board.  If we felt so strongly, so emotional and so moral about this there would be no question of us doing trade with South Africa.  But the fact is, and every Member of this House knows it, that we do so.  The same people who condemn apartheid so loudly are the very people who turn a blind eye to trading with South Africa.</P>

That has happened under successive Governments.  I do not include Senator Brendan Ryan in this &mdash; I am <Col N="1830" /> saying successive Governments have done that.  It is very easy to condemn apartheid, but it is far harder&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is another more delicate point which has not been debated.  It is the question of violence.  It is very easy for us to ritually condemn violence as far away as South Africa.  But it is important &mdash; and I would like to hear the Minister loud and clear on this &mdash; to say whether the Government support the violence of the African National Congress.  If they do not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, your watch is going much faster than the clock, seven minutes to five was the time you gave.  I want to hear the Government &mdash; and it <Col N="1831" /> is no good their being protected on this &mdash; say where they stand on the violence of the ANC, whether they will say they condemn the ANC and their violence. That would be an honest approach; that would be what we want to hear.  I would also like to be informed where they see the distinction between the ANC and the IRA.  That is important as well.  Whatever Senator Ryan says about economic targets, there is no way in which we can redefine these, or be ambiguous or ambivalent.  Economic targets to me is a pseudonym for legitimate targets.  Everywhere is an economic target if it is interpreted as such.  What I would like to see this House doing is not continuously piously passing motions here against this and that while it refuses, or successive Governments refuse, to do something concrete about it or to spell out loud and clear where they stand or whether they condemn the violence of the ANC.  That would be an honest approach.  This motion is not an honest approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken on this subject on a number of occasions.  To put his mind at rest, let me reiterate &mdash; and I will deal with it further &mdash; that the Government do not condone violence. They condemn violence, no matter from what source that violence comes.  We have said it on a number of occasions and, at the risk of repeating myself, I say it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the question that Senator Ross raised about economic sanctions, let me say that this Government and their predecessor have shown the way to our European partners in relation to economic sanctions on South Africa but apparently in this House we get little credit for it.  We have been to the forefront in relation to the sanctions that we have placed on the South African <Col N="1832" /> Government.  Yes, there are very many who would like to see more sanctions and that matter we will be looking into.  We feel it would be better to take our partners in the EC with us in relation to economic sanctions.  There would be far better results if we could do that and we continue to press our partners to impose further economic sanctions.</P>
    <P>It is a mark of the high regard in which Nelson Mandela is held, in this country, that a motion calling for his release is being discussed here today.  Only last week, a similar motion was debated in the Dáil where it received unanimous support from all sides of the House.  On that occasion I renewed the call of successive Irish Governments for the immediate and unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and his fellow political prisoners.  I welcome the opportunity this debate provides to renew this call.</P>
    <P>His 70th birthday provides the occasion for such a gesture which would at once be humanitarian, since Nelson Mandela is now an ageing man, and also would be a first indication that the South African Government are disposed to listen to the voice of the international community which has conveyed with some insistence its view that the freeing of political prisoners would be a first step towards real dialogue in South Africa.</P>
    <P>Happy though I am to participate in this tribute to Nelson Mandela on the occasion of his 70th birthday, it gives me no pleasure to address this subject while he remains in prison.  Though we may congratulate Mr. Mandela on reaching this age, over one-third of his life has been spent behind bars and there can be no celebration while he continues to be imprisoned.  I know I speak for the House and for the people of Ireland when I extend my sympathies, along with my greetings, to Nelson Mandela, his wife, Winnie, and his family.  His struggle for the cause of freedom has found an echo in all our hearts.</P>
    <P>As Senator Bulbulia stated, Nelson Mandela was born in 1918 and trained as a lawyer.  He joined the African National Congress in 1944, devoting his life to the struggle for freedom for black South <Col N="1833" /> Africans.  He was sentenced to five years' imprisonment in 1962 for the part he played in organising a three day nationwide strike, and while serving that sentence he was further charged, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment under South Africa's Sabotage and Suppression of Communism Acts.  Despite numerous calls on the South African Government to release him, he is still, more than 25 years later, in prison.</P>
    <P>During the period of his imprisonment, the name of Nelson Mandela has become as universally known as a symbol of the fate of his people as it is as their leader and the focus of black aspirations for a just, multiracial and democratic society in South Africa.  The years he has spent in prison have not ended his dedication to the struggle for freedom and equality in South Africa and his imprisonment represents an ever-present reminder of the continuing denial of basic rights to the majority in that country.</P>
    <P>These years have also seen the steady worsening of the system of repression and of the unjust system of apartheid in South Africa.  Political, economic, social and civil rights continue to be denied to the majority for no other reason than the colour of their skin.  Since the imposition of the nationwide state of emergency in June 1986, we have seen a steadily rising level of violence and terror.  Hundreds of people, mainly blacks, have been killed either at the hands of the security forces or in internecine conflict.  Thousands more, again mainly black, have been arrested and detained without charge or trial, often for months on end.  A particularly disturbing development is the inclusion of hundreds of schoolchildren among those detained without trial, many of whom have not yet been released to their families.</P>
    <P>The year 1988 has seen the continuing tightening of the system of apartheid. On 10 June the state of emergency was reimposed for a third successive year. In February, 17 organisations working peacefully to oppose apartheid were banned from engaging in further political activity.  The latest threat to the black majority in South Africa is the proposed <Col N="1834" /> introduction of the Promotion of Orderly Internal Politics Bill, which would give the South African authorities the power to block any foreign funding destined for groups of which they would not approve. Passage of such a measure would have a disastrous effect on those organisations and bodies working to try to improve the lot of the victims of apartheid.  This is another example of the apparent determination of the South African authorities to stamp out any attempts by concerned parties to mitigate the effects of the apartheid system.</P>
    <P>Developments since last week have not been encouraging.  The week has been marked by a further explosion of violence, with the deplorable bombing of people coming from a rugby match.  Once again I repeat that the Government cannot and do not condone such attacks. The last few days have also seen still more arrests and the introduction of legislation to amend the operation of the Group Areas Act, so as to enable the authorities to enforce in selected areas the strictest residential apartheid.  The Government are concerned that the route of further repression is not the one on which a solution will be found.  We call once again for the opening of a process of dialogue in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners has become the litmus test in the eyes of the world for the willingness of the South African Government to embark on a genuine national dialogue with representatives of all shades of opinion in South Africa.  The only route to a sociable future for South Africa has to start from reconciliation between all the peoples of that country, leading towards the peaceful abolition of apartheid and the establishment in its place of a democratic multi-racial society transcending barriers of colour, politics and religion.  I stress again that this cannot be achieved while Nelson Mandela and other black leaders remain in prison or detained and organisations opposed to apartheid remain proscribed.</P>
    <P>The immediate and unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and other political <Col N="1835" /> prisoners is a long standing demand of Ireland along with its partners in the Community.  I now renew this call and urge the South African President to avail of the opportunity of the impending 70th birthday to release Nelson Mandela along with all other political prisoners.  By doing this, the South African Government could take a first step to show that a will for peaceful reconciliation exists on their part and thereby establish a basis for negotiations aimed at a democratic, non-racial and united South Africa.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion of the House, which is entirely in line with the Government's view.</P>

      <P>I should like first to express my appreciation to the Members of the House for acceding to my request that all Stages of this Bill be taken today.  This is non-contentious legislation.  It was agreed by all Members in the Dáil that a speedy passage be given to the Bill and it was pointed out there that each month's delay <Col N="1836" /> in the passage of the Bill would cost CBF in the order of £125,000.  Therefore, it is important and I want to express my appreciation to the Members for allowing the Bill to go through the Seanad this afternoon and to thank them for their positive contributions.</P>
      <P>I am sure that CBF will be extremely heartened at the level of satisfaction expressed at their performance to date. As CBF move into a new era of activity and as we move towards a new era with the advent of the single European market by 1992, our food industry must be put on a proper footing, that our export markets must get the proper support and CBF as the main meat promotional and marketing board must get adequate finance. I appreciate a number of the reservations that were referred to, mainly in relation to the numbers of cattle and pigs.  I assure the Members that every possible step is being taken to increase numbers and to promote both the cattle and pig industries at producer level because there is no point, as a number of Members pointed out, in having ultra modern processing and manufacturing facilities if we have not got an adequate number of livestock to go through those plants.</P>
      <P>I want to record my appreciation of the positive and very encouraging support for this most important sector of the food industry.</P>

      <P>Section 3 amends section 6 of the Principal Act by increasing the number of ordinary CBF board members from nine to eleven.  The two additional members, one representative of producers and one representative of the <Col N="1837" /> meat export trade, are proposed in the light of the extension of CBF's role to pigmeat.  This section also allows the number of ordinary members to be further increased by the Minister by regulations. I am reading from the explanatory memorandum.</P>
      <P>I would like some assurances from the Minister in relation to the make-up of the board.  The point has been made &mdash; and I glad that it has been expanded &mdash; to include people from the pigmeat industry. I would like to see a board made up of representatives of the pigmeat, sheepmeat and the beef industry.  It is important that the Minister gets a proper balance of interests on the board of CBF. There would be a lot of resentment among the sheepmeat people if they were excluded.  I urge the Minister when he is appointing his members and expanding the board that due cognisance will be taken of all the interests in the meat export trace whether it be beef, pigmeat or sheepmeat.  The Minister might like to give some assurances along those lines.</P>

      <P>In response to Senator Connor's request that the broadest possible representation be given on the board, I want to point out that the board will comprise, in addition to the chairman, four producer representatives and that they should be representative of the main sectors of the industry.  That is in the interests of the industry and of CBF because they are getting the substantial part of their funding from the industry.  It would be prudent to have representation on the board reflective of the entire industry including the sheepmeat industry.  There are four producer representatives, three exporter representatives, one domestic meat trade representative, one livestock export trade representative and two ministerial appointments.  I give a commitment that I will bring the Senator's concern in relation to this matter to the attention of the Minister when the nominations come in from the appropriate bodies nominating members to the board.</P>

      <P>The Minister said on Second Stage that it may be possible to expand into the poultry business and into venison.  Does the Minister think it necessary that a representative from the poultry industry should be appointed to the board at this stage so that they could see what the market is like and try to get openings for the export of poultry meat to the Continent?</P>

      <P>In response to Senator Hussey's question in relation to the poultry industry, it is important to have a representative board of the entire industry. On Second Stage I said that I regarded the poultry industry as a growth area and an area for tremendous potential. I have no doubt that the producer organisations will ensure adequate and appropriate representation to reflect the importance of the different sectors and as the industry develops, there is no doubt that appropriate representation will be given to the poultry industry.</P>

In the previous section the definition of livestock has been categorised as bovine animals, sheep and pigs.  The producer sectors are now being assured of a place on this board.  Can we take it that the Minister is likely to extend it by ministerial order which this Bill gives him the power to do to the poultry area and, if so, will the board be automatically extended to include that sector?</P>

      <P>As Senator Ferris pointed out, there is provision for the regulation by ministerial order for extension of the board to ensure adequate representation from the industry.  If there is a weakness on the board in relation to any sector, particulary the poultry sector, which is a growth area, I have no doubt that the Minister will speedily introduce an order to ensure that the board of CBF are as broadly based and as reflective of the industry as possible because that is very much in the interests of the board, the industry and the organisation itself.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the actual designation of levies which are stated to be £1.50 per bovine animal and 20p per porcine animal.  In comparable terms when you look at the value of the animals themselves, £1.50 on what is, in fact, a very expensive bovine animal and 20p on a pig is not in accordance with fair play.  Perhaps the Minister would advise us as to how he decided on these figures. Are these just nominal figures chosen for sheep and pigs because of their present value in comparison with the bovine animal which is a very expensive animal to purchase now?  I note that if he intends to change these he will bring an order before the House to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the levies proposed, that is, £1.50 for bovine animals and 20p for sheep and pigs, were recommended by CBF.  CBF are very broadly representative of the industry generally and put a lot of work into a five year programme for the development of the meat industry.  After much discussion and debate they came up with these figures, as recommendations from CBF, to the Department of Agriculture and Food as appropriate figures.  I would think that the reason the pig levy is at 20p is the depressed state of the industry for a long number of years.  A very genuine effort is being made by everybody now to develop the pigmeat industry.  The levy figures as suggested are appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the figures are appropriate but I do not honestly believe that the budgetary position in which the CBF find themselves is adequate.  CBF should have a more aggressive and much wider role and they should have the resources to play a greater role in the promotion of the Irish meat product abroad.  In my Second <Col N="1840" /> Stage speech I made the point that in Ireland we spend around 0.2 per cent on promotion, that is, the value of the product on promotion.  That is much less than is spent by the Meat and Livestock Commission in the United Kingdom and by CBF's counterpart in France &mdash; the title of which I cannot give because my French is not very good.  We should in the future seek to increase the resources of the promotion board.  I would not be adverse to this &mdash; I know we live in times of great financial constraints &mdash; but in terms of the long term investment and economic development of the country, money invested by the Government in a promotion board like CBF would be very well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>At least the Minister recognised that the figures are nominal because of the depressed state of the pig industry. There were times when the 20p and sometimes 50p, was about the only profit per head.  In good times it was £1, so at least he recognised that that industry has gone through a valley period.  I take an optimistic view of it.  We have an efficient production system in pigs, admittedly confined to larger units, but there are some areas of reservation amongst producers now.  They do not object to paying the 20p if somebody takes the responsibility. I am sure the new board will accept the responsibility to have a major thrust to develop our pigmeat into the export market where I am sure the quality is as good as if not better than that of any other country producing pig, bacon and pork products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are reservations about the overall thrust of this now in that we will have a limited number of facilities available in the country.  We will have six or seven facilities which will not be located adjacent to all the producers and there will be some additional costs in trying to get their produce from the area of production into the processing areas which will now be rationalised.  I know there are plans afoot already for the development of the processing units which the Minister mentioned in his Second Stage speech, but at least he recognises the difficulties the pig <Col N="1841" /> industry, in particular, has gone through. I am happy that the industry accepts this as a token figure and, if there are good results which ensure that there is a better buoyancy in the production of pigmeat, I am sure Members of this House can have a debate on how well this board have done, particularly in the area of pigmeat, if and when the Minister comes back to revise these levies which he inevitably will as his predecessors have always done.</P>

      <P>The explanatory memorandum states that:</P>
      <P>Section 5 amends section 29 of the Principal Act by increasing the maximum penalty on summary conviction for failure to make returns and pay levies due, from £500 to £1,000 and by introducing an additional fine of up to £50 per day for a continuing offence ...</P>
      <P>This implies that there has been default by a number of operators in making levies which were collected on behalf of CBF or on behalf of the Department of Agriculture and Food for veterinary services or whatever.  Can the Minister let us know how widespread this practice has been?  Obviously there is a difficulty and a problem since the inclusion of this section clearly implies that there has been a difficulty here and it was put in here to address that problem.</P>

      <P>I do not have specific details in relation to any contravention of the regulations under this section but I do know that CBF indicated to the Department that they wanted fines brought up to a realistic level and adequate monitoring of the collection.  It was on the basis of a recommendation from CBF that the Department framed this particular section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this section if it has anything to do with the administration of hormones.  Do penalties for that problem come under another Act?  It is very serious at present and I believe that, even though it is illegal, it is being carried out by underhand methods and is fairly widespread.  I wonder if anything could be done under this section to try to curtail it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this section deals only with the points raised by Senator Connor about making returns, particularly for the payment of levies.  It does not address itself to the problem, which is a very serious and significant problem, which has been referred to by Senator Hussey.  I understand that this section deals with fines in relation to the non-return of figures so that levies can be levied on the people who are expected to pay them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they want to increase these, CBF must have some evidence that there was some hesitancy on the part of some people in paying their levies.  I know there has been controversy about these levies in the past and about a whole lot of other levies such as disease eradication levies. While there is a dispute in progress, the national farming organisations have a major responsibility, instead of initiating a campaign suggesting that levies should not be paid, to use their good offices to ensure that the purpose of these particular levies is explained to their members and that they are in the members' interests.  They should not be used by the farming organisations to suggest that they be withheld pending clarification of this, or that, or in any other area.  Levies have been used in the past by some of the farming organisations as a weapon, so to speak, which has not been conducive to good legislation because they were brought in here for a specific purpose and should not be used as an ultimatum for any other purpose. Let us hope, although we do not like increasing fines, that the reason for suggesting the increase is not the hidden reason we suspect it might be, which is <Col N="1843" /> the first point of Senator Connor's address.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are defaulters, do they come from the larger areas rather than the small domestic butcher or victualler?  While we tend in the legislation to increase the fines, a compliment must be paid especially to the smaller traders who have geared themselves for the collection of this levy.  Did the main portion of this come from the bigger producer rather than the small one?  My interpretation of it over a number of years was that the small producers may have been slow in submitting returns but nevertheless they collected and they are really only collectors.  They are the middlemen to collect the money for CBF in this and the producer is willing to pay the levy because he feels that the marketing CBF are doing is giving him a better price for his animal.  That is very important and there is no crib in that regard.</P>
      <P>The drafters of this Bill, when they increased the fine did it for a reason.  I do not think it was an accumulation of money because you do not get an accumulation of money by increasing fines the proceeds of which go to different authorities.  Increasing the fine would not bring more moneys into CBF.  For efficiency of collection fines are never the answer.  The co-operation of people in the trade can be secured by other methods.  Has the Minister of State the figures available?  If not, can he tell us broadly if it is from the bigger factories rather than the small domestic butcher?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>First, Senator Hussey inquired about hormones.  That does not come under this section of the Bill.  This section is involved exclusively with the failure to make returns, as Senator Ferris mentioned.  I have not got detailed information in relation to whether the bigger or smaller people are defaulting but &mdash; and this point has been made by a number of speakers &mdash; CBF are a national promotional marketing agency for a major, £1 billion industry.  It is a relatively small <Col N="1844" /> operation, and, as I said in my Second Stage speech, the amount of money expended by CBF for the industry is minimal. We have to compete with organisations throughout Europe who are multinationals and massive in size and funding relative to CBF.</P>
      <P>The number of staff of CBF is only 30. The point I made to the Department was that quite a number of the staff are tied up in trying to get in levies and in contacting people.  It is a question of people going into arrears and CBF personnel, rather than being out in the field and promoting the industry, spending a good deal of their time chasing up levies and chasing different people to get the money in to fund the organisation.  Therefore, they made representations to the Department to have this section tidied up to allow their staff to spend the maximum time on the field doing the job they should be doing, that is, promoting a most important industry on behalf of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commented on the last occasion on the peculiar irony of our legislating for something that had been abolished, and I do not want to be in the least repetitious.  We have quite enough business to deal with in this Bill without repeating anything.  I do not think an alternative to grants is to sell off houses; in the words of a newspaper headline, giving a bonanza to local authority tenants, with the implication that people were going to get enormous benefits from selling off local authority houses at what the newspapers interpreted as being very low prices.  Perhaps the Minister will explain.  I think there is an in-between somewhere where perhaps we encourage people who want to own their own houses.</P>
      <P>I do not believe in the perpetual running down of publicly owned housing stock which when we have money will necessitate the construction of more and more new houses while what we have now &mdash; which, unfortunately, in spite of efforts of this House and the other House, the Minister has as yet not chosen to talk about &mdash; is the imminent housing crisis the Government's policies are going to land upon us in a relatively short time. In my own city the housing officers are already talking about the fact that supply and demand are coming much more into equilibrium than they would have been six months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the admittedly exceptional quantity and quality of local authority house building that has characterised our State for the last six or seven years/comes to an end, one wonders whether it is wise to be selling off the existing local authority stock.  That is why there is an interesting argument about the balance between the £5,000 grant, which encourages people to move out of local authority housing, and alternative forms of tenant purchase which encourage people to stay in local authority housing and which obviously reduce both the quality and quantity of local authority housing that is available for prospective new tenants.  Since apparently we will be building very few, if any, new houses in the coming years, perhaps there is an argument for some sort of <Col N="1846" /> incentive to be given to those who wish to move out of local authority housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Chair's guidance.  I understand that section 4 deals with a different concept from that addressed by Senator Ryan.  This is a very important concept and one on which I wanted to speak, but I have a feeling it is more relevant to section 17.  This section, as I understand it, deals with the scheme which has been abolished by the Government, that is the £5,000 grant to local authority tenants if they surrendered their houses and bought other houses elsewhere, either a local authority vested house or a private house.  This section is legislating for a scheme which has been abolished.</P>
      <P>Will the Chair say if we are in a position to deal with the new tenant purchase scheme, announced by the Minister, and the valuations which have been announced by local authorities?  I want to address some problems that have arisen. I intended putting down an amendment, but I was advised that under Standing Orders my amendment would not be allowed as it would involve a potential charge on either the Exchequer or on local authorities, and I was going to request that the Minister consider putting down an amendment on Report Stage. Are we in a position to deal with the tenant purchase scheme as announced by the Minister under this section, or is it under section 17?</P>

      <P>The Minister replied to this section on the last occasion.  I think he indicated the £5,000 grant scheme was a disaster &mdash; if I remember his words correctly.  I could not agree with him.  It was a very successful scheme.  We live in <Col N="1847" /> a free society, and it is only right that if people who live in local authority housing want to better themselves, they should be given the opportunity of vacating a local authority house to buy a house in an area of their choice.  Many people availed of that scheme and it was very successful but it has served its purpose.  I asked Ministers in the last Government and the present Minister about people who live in flats, and I never got an answer.  A special case can be made for flat dwellers.  There are people living in flats who want to live in private houses in areas of their choice, but who do not have sufficient points on the letting scheme to get a house.  The £5,000 scheme as it operated in the past should be made available to people who live in flats to give them the opportunity to buy a house. That is a reasonable request to make.  If a number of one and two bedroomed flats were available they could be occupied by smaller families.  It would be of real benefit to the Government if they proceeded with that type of policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In my experience, the £5,000 grant scheme was very good for the conscientious tenant who had respect for the local authority property.  The biggest problem I found in my area was that it totally destabilised the community.  The people who wanted to get on and who made things happen got out while those left behind were not as progressive with the result that the community became one-sided or lop-sided.  The great thing about the new scheme is that it stabilises society.  I would not be surprised if 40 per cent or more local authority tenants in my area avail of this very generous gesture and terrific opportunity to own their own houses.  When we look at the rest of Europe and see that many people never have an opportunity of owning their own homes, we realise this is a terrific step forward.  This is progressive legislation.  I ask the Minister to take into account Senator Doyle's recommendation in relation to flat dwellers.  He has a very valid point and there may be a lot of validity in having a good close look at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>My observations are similar to Senator Cassidy's.  The £5,000 grant scheme may have succeeded to a certain extent in getting people to vacate local authority houses and to build their own houses, but in my experience the best people &mdash; those involved in local community work, who were prepared to develop their housing estate and make it a better place to live &mdash; availed of it.  Very often they left behind a community who were not as progressive or who were not as prepared to put as much into developing the local amenities and the local communities as the people who availed of the £5,000 grant.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Doyle that there may be a problem as regards people living in flats.  This is one area that I am not competent to speak on but if there is a problem in that area and something could be done by way of a grant, such as the £5,000 grant scheme that is now being terminated, the Minister could look at it and see if anything could be done to eliminate the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the point made by Senator Doyle because it is worthy of a response from the Minister. I recognise Senator Doyle as being an expert in this area because he represents people living in this kind of accommodation. These people could be assisted by a scheme such as the one the Government have abolished.  The Minister has given his reason for abolishing the scheme and we can debate it backwards and forwards but our interpretation will always differ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respect the Minister's view and I hope he respects mine.  I speak from experience of how the scheme operated, the kind of people who benefited, and the fact that it put houses back into the local authority housing stock to meet the waiting list demands, which are still there. There are still local authority housing waiting lists which have not been reduced, will not be reduced by the Government's allocations this year and which will eventually lead to the crisis in housing Senator Ryan referred to.  That is the situation on the ground, but I do <Col N="1849" /> not know if that is how it is perceived in the Department.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister has given his reasons for abolishing the scheme, and this section brings the scheme into operation. The point made by Senator Doyle deserves some comment from the Minister and perhaps he will look at the problem outlined at some date in the future. The view has been expressed on the Government side of the House that there is, possibly, a case to be answered.  We would like to hear from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I raised another question which the Minister felt should not be raised on section 4.  I suggested another section, the section on mortgages might be appropriate and the Minister suggested section 23 which deals with applications received on or before 31 December 1987.  I respect the Minister's view.  I will deal with it under whatever section the Minister feels is the right one.  It deals with people who had applied before 31 December and even some who had effected the legal transfer on 31 December 1987.  The new scheme has now put them into the anomalous situation.  The value of their houses is so different from the new values announced as to make their position almost untenable.  They find themselves paying larger amounts of money than their neighbours who bought identical houses in the same scheme.  There is an anomaly there.  I suggested that an amendment should be made to this Bill on Report Stage to equalise the position of people who had, in good faith, entered into an agreement to purchase their houses.</P>
    <P>I want to commend the new scheme. There is widespread support for it and I have advocated that people who want to benefit from it should opt for it &mdash; but some people are faced with the dilemma of having to pay very different mortgages. Perhaps the Minister might consider a Report Stage amendment to insert equalisation.  Perhaps the period of mortgage repayments could be shortened to compensate those people in some way for the position they now find themselves in. I am in your hands, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, as to the relevant section.  I will attempt <Col N="1850" /> to raise this question again on section 17 and perhaps the Minister might be coaxed to respond.  I would welcome a response to Senator Doyle's comment on this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very thankful to the Senators who have supported my point of view.  There is also another very important matter under the sale scheme for houses which I did not mention but which I will come to at a later stage.  While the Minister has eliminated senior citizen accommodation from that sale scheme, no local authority that I know of have yet prepared a scheme for the sale of flats. The Minister should consider giving the £5,000 grant to flat-dwellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that on the last occasion I stated that I did not propose reintroducing the £5,000 grant, and I reiterate that now.  I said that there were people who had considered this matter.  I was not in a position on the last occasion to give the reference, but I am now.  I would like to put it on the record, for what it is worth.  It is from <i>A Study of the £5,000 Surrender Grant in the Dublin Housing Area</i> carried out by Threshold, an organisation not unknown to many of the Senators who have an interest in housing.  I quote from page 8 of their summary, sub-paragraph 4:</P>
      <P>4.  The grant undoubtedly enabled people who might not otherwise have been able to do so to purchase a house in the private sector.  Their exodus, however, had serious consequences in these areas of high take-up of the grant....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.  The effects were found in the study to be as follows: Communities where unemployment was already high suffered the loss of many of those people who had jobs.  Income levels dropped and services in the areas deteriorated.  Many of the vacant houses were vandalised.  The community was substantially deprived of its leaders as they were the ones to move out with the grant.  The large <Col N="1851" /> number of vacancies enabled the waiting list for Dublin Corporation housing to be reduced.  But an already fragmented community now had to encompass the addition of other marginalised groups, such as single homeless people, single-parent families &mdash; many of whom were also unemployed &mdash; which the Corporation now found it possible to house.  The community spirit essential if such problems are to be combated had taken demoralising punishment.  Stigma, particularly in relation to job opportunities, provided a strong motive to change address.  The overall effect gave further impetus to those who could do so to move.  As the level of unemployed in the community consequently rose further, the circle was completed.</P>
    <P>As a back-up to that report from Threshold I would like to take a little piece from <i>Focus on Homelessness</i> edited by John Blackwell and Stanislaus Kennedy and published quite recently.  It deals as well with the period during which the £5,000 grant operated to local authority tenants who could buy a house in the private sector.  The effects had been strongly felt in west Tallaght.  It states at page 712 that this particular policy, designed to have a positive effect on the building industry, has had a devastating effect on the new unsettled communities of west Tallaght; that the unemployed and the impoverished are increasingly being ghettoised.</P>
    <P>When I considered this matter last year I did not have the benefit of those two items from independent bodies who did their own assessment of it but they certainly reinforced my view that what I had done was right.  It is not my intention to reintroduce that scheme.  It was a bad scheme.</P>
    <P>In so far as the tenant purchase scheme is concerned I suggest that perhaps there are various sections under the legislation whereby it might be considered but I recommended section 23 as it has to do with an element of the scheme, that the scheme cannot be concluded until that <Col N="1852" /> section is cleared by this House.  Perhaps that might make it appropriate.</P>
    <P>Just by way of explanation to Senator Doyle on the question of the flats, the situation is that under the legislation for the tenant purchase scheme it is possible to buy out the flat but it requires a different set of guidelines.  We have a special group working on that and when they come up with their recommendations in the matter I will be more than happy to include them in that scheme also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has quoted from studies carried out by Threshold and also from a report entitled <i>Focus on Homelessness.</i>  I am not going to challenge their view but I have to ask the Minister a very pertinent question: where would the people described in the Focus report, the unemployed and single people who got houses that were vacated by people who availed of the £5,000 grant, be housed?  They would not be housed: they would still be on the waiting list of Dublin Corporation and other local authorities. That is what is happening now, as Senator Ryan has mentioned.  The housing stock is drying up and we will have a problem.  The £5,000 grant created a number of vacancies which enabled the corporation to house the unemployed and single parents.  Is there anything wrong with that?  They were on the local authority waiting list waiting to be rehoused and this scheme, while it gave people an opportunity to buy houses in the private sector or areas of their own choice, also enabled people who were unemployed and single parent families to be rehoused.  That is very important.  We have to put that on the record as well. We cannot have a one-sided view on this; we must have a balanced view of what the £5,000 grant did for us.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say that he is reviewing the scheme for the sale of flats.  I would like him to tell us when that scheme will be prepared.  If it is not prepared in the very near future will he then extend the special scheme for the sale of houses, which ends on 31 December, into next year for the sale of flats?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave my comments about this new tenant purchase scheme to the relevant section as suggested by the Minister but I want to take issue with his philosophy on the abolition of this scheme.  I accept that Professor Blackwell is a competent lecturer in housing and the consequences of housing.</P>
      <P>For ten years or more I was a member of a health board with Sister Stanislaus. I am aware of her work in the area of combating poverty and I respect the agency's views but it is my considered opinion that the homeless, the unemployed, unmarried mothers and others also deserve to be housed.  The fact that this scheme enabled them to be housed must in itself commend the scheme.  Let us not blame the people who availed of the scheme to better themselves for the fact that many of the unemployed suddently found themselves in the position of being able to get houses.  It has always been considered by everybody in Opposition as the responsibility of Government to deal with the problem of unemployment.  Therefore, let us not wash our hands of the problem of unemployment or other social problems or link them with housing and the fact that people try to better themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the issue.  If the Minister wants to talk about unemployment and about what the Government have failed to do &mdash; to address the problem of unemployment &mdash; we will debate that but let us not condemn people who have used this scheme to better themselves which, under our Constitution, they are entitled to do and do not say that because the unfortunates, who did not have a house or a job, suddenly found themselves with at least a house a problem was created which was to be laid at the threshold of those who tried to better themselves under the other scheme.  That is not the case.  The Minister can write whatever thesis he likes and listen to whatever views he likes.  I do not dispute what happened but let us not wash our hands of the responsibility to look after those who suddenly needed housing and were accommodated.  Now that this scheme has been abolished housing lists will get <Col N="1854" /> longer and we will not address this problem. These people will find themselves lower down on the list of people to be housed, given that there will be families with four and five children who will have a higher number of points in the stakes to qualify.  That is my view and I would like to put it on the record along with the views of the Minister, Professor Blackwell and my very good friend, Sister Stanislaus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I always find statements from authoritative people worthy of considerable respect but there is only one person I am expected to regard as having infallibility under very limited circumstances and even those very limited circumstances I have great difficulty in believing in.  Whether they be the views of John Blackwell, Sister Stanislaus or of Threshold they are extremely interesting and should be given considerable weight but they are not infallible.  It needs to be said &mdash; if it is a nasty point, let it be a nasty point &mdash; that none of the authors of these reports will ever or would ever have had to live in west Tallaght.  Therefore, it is a bit much to presume that you know what is good for those who have to live in those places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, if the Minister abolished the £5,000 grant in order to invest in infrastructure in those areas I would have said that perhaps it was a very good idea. Give all the community leaders something to do.  Give them community centres and facilities for their young people. Why did all those people who apparently were the leaders in their communities leave those places?  They left because they felt there were no opportunities there for their children, that there were no decent facilities there, that the stigma of an address in such places would guarantee their children having considerable difficulty in getting a job later on, as people can still tell you, and for many other reasons.  They did not leave because a £5,000 grant was made available, they left because they wanted to leave and the £5,000 grant made it possible to do so.  The second point that needs to be made is that people who live in local <Col N="1855" /> authority estates can never get the right side of the stick.  When people, like the people who left with the £5,000 grant, were living in local authority estates they were forever being criticised by other people for living in State subsidised housing and asked why would they not get up off their backsides and build houses for themselves like everybody else.  That was the usual jibe against them.  People regularly quoted to me figures about the average subsidy on local authority houses and told me of the families they knew who had three cars and four incomes and who would not move.  That argument was used <i>ad nauseam</i>, particularly by right wing economists about the whole concept of public housing.  Now when the tenants are given an incentive to move out they are somehow blamed and we are told that it is not good that they have moved out because the communities have lost their leaders.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ferris, and I do not care who says it, that the notion that moving in more of the unemployed and single mothers is unacceptable and reflects badly on the people who wrote those reports.  People, particularly those with their record, should be extremely careful about the language they use and should be extremely careful to avoid imposing further stigma on those who are already heavily stigmatised.</P>
    <P>Having said all of that, a balance needs to be struck in regard to public expenditure in the area of housing and one of my arguments is that perhaps making available a £5,000 grant, the mortgage interest subsidy and a number of others, is not the most efficient way to use the limited State resources available to provide housing.  The figures that were presented in the Dáil last April and more recently showed that since the State has effectively stopped construction of new houses in most of the major urban areas, the idea that we are somehow reallocating resources from one area of public housing to another is a bit of a joke. These grants were stopped, not because of sociological issues or because of any damage to communities, but because the <Col N="1856" /> Government decided to cut back on this area of public expenditure and <i>post hoc</i> justifications on the basis of research that conveniently comes to hand can not get away from that fact.</P>
    <P>The truth is that these grants did give people a choice and Gustavo Guitierrez, one of the great philosophers of the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua, said in a very inspiring address which he gave in Galway that poverty is the absence of choice.  Depriving people of choice and forcing them to live where they do not wish to live is not necessarily the way to build a community.  I have difficulty in believing that people could be persuaded to move out of the community that they were allegedly the natural leaders of and major participants in because a £5,000 grant was made available to them.  These are people who were supposed to be the backbone of their communities and committed to their communities and I find it difficult to believe that when a once-off £5,000 grant is made available, which will still leave them with a considerable mortgage to pay back for the rest of their lives, they would suddenly up and leave their communities.  Like a lot of what passes for left-wing analyses in this country, it is a little simplistic in the sense that it amounts to some people attempting to organise the lives of others.  I happen to believe that the best way to build socialism is to let ordinary people organise their own lives and to determine their own priorities with the State responding to those priorities in the most creative way possible.</P>
    <P>The £5,000 grant represented the aspirations of many people.  The people who left wanted to leave and we do not have any right to force people to live where they do not want to live, particularly since none of us would dream of living in the housing conditions that most of these people are expected to live in.  Most of us at the first chance we got moved out of that type of housing into much more acceptable housing but, apparently, we believe that it is good for other people not to have that choice.  I do not believe in that sort of two-tiered society, where we leave certain people to be the opinion <Col N="1857" /> formers and leaders in communities that the rest of us choose not to participate in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see a study carried out into why people availed of the £5,000 grant, as I am sure it would bear out much of what Senator Ryan has said. When the £5,000 grant was made available houses became vacant and were reoccupied, as we have learned now from the reports produced by Threshold and Focus, by the unemployed and by single people.  Recently when I visited the housing section of the local authority of which I am a member, I inquired about the position in regard to housing because I like to keep on eye on the position and see how many houses are becoming available. On Second Stage I requested the Minister to make funds available for inner city housing but I could not in good conscience make an appeal to the Minister to make funds available for housing in the areas we are talking about now, the areas which Threshold and Focus deal with in their reports.  I say this because there are more houses available now than we have tenants for.  I asked the officials the reason for the number of vacancies and they told me that keys were being handed in on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>Of course the reason for it is that people are emigrating and leaving their houses to the local authority, as happened in 1956-57. Will the Minister come back to this House in a year's time and quote to us from Threshold and Focus reports on the effects emigration has had on Tallaght, Blanchardstown and other areas in the outer city?  The economic policy being followed by the Government has the undesired effect that the numbers of unemployed are increasing, as we saw from the figures last Friday.  Houses are becoming available to local authorities in urban areas on account of emigration. The Minister might like to think about that and see what Threshold and Focus have to say about it in a year's time.</P>

      <P>I have just one final comment. I will be glad to convey some of <Col N="1858" /> the sentiments expressed by some Senators to the people named as the compilers of this little document.  I leaked them before to the said Senators.  I would just like to ask Senator Ryan &mdash; I do not know whether he is referring to those who might or might not be living in West Tallaght &mdash; whether some of the people involved in the editing of this particular document had any real knowledge of that.  I would like to clear up that matter. The reference I gave from <i>Focus on Homelessness</i> by the two people involved was, in fact, not written by either John Blackwell or Stanislaus Kennedy, but by the West Tallaght Resource Centre.  I am sure they would be reasonably close to the situation that exists there.  It is also interesting to note from that same document that the West Tallaght Resource Centre, speaking for themselves, said that quite a number of the families availing of the £5,000 grant exercised their choice, remained in the Tallaght area and just moved up the road.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 2 and 3 to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  For the purposes of this section &lsquo;management&rsquo; shall be taken to include, where appropriate, caretaking, maintenance, and suitable social support services.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is simply a matter of clarification. The section deals with assistance by housing authorities of certain bodies.  Section 5 (1) says that the assistance may be for the erection, purchase, improvement, or conversion, or management by the authority or body of housing accommodation. My amendment simply attempts to make it clear what I believe to be the Minister's intention: that management is not simply the management of the resource, but is also support for the people involved and, that therefore, management shall be taken to include, where appropriate, <Col N="1860" /> caretaking, maintenance and suitable social support services.  This relates, in particular, for one reason, to the provisions of section 10 to do with the powers that are being given to housing authorities to deal with homeless people and the arrangements they can make with other organisations.  If these arrangements are to work, the organisations have to be seen as organisations which do more than manage property.  They have to be seen for what they are: social support organisations.  It is important, therefore, that the word &ldquo;management&rdquo; in this context should be seen to mean what I believe and hope it is intended to mean, to involve not just the management of the resource but also, as my amendment says, where appropriate, caretaking, maintenance and suitable social support services.  I would ask the Minister to either accept the amendment or to make it clear that the regulations emanating from this Bill would make it clear that that word &ldquo;management&rdquo; implies what I think it implies.</P>
    <P>It is important that it should be in regulations rather than in guidelines because regulations have the force of law, but guidelines do not.  The Minister can send all the guidelines he wishes to a housing authority but if the legal advice available to a housing authority says that the Minister is wrong, there is no obligation on the housing authority to accept those guidelines.  That is why I would be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say on this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this amendment is either necessary or desirable for the following reason: the concept of what is involved in housing management is constantly developing and it is desirable that legislation should allow this to happen without attempting any definitions.  That is my basic point.  The management of housing and the expression used in this section has always been seen in the past in the broadest possible terms.  It certainly is taken &mdash; this is the point that Senator Ryan might be concerned about &mdash; to mean and to include caretaking, maintenance and all <Col N="1861" /> the other necessary support services that one might find desirable, including the social ones.  Section 58 of the 1966 Act, under which local authorities look after all aspects of the operation of their housing estates, used the word &lsquo;management&rsquo; to embrace the various items mentioned in Senator Ryan's amendment, including, for example, warden support for elderly persons.  Similarly, section 13 of the present Bill speaks of the management of residential caravan sites for travellers, the power given there is designed to include such facilities as caretaking, maintenance and other support services, including social workers whose salaries are recouped under section 6.  What is being attempted here is in the widest possible sense and anything restrictive so far as I am concerned would not serve the purpose we have in mind.</P>
      <P>We do not at present have any scheme for helping voluntary bodies with the day to day costs of running their housing. Under section 10 of the Bill, there is power to pay voluntary bodies, where they accommodate homeless persons, and such payments could allow for the costs arising from the services mentioned by Senator Ryan.  That could take place if it was deemed necessary, but in the circumstances we look on the word &ldquo;management&rdquo; as understood in the 1966 Act as being the widest possible, and to include all the things the Senator mentioned in his amendment.  Consequently, we are of the opinion that it is not necessary to have the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 46 and 47, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(7) This section would specifically <Col N="1862" /> include a bona fide voluntary association or non-profit co-operative or voluntary housing association.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his final reply to Senator Ryan, referred briefly to the actual concept of what is included in our amendment. This section deals with assistance by local authorities of certain bodies and our amendment seeks to specifically include a bona fide voluntary association or non-profit co-operative or voluntary housing association.  By positively including them we want to ensure that we will be capable of assisting them.  Perhaps the Minister is of the view that this point is covered.  I want to put it on record that we want to ensure that associations involved in voluntary work receive grants, loans or other disbursements from local authorities to help them with their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment, as well as being unnecessary, is inappropriate in the circumstances.  Section 5 applies in very broad terms to anybody approved by the Minister for the purpose of the section and while all of the organisations already approved under section 12 of the 1966 Act would, arguably, come within the broad descriptions contained in the amendment, I do not consider it desirable to move from the general provision towards providing in the Bill descriptions of bodies which may or may not be approved.  I would not like to go in that direction.  This type of description I consider to be much more appropriate to circular letters and guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the amendment is drafted it is structurally meaningless.  I do not know whether it was intended to convey a message to the Minister that he might approve of any type of body mentioned but it did not say so.  However, my objection to the amendment is not specifically to its drafting but rather an objection in principle to what would be a potentially limiting effect.  It might not seem that way now but I am not prepared to take the risk that it might be limiting in its effect in years to come.  Consequently, the 1966 Act does exactly what is required in these <Col N="1863" /> circumstances and the amendment should be withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not have an argument about the drafting because the Minister has all sorts of facilities available to him that I do not have available to me. His argument has not really convinced me.  I am of the view that if we are specific he does not like it, that he wants the widest possible interpretation so that he can write any circular or letter he likes to the housing authority defining those he considers to be the proper group to be included.  We are trying to ensure that they are not excluded in the future.  The Minister says that that is not a good way to legislate, that he wants this left as open as possible so that he would decide who should be helped and receive a circular. Is that what the Minister is saying?  If so this amendment would be valid.  From the Minister's attitude I am not sure whether any bona fide voluntary organisations who might be designated by housing authorities would be approved by him.</P>
      <P>We are trying to improve the legislation. We put down an amendment for discussion and it was wiped away.  The Minister has recommended that we withdraw it but it is not a matter for the Minister to suggest that we withdraw it, it is a matter for the Chair and the Member who moves it.  The Minister can only respond to amendments.  He does not have a vote in the House, unlike the other House.  Let us be honest with one another, we are trying to improve the legislation by ensuring that there is the widest possible interpretation, as in the past.  We want to ensure that such associations are not excluded in the future.  To our knowledge they have done a lot of excellent work in the past, and I hope they will continue their work.  I hope they will continue to be assisted by the Government who sometimes are incapable of housing certain categories of people.  It is because these associations have done a lot in the past that we are showing concern for them.</P>

      <P>The Senator has it wrong. <Col N="1864" /> The bodies he referred to in his amendment are bodies who are being approved right now.  If he is saying that the bodies, as indicated in section 12 of the 1966 Act, are somehow defective, or if he has problems with that provision, why does he not say so?  Is he saying that it should be left to the Minister to define the type of body mentioned.  That would not be the right way to deal with this and would be contrary to what he has suggested in the rest of his submission.  As far as I am concerned it is meaningless in so far as that is already the position.  Why alter something that has worked well in another section since 1966, unless Senator Ferris can tell me that he is unhappy with that?</P>

      <P>A lot of things have changed, including the Minister.  His policies in this whole area have changed.  His party's attitude since they published their manifesto in the last local elections has changed in this area.  The Minister is not incapable of change, he has made a few U-turns also.  I want to ensure that in future the groups outlined by us in the amendment will be treated in the same way that they have been in the past.  The Minister is suggesting that these matters should not be written in this way, that they should be dealt with by way of circulars, letters and so on.  I have it on the record that the Minister is going to treat this group of people by circular or letter in the same way as they were addressed in the past.</P>

      <P>For my benefit, will the Minister explain why he finds it necessary to repeal section 12 of the 1966 Act?  I presume section 5 is, effectively, replacing it.  In the list of repeals there are a number of very intriguing repeals stuck in at the end of the Bill to sections of the 1966 Act, some of which, to say the least, are quite disturbing.  The only one that arises at this stage is the repeal of section 12.  Section 12 is similarly worded.  I would like the Minister to explain to me how he sees section 5 as being an improvement on or a change from section 12.  It is more elaborate than section 12 of the 1966 Act.  Why did the Minister find it necessary to be more elaborate and how, if at all, does the section differ in principle from section 12 of the 1966 Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 29, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and not less frequently than every three years&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section refers to the duty of a housing authority to, within one year of the commencement of this section, make an estimate of the existing housing requirements and the prospective housing requirements over such period as the <Col N="1866" /> Minister may direct or, in the absence of such direction, as the authority sees fit. It is the essence of good planning that there should be some attempt at an assessment of existing and future housing requirements.  It is rather peculiar, however that the estimate of housing requirements under section 9 shall be within one year of the commencement and thereafter not less frequently than every three years.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that the estimate of housing requirements should be made once within one year and then at no particularly well-defined regular interval thereafter other than at the behest of the Minister.  It appears that there is a perfectly logical case for having estimates of housing requirements made with the same frequency as assessments of the need for housing.  The two matters intertwine. It appears that it would be somewhat ludicrous to attempt to make an assessment of the need for the provision by the authority of adequate and suitable accommodation for persons, as listed in section 9, at least every three years but to have no obligation to make an estimate of housing requirements with a similar frequency.  It appears to be logical to ensure that the requirements and the obligations under section 8 are also carried out every three years.  It is hardly controversial or difficult to accept.</P>
    <P>I would be very interested in hearing the Minister's comments on this.  Perhaps I am being optimistic in assuming that he will accept this obviously very reasonable amendment but, if for some reason he does not accept it, I would be interested in hearing it.  It seems entirely logical that two matters which are so closely related ought to be carried out with the same frequency.  Otherwise one or other, if not both, could be entirely meaningless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator does not fully appreciate what is involved under section 8.  What is involved is a major assessment of housing requirements, local authority and private. Section 53 of the Housing Act, 1966, provided that the assessment should be carried out every five years.  Even that <Col N="1867" /> five year timetable was not strictly adhered to in the past for various reasons, mainly the scale of the undertaking which is colossal.  Obviously it is essential that all housing authorities should carry out their estimates or assessments at the same time, using, as far as possible, consistent assumptions.  The results of these local authority estimates provide the key element in estimating overall national housing requirements.  However, the demographic, economic and housing stock data underlying the calculation of housing requirements do not change very significantly in a short number of years. An estimate of overall housing requirements every three years would be wasteful and unnecessary for the reasons which I have outlined.  We do not think it is necessary to concede this amendment.  I ask the Senator to try to bear in mind what is involved in the exercise, with all private and public housing.  It would be an enormous task.  It does not happen often and there is no need for it to happen often.  I am not prepared to concede the amendment on those grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two ways of having a discussion.  You can argue about the detail or you can argue about the principle.  I am not prepared to argue about the three years if the Minister accepts the principle.  The Minister said there was an obligation on the housing authority, admittedly unenforced but that is due to the failure of our systems. Section 53 of the Housing Act, 1966, states: &ldquo;It shall be the duty of the housing authority, within such period after the commencement of this section as may be specified by the Minister and thereafter either at least once in every five years or at such intervals, being less than five years, as the Minister may direct from time to time, to inspect the houses in their functional area and to ascertain ...&rdquo;  I appreciate precisely what is involved in this but it appears that an attempt is being made to lessen that responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, there are a number of interesting repealing sections at the <Col N="1868" /> tail end of this Bill which raise interesting questions about the whole policy basis that underlines the areas of this Bill that have nothing to do with the homeless. The Minister was at pains to elaborate that this is not specifically a homeless persons Bill but covers many other matters. What we are being told now is that on one occasion within a year of the commencement of this section a major assessment will have to be carried out, and God knows when it will be carried out again. Under the previous Act it had to be carried out at least every five years.  It is interesting that the drafters of the Principal Act envisaged these assessments as being needed to be carried out with a frequency of less than five years.  I am at a loss to believe that the Oireachtas was so wrong as regards the 1966 Act when it envisaged these sorts of assessments being carried out with a greater frequency than once every five years, because that is what is possible under the Act.  What is obligatory is every five years but what is possible is less than every five years &mdash; while now we are giving <i>carte blanche</i> to the Minister to do so whenever he sees fit.</P>
    <P>If one believes, as I and I think a number of Senators on this side of the House do, that we are going to have a major housing crisis within five years, most local authorities would not be wildly enthusiastic about producing masses of statistics which would underline the possible decline in the general housing stock, due to the lack of finance for maintenance, and so on, which is now being talked about by those members of local authorities who so often lecture me about my lack of experience in this area.  If the Minister argues with me about three years, on the next Stage I will accept five years but the Minister is not arguing about that.  He is arguing about the principle of obliging, by law, regular assessments of housing stock.</P>
    <P>I find it astonishing that the Minister who is responsible for housing could somehow argue that there is no need to ensure, and insist in law, that there should be a regular updating of the quality of information available to housing <Col N="1869" /> authorities about the housing stock.  It appears that underlying that is a certain desire to fudge the data which may become increasingly unpleasant in the next five or ten years.  I do not think there is any case for leaving out a time limit which was envisaged in 1966 and which is probably even more necessary now because of the demand for local authority housing and because of the apparent conspiracy between the two major political parties in this State to perpetuate mass unemployment.  There will be a large-scale demand for public housing and a deliberate decision will be made not to make funds available to provide it. Because of that, it appears that there is an even greater need to have good up-to-date data.</P>
    <P>Some very authoritative studies on Irish decision-making structures and processes have identified the faults in this country not as having anything to do with our racial characteristics, which some people try to pretend, nor with the political process and politicians <i>per se</i>&mdash; our politicians are every bit as good as those in any other country in Europe and I include the present Government in that &mdash; but with our systems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rarely take issue with you, a Chathaoirligh, but the question of how a decision is made or how information is gathered on the quality of our housing stock is a necessary part of developing any policy on how to improve, upgrade or modify our housing stock.  I was simply using that as an attempt to illustrate a broad principle which is that our systems of information gathering and decision making are the biggest weaknesses in our whole political process.  It <Col N="1870" /> appears that to fudge the issue of a necessary upgrading in the quality of data available to housing authorities is another example of our unwillingness to develop systems that are precise, specific and able to identify problems in time before everything becomes a crisis.  Effectively the Minister said that it is too big a job.  I will not argue with the Minister about three years, five years or six years but can he tell me now why it should somehow become an issue for the Minister to decide how frequently Cork Corporation, Mayo County Council or Kerry County Council must carry out a housing assessment?  What sort of infallibility or fund of information is available in the Custom House that is not available elsewhere? Why should it become a function of the Minister to tell local housing authorities when they should do these things? The correct thing to do is to identify a reasonable interval and say that is the interval that ought to be observed.  I do not care if it is three or five years.  Three years is not an unreasonable period and housing authorities ought to be doing much more information gathering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are those who would argue for instance that, instead of a housing programme, we have had for far too long a house building programme, which is a quite different thing.  Instead of identifying areas where useful efficient expenditure could be spent to upgrade existing housing and poor quality housing, we have spent an enormous amount of money on building more and more houses, which was not necessarily the proper response.  One of the reasons for that is the poor quality information which is available about the existing housing stock.  Putting on the long finger how frequently the sort of assessment the Minister mentioned, and which I am concerned about, should be done is nothing more than fudging the issue.  If it is not specified it will not be done.  The Minister said that when the assessments were specified to be done every five years they were not done.  If they could not be done when it was the law that they should be done fairly frequently, why should we believe that they will be done now when <Col N="1871" /> there is no obligation on local authorities to do them at regular intervals?  I cannot accept the Minister's arguments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment on Senator Ryan's remarks.  He gets annoyed from time to time with local authority members for appearing to lecture him but the point we appear to be missing here is that local authorities do their own assessments on a regular basis. I came to this House on a number of occasions to meet various Ministers for the Environment and Ministers for Local Government and at all times I was armed with my assessment of the needs in different areas of County Cork, which I represent. The Minister is not saying that housing authorities may not, should not, or do not carry out their own assessments. They do and this can be compiled relatively easily.  When a local authority decide to make representations and submissions to a Minister at any given time, it is obvious that they will come armed with some form, and quite often this is very comprehensive, of assessment as it relates to their area.  The Minister has not said at any stage that a housing authority should not, within the intervening period of five years, carry out their own assessment. I am quite sure that every local authority carry out assessments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In his first reply the Minister said that because this was a major task he did not want to put a time limit on it in future.  If we are honest we all must recognise that a job has to be done in this area.  The section which Senator Ryan is trying to strengthen already puts a time limit of one year within which the initial assessment by the housing authority has to be made.  It is only the continuation of that reporting procedure that Senator Ryan is trying to address in his amendment and I think this is a very reasonable request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of a local authority I know that this is an ongoing process in local authorities.  If we legislate for this and leave no obligation on anybody except the Minister to decide when the <Col N="1872" /> next assessment is to be done, how can any Minister carry out a policy of rehousing or allocation of national funds for housing if he is not aware of the needs in any local authority area?  I am surprised that the Minister, who is a progressive Minister would allow a situation to develop whereby he would not have the information which he would need to carry out his programme available to him.  The Minister can express his exasperation and I am expressing mine at the way in which he responds to the comments from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to local authorities, this section requires that the report will be prepared and adopted by the authority. It is necessary that any housing authority programme should be discussed publicly and sent to the Minister when it is adopted as part of their requirement for an allocation.  The Minister is saying that this has to be done within the first 12 months of this Bill being enacted and thereafter whenever he so decides.  Those of us who are involved in local authorities would like a time factor to be involved in this.  When the bad news becomes available after the first 12 months I do not think that we should shy away from our responsibilities as members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>As the Minister responsible for meeting the requirements of local authorities the Minister should not insert a provision in the Bill which ensures that local authorities can disregard their responsibility to provide the Minister with the fullest information so that he can advise the Government on how they should respond to the information.  I am afraid that because of the present allocation for new houses we could have a housing crisis four or five years down the road.  It is important that local authorities should discuss their plans publicly so that everyone knows where the buck stops.  When it comes to the allocation of capital funding the buck stops with the Minister and the Government.  They have to respond to the needs of local authorities and they should not let members of local authorities off the hook in responding positively to them.  The fact that the five year <Col N="1873" /> period was not included before substantiates Senator Ryan's reason for putting in a time factor here.  I will not argue about the time limit but there should be some period within which there is an obligation on all local authorities to tell the Minister what is needed in their areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a very able man &mdash; I never had any doubt about that &mdash; but he can be disingenuous sometimes. One would get the impression that <Col N="1874" /> we were undertaking of a detailed engineering survey of every house in a housing authority area.  Let me remind the House that section 8 (2) says:</P>
      <P>In making an estimate of housing requirements in accordance with subsection (1), a housing authority shall have regard to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  information (derived from any survey of all or a sample of the housing in the area or otherwise as the authority see fit) ...</P>
      <P>The first point to be made is that they can use a sample if they are stuck.  I might not agree with that but that is what is written there.  The subsection continues:</P>
      <P>... in relation to the housing conditions in the area, including the number of houses which are in any respect unfit or unsuitable for human habitation, are over-crowded, are shared involuntarily or are expected ... to be lost ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are three critical phrases &mdash;&ldquo;unsuitable for human habitation&rdquo;, &ldquo;are over-crowded&rdquo;, &ldquo;are shared involuntarily&rdquo;. They are extremely important indices which should be reflected in such an assessment.  When one considers that in 1984 local authorities completed 7,000 houses, that according to the Dáil Official Report of 25 November 1987, they expected to complete less than a quarter of that number in 1988, then questions of over-crowding will arise much more frequently than every three years, that even the five years stipulated in the 1966 Act would have been excessively long, that a three year stipulation is being generous.  With those sorts of levels of housing completions by housing authorities over a number of years, the incidence of involuntary sharing or overcrowding will become more and more frequent and intense.  I have to assume that what the Minister is saying is that, since five years and three years were too short, the period of time he has in mind will be somewhat longer.  If we assume we will have one assessment carried out in the next 12 months before the <Col N="1875" /> crisis becomes too acute the next one is to be undertaken in five or six years time &mdash; and we are going to have a nice breathing space in between &mdash; and perhaps we will not have one even then because there is no guarantee.  Within that time local authorities will not have to undertake the types of surveys required in this section with regard to overcrowding, involuntary sharing and so on.</P>
    <P>In that context the more one reads the section the more it becomes clear that the obligation should be clearly written down.  It is an interesting question as to why nobody, myself included, ever got around to trying to get housing authorities to do the things they are obliged to do by law.  It is an interesting question, perhaps related to other obligations the Minister is unwilling to place on housing authorities.  Perhaps we never get used to the need to get housing authorities to do anything they are obliged to do.  Perhaps that is a good reason the Minister does not want to place other obligations on them, to which we will come later.  The fact is that an important issue here &mdash; the degree of over-crowding and involuntary sharing &mdash; must be assessed in the estimate of housing requirements.  That will not have to be done at any given regular frequency.  Additionally that will allow considerable deterioration in the quality of housing available to many people to go unnoticed for a long period of time.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister referring me to section 9.  That is a different section whose provisions I do not want to anticipate.  Section 8 is there with a specific purpose; that purpose is as important as are the objectives of section 9.  If there is an obligation to carry out those surveys under the provisions of section 8 they should be undertaken sufficiently frequently and efficiently to be of some use to people who are trying to plan for future housing needs.  If they are done on a haphazard basis or not at all, important information will be withheld from us. This is happening in other countries as well where many of the indices of deprivation are no longer being measured.  In the case of Governments who like to <Col N="1876" /> pretend to those who are already reasonably well off that things are going well, the last thing they want is information on those who are doing badly.  Therefore they begin to fudge the edges.  That is what is going on here.  The Minister has not given any substantive reason for not insisting on a time limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Brendan Ryan mentioned three discriptions of housing conditions and spoke about two of them &mdash; overcrowding and involuntary sharing. He did not speak about the first description &mdash;&ldquo;unfit or unsuitable for human habitation&rdquo;.  We have gone a long way in our housing programmes and there is now a limit to that category.  While that latter description may have been apt seven or eight years ago any local authority now assessing their housing stock will find such conditions almost eliminated. However it would be wrong to leave this provision open-ended.  There should be a time factor involved in this section.  A local authority should as was stated in the 1966 Act, at least every five years carry out an assessment of the housing requirements in their area.  That is a reasonable request in which I support Senator Ryan and Ferris.</P>

      <P>I do not want to labour this point.  It is obvious that some people who are addressing this subject do not have to go before local authorities for election because we appear to be suggesting that they do not discharge their functions in any area.  As a local authority member of 15 years standing I can assure the House that we address the subject of housing on a monthly basis and, in some counties on a weekly basis.  It is not true to say that this assessment requirement will be ignored because the Minister does not direct county councils to so do.  We do it on a monthly basis anyway.  I am sure the Minister, at the press of a button can obtain information from any local authority in relation to the difficulties they may be encountering on a daily basis let alone on a five-yearly basis.  Let us not suggest &mdash; as appears to be suggested &mdash; that local authority members are <Col N="1877" /> deficient in the discharge of their functions in relation to housing.  I would like to think we do not ignore any of these important functions.  We appear to be suggesting here that if the Minister does not direct us to do it, we do not do it. This is one of the things about which we constantly cry in local authorities &mdash; that the hand of Big Daddy is in evidence once again.  As housing authorities we are discharging our democratic responsibilities anyway.  If the Minister finds local authorities are not doing so he will be very quick to point it out to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say, first, that nothing is being fudged in so far as the Minister's attitude is concerned here.  To suggest that there is fudging going on is ungenerous on the part of Senator Brendan Ryan.  I would invite some Senators to pay closer attention to the text of the section.  Had they done so the amount of talk already devoted to this section might not have been necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be clear as to what will happen. Within one year of the passage of this legislation there will be a major assessment, not just of local authority housing requirements but of all housing requirements, local authority and private.  That is a huge study.  A major strategic study of that kind does not need to be undertaken within any specific number of years.  It has to be done occasionally.  That has been the experience since the passage of the 1966 Act &mdash; 22 years ago.  That is the reason it has not been deemed necessary to carry out the demands or provisions of the 1966 legislation every five years. These assessments are undertaken following a census of population following the adoption of a development plan, or <Col N="1878" /> at some other time regarded as suitable by the agencies involved.</P>
    <P>While Senator Ryan would not like to refer to section 9 at this stage and we should not do so, it is important to understand &mdash; because Senator Ferris might have misunderstood that point is so far as local authority housing is concerned &mdash; that such an assessment or estimate of local authority housing needs will be undertaken under the provisions of section 9 every three years.  That will be indicated in the relevant Statute.</P>
    <P>If you pay close attention to the wording of section 8 you will see that, after the one year assessment has been carried out, local authorities or housing authorities will not await Ministerial direction or demand for the next.  As is said in section 8 (1), it can be carried out &ldquo;thereafter at any time that appears to them expedient&rdquo;, &ldquo;them&rdquo; being the local authority members.  If local authority members feel that in their area there is a need to have this assessment carried out twice a year, there is nothing to stop them authorising it under this legislation.  They do so, in practice, on many occasions when they are considering changes in their development plans and at Estimates times and many other times as well. Those who are members of local authorities would appreciate that point. Senator Callaghan is quite right in his understanding of it.  If the Minister, in some other set of circumstances, deems it necessary and expedient to have such an estimate carried out at any other time, he may do so under this legislation.</P>
    <P>Over the past 22 years our experience has been that it is not necessary to carry out this assessment in a rigid framework of years.  The fact that the five yearly estimate requirement of the 1966 Act was not carried out on a regular basis was not to suggest that the members were shying away from it but that members in considering what was required of them did not think it was justified.  It has to be recognised that information relevant to the need for housing is constantly coming before us and before local authority members in so far as the census report is concerned, in so far as development plans <Col N="1879" /> are concerned, and so on.  Where that information indicates, either to a Minister or to local authority members, that it is then a suitable time to have such an assessment carried out, they are at liberty under this legislation to do so.</P>
    <P>Finally, in so far as local authority needs are concerned, it is stated specifically in section 9 that it will be every three years for a particular reason in so far as it concerns itself with local authority needs as distinct from the general needs of the whole community, private and public.  That is the reading of the section. I invite Senators to scrutinise closely the wording and they will find that it is more than adequate to allay the fears that they have expressed.</P>

      <P>It is not.  I am sorry if there has been some repetition.  I have endeavoured not to be repetitious.  What I am trying to do is to follow the Minister as he hops around a little.  He cannot, on the one hand, tell us that it is an enormous undertaking and then tell us that local authorities will do it every six months if they wish.  There are a number of things that need to be addressed.  One is the considerable reduction in staff in local authorities all over the country because of the voluntary redundancy package.  I should not be the one talking about this. There are people here, members of local authorities, who are far more experienced than I am.  There has been a considerable reduction in staff and it would be interesting to know whether staff would be available now to carry out this work.  If the problem is as extensive as the Minister says, how can cash-strapped local authorities do the assessment if the scale of the assessment is so great?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I cannot accept the Minister's interpretation because the Bill specifically states: &ldquo;derived from any survey of all or a sample of the housing in the area&rdquo;.  So it is not a survey of all the housing that must be done, but a survey of a sample of the housing.  Maybe <Col N="1880" /> it is not just the Members who are not reading the section as carefully as possible. A sample of the housing is a matter that the housing authority can define. You cannot have it both ways.  You cannot, on the one hand, say that many housing authorities failed to do it and on the other hand say that we should leave it up to them to do it.  If they failed to do it when they were obliged to, how in Heaven's name could anybody expect them to do it when they have no obligation to do it on a regular basis?  There is a lack of logic in this.  The Minister may feel that I am being less than generous, but there is a certain blurring of the edges here.</P>
    <P>We are anticipating a housing crisis in the nineties.  I am being a little less critical, but there will be a rapid increase in the level of overcrowding in the next few years.  There will be a rapid increase in the level of involuntary sharing.  Let there be no doubt about it, emigration is not going to continue indefinitely.  People of marriageable age are going to keep on getting married.  Already officials of housing authorities to whom I have spoken have said that the ease of allocation of local authority houses that existed even six months ago is no longer there.  We have not really felt the pinch of the cutbacks in local authority housing. I have no intention of withdrawing the amendment because I have heard no good reason to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me respond to that.  I do not want to let that go because making statements such as that it is expected that there will be a rapid increase in over-crowding is speculative and there is no basis being put forward by the Senator in support of his point of view.  So I must reject it as being unsupported and not in the tradition of Senator Ryan in the case he makes.  I am saying to Senator Ryan that section 8 of this legislation allows this assessment to be done within one year of the legislation being passed.  It allows it to be done at any time local authority members feel it is justified.  It allows it to be done when the Minister feels that it is justified.  As far as I am <Col N="1881" /> concerned, that is quite a big advance and it certainly makes a nonsense of the situation that existed under the 1966 Act when the five year rule was not being implemented, anyway.  This is much more reasonable and the Senator knows well that the way an assessment is done internationally is by way of sample survey.  That is the way it is being applied in this jurisdiction also.</P>

      <P>I am not sure what sort of evidence the Ministers want me to produce about the future.  By definition, the future is all about speculation.  We do not know any other way.  So the Minister is being a little harsh in saying that when I attempt to say what is going to happen in five years' time I am speculating.  If the Minister has a better way of knowing what is going to happen in 1994 than I do, he can tell me about it.</P>

      <P>If the Minister wants to be flippant about housing he can be, but the rest of us are not.  The estimate in the Official Report for the completion of local authority housing in 1988 is 1,600 local authority houses.  That is half of what were estimated to be completed in 1987.  As reported in the Official Report the funds available as of 27 April 1988 for new house starts for Cork Corporation are nil, for Dublin Corporation nil, for Galway Corporation nil, for Limerick Corporation nil and for Waterford Corporation nil.  That is considerable evidence that we are not going to have nearly enough local authority houses available to house those who will need them.  If they do not live in local authority houses, they are either going to live on the side of the road, or in private rented accommodation, or they are going to share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early seventies the figures shows that about 40 per cent to 50 per cent of local authority houses in Dublin, before the extraordinary achievement of the <Col N="1882" /> housing programmes of the past 15 years, were occupied by more than one family. That is the evidence from the past when we did not build enough houses.  The evidence now is that we are not building enough local authority houses.  It is perfectly reasonable and logical to forecast that four or five years' time we will have the problem I mentioned.  It is based on the best of evidence and I will not wait and see.  That is not the way to run a country.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 29, after &ldquo;make&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and publish&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 relates to the proper functioning of a democracy.  If we oblige housing authorities or any other public body to assemble information, it is important that that sort of information should be widely available.  Since there are extraordinary <Col N="1883" /> provisions under the Official Secrets Act about what can be published or the position under which things can be published, it is extremely important that we make it clear in any legislation to deal with information that the body which assembles that information is both authorised and obliged to make it public.</P>
    <P>The simple import of my amendment is to ensure that everything that a housing authority assemble by way of information under section 8 is made available, not just to members of a housing authority or a particular housing committee of the local authority, but to the public at large, so that the public, anybody interested in the issue and researchers in particular &mdash; people who are interested in the whole issue of housing &mdash; would have access to the best and most authoritative information available.  There is, presumably, a route by which this information can become public via the fact that information will become available to the members of local authorities.  It is a proper representation of the way democracy functions that such information ought to be available, as of right, to the public.  The precise details of how that information should be published could well be dealt with by ministerial circulars which are so plentiful about legislation like this.  It would be quite simple to issue a ministerial circular explaining that publication could be by way of the right of inspection by any interested parties and that there is no need for them to publish large books or anything like that.</P>
    <P>We heard enough about the need to leave legislation flexible to allow for changing circumstances earlier on in the debate on this Bill not to be too worried now about possible semantics regarding the meaning of the word &ldquo;published&rdquo;.  It simply is an attempt on my part to ensure that the upgraded information that will be available &mdash; if these surveys are carried out more than once &mdash; and, if they are carried out with any regularity, will be available on the widest possible basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimates for housing requirements under section 8 of this Bill <Col N="1884" /> will be reported to elected members of local authorities and they will be adopted by the councils.  That will ensure that the adequacy of the estimates will be fully debated by the elected local representatives. These estimates will, of course, be published and become public knowledge in this way.  In addition, there is no requirement in section 53 of the 1966 Housing Act, which is being replaced by this section 8, to publish the reports on housing requirements.  I do not see any merit in introducing such a requirement which could be quite expensive for the smaller housing authorities.  If local authorities want to do it, then it is a matter for themselves.  I will certainly not demand it of them and put them to further expense where local authority members in debating these matters usually have the debates sufficiently well covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We now have the position where the Minister says on the one hand it is published and on the other hand that it is not.  He referred to section 53 of the 1966 Act as not requiring them to be published.  I want to make sure that this information is in the hands of the public.  Is there anything in general legislation about official secrets or otherwise to preclude or prevent any member of a housing authority from making such information public?  In other words, if a member of a local authority makes such information public, is he liable not to receive further information because he is in breach of confidence?  Perhaps those Senators who are members of housing authorities can perhaps explain this to me.  There does not seem to me to be any problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Publish&rdquo; is a word which can have a breadth of meanings.  It seems that a scheme of priorities for lettings of dwellings must be open to inspection by the public under a later section of this Bill because everybody accepts that that should be accessible to the public who <Col N="1885" /> are presumably going to be the beneficiaries of that scheme of priorities.  In a similar way the assessments made of housing requirements under this legislation ought to be accessible to the public as of right and not by some backdoor route.  I cannot understand what the Minister is saying.  If the position is that this material is public knowledge, let us say so.  As I have said on previous sections, we need not argue about the precise wording.  We could simply elaborate on the scheme of lettings and say that assessments under sections 8 and 9 ought to be available for public study.  It would be quite simple.  If such estimates are made and approved by housing authorities will I be able to walk into Cork Corporation and see them as a citizen and not as a Member of the Oireachtas? The answer must be either &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say to Senator Ryan that a housing list is prepared and brought up to date by every local authority.  As Senator Ryan is not a member of a local authority I can understand that he is at sixes and sevens about what happens within the administration of a local authority.  I want to say clearly to Senator Ryan that every iota and every channel is X-rayed and the personnel of every county are examined in depth &mdash; the homeless, people living on their own and people in all types of housing conditions. That information is readily available to the public.  It is readily available on a housing list in every local authority throughout this country and is reviewed from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no problem with this section because I know from my years of experience as a member of a local authority that Mayo County Council and adjoining county councils compare notes on housing. Throughout the country staff officers and high ranking housing administrators from time to time do surveys on other counties.  They survey the requirements in other regions and the progress made by a local authority.  Arising out of that our high tech staff discuss it with the departmental officials who give an overall opinion to the Minister.  Indeed, the <Col N="1886" /> Minister here this evening has spent many years on local authorities and I am sure it is boring for him to have to listen to this in an effort to elicit technical data when it is already available at any information centre in any local authority in connection with the housing list.  I do not think there should be any question or doubt in the mind of Senator Ryan or any other Senator.  No member of a local authority will question the availability of that information.  It is there and it can be seen and it is reviewed from time to time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to Senator Ryan he is trying to ensure that the information is not kept secret.  That is basically what he is saying.  Give me a chance to explain what he is trying to do.  I want to interpret what the Minister has said as well.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan wants to know if this information is available, if it is secret information or if it is open to him as a member of the public, not as an elected Member of the Oireachtas, to walk in and get the information.  To my knowledge this information should be and is available.  It is a matter of public concern that this information should be available. That is the subject of his amendment. The Minister interprets that as putting an onus on the local authority who might not be in a position financially to publish it formally in a written report.  He said there is no need to require the local authority to publish it formally in a report which would be circulated and which would cost money to print.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is saying correctly that this information is available, comes before members of local authorities, is discussed, adopted, rejected or approved by them and in the process of debate it becomes public knowledge and, if the media think it worth while to publish it, they will publish it.  It is available to the public if the media print it.  It is not confidential on the basis that it is discussed at a publicly convened meeting where the press are present.  That is what I understand the Minister to be saying.  A requirement to publish puts an additional legal requirement that they should go into print and publish a booklet or a <Col N="1887" /> report which is probably unnecessary.  In individual cases there is always an element of confidentiality.  There has to be because there are many social and medical problems surrounding the process of approving people in need of rehousing.  Of course that is confidential. It is even confidential to us unless the applicant is with us when we are making representations.  For that reason there must be confidentiality about the applicant and the background to the application and the authority's decision on their estimate of what the requirements are.  Overall I am satisfied that there is no element of secrecy attached to this and that this section is probably strong enough without putting in a requirement to publish.  If I interpreted him correctly, the Minister has assured us that this general overall requirement will become public knowledge.  That is really what Senator Ryan is trying to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, as many questions have yet to be answered.  I am not sure what Senator O'Toole is getting worried about.  I have a fairly good understanding of what goes on and some of it is not perhaps as clear as it ought to be.  For instance, why is it necessary in section 11, which deals with schemes of priorities for lettings, to insert a specific provision under paragraph 12 that a housing authority shall, upon request, permit a scheme made by them, under this section to be inspected during office hours by any person.  If everything that is approved under sections 8 and 9 is public knowledge &mdash; and presumably the scheme under section 11 will also be approved if it is public knowledge &mdash; why is it necessary to put in a specific proviso that the scheme of lettings shall be open to inspection during office hours if it is not necessary under sections 8 and 9?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not particularly worried about the ins and outs and workings of a local authority.  Local authority members are well able to do this.  My function is to <Col N="1888" /> ensure that the legislation which passes through this Oireachtas in workable, consistent and intelligent.  It seems that either the provision in section 11 ought not to be there because it is <i>de facto</i> public knowledge, or else it should be in section 8 and 9.  May I say, incidentally, that public representatives having access to information is not the same as the public having access to information? There is and has been a tendency among our public representatives at all levels as evidenced by the refusal of the contemplated Freedom of Information Bill, to hold on to their monopoly of information. My experience at this stage is that the resistance to freedom of information is more on the political side of our society than on the administrative or Civil Service side.</P>
    <P>Therefore, notwithstanding the fact that the local authority members here believe this information is available &mdash; they could all answer for me &mdash; can anybody tell me how many dwellings in County Mayo, County Tipperary or anywhere are unfit for human habitation, shared involuntarily or overcrowded?  Is that information somewhere written down in the archives of the various local authorities so that somebody ringing up can get it?  If a newspaper rings up will it be made available to a newspaper?  Is that information available like that or is it not?  If it is, then there is no problem. Legislation ought to be consistent and if section 11 provides specifically that the scheme shall be available for public inspection, why is it not said about either the estimates of housing requirements or the housing assessment later on?  If somebody can answer that I can decide whether I want to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>What is involved here is very simple indeed.  Matters are brought before local authorities by way of report. The reports are then considered by the local authority members in public.  It is important to stress &ldquo;in public&rdquo; in so far as there is a public arena where members of the public can come and sit and listen to the debate and, more specifically, <Col N="1889" /> there are media representatives who choose to report on the happenings, workings and discussions that take place at these local authority meetings.  Then if the media think there is sufficient demand by the general public to know about these deliberations they publish certain aspects of the debate.  That is not to say that in the first instance the whole thing is published.  It is public.  If a local authority choose for any reason best known to themselves to publish any information or any report that comes before them, then they are at liberty to do so, but I am not going to oblige them to do it.  I am not going to make it part of legislation that they must do it.  I remind Senators also that when the matter was being considered in the Dáil I took on board an amendment there to add in line 34, page 8, section 8 after &ldquo;to be prepared&rdquo;, &ldquo;and adopted&rdquo; and I regarded that as an important aspect.  It was not just a question of having the matter in the report prepared and brought before the members; the members had to be sufficiently concerned that they were going to adopt the report. I think that is sufficient and adequate in regard to making public any matters that come before the local authority.  I suggest to Senator Ryan that local authority members are well able to bring these matters to the notice of the public and the media always report on such items as this by way of right.  I think the Senator is being unduly cautious in this matter and for that reason he should withdraw the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) the extent to which there is unused residential accommodation <Col N="1890" /> above commercial and/or retail space in buildings,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to add a new subsection providing a requirement that in carrying out this estimate of requirement the local authority in addition to their own functional area would assess the needs and the housing in the private sector.  In this amendment I want just to specify that there is a great deal of unused residential accommodation privately owned &mdash; we are aware of this in urban areas &mdash; which possibly could be made available by way of negotiation with the local authority or otherwise for renting, even in the short term, to overcome some of the problems of homelessness.  It is really to broaden the remit of the housing authority in making this assessment of the needs.  They should be conscious of unused residential accommodation over commercial and retail space.  We would like them at least to look at it and report to the Minister on it.  It may not be available. We understand that the rights of private ownership are still enshrined in the Constitution, but at least if it is available the Minister should be aware of it and then perhaps negotiations on its availability should become a process in which we would address some of the problems in this area.</P>

      <P>With regard to what Senator Ferris said, I suggest when local authorities are assessing housing stock in their area they consider taking into account residential and rental accommodation. In the past, at least when I was very young, most private property was rented.  We have moved away from that to where people own their own houses, but there has been a tendency back to rented accommodation.  This is good in many areas because it helps to <Col N="1891" /> improve housing stocks.  Rather than renting flats people rent private houses in the inner city and they take a greater interest in such accommodation.  That kind of rental accommodation should be taken into account by the local authority when they are assessing the housing needs in their functional area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These two amendments relate to something I spoke about briefly and I do not want to elaborate too much on them now.  We have been accused by people who have done research into the way our housing policy has developed of confusing a building policy with a housing policy.  Both these amendments relate to endeavours to fulfil housing needs by using existing stock, by identifying existing possible routes to accommodation. Since the Minister obviously approves of Threshold &mdash; as I do &mdash; perhaps he ought to accede to their greatest request for legislation to deal with regulation of the private rented sector which they identify as one of the greatest causes of human suffering in their area of competence. Perhaps he should listen to them on that because obviously he approves enormously of them.  There is a delicate balance to be drawn but it can be done. Perhaps we could even get so far as making sure that the existing law on private rented accommodation is enforced. Both these amendments are simply extensions of the nature of a housing assessment and are intended to ensure that options are not overlooked.  The former City Manager in Cork was particularly interested in empty space over commercial properties in or around the city centre in Cork.  The obstacles, whether they be problems of title, access, security, tax structure or whatever to the utilisation of such property for housing ought to be identified and dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said frequently on many issues in this House, the real start of solving a problem is to have all the data on the problem and leaving gaps in the data is the best guarantee that the solution that will be prescribed will be the solution to the wrong problem because <Col N="1892" /> the problem will not be identified properly. That is why amendments Nos. 12 and 13 deserve to be considered and debated and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on them.</P>

      <P>In regard to what Senator Ryan has said, the Government themselves have taken a step in this direction by giving incentives to rented accommodation in designated areas in the inner cities.  Bearing that in mind, I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point that unused residential accommodation is potentially an important factor in the calculation of overall housing requirements.  However, the type of accommodation referred to specifically is only one example of vacant or under-used accommodation and, indeed, it is peculiar to urban areas. Under subsection (2) (a) housing authorities are required to have regard to information on the housing conditions of the area which obviously would include the amount of vacant accommodation, both in the housing authority's own stock and in the private housing stock.  Subsection (2) (f) provides that a housing authority shall have regard to such other matters as the Minister may from time to time direct and this provision can, of course, be used to draw the specific attention of housing authorities to the need to have regard to vacant housing accommodation in the estimates of housing requirements.</P>
      <P>In effect, I do not want to restrict it to possible accommodation that might be available over commercial shops.  That is covered in subsection (2) (e) which states, &ldquo;such other information as the authority consider relevant&rdquo;.  That is the kind of section that enables a local authority to utilise information about any type of housing accommodation vacant over shops, or whatever, and I am not interested in restricting it to one particular kind in the legislation.</P>

      <P>The wording the parliamentary draftsman used in subsection <Col N="1893" /> (2) (e), &ldquo;such other information as the authority consider relevant&rdquo; is very wide-ranging. It could mean anything.  I am glad the Minister has drawn our attention to the fact that it could mean what we are talking about.</P>
      <P>The Minister considered requesting the authority to have regard to other disused accommodation, whether it be over commercial shops, in rural isolated cottages that are locked up because people have gone away, or other non-used housing stock.  It is possible, under this subsection, to request the local authority to get that information and the Minister obviously has the power to do so, but the subsection is worded in such a way that if we had not put down this amendment and elicited the information from him, nobody would have known it could be used for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the Minister's approach to a number of these issues.  If we were to go on the logic he uses in phrases like &ldquo;such other information as the authority consider relevant&rdquo; and &ldquo;such other matters as the Minister may, from time to time, direct&rdquo; we should delete most of section 8 and substitute &ldquo;whatever the local authority look for and whatever the Minister wishes to direct&rdquo;.  First, should the Oireachtas not address itself to attempting to specify important areas of concern?  The evidence seems to suggest that we have often been omitted in previous surveys.  People in this House who have experience in housing authorities would not put down amendments like this if there was no reason to believe that such surveys have not been done with any great enthusiasm or in any great detail in the past.  Secondly, it is bad law to leave issues that are identified as being important to the good will of a Minister.  I do not like centralised Government.  We should have the maximum amount of decentralised Government which involves the maximum of definition of responsibility and of duty.  Thirdly, it is a fact that all large organisations, however efficiently run, have an inertia all their own.  Since it appears from what people have said <Col N="1894" /> that most housing authorities have not been particularly enthusiastic about doing the two things referred to in these amendments, it is quite clear that these provisions are necessary.</P>
      <P>There is a policy question involved here &mdash; the need to direct our thinking about how to meet housing requirements away from simply building more houses into making the maximum, optimum use of existing housing stock.  If there are constitutional requirements why people can leave potentially usable housing accommodation empty or derelict, we should address those matters also but that is a matter for a later discussion.  There is no reason why specific issues should not be addressed.  I do not believe &mdash; and I do not believe the Minister does either &mdash; that the Minister has a monopoly on wisdom and that the issues he identifies and puts into his Bill are the only ones that need to be addressed.  Why is it necessary to take information about, for example, the people who are homeless and not about the existence of possible cheap, low-cost solutions to their problems? It is a narrow and limited perspective to presume that the solution to the problems of people who are without housing must lie in the provision of local authority housing.  There are potentially other solutions and we ought to be directing housing authorities to look at them. It is not enough to leave it to a busy Minister or an equally busy city manager who are already swamped with too much work, to identify possible new areas of work, particularly at a time when housing authorities are desperately short of staff, as most of them appear to be now.</P>

      <P>In page 9, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) It shall be the function of a housing authority within six months of the commencement of this Act, and <Col N="1895" /> thereafter at least once in every five years, or at such intervals, being less than five years, as the Minister may direct from time to time, to inspect the houses in their functional area and to ascertain&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to what extent there exist in the area houses which are in any respect unfit or unsuitable for human habitation,</P>
    <P>(b)  any overcrowding existing in the area, and</P>

    <P>and shall publish or cause to have published the results of the inspection.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first of the later sections of the Bill which refer to the homeless.  This Bill encapsulates the inadequacy of official thinking about the problems of the homeless, in that a survey can be done once one year after the commencement of this Bill, and then at some indeterminate point in the future, to identify the number of homeless people &mdash; whether they are homeless or living in temporary moveable accommodation.  It shows a total lack of comprehension of the nature of the population who are homeless in our society, and presumes a rigidly fixed homeless population who are not in a permanent state of flux, who are not affected by economic circumstances, by changes in the housing market and so on.  It presumes that we can identify the numbers of people who are above a certain age, or the numbers of people who are in psychiatric institutions, and that we can see the homeless as an identifiable category.  I do not think there is anything malicious in this, it is simply a total lack <Col N="1896" /> of comprehension to presume that an occasional survey carried out as frequently, or as infrequently, as a housing authority or the Minister responsible sees fit, can give anything other than a farcical estimate of the numbers of the homeless. That is the sort of total lack of official comprehension of the nature of the problems of homeless people that makes legislation of the kind we should have almost impossible to get through the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Minister ought not to try to lead us to section 9 because the possibilities of doing what is needed under section 9, if what is provided under section 8 is not done properly, are severely inhibited.  If he refers to a sporadic, uneven and every-so-often survey of the extent to which there are people homeless in a local authority area, it ought to be done in a realistic way which relates to the problems of those who are being surveyed.  This sort of haphazard attempt to assess housing requirements could not possibly work in dealing with the homeless because of the fluctuating nature of that population.</P>

      <P>This section is a good example of decentralised government and it sets down simply the estimate of housing requirements &mdash; when it will be done, how it will be done and the type of information that will be sought by that estimate.  That is all it is asked to do.  I think Senator Ryan is ignoring section 9 which is directed at local authority housing needs.  He is confusing the two things and trying to bunch them together and lead me on to deal with section 9 when we are talking about section 8.  I am not impressed at that technique.</P>

      <P>With regard to subsection (2) what significance does the Minister think should be attached to the sort of figures that are done on a once off basis by Dublin Corporation about the numbers of homeless people in Dublin?  What significance will it have if it is done within the next 12 months from the commencement of this section and is not done again?

      <P>In so far as the first assessment is concerned, it is very important. It is going to be done.  The legislation states that.  Therefore we will know what the state of play is right then.  When one considers it, housing authorities are constantly in touch with the ongoing housing problems in their own areas and they will not ignore aspects of the problem just to accommodate me or anybody else when those problems come to their attention. As Senator Doyle said on a few occasions, they will address the problems, and without fear or favour they will have reports issued on them and I take it that the media will give the usual coverage to their deliberations on such reports. It is very useful and I would not minimise what is being attempted here at all.  To suggest otherwise is to do a major injustice to the local authorities and to the members who serve on them.  They are very conscious of their duties, of the needs of their constituents.  This is just a formal assessment we are talking about in section 8.  The assessment will be done; <Col N="1898" /> the Estimate will be made available, it will be brought before local authority members; it will be adopted by them; they may publish it if they so wish.  One way or the other it will be public knowledge. If and when circumstances change they can have another assessment done. I really think Senator Ryan has pursued this too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I keep addressing the Chair.  Can anybody explain to me the logic of doing a once off survey in one year's time of the extent to which there are people living in accommodation which, by definition is temporary or moveable and then not do so again for an indefinite period but to rely on those figures?  The Minister refuses point blank to have these things updated on a regular obligatory basis.  Yet those kinds of figures will be meaningless within one or two years.  Either of the provisions of paragraph (b) ought to be a separate section with different rules governing how it is operated.  Otherwise it ought to be done on a yearly or at best a three yearly basis, neither of which is guaranteed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am not disputing, as I said at the beginning, the bona fides of those who inserted this into the Bill.  Indeed I am not disputing the bona fides of the Minister on this issue.  What I am simply saying is that to insert a provision like that shows, to my mind an utter lack of comprehension about the nature of the population who are homeless in our society and the fact that it is a fluctuating population, not a static group of X thousand people who will be there next year, the year after and the year after.  They move around, they move in and out of private rented accommodation, in and out of night shelters and hostels; they are not a fixed group of people one can count on O'Connell Bridge on a particular day and who will be there until we do something for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are a fluctuating population and to suggest that one can do once in 12 months time an assessment of the extent to which there are people living in moveable accommodation, and presume they <Col N="1899" /> will not move that accommodation, and use that in any way to build up a statistical data base seems to me to be something close to nonsense.  I am not being the least bit unreasonable.  I would simply like to know what significance such data will have if there is not a constant obligation on housing authorities to update it.  We have removed the five yearly obligation; we have refused to insert another obligation.  It, therefore, makes absolutely no sense to have it there, that is all I have to say about it.</P>

Other matters will come to the knowledge of local authorities, whether it is the census returns for their areas or development plan reviews which will prod them on or suggest to them that they should consider further their estimates for the requirements of housing, be it local authority or in the private sector.

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 30, after &ldquo;make&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and publish&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have discussed this question at length before and I am still at a loss to understand why there is such resistance to it. The suggestion that there would be some cost in publishing a document which has been presumably printed in order to be circulated to members of local authorities, as the Minister has suggested, seems to me to be utterly ludicrous.  If the Minister believes it is a good thing to have public access to these documents, he could simply introduce a provision similar to the one in section 11 which guarantees that under paragraph 12 a housing authority shall, upon request, permit a scheme made by them under this section to be inspected during office hours.  It would be quite feasible to introduce a similar provision to guarantee that any of the information gathered under section 8 or section 9 would be available to the public.  That would simply mean that a copy of what was circulated to local authority members would be available for inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1901" /> I defy the Minister to explain to me how that could cost any money.  It is really beyond my comprehension, unless there is something involved in all this that I do not know about.  It seems that if it is deemed necessary that public access ought to be guaranteed, there is no reason not to guarantee similar access to information assembled under section 9 without any cost to a housing authority. I do not understand the resistance to it other than the obvious fact that the Minister does not want to be responsible for the Dáil coming back and that is not a particularly convincing one.  Obviously we all accept that the Minister is not going to accept any amendments since the Bill is being debated after the Dáil has risen, which is a regrettable fact.  The Minister might give us a reason anyway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing assessments which would have to be carried out within one year of the implementation of section 9 and at least every three years thereafter is a new departure for housing authorities. This is the first time this kind of provision has been installed in legislation. Section 9 would apply to all housing authorities, including the small urban authorities and town commissioners.  There is no provision in section 53 of the Housing Act, 1966, requiring housing authorities to publish reports on their five yearly assessments of housing needs.  I do not consider it appropriate to introduce such a requirement for this new and more frequent exercise on local authority housing needs which, as I have indicated, must be carried out by even the smallest housing authority.  It could also be quite expensive for those small authorities to publish such reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senators I expect that the results of these assessments will be made available to elected members.  That has always been the case.  I do not want to put a statutory requirement on small authorities and towns commissioners to publish a report on the assessments as it is not necessary to do so.  The previous legislation was not found wanting as regards the making available of information to local authorities, elected <Col N="1902" /> members and the public in general.  That is generally accepted across the board as having been an adequate way to deal with requests for information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between the Minister telling us what he thinks and telling us why he has come to that conclusion.  There is no point in quoting section 53 of the 1966 Act.  The point I am trying to make is that an important part of a local authority's attempt to make housing provision, a scheme of lettings, is the making available of information to the public.  If the Minister is quibbling about the use of the word &ldquo;publish,&rdquo; which he should not do, we can always insert a similar word in section 11.  That is not the issue.  I invite the Minister to explain to me how a requirement to allow inspection of these reports by members of the public could cost money and, if it does not cost money, what has he got against it?</P>
      <P>There are interesting questions on the difference between sections 8 and 9 but we can come to them when we deal with the section.  I do not want to delay the House on a fine summer's evening but I would like to know the Minister's reasons for not accepting this.  I do not want to know that he thinks it is not a good idea. I want to know why he thinks it is not a good idea and it would be very helpful to me and to the House if he told us why he thinks it is not a good idea.  As I have said, I would like to know why it would cost money for the public to have access to a copy of these reports in the offices of the local authority during normal office hours.  That does not appear to be something that would place an impossible burden on even the smallest authority.  It is important information and the public are entitled to know what is contained in those reports and I fail to see why they should not be made available.  I would like the Minister to explain why it would cost so much money to do what is already provided for under section 11.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>In an effort to be helpful, perhaps we should try to be a bit more selective in our choice of words. <Col N="1903" /> If Senator Ryan is suggesting that the information should be made available &mdash; it is not for me to speak on behalf of the Minister &mdash; as far as I am aware all that information is readily available to any member of the public.  As to whether or not there should be a requirement to publish reports, why should we publish only this particular list?  Why not all the other lists?  Any local authority member can see the monster we spawned in relation to the requirements under the Planning Act.  All the documentation has to be made available to the public at every courthouse and every county council office.  They must even place notices on billboards on public streets at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed, but we have to draw the line somewhere.  For example, the agenda that goes out to every member of the local authority of which I am member is also issued to the local newspapers who are invited to attend.  They do not have to do so but they do.  It is not entirely fair to suggest that the information is not being made available and we must be careful to ensure that we are not striking at the very fundamental purpose for which we elect local authorities.  Why elect local authorities at all if every bit of information has to be publicised and circularised to every citizen in the county?  It should suffice to establish that the information is available to any member of the public who requires it from the county manager or the county secretary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator O'Callaghan has said.  As a member of a local authority, I am aware that when housing officials come to us with their plans and proposals for the future, the press always take up the issues concerned.  I have no doubt that when this statutory requirement to publish or to bring forward a list comes into effect, the press will follow it up.  I do not think <Col N="1904" /> it is necessary to insert a requirement into the Bill that a list should be published because it will be published in any event. Where does Senator Brendan Ryan want it published?  It will be published in the newspapers and surely that should suffice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>People are forever telling me that, because they are members of local authorities, they know this, that and the other.  In reply to Senator Haughey's question the truth is that this is not a matter that I would worry too much about.  It is a matter of interpretation. The Minister explained to me earlier that I could leave in his safe hands the precise interpretation of terms, particularly the definition of &ldquo;homeless&rdquo;, which could be contained in an explanatory memorandum, circular or guidelines and I would simply say that, on the question on publishing this sort of information, similar guidelines would be quite satisfactory to me.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that, if a local authority were to choose not to publish this data, there would be nothing to force them to do so and if Dublin Corporation were to decide in two years time that they did not want to have this data published for one reason or another they could not be forced to do so.  I would regard that as undemocratic, improper and an insult to the participation of the citizen in democracy.  What democracy is ultimately about is the full participation of each citizen in the process of Government. We can come back to the interesting differences between sections 8 and 9 when we deal with the amendment but I do not want the local authorities to make available or to circularise documents. I never said any such thing.  I have kept on emphasising that what is contained in section 11 is the right of a member of the public to inspect the scheme of lettings for local authority houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand how we can tell people that they have that right while not being able to tell them that they have a similar right with regard to the information assembled under sections 8 and <Col N="1905" /> 9.  That astonishes me.  It suggests a profound fear of the ordinary citizen which people who are elected by ordinary citizens have least reason to have because they know they have the trust of ordinary people.  I fail to understand why this cannot be accepted in principle, if not in detail.  There is no argument about the detail.  We should guarantee that important information is made available to the electorate, to people involved in research, to prospective participants in local elections and to Members of the Oireachtas who are not members of local authorities who may wish to know what is going on in their own areas.  My own view is that Members of the Oireachtas should not be members of local authorities as it causes confusion in our democracy.  I have had a motion to that effect on the Order Paper for some time. I am sure it was brought to the Minister's attention at some stage or another.  There should be a proper separation of powers between central Government, the Oireachtas and local authority membership. I have long held that belief and I still hold it.</P>
    <P>That is neither here or there on this issue.  Perhaps the Minister will explain to me why he thinks it is so important that the public should have a guarantee on a right to access to information on the scheme of lettings while not having a similar guarantee on a right to access to important information on which those scheme of lettings will be based.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to know now what we are really discussing because under section 9 the housing authorities make an assessment of their own housing needs from the housing lists.  They then prepare a scheme of lettings which is published and handed out to the public. In Dublin Corporation everyone knows exactly the number of points that are allocated for inadequate living accommodation, or lack of a bedroom, bathroom or whatever.  It is all documented and equated on a points scheme.  We encourage the public to avail of this information so that they can understand the scheme and work out for themselves what <Col N="1906" /> points they are entitled to.  From time to time local councils amend that scheme. In the early eighties we found that there was a large amount of unfit housing stock, but at that stage people in unfit accommodation only got bonus points, which were not sufficient to get them rehoused. I remember at one of the meetings I moved rather cleverly because a number of people in my own area were affected &mdash; that the bonus points should be changed into a priority.  The council agreed and it became a priority, so everyone in unfit accommodation was put at the top of the list and was housed as a priority.  The document stating that is available and always was available to the public.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (2), between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) are single,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One of the categories of extreme need that has been identified in the past number of years for housing are people who are single.  There are a variety of reasons for believing that they do not do well on local authority housing letting schemes, understandable reasons, because of priority of letting, but I believe very strongly that we have failed in many areas of policy formulation in this country because of the inadequate information base that has been used to formulate that policy.  We ought to know the numbers of persons who are single in a particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to make a big thing out of this, I simply suggest that in terms of <Col N="1907" /> people who are homeless that the existence of the single homeless as a specific category within the group who are homeless is an important consideration which ought to affect, in particular, the nature of provision for people who are single. We do not need large local authority houses for people who are single and who are in need of accommodation.  We need small units which are comfortable and private.  Neither do we need hostels for people who are single.  We need decent basic accommodation.  It can be low cost accommodation and it need not necessarily always be local authority accommodation. That is why it is important to identify the numbers who are single and who may well be able to be accommodated without the necessity of getting tangled up in large-scale house building projects.  That is why I think the question of the numbers who are single ought to be referred to this survey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that this amendment is both ambiguous and unnecessary. Persons who are in need of housing and unable to provide it from their own resources are eligible for inclusion in an assessment under section 9, whatever their marital status or whether they comprise simply one person households.  It would be wrong to identify single persons as a particular category of housing need over and above the relevant criteria of housing need such as being homeless, living in overcrowded conditions or otherwise in need of housing.  I remind Senators that local authorities do house single people who are not elderly.  I would say also that single means that you are not married, it does not mean that you are homeless, and for that reason I do not want to include this particular definition in the list as set out in section 9.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a member of two housing authorities and it has alarmed me somewhat in recent times the number of single people from their late thirties onwards who are now applying for local authority housing.  In the past they did not apply because they felt that they <Col N="1908" /> would not be housed anyway but in recent times they have been applying in larger numbers.  I take the Minister's point that this category is covered in the other sections of the Bill.  I feel that this group could do with a little boost to morale in terms of it being specifically stated that they may apply.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to make is that we are not building sufficient numbers of small houses to cater for this group. Whereas the Minister may feel this is unnecessary.  I submit that this group have not until quite recently been applying to local authorities and if there were identified as a specific group it would, as I have stated, given them a morale boost. They would have some better hope of housing than the vague entitlement which they have under other sections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <P>Their need heretofore has not been specifically identified.  The categories mentioned were families and elderly people.  Local authorities have been working them in but they are not specifically mentioned or named.  I believe that a statement from the Minister, aside from this Act altogether, that these people may apply and are welcome to apply would go a long way to meeting the problem we are highlighting here this evening.</P>

      <P>I will state that for you and I think I stated it in my original reply to it.  If that is all that is required here as far as the single people are concerned I would be happy to oblige.  In fact, single people are being and have been accommodated and there has been no difficulty with it.  It has not been found contrary to any existing legislation or any thoughts or interpretation on any particular legislation. I am happy to say that local authorities have taken that on board without any difficulty whatsoever and they do not require it to be put in a separate way <Col N="1909" /> here that we isolate single people in a particular way.  I take your point.  I recognise that local authorities are doing the right thing in the matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) Each housing authority shall furnish to the Minister an annual report on its activities under this Act giving details of its existing housing requirements, its prospective housing requirements, the number of persons provided with housing in the course of the year, the number of applicants refused, the number of persons provided with housing who did not formally make an application, information available in relation to housing conditions in its area, the number of houses unfit or unsuitable for human habitation, overcrowded, shared involuntarily, or which are expected to be lost; information on the numbers of people homeless or living in temporary or moveable accommodation; expected changes in the size and structure of the population in the area; the number of people elderly, disabled or handicapped, who are not reasonably able to meet their accommodation needs themselves, and any other information which the housing authority thinks fit to include.</P>
      <P>(8)  The Minister shall present to each House of the Oireachtas an annual report compiled from and containing all the material contained in the reports furnished to him by housing authorities and any other information he thinks fit to include.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What this amendment endeavours to do is to pursue the logic of what I have been trying to do with sections 8 and 9, and that is to make sure that information is made available, organised and published so that we know what is happening to our housing provision.  If the local authorities <Col N="1910" /> are as good as the members of local authorities here tell me they are about dealing with housing problems then all relevant information ought to be on record, every piece of it.  They are the criteria used to make housing available.  If the information is on record it ought not to be a difficult job to make it available to the Minister.  If it is made available to the Minister on a regular basis it is not impossible to make that information known.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important, as I keep saying, that if the problem of housing is to be dealt with other than in the classical way of simply building more and more houses, which may not be what people need or want at all, a good data base of information about the structure and the nature of the problem ought to be put together.  The amendment endeavours to ensure that good quality information is assembled, collated and published so that the public, the politicians and the researchers can know what they are talking about and that people, like those the Minister quoted with such approval earlier, can have access to good, hard solid and up-to-date information.  The most likely source of such information ought to be, and one trusts that it is, the housing authorities and in that case the simple and sensible thing to do is to make that information available to the central authority and have the central authority publish it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Information on the operation of any provision of this Bill and, indeed, on any part of the housing code, may be obtained from housing authorities without recourse to statutory provisions as is suggested and proposed here.  The amendments suggested by the Senator are unnecessary and could be potentially harmful to the extent that they could weaken the Minister's position in obtaining information which was not specifically referred to in the subsection or which, for example, the housing authority did not think fit to include in their annual report to the Minister.  I used the wording suggested in the proposed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1911" /> Furthermore, the bulk of the information sought by my Department from housing authorities is on a quarterly rather than an annual basis.  A substantial amount of information on the programmes and activities of housing authorities is already published in the quarterly and annual bulletins of housing statistics and in my Department's annual report.  The publication of additional information on particular aspects of local authority housing programmes can be considered as necessary or as appropriate. An enormous amount of information already exists and comes to the Department not on an annual basis but on a quarterly basis, and often more frequently if the Minister so requires it.</P>
    <P>I do not want any extra, more elaborate or restrictive reporting arrangement. The amendment suggests a more restrictive arrangement than that which is currently available to the Minister.  We have enough information in so far as housing statistics are concerned.  I do not regard it as being necessary to have this extra information furnished to the Minister. I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9) In so far as this section applies to persons to whom section 13 applies, an assessment under this section shall include an assessment of the need to provide sites for caravans for such persons.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 9 refers to the obligation on a housing authority to make an assessment of the need for the provision by the authority of adequate and suitable housing accommodation for certain persons.  That is fine and nobody would quibble with the intent but subsection (2) then states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a housing <Col N="1912" /> authority in making an assessment under this section shall have regard to the need for housing of people who &mdash; (a) are homeless, (b) are persons to whom section 13 applies.</P>
    <P>Section 13 refers to the travelling community. It has echoes of &ldquo;Lawrence of Arabia&rdquo; but it actually refers to the travelling community, to persons belonging to the class of persons who traditionally pursue or have pursued a nomadic way of life.  I can understand the difficulties there in regard to definition and I will not argue with the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>It is an inadequate response to the needs of travelling people to talk about them in terms of housing accommodation. Many people, including the Minister in the light of section 13, recognise that many members of the travelling community would prefer good quality sites.  It seems to me, therefore, that if we are going to have a housing assessment in the proper way and have regard to the needs of the travelling community, a realistic part of that assessment would be an assessment of the need to make provision for sites.  That is what the amendment attempts to do by stating that in so far as this section applies to persons to whom section 13 applies, an assessment under this section shall include an assessment of the need to provide sites for caravans for such persons.  It seems to me that it would be quite difficult to expect local authorities to do what is expected of them under section 13 if they do not get a good incentive and do not have an obligation to find out and identify the potential numbers of such sites that require to be provided.  That is why, under section 9, it ought to be necessary, as well as all the other matters, to identify the number of sites that might be needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>A small clarification might help to settle the matter as far as the Senator's problem is concerned.  Subsection (2) (b) applies to persons to whom section 13 applies, such as travellers. They are already specifically identified as a category of need to whom the housing <Col N="1913" /> authority must have regard in their housing assessment.  Section 13 deals with the provision by the housing authority of residential halting sites for travellers.  It is acknowledged that the provision of residential halting sites is the most suitable response to the accommodation needs of many, not all, travelling families.  If necessary I am prepared to make it clear in the guidelines that I will be sending out to housing authorities what I expect when they are undertaking a housing assessment under section 9.  That should help to clarify the position for the Senator.</P>

      <P>My concentration lapsed for a second.  I have not eaten since this morning.  That is probably the reason and I do not anticipate eating for a while yet. Did the Minister say that in the guidelines he was going to tell people that under section 9 he expected them to assess the need for the provision of residential halting sites?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine except that the evidence of the last 15 years is that while some authorities did a great job, other authorities did not.  Limerick Corporation has not exactly set the world on fire in its provision of residential halting sites, for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the first time the Minister said that about anything I said in the three days we debated this Bill. Therefore, I do not believe a ministerial interpretation will shift Limerick Corporation from their resolute refusal.  I hope, perhaps, Mr. Justice Costello may have shifted them but I do not believe a ministerial interpretation will shift them from their position of recalcitrance to a more reasonable response.  Therefore, it does appear to me that while perhaps the Minister and I are in agreement that the assessment of the need for the provision of sites ought to be a part of this it will not become a part of it unless they are <Col N="1914" /> made to do it, in other words, they are obliged to do it.  The Minister will have to agree that circulars, interpretations and guidelines are all very fine but they have no force in law.  If the Minister was to tell me he will ensure that the regulations implemented under this Bill are to have specific provision I would listen to him because that would be an obligation on housing authorities to do something. Guidelines are very useful and I am sure most local authorities welcome them, but they are no guarantee of action.  I am sure the Minister has a large file of circulars sent to local authorities about the problems of the travelling community all of which have been responded to excellently in some areas and all of which have been ignored with equal resolution by other housing authorities.  That seems to be the evidence of the record.  Why should on more circular, or one more guideline, make any difference where housing authorities are either unwilling or unable &mdash; mostly unwilling &mdash; to do what the Minister and many Members of the Oireachtas want them to do?  It seems to me that the only way is to make it obligatory either by legislation or by regulation.  If the Minister gives me an assurance that he will do that by regulation I will withdrawn the amendment but, if he does not, I will have to pursue the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say in response is that the provision of halting sites, serviced or otherwise by local authorities for travellers, is a distinct and different matter from the question of the assessment of the need for such a provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No amount of eloquent nods from the Minister in my direction will persuade me to withdraw my amendment. What I want to know is, will he tell local authorities by regulation that they have to do an assessment.  If they have not to do an assessment how, in God's name, are they going to make adequate provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already stated to the Senator when he had his lapse of <Col N="1915" /> concentration because of lack of food, the guidelines would point out to them that they would have to consider that matter in so far as the assessment is concerned. That would be made quite clear to them.  As the Senator has admitted, in the vast majority of cases what is expected in that regard is quite clearly understood.  If it is necessary to reiterate it again in further guidelines, when I am dealing with the matter on the next occasion I will be happy to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister emphasised that section 8, in regard to the estimate of housing requirements, requires that the housing authority shall cause a report thereon to be prepared and adopted by the authority.  Section 9 does not impose any such obligation.  Can the Minister explain the difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 and section 9 deal with two different matters, as the Senator knows.  Section 9 deals with the local authority's housing assessment.  It is an administrative function.  All that information will be available to the local authority members.  Without seeking to provoke the Senator in any way, it occurs to me that it is an acceptable face of democracy, and the Senator referred to that.  One of the acceptable faces of democracy so far as I am concerned is that people elect local representatives to carry out their business on their behalf at local authority level.  When local representatives consider reports and assessments made and put before them by the Administration, they act on behalf of the electorate and that is adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody could argue with what the Minister had said.  It would be helpful if the Minister would explain, if he puts such emphasis on the obligation to have the report under section 8 adopted, what is the status of the provisions under section 9?  It does not appear that it has to be adopted by the authority.  If that is the case why does it have to be discussed by the authority?  Is <Col N="1917" /> it an internal matter to be dealt with by the manager and the officials?  There is no obligation that the assessments made under section 9 have to be adopted by the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large the provisions under section 9 are administrative and that is recognised by the Senator's previous amendment, amendment No. 18, in which he sought that certain information would be furnished to me as Minister. As I have stated, all that information is already readily available.  It is that information from the assessments that determines housing allocations.  In so far as section 9, regarding assessments of local authority needs, is concerned, it is an administrative provision and that is adequately catered for.  Section 8 deals with the whole housing arrangement, whether public or private, and that is of a different nature, as I think the Senator will concede.</P>

I am surprised that an eminent Senator in the House can project a lack of knowledge.  In my understanding, every local authority in Ireland have very extensive lists which they submit in support of claims for financial assistance for housing.  That list is revised every month.  What local authority do not have a housing meeting every month?  The minutes are presented at the council meeting and controversial matters <Col N="1918" /> are discussed with the various political parties.  The information is made public in the press and is available in any library and from the Government Information Service.  Information is available to people as to how many people are on a housing list, the categories, the income bracket and how long they are on the housing list.  It also includes information on their families. That information is available on computer at present.  As a member of a local authority, I am not a qualified person if I do not have that information.  Every member of a local authority should have that knowledge.</P>

For some time past people who leave psychiatric hospitals and homes have been housed by local authorities.  The local authority of which I am a member have provided sheltered accommodation for six or eight people to enable them to regain their feet in society.  I would encourage the Minister to request other local authorities to do likewise and help people who suffer from psychiatric illnesses to find accommodation in local authority housing.  This is a very sensitive issue.  This practice has succeeded in many areas in which it has been applied in Dublin.

      <P>In page 10, subsection (1) between lines 44 and 45 to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) take such other steps, as they may consider appropriate, to ensure the availability of suitable accommodation for such persons.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are many things wrong with this section.  It is an appalling section, totally inadequate, almost useless and fails entirely to address the problem it sets out to solve.  Unfortunately, because of the Standing Orders of this House it is impossible to introduce amendments to deal with the substance of my objections to it.  We can only deal with the problems when we are dealing with the section itself.  The nature of the process is not something about which I have any right to complain.  If I ever get into Government I will take a different view on those matters but for the time being I cannot do anything about the fundamental inadequacy of section 10.  All one can do at this stage is, as is the aim of my amendments, try to make something useful out of a very poor section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of my amendments adds another power to the powers which the housing authority may use.  It simply states that they may &ldquo;take such other steps, as they may consider appropriate, to ensure the availability of suitable accommodation for such persons&rdquo;.  I would hate housing authorities to be prevented from doing things they might wish to do, in cases where they are well disposed, simply because the provisions under subsection (1) are too limited. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that an additional subsection ought to be added on to the section which would enlarge their powers.  Because the Minister apparently differs from me in his belief of how local authorities will implement or operate this section, he ought to be open to the prospect of extending their flexibility, since they are, in his view, going to be remarkably responsive under this section, and they ought to be allowed to do a range of <Col N="1920" /> things, if they so wish, other than those specifically referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite clear exactly what the amendment seeks to achieve.  If it is intended to imply a statutory obligation to house homeless persons, I have already indicated that an approach which puts an obligation on local authorities to house one category of persons above all others is not appropriate.  The Government's basic approach is a combination of providing extra resources to voluntary bodies and new powers to housing authorities as provided for in section 10. These new powers provide housing authorities with a whole range of alternatives to deal with individual cases of homelessness. They are, of course, additional to the use by the authority of their own housing accommodation to meet the needs of individual homeless persons. Housing authorities, particularly the larger urban authorities, have an amount of accommodation which has become vacant and which is available for homeless persons and emergency cases.</P>
      <P>I would also foresee that local authorities would enter into arrangments with voluntary bodies to provide accommodation for the homeless with grants persons.  This is precisely why the Government are assisting in the development of voluntary housing accommodation for the homeless with grants of up to 95 per cent of costs.  Apart from arranging accommodation with a voluntary organisation, housing authorities will be able to assist the homeless persons financially and otherwise and will also be able to arrange private rented accommodation where this is appropriate.  I do not think that the amendment would add anything meaningful to the powers that have already been set out in section 10 which are far reaching and adequate to deal with the situation as I find it now.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (11), between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e)  minimum standards of accommodation, having regard to such matters as floor area, bed space, washing, toilet and bathing facilities, heating arrangements and personal privacy in the event of the housing authority making arrangements under subsection (1);&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A member of a local authority whom I met recently told me that the manager had said to him that all he would have to do under this is provide a few units of Dickensian accommodation and he would meet his obligations under section 10.  That is how that member of a local authority told me the executive authority in that housing authority interpreted the implementation of the power under section 10 &mdash; a couple of units of Dickensian accommodation.  Whatever the Minister's experience of people dealing with this matter, no voluntary organisation who deal with the homeless and who are less than enlightened in their views should be allowed to provide, for people who have suffered quite a lot, an inadequate standard of accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I prefer my own amendment and I would not quibble with Senator Doyle's amendment either, I think the Minister ought to take unto himself the power to ensure that whatever accommodation is made available meets adequate minimum standards.  We have had the appalling spectacle in Britain of people getting rich out of the problem of the homeless, crowding large numbers of people into appalling accommodation, into substandard accommodation, and being able to enforce that overcrowding by the use of heavy-handed security methods.  The proper way to minimise the risk of such occurrences, to ensure that people are not dumped into second grade, poor <Col N="1922" /> quality accommodation and to ensure that there are minimum standards of accommodation with regard to obvious things such as floor area, bed space, washing, toilet and bathing facilities, heating arrangements, personal privacy, etc., is for the Minister to take unto himself the power to specify such standards by regulation. I would prefer &mdash; and if Senator Doyle does not push his amendment I will push mine &mdash; that the minimum standards ought to be specified in detail.</P>
    <P>There is no point in taking people off the streets by putting them into poor quality accommodation.  I will not argue with the Minister's specifications of minimum standards but it ought to be made clear that minimum standards are going to be insisted upon and they must be insisted upon in a way which is enforceable and in which they can be assessed and measured.  Amendment No. 23 proposes that, in the regulations to deal with the implementation of the powers conferred on local authorities under this section and the unfortunately limited responsibility they will have, whatever they do be up to a reasonable standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Ryan I believe it is appropriate, if at all possible, that we set down some minimum standards of accommodation, as specified either in this amendment or the amendment in the name of Senator Joe Doyle. We go a bit further in our amendment and specify what we consider to be the minimum standards.  I was appalled to hear the comments of an executive of a housing authority, whether it is county manager or otherwise, who interpreted the section in that way.  If that is the impression given to managers who have overall responsibility for housing, then Senator Ryan is correct to be concerned about how local authorities respond to this problem.  I do not think a manager would interpret the section that way but I accept what Senator Ryan has said as being a valid criticism of somebody's point of view.  I suppose this cannot be verified, but it does lend weight to our desire to specify certain standards.  Floor area, bed space, washing and bathroom <Col N="1923" /> facilities are minimum requirements for any local authority nowadays.  Hopefully all the accommodation local authorities provide meet with these standards, with the possible exception of emergency accommodation such as caravans or mobile homes.  This accommodation would not necessarily meet with these criteria but they would be considered to be emergency or interim arrangements and local authorities would normally house these people when a house becomes available.  People who live in substandard accommodation such as caravans and mobile homes are considered to be eligible for rehousing on the basis that caravans or mobile homes are not a satisfactory answer to the problem: They would be an emergency answer but not a satisfactory one.  I do not think there is anything wrong with trying to set down standards and I am anxious to hear the Minister's response to this reasonable amendment.</P>

      <P>In my amendment I have asked that minimum standards be set for accommodation.  Senators Ryan, Ferris, O'Shea and Harte have put flesh on my amendment and I will withdraw my amendment in favour of theirs.  Senator Ryan was right in saying that there have been terrible happenings in Britain in relation to the housing of people in private accommodation.  One incident which comes to mind was a fire in Blackpool where a number of people who were living in very poor quality accommodation lost their lives.  I would certainly support their amendment in relation to the minimum standards of accommodation which would put pressure on local authorities to provide proper accommodation.  I am fearful of how local authorities might interpret the provisions. I would be surprised if they interpreted it as did the manager who spoke to Senator Ryan.  I hope that would not happen.  The Minister must write in some safeguards to ensure it does not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of prescribed <Col N="1924" /> minimum standards for voluntary housing accommodation or other accommodation provided for homeless persons was raised in my discussions with representatives of the Simon Community in June, 1987.  We spent a long time talking about it.  I am not going to single out any one organisation except to say that they reflected the view that might very well have been held on this matter by a lot of similar types of bodies.</P>
      <P>At the meeting I indicated my very strong reservations regarding any attempt to lay down minimum standards applicable to accommodation for homeless persons only arranged by housing authorities.  The Department have issued standards for the provision of voluntary housing accommodation, including hostel type accommodation, under the voluntary housing scheme.  Housing authorities should have regard to these standards when arranging accommodation for a homeless person.  Because of the definition of &ldquo;homeless&rdquo;, as set out in section 2, the provision of accommodation in a night shelter or similar institution would not be appropriate.</P>
      <P>With regard to private rented accommodation, virtually all relevant housing authorities have made by-laws in this matter relating to minimum standards under section 70 of the 1966 Act.  I have been pursuing it here; its provisions are quite extensive.  In addition, regulations have been made under the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, governing the standards of former rent-controlled dwellings.  I consider it more appropriate, therefore, that existing standards should be used and enforced rather than attempting to devise another layer of standards applicable only to accommodation occupied by homeless persons. I am not anxious to separate a particular category of person and say that a minimum standard will apply to him or her type and his or her types only.  The matter is covered in legislation already.  If the provision is properly applied it makes these amendments unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect, it is not always applied; that is the problem.  The <Col N="1925" /> private rented sector is a good example. Local authorities can devise whatever regulations they like, and they have, but they are certainly not enforced.  You only have to look around places like Rathmines, areas close by to where I live, to see the poor type accommodation available for letting in the private sector. The Minister says that the regulations are enforced but, unfortunately I would have to say they are not enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Senator that that is not really our problem here. I am saying that legislation exists already in so far as minimum standards are concerned generally in relation to both local authority and private lettings.  If the job is not being done, it is not really for consideration here.  It is not necessary to write it in here specifically in so far as one particular category is concerned.  I am not seeking to isolate them from the other categories already catered for in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the other categories that the Minister speaks of are dealt with already in other legislation.  The Department have published a set of standards to which local authorities adhere.  Certainly the provisions of this Bill address some of the problems of the homeless.  I see nothing wrong with writing in at least an aspiration that some minimum standard should be adhered to.  We are not specifying the actual measurements of the room, the bed space or anything like that. All we are saying is that they should apply some minimum standards.  It is a matter for the Minister and his Department by way of order or whatever other way they may want to communicate these standards. Regard has to be had to minimum standards.  I would prefer if the legislation indicated that they wanted to ensure a minimum set of standards.  I will abide by whatever is decided but let us specifically state the intention.  It is important to state it, so that somebody will have to have regard to a minimum set of standards. Otherwise there might be no regard whatsoever paid to such standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may assure me that other <Col N="1926" /> legislation will ensure that they will have to have regard to other regulations laid down by the Minister or his Department but I am not convinced.  It is not unreasonable that the provisions of this Bill should include some reference to what the Minister would consider to be minimum requirements.  What Senator Doyle has said is quite true.  In the private sector some accommodation being offered to people is substandard.  Local authorities are faced with the dilemma of housing people from such substandard accommodation which is unfit and considered to be so.  People in desperate circumstances are charged exorbitant rents for such accommodation.  Despite the fact that we tell them they should not relet such properties they do so because there is a need.  People, be they battered wives or whatever, desperately seek accommodation.  They are at the mercy of others who have substandard accommodation available and who are prepared to and who have exploited people in such unfortunate circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Minister, as the responsible Minister should lay down some criteria and that they should be specifically stated.  We will not be seeking a minimum or maximum floor area but there should be some regard to the amount of accommodation for living, sleeping and washing, and basic purposes. I see nothing wrong with legislation that would relect that view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I claim that there are already strict standards in existence.  I would oppose any further restrictions being imposed on local authorities.  My fear would be that that would lead to a complete jungle of compliance.  At present there are the planning authority, the fire authority and the local authority involving a whole maze of compliant regulations even down to the colour of slates to be used on roofs.  I do not known how you could impose stricter compliance with the regulations.  In fact, that would be disservice.  In my county at present &mdash; and I am sure this is the case elsewhere &mdash; not only are there the standards I have described but also a request <Col N="1927" /> by developers for bonds over and above the planning fee.  The bond is demanded by a local authority and withheld until the accommodation meets the required standard.  The imposition of any more restrictions by way of legislation would defeat the purpose of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The case was made by Senator McGowan.  All I can add, to put Senator Ferris's mind at rest, is that the existing standards will not be swept away by this legislation.  Any accommodation provided under this legislation will have to be in accordance with those standards already in existence and there in statute form.  The vast majority of local authorities have the by-laws already in place in so far as these laws are concerned.  If it puts the Senator's mind at rest where the question of these assessments and what has to be done in so far as the housing of homeless people is concerned, I will draw it to their attention that the existing standards as laid down in Statute at present should be applied to the housing of homeless people.  Anything above and beyond that would be superfluous to the requirement.  I will be happy to do that.</P>

I have always found this House extremely indulgent with Members when they are absent.  It usually allows time for people to return.

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (2) (b), to delete lines 28 to 34 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that he has deliberately and knowingly done or failed to do something (other than an act or omission in good faith) with a view to take unfair advantage of the Act in consequence of which the accommodation he is so occupying is less suitable for his adequate housing than other accommodation which it would have been or would be reasonable for him to occupy; and&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision which this amendment proposes to delete was contained in the 1985 Bill in identical terms and I do not see any reason to revise the wording now.  I do not know how a housing authority could establish that someone had done or failed to do something with a view to taking unfair advantage of the Act.  A housing authority could establish that a particular action had a particular result.  How an authority could establish effectively what was in a person's mind at the time of the carrying out of the action, I do not know.  The proposed amendment would be unworkable in practice and consequently I cannot concede it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is unworkable seems to fluctuate with the mood of the moment.  On the one hand, we can have extreme latitude in interpretation and, on the other hand, we can have extremely legalistic writing down of precise details. We have had words that we were assured meant what the Minister meant because <Col N="1931" /> he would ensure that they meant that. We now have an insistence by the Minister that something will not mean that something which is reasonable to a reasonable person cannot be put into legislation because it is unreasonable.  It cannot be suggested that a local authority cannot have reason to believe that somebody is doing something with a view to taking unfair advantage of the Act.</P>
      <P>I know people in housing authorities who are already aware of &mdash; and keep assuring me of &mdash; the way people take advantage of other areas of legislation by the abuse, as they tell me, of medical evidence when people are looking for local authority housing.  That is seen as taking an unfair advantage of other legislation. Officials, apparently, are able to take steps to ensure that that sort of thing does not enable people to jump queues too unfairly.</P>
      <P>It seems that in many areas of life people can be identified who are trying to take unfair advantage of legislation and something should be done about it. The problem is that the Minister wants to leave housing authorities with a <i>carte blanche</i> to interpret these things.  The objective, allegedly, is to make sure people do not use any provisions of legislation like this to jump a queue.  In practice, it means that local authorities can make personal judgments about people's previous behaviour in terms of assessing whether the accommodation they have is their fault or not.  It is not really a question of behaviour; it is a question of culpability. I will read the subsection:</P>
      <P>provide that the housing authority, in applying its terms to a person, may disregard the accommodation that person is occupying where the authority have reason to believe that he has deliberately or without good and sufficient reason done or failed to do anything ... in consequence of which the accommodation he is so occupying is less suitable for his adequate housing than other accommodation which it would have been, or would be, reasonable for him to occupy;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1932" /> There is a judgmental philosophy throughout, not based on any attempt to get around the law but simply based on people's behaviour.  It could be used because a woman gets herself pregnant, for instance, which could perhaps result in her losing the level of housing accommodation that she had.  It could happen that a couple, with no children in a good flat who were told by a landlord that no children are allowed, who have a baby and they have to leave.  That could be where they do something deliberately or without good and sufficient reason.  Is it good and sufficient reason when tenants are told by a landlord &mdash; perhaps it is written into the conditions of a letting &mdash; that there are no children allowed and then they have a baby?  We will again be back to these mysterious circulars.</P>
    <P>I find it a little extraordinary that the Minister can tell me that, on the one hand, he can interpret complex words like &ldquo;management&rdquo; to ensure that they mean what they say, or he can interpret things like &ldquo;reasonable grounds for not being in accommodation&rdquo; in the definition of a homeless person and can, at the same time, tell me now that this is an attempt to give a local authority power to ensure that people will be adjudicated on, not on the basis of their behaviour but on the basis of their attempts to get around the intent of legislation.  I do not think that the Minister has an adequate case to put forward.  What is there is completely loaded against the applicant.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 are alternatives and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (7) line 4 after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and no such scheme or amendment to any such scheme shall be approved by the Minister unless he is satisfied that the appropriate needs of the categories of persons set out in section 9 have been provided for&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the comment in the media subsequent to the publication of this Bill some months ago, the Minister laid great stress on the fact that under the provisions of section 11 he would have considerable powers to ensure that housing authorities did a lot of the things that I and many Members of this House and I am sure the Minister, wish them to do with regard to a number of disadvantaged groups. Section 9 lists a number of the groups or the sort of people who must be considered when the local authority are carrying out an assessment of housing needs and refers in particular to people who are homeless, to travellers, to people who are living in accommodation that is unfit for human habitation and so on.  To be logical and consistent, therefore, the Minister ought to give himself power to ensure that housing authorities do that which he wants them to do, which is to make provision for all those groups in their scheme of priorities for letting dwellings, and that is what amendment No. 28 proposes to do.  It proposes to ensure that no such scheme of priorities for letting dwellings or, indeed, amendment to any such scheme shall be approved by the Minister unless he is satisfied that the appropriate needs of the categories of persons set out in section 9 have been provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be inconsistent of the Minister not to ensure that this is done but it is also important that not just the good will of this Minister but the position of future Ministers is made perfectly clear.  In making that perfectly clear I am asking the Minister to do what he has on a few occasions assured us he intends to do. The difficulty is &mdash; and this also arises from section 10, which we did not have much time to discuss &mdash; that no Minister has ever in the history of the State, as far as I know, refused approval to a scheme of priorities for letting local authority <Col N="1935" /> dwellings.  My amendment is limited in the sense that it only applies to local authority dwellings and in that regard will not be an adequate response to the needs of homeless people.  Nevertheless, it would ensure that at least the intent that the Minister has expressed and the intent contained in section 9 are translated into the housing policy of housing authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 29 is a little more specific in that it refers to the housing needs as specified in section 9 (2) which deals with the homeless.  They are identified there and our amendment which I feel should meet the concerns of Senator Brendan Ryan seeks that the Minister would not approve a scheme unless he is satisfied that the housing needs, as specified in the previous section, would receive due priority under this scheme.  I believe that if the Minister would concede our amendment as being the appropriate one, Senator Ryan would accept that as going some way towards addressing the needs of the homeless which he felt were not covered sufficiently in section 10 but which we believe are covered in section 9 (2) as specified.  The Minister should not approve any scheme which does not meet with the requirements laid down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Senator Ryan's amendment, it is important when the Minister is examining the letting schemes which are sent to him for approval that he ensures that they are drawn up in such a way as to comply with section 9.  I am not happy with Senator Ferris's amendment because he singles out the homeless.  I understand that under the Bill they have a priority but so have many other categories.  The Minister must insist that local authorities in drawing up their letting schemes give the priority that these specified cases are entitled to.  The Minister should take that power unto himself to make sure that local authorities draw up schemes in such a way as to meet the very principle, the very tone that underlies this Bill, namely, <Col N="1936" /> housing the homeless and the other categories mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered all the amendments and I find them quite unnecessary for the following reason that can be stated very quickly.  Senators will notice that under section 11 (1) a housing authority are obliged in law to have regard to the housing needs of persons included in their most recent assessment which is carried out under section 9 and those who have been accepted for inclusion in the next assessment subsequent to that.  I think it would be wrong to provide this requirement in section 11 (1) and, having done that and having it agreed, subsequently to provide by implication that housing authorities are somehow not going to abide by that regulation or that requirement of section 11 (1) unless they are forced to do so by the Minister.  I do not see the rationale behind the Senator's concern in this regard, considering what is stated in section 11 (1).  If that is complied with, why does it have to require the Minister to force them to carry out the requirements as indicated under that section?  It does not make sense to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I would not withdraw it at this stage anyway.  I think it extremely important that the interpretation of how a local authority do what the Minister say they have to do should rest with the Minister, not with the local authority.  It should be clear that if a housing authority do not give adequate priority to the people or groups or do not adequately meet all the needs of all the people listed under section 9, on that basis alone the Minister can refuse.  If it is so clear that they have to do all these things, why do they need ministerial <Col N="1937" /> approval for them?  If the Minister is so sure everything they need to do is specified and spelt out in section 11, why does he then insist they get approval of the Minister for it?  Is it simply that the Minister does not trust the legal advice available to the housing authorities?  If it is all clear and spelt out in the detail as the Minister assures us it is and is adequate, there ought to be no need for them to get the Minister's approval.  It ought to be simply adequate that they must do what they are told to do and must do it in accordance with the law.  I think housing authorities have sufficiently well qualified staff in their numbers not to need the Minister's approval for something if it is as clear as the Minister says.  On the other hand, if it is not as clear as that and needs ministerial approval for good reason, quite clearly it is reasonable to expect that the Minister would ensure that the conditions specified as being met would be met.  You cannot have it both ways. Either the matter is very clear and they should not need ministerial approval or it is not clear, in which case it is perfectly reasonable to put in either or both of these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think local authorities are competent in this.  Letting of houses is a very mundane operation so far as local authorities are concerned.  I refute Senator Ryan's allegation that local authority staff are not qualified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take exception to that inference on behalf of the staff of local authorities because they are, and I speak from experience, highly qualified, not only to interpret the regulations but to interpret the abuses.  I am sad to learn that some of the abuses are not understood by the Senators who put forward amendments here.  For instance, a person who might find difficulty in qualifying for a house rents an old caravan, parks it along the road and lives there during the day when the housing inspector is likely to call.  Such abuses are well known to <Col N="1938" /> local authorities and their staff who are implementing the letting regulations. Local authority staff throughout the country have had a great deal of experience of implementing the regulations and I would not welcome the Minister drawing up further restrictions that would defeat what Senator Ryan intends to implement to make sure that the right people qualify.  We have very simple regulations to make sure that the right people qualify.  We have very simple regulations which are easy to understand. We have a points system for overcrowding. Such factors are the condition of the house, the number in family and whether anyone in the house is ill are considered.  All these matters are as easy to understand as it is to loose your boots.  I am surprised to find we are going through this with a fine comb here.  We are dealing with ordinary, simple legislation.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, Senator McGowan need not have made that long speech because I did not say what he thought I said.  I said I believe they had plenty of people who were perfectly well qualified to do all these things.  I am a member of the engineering profession.  I have considerable respect for the many people who are of a similar profession to my own in the local authorities and for the other skilled people there.  One only have to look at the qualify of the development of the city I live in to appreciate the skills and qualities of members of the staff of local authorities.  Many people in Dublin would do well to imitate what has been done in my adopted city in terms of urban development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me try to get to the kernal of the concerns here.  Basically I agree with Senator McGowan.  In the local authorities I am aware of I have every confidence that the staff would adhere not alone to the letter but to the spirit of this legislation, but suppose a local authority do not adhere to the spirit or letter of section 10 or section 11, what powers has the Minister to ensure that they live up to their responsibilities in relation to the homeless?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure Senator McGowan that we are dealing with new legislation which is not the 1966 Act but takes account of it.  Section 9 (2) to which this amendment refers goes into much detail to spell out for local authorities the categories of people concerned.  It provides: &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a housing authority in making an assessment under this section shall have regard to the need for housing of persons who &mdash; (a) are homeless,&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ferris, why are you going back to section 9?  I am at section 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 (2) is referred to in my amendment and I am trying to ensure that the Minister retains the power unto himself.  My amendment provides that the Minister shall not approve a scheme submitted to him unless it complies with the regulations as we have set down in a previous section.  Apparently there is no objection from Senator McGowan to laying down the criteria in a previous section, simply because the Minister did it.  Here we are in this section requiring local authorities to have regard to the Minister's powers.  In our amendment we are asking that the Minister would not approve any scheme unless he were satisfied that it met the criteria set down in the previous section.  That is all we are doing.  It is not that it comes from this side of the House and therefore is an attempt to usurp the position of the Minister or the local authority.  He was the Minister laying down certain criteria <Col N="1940" /> in the Bill, and here is another amendment requiring that the Minister should have the power to review the scheme submitted to him by any local authority or any agency.</P>
      <P>We are saying in our amendment that if the local authorities do not comply with the criteria laid down in the previous sections, the Minister should not give his approval.  That is just respecting the Minister's authority, and asking him to exert his authority in the areas about which we are concerned.  We are going into a new area in this Bill, an area we all welcome, and we want to ensure that the spirit and the letter of the law are carried out.  We do not want anybody to be under any illusion of our desire for this criteria to be met.  That is all we are trying to do.  It is perfectly reasonable.  A previous section prepared by the draftsman setting down criteria was approved by us.  Now, because we are asking the Minister to live up to the criteria set down in our amendment, some people say that is wrong.  I do not understand the logic of the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see nothing in this section that alters substantially the system that has prevailed and I have already outlined the areas where local authority staff examine and make submissions. The health board officials are involved in the examination of tenants' applications for local authority houses, and the county manager makes the letting on the recommendation of the health board official.  After the county manager makes a recommendation, local authority members are advised seven days ahead of the actual letting being made. That is public knowledge.  The members of that local authority have an opportunity to object if they consider any miscarriage of justice is intended in the letting, or if there is departure from the regulations governing the letting of houses.  To ask that the Minister be more involved would tie things up to such an extent that this measure would not be workable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asking that the <Col N="1941" /> Minister would not approve a scheme or an amendment to a scheme, unless the criteria outlined in section 9 are met.  We are only asking him for a guarantee that local authorities will implement section 9.  It is a very simple matter.  I am sure most local authorities will comply with the regulations, but we are trying to cover any loophole that might exist if a local authority did not want to help the homeless. That is a possibility.  We are asking the Minister for a guarantee that he would not approve any scheme of letting, or allow any amendment to a scheme of letting, that would not provide for the categories specified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator McGowan.  I have been a member of a local authority since 1963 and I have full confidence in the staff of local authorities &mdash; how they allocate houses and scrutinise applicants for local authority housing. Public representatives may disagree with them at times, because we all have our own favourite applicants we would like to see housed, but very often these applicants do not succeed in getting houses because information made available to the investigating officers showed that somebody else was more entitled to a house.  The county manager, on the recommendation of the county medical officer, always gives priority to the type of people listed in section 9 of this Bill &mdash; the homeless, people living in overcrowded conditions, people who are ill, single mothers and so on.  I have full confidence in the people allocating local authority houses.  If we give the Minister the power this amendment asks for, there is no guarantee that somebody who feels he is entitled to a house will get it.  I am quite satisfied with the legislation as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not dealing with the allocation of houses as such.  What we are dealing with is a reserve function, the drawing up of a priority scheme of letting for housing, not individual houses.  I do not wish to repeat myself, but that is the point we want to guarantee in this amendment.  It is a reasonable amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a matter of importance to be considered here, a matter of considerable importance to the Minister for the Environment.  Everything that is required in substance, as understood by these amendments, is already covered in section 11 (1) (b).  We should be clear about that from the start.  What exactly are we talking about in this section?  We are talking about letting schemes.  I am seeing to it that letting schemes are made by local authorities.  They are submitted to the Minister, and he can decide that they are in conformity with the Act and if they are not he can suggest that they amend it and tell them where to do that.</P>
      <P>To suggest, as implied in these amendments, that the Minister might approve something that was not in accordance with the Act is going too far.  It suggests that the Minister's motives might in some way be suspect, or that in some way he might seek to have a letting scheme approved that was not in accordance with the legislation.  That I have to reject.  It is not possible for me in any circircumstances to accept the bona fides of that, because the Senators are challenging the bona fides of the Minister for the Environment for the time being.</P>
      <P>Everything required is already in section 11 (1) (b) and the authority of the Minister is adequately stated in subsections (7) and (8) in so far as approvals, amendments, additions and subtractions to any letting schemes are concerned.</P>

Nobody is getting involved in personal imputations about anybody in this.  What we are involved in here is attempting to identify in law what we understand to be the priorities that are contained in the intent of those who drafted this legislation and which most members of the Oireachtas share, that is, that there are certain categories which have been identified as being in particular need.  I am prepared to withdraw the amendment because, when the Minister chooses to be reasonable and explain and talk in reasonable terms about the legislation as distinct from standing on his dignity and imputing motives to other people, he can be quite persuasive.  I would advise him <Col N="1945" /> that, for the rest of the discussion on this Bill, he should concentrate more on his capacities of persuasion than on his sensitivities and delicacies, because he is very persuasive when he is like that.  He has been quite persuasive and I am quite prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Finally, by way of response to that, the Minister never stands on his dignity and takes nothing in a personal way.  All matters concerned with legislation that I am involved in are taken on behalf of the Office and the Minister must protect first of all his Office and must protect the legislation that comes through his hands and becomes the law of the land.  If it is implied in any amendment that in some way the holder of this Office I have could in any way be judged as seeking to do something that was not in accordance with the law of the land then I must stand on my dignity; it is the dignity of the Office I am referring to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(10) A scheme under this section <Col N="1946" /> shall include such provisions, regarding the financial circumstances of the person applying for accommodation or of any other person who normally resides with him or who might reasonably be expected to reside with him, in determining eligibility for inclusion in the order of priority as the housing authority consider appropriate or as the Minister may from time to time direct.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I move this amendment because I have known of abuses in the letting of local authority houses, such as abuses by people who have received a local authority house but have sold a private house of their own beforehand, and other problems of that nature.  They are rare, but they do occur.  Dublin Corporation have introduced a financial limit above which people are not considered.  Senator McGowan also said that in Donegal they have such a financial threshold.  I moved this amendment so as to remove any anomalies that may occur where people try to get local authority houses they are not entitled to or where they would not be entitled due to their financial circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>A somewhat similar provision was included in the 1985 Bill in the context of a housing authority deciding whether a person was able to provide accommodation from his own resources. It was decided to drop the provision from the present Bill, since it was perfectly clear that in reaching a decision on the matter a local authority had, necessarily, to investigate and have regard to the financial position of the person seeking the housing.  The section as it stands clearly allows a local authority to make any provision they wish in a scheme of letting priorities in regard to the financial circumstances of persons seeking houses. They could, as some local authorities do at present, impose an income limit to qualify for local authority housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section also gives powers to the Minister to direct local authorities to amend the scheme the authority propose <Col N="1947" /> to make or have already made.  The Minister's approval is also required to every single scheme.  It is important to state that.  The existing provisions more than adequately cover any situation which might be dealt with under the proposed amendment.  I think the Senator will be satisfied, from his own experience, that in the circumstances of financial consideration, due notice is always taken by the housing authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I withdraw the amendment, I just want to ask the Minister if he could indicate how many local authorities have these income limits.  Is it the Minister's view that local authorities should have an income limit in their scheme of lettings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Not generally, but as I understand it, the major authorities do, for very practical reasons and having regard to the numbers of people concerned. In the ordinary circumstances I do not think it is always necessary particularly in the smaller authorities where a lot of that evidence is well known to the investigating officers.</P>
      <P>Maybe it is an appropriate time to say that local authorities take this obligation very seriously.  I have had nothing but praise of their level of concern and compassion and care in making recommendations in so far as lettings are concerned and they are always backed up, as Senator McGowan has so rightly said, by ample medical evidence and social worker evidence as well.  I am generally very happy with the way these matters are attended to by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only concur with what the Minister has said because it is my experience that where people have to leave private accommodation, not because they are evicted but by agreement and are compensated, the housing officers do not hold that against them; it is a small income that they can invest for the future and it is not held against them. There are other types, unfortunately, <Col N="1948" /> who do take advantage of local authorities and can sometimes hoodwink local authorities into giving them local authority houses which they are not entitled to because they can out of their own resources provide for their own housing. I am glad to hear the Minister say that he is aware of the situation and I will certainly withdraw the amendment.</P>

I have been reading this Bill carefully and my understanding would be that section 11 is a replacement for section 60 of the 1966 Act.  That is the first point.  Can the Minister confirm that for me?  Section 60 of the 1966 Act &mdash; duty of housing authority to make schemes of priorities for letting housing accommodation, is being repealed.  Could it be confirmed for me that this is so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <P>Whenever a scheme under this section comes into force the following shall apply: (b) lettings by the housing authority of dwellings to which the scheme relates shall be in accordance with the provisions of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the housing authority have to operate according to the scheme of priorities that they have drawn up under section 60 of the 1966 Act.  I have read section 11 of this Bill extremely carefully and I cannot find any provision which states that they will have to operate <Col N="1949" /> according to the scheme of priorities that they will draw up under section 11.  Perhaps the Minister could explain to me why an obligation to operate in accordance with the scheme of priorities is not contained in section 11?</P>

      <P>There is one issue I would like to raise and I do not know whether I should raise it now or when we come to deal with the matter of repeals later on and, that is, the question of the repeal of section 55 of the 1966 Act.  Section 55 of the 1966 Act makes specific reference to building programmes and an obligation is put on a housing authority to bring forward building programmes.  It is one of the sections being repealed under the Schedule to the Bill.  I can raise it at that stage if you wish but section 55 states that it shall be the duty of a housing authority, to prepare and adopt a programme, in this Act referred to as a building programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This section states that the Minister may on application by a housing authority and subject to subsection (2) determine that a group of houses provided by the authority shall be houses to which this section applies, in other words <Col N="1950" /> the reconstruction or improvement of certain groups of houses.  At the outset I congratulate the Minister for announcing that the repairs of low cost houses, which has taken place throughout the country to good effect, will continue.  The Minister is continuing a pilot project initiated by a previous Government.  I am quite pleased about this because I think it is a good investment to continue to repair these low cost houses up to the standard now being achieved.</P>
      <P>I do have one concern and it relates to the recently announced purchase scheme.  Houses are being offered to those tenants living in reconstructed houses.  The remainder are either not being offered a house at all or they are being offered a substandard house at valuation. It is my opinion and the opinion of the local authority of which I am a member that the Minister should make an exception is the scheme that he announced on 1 January, to be completed by 31 December, in the case of low cost houses as these will not be reconstructed by 31 December.</P>
      <P>Because of the standard of workmanship many tenants will now opt to buy these reconstructed houses but it would amount to bad planning to allow the existing tenants in low cost houses to purchase them in their present condition because they would be unable to bring them up to the standard which the local authorities would achieve if they were to carry out reconstruction, which, under this section, grants will be made available.  I ask the Minister to consider making an exception in the case of this special category of houses as it is in all our interests, including those of the Minister, the Department and the local authority that the housing stock should be brought up to the standard being achieved under the pilot project and that all tenants should be given the same facilities as their next door neighbour who is fortunate enough to be living in a house reconstructed under the pilot project.  I am raising this issue on this section because it is the only section on which I can deal with the anomaly that has arisen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am strongly opposed to that proposal on the grounds that the tenant purchase scheme is one of the best schemes ever announced.  The response of local authority tenants to that scheme has been tremendous.  However well intended the Senator's amendment may be, I believe it would result in delays in the implementation of the scheme and it would lead to delays in the purchase of houses because an assessment would have to be carried out on the extent of repairs needed and it would be necessary to fund the cost of repairs, which in some cases, would be substantial.  The houses that were recently offered to local authority tenants were offered at the same price as the cost of a site.  There has been a tremendous response on the ground to this scheme.  I would strongly oppose the Minister accepting this amendment as there has been a magnificent response to the tenant purchase scheme.  Under the scheme a vast number of people will have an opportunity to buy their own houses and to extend, repair or alter that house at a price below the cost of a site, a serviced site in many cases.  If Senator Ferris realised the extent of the response on the ground he would not have made such a proposal here.  However, one would like to see extra funds being made available for the repair of houses, a very useful proposal.  To assess the extent of repairs needed would take years, with the value of the house changing before the tenant purchase scheme could be implemented.  That certainly would not be acceptable.  I welcome the tenant purchase scheme as I believe it is the best scheme that has ever been announced in all of the time I have served as a member of a county council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I suggest he has completely misunderstood or misrepresented what I said.  First of all, I commended the Minister for making funds available to <Col N="1952" /> repair low cost houses and I commend the Minister for deciding to continue on a pilot project to bring substandard low cost houses up to a standard that all local authorities felt they should be brought up to.  It is an excellent scheme and the Minister has made available substantial funding.  I do not know or even purport to know whether there is low cost housing in Senator McGowan's constituency but I do know that there is low cost housing in several locations in my constituency.</P>
      <P>The pilot project has been started and completed to the Minister's satisfaction. The Minister has agreed to commit further capital funds this year for numbers of houses in various towns in County Tipperary.  I have commended the Minister publicly for that at urban council and at county council level.  Under the recently announced tenant purchase scheme the houses that were fortunate enough to be included and repaired under the pilot project are being offered to tenants at a price at which they are able to purchase them.  I have recommended the scheme and recommended that the tenants should purchase them.  Because the remaining houses will not be repaired before 31 December, the same facility which is being offered to those who are fortunate to be in repaired houses, should be applied to the other tenants in that group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not got an amendment down but I suggest that in this section which is relevant to what we are discussing, the Minister would consider an amendment to the scheme specifically for these people in these houses so that all tenants in low cost housing schemes are treated equally.  Otherwise the Minister will be offering the non-repaired houses at very low prices to people who would be unable to carry out renovation and repairs.  From a planning point of view they would never achieve the standard and quality that the Department have achieved in the pilot project and in the houses the Minister is now proceeding with.  I hope Senator McGowan will accept my bona fides in the matter and I hope that in his reply <Col N="1953" /> the Minister will confirm the case I have been making in his defence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's words of commendation about the remedial works scheme.  I am not going to go into it here this evening except to summarise my point of view on it.  A certain amount of money was made available for the renovation and the reconstruction of certain low cost houses.  I have increased that amount of money and whatever resources are available to me I intend to continue that practice, because it is only when one does an assessment of the total needs in so far as remedial works are concerned you begin to get some idea about some of the bad decisions that were made in the past in starting off with low cost housing of various types throughout the country.  Now it is coming home to roost and it is costing enormous sums of money and the regrettable part about it is that unless I push extra money into that area now, it will be out of control in a number of years.</P>
      <P>For that reason I take the House's support in the matter of doing something in the remedial area.  It is bringing back a new kind of stability and community spirit to many of the areas where that remedial money is being spent.  There are a lot of claims on the scheme not just in some of the provincial centres but in the city as well, where there is still quite an amount of accommodation without what I regard as the basic facility being available. I would like to think that we could do something about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the tenant purchase scheme is concerned, Senator McGowan is right. This is a glorious opportunity and it is accepted by all sides that it is and it is being recommended across the board as well.  I recognised the difficulty that might arise in some of the matters referred to by Senator Ferris.  But I thought it was adequately catered for in the scheme in so far as the cost was based on the market <Col N="1954" /> value, so that if a property requires remedial work to be carried out, the cost value of that remedial work is subtracted from the total cost of the house by way of market value and they are given the benefit of that, as distinct from the property that has had the remedial works already carried out and which will be at a higher cost.  To enable the difference to be made up, it is always possible for the new purchaser to get other accommodation by way of loan facility to carry out the works that were not included in the original purchase price, so they are getting the best of both worlds.  Those who had the works carried out previously are getting the market value with deductions and those who have not had the remedial works carried out are getting the benefit of the possible cost of those remedial works subtracted from the market value.  That is specifically included in the regulations and I hope that the local authorities are applying it in the spirit in which it was intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to carry out a review of the sale of local authority houses along the lines I have suggested.  The Minister feels the difficulties are catered for, but the figures do not add up and there is no doubt that the market value of the unrepaired low cost scheme houses does not permit the tenant purchaser to carry out the standard of repair that we would require from a planning point of view.  We are altering the walls, extending them outwards, we are changing the roof line, installing chimneys and doing a lot of work that normally a tenant purchaser would be unable to carry out even with a loan, because the maximum reconstruction loan available from the local authority is something like £8,000.  Eight thousand pounds will not bring low cost houses up to the standard achieved in the Minister's pilot project.  The existing tenant purchasers are lucky to be in a repaired house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should address himself to this area.  It is not beyond his capabilities to come up with an ingenious scheme that will meet the problems and give the <Col N="1955" /> proper incentive to people awaiting repairs to opt to buy their house like their next door neighbour.</P>
    <P>I can discuss the matter privately with the Minister but it arises under this section and the Minister will hear a lot more about it from local authorities who are now faced with this dilemma.  Otherwise many of the houses they would have liked to sell will not be sold.  I know the Minister has a scheme of repairs on line. He has made a commitment over a number of years to it and has increased the allocation to it.  In the knowledge that the Minister has been generous, he might allow &mdash; not open the floodgates to everybody &mdash; an extension of the scheme for people in low cost housing, so that repairs could be carried out and that they could opt to buy their houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>This business of complimenting the Minister from the Labour side seems contagious here tonight.  We in the Labour Group put down this amendment because of an experience I had in my constituency.  The Minister allocated £170,000 for a travellers' halting site and for that I compliment him.  As the local authority &mdash; Waterford Corporation &mdash; worked towards this we had discussions with the person in charge of the itinerant halts in Dublin County Council who came and discussed the matter with the planning committee of <Col N="1956" /> Waterford Corporation.  Subsequently the planning committee of Waterford Corporation visited the sites in Cork city in company with officials and some of the members who had taken an interest in this.  One thing that came over loud and clear to us in our discussions was that the halts that worked best were the one that had a caretaker, preferably living in a house on the halting site.  Waterford Corporation subsequently applied to the Department for a caretaker but they were not able to accede to that.</P>
      <P>Waterford Corporation are very serious about this.  There has been a very thoughtful approach to it and a lot of research carried out.  We have agreed to redraft our plan following suggestions from the Minister's Department.  The effectiveness of this substantial investment in a social problem &mdash; I accept that the Minister is committed to solving it &mdash; is put at risk because of the inability of the local authority to provide a caretaker. I should like to ask the Minister to consider our amendment in which we are seeking that caretakers be provided at halting sites for travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust the Minister will accept the amendment in the spirit in which it is intended because he considers the word &ldquo;manage&rdquo; as meaning that he is addressing this problem.  However, because of staffing problems in local authorities it may be that some of them may not be able to appoint a caretaker to manage a travellers' controlled site.  In my constituency any proposals brought forward by the assistant manager, Mr. Mackey &mdash; he has since been appointed to Cavan &mdash; included a caretaker on site. It was only when that proviso was written into his recommendations that the council accepted them.  Indeed, the settled community can only be convinced of our bona fides in this area if we are serious about putting in caretakers.  Sites which have caretakers have been quite successful. It is imperative that all itinerant halting sites should have a caretaker resident on site so that there is proper control and management.  Unfortunately, otherwise, itinerants will be their own worst <Col N="1957" /> enemies, because they tend to be dirty and slovenly about how they treat a site. If there is a caretaker on the site he will ensure that certain standards are achieved and maintained.  Usually those standards do not infringe on the rights of the settled community.  A lot of lipservice has been paid to this area but very few local authority members, or others, want to address themselves to the problem. We are suggesting this in good faith so that the Minister will understand what we are trying to achieve.  Perhaps the Minister's board of management will meet our requirements but we want him to spell out their function so that local authorities will not fail to get approval for the appointment of caretakers when proposals are made to his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <P>I have already indicated when considering amendment No. 8 that the term &ldquo;management&rdquo; or &ldquo;manage&rdquo; in the context of housing legislation already includes the provision of caretaker and, indeed, other services such as warden services for the elderly.  It is often unhelpful in legislation to identify or emphasise one aspect of a term to the potential exclusion of others.  In that case I would see the proposed amendment as unnecessary and one that might very well be potentially restrictive.  I would rather not accept it for that reason.  I take the points made about caretakers in general. I will consider this further and I will talk to my advisers on travellers and also to travellers' representatives.  I have discovered that it is always useful in considering this difficulty we have nationally to take advice from those who are actually working with the particular group on the ground.  I have been adopting that practice.  I have been attending their conferences and I know some of the people concerned.  I have been involved in this particular type of activity for over a quarter of a century and I think I know what is required and involved.  I will discuss the matter further in the light of what has been said here.</P>

    <P>On the basis of the Minister's commitment at that time, is he satisfied that there has been any progress on the issues raised and, if so, will he let us have the information he has at his disposal?  Are local authorities providing more sites?  I appreciate that this is being done in some cases.  Does the Minister have any information on the number of people to which section 13 applies?  Is the number going up or down?  Has it gone up or down since he became Minister?  I accept the bona fides of the Minister on this.  I am well aware of his concern, his commitment and determination to do something about this.  He seems to have identified at least one recalcitrant local authority and I wish him well in his endeavours to deal with that issue.  I would like to know if there is any evidence that things are getting better or worse with regard to members of the travelling community and, in particular, with the provision of serviced <Col N="1959" /> sites.  It is a pity that the Minister's determination to deal with those who work with travellers was not as evident in other provisions of this Bill in that those who deal with the homeless did not get much of a hearing in terms of the provisions of section 10.  All the voluntary organisations do not agree with the Minister and he did not listen very well to them.</P>

      <P>The Minister was praised for a number of reasons, particularly in relation to the refurbishment schemes that are taking place and in regard to the new tenant purchase scheme.  I should also like to praise him and his Department on the work the Department have been doing for travellers over the last two or three years. Our local authority received a circular a year ago from the Department of the Environment informing us in no uncertain terms that we were to do something about the problem of travellers in the city.  The local authority involved responded very enthusiastically to the circular, so much so that recently we had a report on travellers in the city to the effect that there would be no problem in relation to travellers in Dublin city within a year, that the problem within the city boundaries will be solved.  I would like to pay a special tribute to the Department and to Dublin Corporation for the tremendous work they have done in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I witnessed an example of that in the north side of the city in Darndale.  This time last year the problem there was explosive and I had it discussed in the Seanad.  I would like to pay a special tribute to Dublin Corporation for the work they have done since then and on the groundwork they were doing up to the time the crisis developed last July. Essentially, I believe the provision of halting sites, chalets and so forth is very important in that it is the way forward. In Darndale last year a second phase of a chalet scheme was approved for travellers. Again, I should like to thank the Department for funding that.  In addition the corporation allocated normal housing <Col N="1960" /> to a number of travellers who were in that area and they are quite satisfied with them.  They have now put forward proposals to construct a group housing scheme which will entirely solve the problem. Those plans are before the Department and I have no doubt that they will receive approval in the near future.  Certainly, that is the expectation.  It will solve the problem to the benefit of all parties concerned.</P>
    <P>The work which the corporation have been doing, to which I have referred, has been terrific.  They undertook to negotiate with many groups &mdash; residents' associations, tenants' associations and all the people who tend to get involved in these issues.  Their patience is to be commended. They brought all parties together in a calm manner to solve the problem.  That is just one example of how the problem has been tackled by one local authority.  The impetus given by the Department in the past year has certainly contributed to that.  I remember discussing the circular which stated that we should do something about the matter.  I am delighted to report that the problem of travellers in the city will be solved within a year.  When I refer to the problem of travellers I do not mean the travellers are a problem but rather the whole situation.</P>

      <P>While listening to Senator Haughey I thought for a moment that we were members of different local authorities. Housing for travelling people has been a burning question in Dublin Corporation but not in the case of Darndale to which Senator Haughey referred.  He did not allude to another area which was the subject of a serious debate and in which his party were not in favour of housing travelling people.  I was glad to hear his comments in regard to the future housing of the homeless and I hope he will commit his party to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Progress has been made in regard to the housing of travelling people.  Perhaps some councils are doing better work in this area than others.  In County Galway considerable progress has been made with regard to the housing of itinerants, or travelling people as they prefer to be called.  Halting sites have been provided and it is very important that, where they have been provided, all the necessary back-up services would also be provided.</P>
      <P>Mention was made by Senator Ferris of the need for a caretaker.  It is also very important that social workers are employed in this area, people who can advise those families on how to run their own homes and take pride in them.  That is very important.  We must remember that they are not the same as the rest of us.  They are coming in from the wilds, as it were.  They are not used to having homes of their own and they do not know how to take care of them.  It is very important that all the services be provided for them.</P>
      <P>In Galway in particular those families are taken care of when houses are being allocated.  In all the major housing estates in the county, in Tuam, Ballinasloe and Galway city, a fair share of houses are allocated to those families and that is very important.  Sometimes there is an influx of travellers to an area, some of them perhaps from other counties.  When their friends are housed in Galway, they seem to think that if they set up home in the area they will also be considered for housing. This has happened on a few occasions, particularly in the Tuam area where houses were allocated to a number of those families.  We found that other families came in straightaway in the hope that they, too, would qualify for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress is being made in this area.  It is a thorny problem and one that we have to tackle very carefully because we have to think of the settled community also. Many people do not like those sites near their homes and, in some cases, with genuine reason.  We have to educate the <Col N="1962" /> general public in this regard and perhaps that is one thing that is lacking at present. Those people should be shown compassion. People seem to think that it is fine to help them out provided the halting sites or chalets are not near their homes. We have much work to do in educating the public on how to tackle this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this section.  Like Senator Hussey and the Minister, I come from the west of Ireland and have lived in the environment of the traditional itinerants who, as I grew up were known as tinkers, not in any derogatory sense but because of that age-old tradition they followed.  Many a rural household in Ireland still has the &ldquo;ponnies&rdquo; or &ldquo;ponjers&rdquo; they made so excellently. It is sad that that craft has been dying out in recent years because of new technology.</P>
      <P>In my own county of Leitrim the local authority, like a number of local authorities in the west, have faced up to this problem as best they could.  It is a thorny problem and can be an emotive one.  In my own town of Drumshanbo my late father was a great champion of the itinerants and particularly of families who had come into the area some years ago and who had stayed on the side of the road primarily because there was no suitable accommodation for them.  Unfortunately, there are still families in those strained economic circumstances.  Travelling the highways and by-ways of Ireland, one sees the very large caravans, the glittering household effects through the windows, the colour televisions and the large cars parked outside.  In many cases they are not the real traditional itinerant families but are families who have opted to go on the road as merchants and traders.  The traditional Irish itinerant families are the original aristocracy of our land.  The famous Irish family names &mdash; O'Reillys, Wards and Maughans &mdash; had at one time substantial tracts of land, particularly in the west. However, they were displaced and their descendants have since roamed mainly in the west.  It is only in recent years that this has become an urban problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1963" /> The provisions in this Bill will go a long way towards helping to alleviate, and I hope eventually to eliminate, what is a social blight.  For a country that purports to present a Christian image to the world &mdash;and in many areas of human endeavour the Irish people are generous to a fault &mdash; when it come to helping to solve what is euphemistically described as a problem, when it refers to only a small number of families in the total population, we Christian people find it difficult to stretch out the hand of compassion and Christianity to itinerants and to help and encourage them to come into our settled communities, to provide adequate housing for them, to encourage their children to go to our schools and to become part of our educational system.  I would like to think that this section will go some way towards making local authorities, and the people in them, aware of these problems. Officials on their own and legislation on its own cannot change entrenched attitudes.</P>
    <P>I hope this section will go some way &mdash; it does not go as far as I would like it to go &mdash; towards compelling local authorities, in cases where there are real problems, to locate halting sites and to provide proper accommodation for these people. I accept that the Minister has real difficulties. He has come up with a suitable compromise at this time in that local authorities can have some power and, in a sense, can take the high moral ground and say: &ldquo;We are legislating for these people and let us now start to encourage the provision of suitable sites&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is another point &mdash; and Senator Hussey touched on this &mdash; in relation to the difficulty that faces some itinerant families or, as the section puts it, those &ldquo;who traditionally pursue or have pursued a nomadic way of life&rdquo;.  I referred earlier to my home town of Drumshanbo and my late father's efforts in eventually succeeding in getting the local authority to provide three houses there.  Although in some cases this was done against local opposition although I must say that the opposition was unrepresentative of the people of the area.  The itinerant families <Col N="1964" /> have been associated with the area for a large number of years and people were happy to see them settled.  I am sorry to report that of those three houses, two of them are boarded up today.</P>
    <P>The main reason for this &mdash; and Senator Hussey referred to this &mdash; is that the families, relatives and friends of those families moved in and created enormous difficulties for the itinerant families who had been originally given the houses. The difficulties became insurmountable and the families had to go back onto the road.  However, the offspring of those families are now integrated into the community and I believe that is where the long term solution to the problem of the itinerant population lies.  If we can get the next generation &mdash; not this generation &mdash; into our schools and integrated into our society they will become more used to the way of life of the settled community. Because of the ingrained attitudes and inclination of the itinerant community to wander and lead a nomadic way of life, the difficulty has continued to the present day.</P>
    <P>I hope this section will go some way towards encouraging local authorities to provide suitable halting sites and that once the younger generation become used to settling on such sites they will integrate into the community and that the community will welcome them so that our successors in the next generation, will not have to debate the subject of itinerants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think local authorities will welcome the encouragement that is given in this section.  However, I would change one word in the section. Instead of saying a housing authority &ldquo;may&rdquo; provide I would say a housing authority &ldquo;will&rdquo; provide.  Every local authority are acutely aware of the problem we are discussing.  It is a good subject to talk about but it is a difficult one to deal with.  I have worked very closely with social workers, all of whom had good intentions and had an answer to the problem, but the problem was always placed on somebody else's doorstep.  This problem is not getting any easier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1965" /> The provision, management and control of sites might, in theory, in practice and on paper, meet the needs of travelling people but the assessment of the movements of travelling people and the different categories of travelling people is a major task and a major problem.  As a local authority member who is actively involved in assisting travelling people I believe that local authorities must never get discouraged or record their failures. They must look forward and I am glad that the Minister is providing encouragement for them in the Bill.  The words of encouragement in the legislation are very important.  This is a problem which is not going to go away.  We cannot legislate for it and hope that it will automatically disappear.  It is a major problem and anybody who comes along with simple solutions does not have a grasp of the real problem.  It is a problem which has to be tackled jointly by the Minister, his Department, the local authorities and social workers and there has to be an input from the travelling people or itinerant families.  It is a broadly based problem and it has to be assessed very carefully.  I venture to say that some travelling people project an undesirable image and those traders who camp along the road do not enlist the sympathy of anybody.  This makes the problem all that much greater.  I am certain that my local authority will not be discouraged if they have failures or if mistakes are made.  We have to approach this in the knowledge that it is a major problem and one on which we have to achieve progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this provision and I think it has been welcomed generally by the House.  I welcome the sensitivity of the language in which the section is expressed and in particular the use of the word &ldquo;travellers&rdquo;.  It is most important that minority groups are given the right to name themselves and the people who drafted this legislation should be commended on the fact that they have used this sensitive language and also found a very pleasant way of describing people who pursue or have pursued a <Col N="1966" /> nomadic way of life.  I welcome this sensitivity.</P>
      <P>I recognise that this is a difficult problem and I believe this section attempts to address it.  I will not blackguard the different areas of the country in which I have lived but I have lived not only in the metropolitan area but also in some rural areas where ten, 15 or 20 years ago this degree of sensitivity was not shown to people, at least some of whom came onto the roads as victims of some of the natural but also political or military disasters of our troubled history.  I welcome this section and particularly the sensitivity of the language in which it is expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I already referred to this section and Senator McGowan will be pleased to know that I concur with everything he said with regard to the section. I am aware of the problem that local authorities have had in this area, the efforts they have made and the failures they have had in trying to address the problem.  I agree with Senator Norris that referring to travellers in the way they are referred to in the section is helpful.</P>
      <P>There are people who like to lead nomadic lives and they appear in our constituencies for short periods.  Very few of them apply to us for rehousing: all of them want to camp adjacent to the national primary routes.  Many of them stay for a while but they are often their own worst enemies because they leave a lot of litter, dirt and filth after them and this makes the problem we are trying to address that much more difficult.  All the people I have discussed this problem with have differentiated between the genuine itinerant nomadic person who moves around and stops in different places for a while and the well-heeled traveller who is involved in a commercial activity and who seems to breeze into different towns with the most expensive caravans with complete and utter disregard for the rights to property of residents in both rural and urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people, with complete abandon, seem to literally take over an area, decimate it and then pass on.  It is an amazing <Col N="1967" /> procedure and members of local authorities or members of the Garda Síochána have very little powers to act on it.  We have seen travellers creating traffic hazards, conducting business on national primary routes where people involved in legitimate trading could not get planning permission to carry on any business.</P>
    <P>I want to differentiate specifically between the genuine tinker, traveller, nomadic person or however we like to describe them, many well known to local people, tradespeople who come, give a service and move on without creating any offence, people who genuinely want to be settled for a while, who like to send their children to school in certain areas and do so.  There is a genuine commitment on the part of members of local authorities to address their problem. Those are the kinds of people the provisions of this section are trying to deal with by way of providing some facilities for them in controlled sites, where they can park their caravans, have access to clean water, hot water and so on.</P>
    <P>There is the other problem presented by the merchants, most coming from across the Border with quite an amount of goods and merchandise.  It never ceases to amaze me how they can get away with some of the activities in which they engage in rural areas in particular where they purport to provide all sorts of services and so on.  One must question our ability to deal with that type of merchant. They do not render any service to society of which I am aware.  Rather, they create quite an amount of annoyance for ordinary people who are genuinely concerned about the travellers referred to and dealt with in this section.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the sensitivity with which this section is written.  I should also like to commend him and the work of his Department in this regard so far and on the provision of moneys for sites for itinerants, particularly in my area of Stillorgan.  I should like to place on the record of the House a little credit to a man who is not here this evening and who <Col N="1968" /> was instrumental in providing a plan for itinerants in the Dublin area.  It constituted the follow-up to a Fianna Fáil promise given in the course of a local election: I refer to the Minister for Energy and for Communications, Deputy Ray Burke who was Chairman of Dublin County Council and who did a tremendous amount of work in this regard.</P>

      <P>I am surprised to find myself intervening again so rapidly.  I am even more surprised to find myself in disagreement with some of what my distinguished colleague, Senator Ferris, has said because so often I find myself in agreement with him.  It seemed to me to be unfortunate that he singled out and characterised one element among the travelling people who may cause some degree of inconvenience.  I would like to place on the record of the House that precisely the same comments could be made about the settled community.  It is unfortunate that these remarks were made.  One does not have to look back any further than yesterday to find that a decent resident of this city had most of her back premises flattened by some cowboy operator who moved in with a JCB.  Her back garden was exposed to flooding by sewage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it arises by virtue of the fact that this is the kind of accusation that was made against travelling people.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already read the section, I have already spoken to the <Col N="1969" /> point on the section but I am commenting very briefly, if I may with your indulgence, on what Senator Ferris said because he also mentioned, with regard to the specific provision&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only making a passing reference as well.  In fact, I might say I was a kind of intellectual traveller on this issue, not I hope a fellow-traveller.  I would like to point out also, with regard to the other accusations that were made, notably those regarding trading, that pig smugglers and other people who do a great deal of damage to our economy are not, by any means, all travellers.  I am sure Senator Ferris will have the grace to withdraw these slurs.  I say it because I know that many of the travellers who wish to be settled, and who wish to make application to be settled, find it a particular problem that even in a forum like Seanad Éireann they are continually subjected to what is not intended as abuse but can very easily be translated into abuse.  In these regards I believe the travellers are no worse.</P>
      <P>I recall some years ago circumstances in which there was a move, in a local county council, to implement precisely the kind of enlightened provisions as are contained in this section and they were resisted.  One of the reasons given was that a local park had been infested with travellers.  The word used was not &ldquo;travellers&rdquo;. It was suggested that they were not fit to mix with the local children and the usual accusations made again this evening about dirt, filth and so on were raised.  The travellers were driven on and a week later a child of a travelling family perished from the cold in a back road near Bray Head.  I will always remember that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those reasons I again commend the Minister for these enlightened provisions. With the greatest respect I would have to place on record my regret that Senator Ferris &mdash; I am sure without any intention of insensitivity &mdash; has appeared to me to lend some weight to accusations <Col N="1970" /> which certainly can be made against travellers but which are equally valid against members of the settled community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not, except to say that I take note of many of the things said.  I recognise the genuine concern of many Members in dealing with travellers.  They are not a problem.  The problem often is how to arrange what is best suited to their requirements.  They themselves are no problem.  I have paid some attention to this matter over the past 15 or 16 months because of a personal interest.  There is now a better arrangement in the Department by way of assessing just what is going on.  There are now quarterly reports coming to the Department from all local authorities to show how they are doing.  Each report has to be a follow-up to the previous one, not merely restating the previous report in different language.</P>
      <P>It is quite an interesting exercise.  Some local authorities have done very well, some not so well.  An interesting thing about it is that the counties with the biggest difficulties &mdash; one is almost tempted to say &ldquo;problem&rdquo; every time &mdash; and the largest numbers of travellers are those that have performed best, while those counties catering for a small number of travellers have done poorly.  That is interesting. It would appear that the provision of sites would be a much more acceptable means of dealing with their circumstances than the provision of houses.  This is confirmed by themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I know that some Members have taken exception to some of the articles written in this little book in discussion previously, suggesting that the authors might not know fully and at all times what they are talking about, I would point out again that it comprises only a collection of papers edited by Blackwell and Stanislaus Kennedy.  I would recommend it as prescribed reading for some of the Members <Col N="1971" /> in so far as the section devoted to housing policy as it affects travelling people is concerned only because the subject matter of the article is written, or suggested, by four travellers themselves.  It is interesting to note the difference in attitude between what they say and what is recorded by another contributor to this collection of works in another chapter dealing with community and environmental services by Dublin Corporation, with special reference to the travelling people.</P>
    <P>I will not go into any close analysis of the last contribution.  Suffice it to say that there are some very interesting things said and some things written in the book which I wish were not said or written.  I take advice on these matters from many people and many offer advice and offer it with a willing heart.  I take advice on this question from somebody who has been very closely involved with travelling people for over a quarter of a century &mdash; long before it became fashionable to have pre-schools for travellers and long before there were schools available for them at all, or any arrangements for social worker participation with them.  I still take much advice from that person as being somebody who knows the situation intimately. I believe that the advice is good and I am going to continue taking it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not be long.  We should not get too tangled up in euphoria. I accept the goodwill of the Minister.  I accept fully that the book he has referred to is and should be required reading &mdash; not for some Members but for all Members of the Oireachtas.  One does not have to agree with everything in it to believe that it should be required reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are books which I believe should be required reading for everybody with which I disagree entirely.  There are some speeches made by Ministers which I believe should be required reading even though I might not agree with a word of them.  We do not disagree on that, but <Col N="1972" /> we must not be carried away with extravagant claims.  I remember a Member of a previous Seanad asserting, in fairly heated controversy with me, the number of travellers who had been housed in his local authority area which was a sub-unit of a county.  It turned out that the census of travellers, including travellers who have been housed for that county, was a fraction of the number that the local authority member had claimed to have been housed in his urban area.</P>
    <P>The important base line is, is the number going up or going down of people who are living in conditions that are unsatisfactory to themselves?  In other words, are we providing people with the sort of conditions they wish for themselves? It is important to remember that because travellers live in the open and are visible and because everything they do is done in full sight of the rest of us, it is very easy to presume that they are less given to being hygienic than we are, less given to concern for their children and so on.</P>
    <P>People who lived in Cork during the corporation dispute some years ago will remember that the settled citizens of Cork city, when the refuse collection services were taken away from them, were not exactly models of sanitary behaviour or good hygiene either.  If people do not have the facilities to have refuse collected and disposed of there is no great distinction that I can see between members of the settled community and others. Refuse piled up in Cork in the most extraordinary places.  A main thoroughfare, a dual carriageway that goes past the city dump, was almost closed because of indiscriminate dumping by respectable settled members of the community.  The IDA would not take prominent industrialists, who were being brought into the city from the airport, by the shortest route which was the new road because of the sights they would see.  These would remind them, in the words of a member of the IDA, of some of the worst manifestations of the Third World so let us not point to the travellers.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> some years ago reported the travellers of an unofficial <Col N="1973" /> halting site in north County Dublin issuing a plea to the settled community to stop dumping their rubbish on the travellers' site.  They were trying to keep it clean and the settled community were using the travellers' halting site as a dump.  There has been a succession of such incidents.  It is not necessary, every time one talks about a vulnerable group, to apologise for listing their deficiencies. We all have deficiencies.  It is not just among travelling families that there are drink problems; it is not just among travelling families that there are neglected children; it is not just among travelling families that you find any particular social problem.  There is a number of very positive qualities that the travelling community have, particularly a very intense sense of the extension of the family which, if it existed among the settled community, could mitigate a considerable number of increasingly serious social problems.</P>
    <P>There has been a commendable development among most local authorities in terms of trying to provide for travelling people.  There has been a decrease in the number of people who are prepared to use hysterical language for political purposes.  There has been a considerable increase in maturity.  Various agencies, among them the Church, have contributed to that by forcing people into more mature debate. However, that does not get away from the fact that there are still local authorities&mdash; and the Minister and I appear to agree that Limerick Corporation is one of them &mdash; who have done very little in this area.  The Minister might explain how anybody can make an authority like that do something about it.  If he can, I will be the first to compliment him on it. I cannot but comment, in the light of something Senator Mooney said, which was quite correct, that the city which has the worst record for housing travellers is the one which is most given to public manifestations of faith once a year in a massive out-pouring of religious fervour under the manifestation of the Confraternity. I find that rather ironic, but maybe nobody else does.</P>

      <P>They are models of probity in the county.  Another matter on the issue of travelling people that I would commend to the Minister, which is not his responsibility but nevertheless concerns many travellers and would help them greatly, is the elimination of discrimination against people simply because they are travellers.  This is a problem, particularly for young people who are members of the travelling community and can be excluded.  All the provisions for housing, etc., will not help if that community do not have the right to participate in the services and the various other leisure activities of our society. That is a matter for legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not know if this section will make a difference because there is nothing there that was not there already.  What may make a difference is the long and well-expressed commitment of the Minister to do something about it.  I hope that the encouragement from this House will help him to keep up his resolve.

      <P>Is there not something illogical about the State making money available to pay for building land which has been made valuable simply because <Col N="1975" /> the State decided to zone it as building land?  This relates back to the question of the price of building land and to a report which the rest of the country may have forgotten, but which Senator Ferris and I will never forget because a long period of our lives is invested in it.  Is the Minister proposing to take any action on many of the recommendations therein, to do with the price of building land, so as to reduce the need for subsidies?  There are other ways in which the State can get its hands on building land.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Seanad do now adjourn.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I express my thanks and pleasure that it has been found possible to debate this motion this evening, because the loss of 290 lives in one tragic accident is something that affects the whole of mankind. Most of us, I assume, believe in the universality of man and in the brotherhood of man under the fatherhood of God.  An action that blasts 290 people into eternity is something about which all right-minded people would express concern <Col N="1976" /> and regret and would seek to have an adequate explanation and the fullest possible information.</P>
    <P>I was prompted to raise this matter because I was somewhat disappointed at the absence of any Government statement on it.  I understand that condolences have been expressed to the Iranian Government on the tragic loss of human life but my understanding is that no public statement of this fact has been made.  I noted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today, 5 July, that a Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman said that it was not Government policy to issue statements on matters which do not touch Ireland directly. I am very unhappy about that statement. To me it is a sort of bureaucratic double-speak; it could be about anything at all. It does not reflect the fact that 290 people were blown into eternity by an action, whether committed willingly or accidentally. The questions must be asked: are we indifferent?  Do we approve?</P>
    <P>I hope that this debate will give an opportunity to the Government to state clearly, unequivocally and publicly what should have been stated and it will be very worth while if as many Senators as possible contribute to this debate.</P>
    <P>This terrible loss of life does affect Ireland directly and I hope to develop that in the course of my contribution. It is important to discuss exactly what happened in so far as it is possible.  This was by any standard an appalling incident. Two hundred and ninety civilian passengers, most of them Iranian, were killed when the Iran Air Flight 655 crashed into the Gulf on Sunday after being hit by two missiles fired from the US guided missile destroyer the <i>Vincennes.</i>  The aircraft was seven minutes into a scheduled 45 minute flight from Bandak Abbas, a port in the south of Iran, to Dubai, and the United States is being criticised by friend and foe.  The commander of the <i>Vincennes</i> would appear to have had considerable doubt about the identification of the target before firing his missiles despite the fact that the <i>Vincennes</i> had a sophisticated radar and missile system &mdash; probably the most sophisticated system <Col N="1977" /> in the world &mdash; and it failed to determine what kind of aircraft was closing on the ship.</P>
    <P>I welcome to the Visitors' Gallery two members of the staff of the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran.  Their presence here this evening is an indication of the seriousness and gravity with which they view this most tragic incident.  I understand that the Iranian Ambassador, His Excellency Bahran Ghaseni paid a formal visit to Iveagh House today and officially requested that the Irish Government should condemn this inhuman act. The considered view of the Iranian Government and their ambassador here is that all available indicators show that this action was deliberate.  However, we must await the outcome of a full inquiry and more detailed information before we can pass absolute judgment as to what caused this terrible tragedy because there are very many questions which require answering.</P>
    <P>There is a question about the seeming failure of the airbus to respond to radio signals; there is a question about the flight path of the aircraft; there is a question about its transponder which would have identified the plane and which was apparently switched off.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the United States Department of Defence have so speedily instituted a formal inquiry into the circumstances, but I contend that an international commission should be established immediately.  I was interested that tonight on the 10 o'clock news on RTE 1 it was announced that the Secretary General of the United Nations, Perez de Cuellar, called for a similar international commission of inquiry.  It is obvious that so great is the mistrust between the Governments of Iran and the United States that an inquiry instituted by either of those bodies would not give satisfaction to either country, nor would it satisfy the international community. The establishment of an international commission would go a long way towards allaying the legitimate concerns of so many people right around the world which have surfaced as a consequence of this dreadful incident.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1978" /> I am very unhappy about some of the phrases used by the President of the United States.  Some of his statements have been, to say the very least, unfortunate. It has been called by him an understandable accident and on Sunday he called it a proper defensive action.  I suppose, if one were to choose, an understandable accident is slightly better than a proper defensive action, but neither of these statements really reflects the full horror of what has occurred.  The suggestion has been made that the President of the United States should have limited himself to a simple statement of responsibility, coupled with a promise to pay generous compensation to the families of the victims and, indeed, many American citizens have voiced their concern at the absence of a statement which has indicated a willingness to pay compensation to the victims.  The sums involved in the context of the amount of money which the American Government spend on defence would be minuscule and one could contrast it with th cost of keeping the <i>Vincennes</i> on station for a week. However, the moral gains would be absolutely enormous and I hope I will be joined by other Senators in calling on the United States to do what it has done in the past when similar incidents have occurred, to make generous payment to those families who have been bereaved, not that it can restore their loved ones, not that it can undo the hurt, the pain, the damage but it would make a point and it would ensure that there was at least some evidence of genuine concern and decency about what has happened.  It is important to talk about the effects of this incident.</P>
    <P>I now come to the point where I feel the silence from Government here could have prolonged the agony of the hostages. We are concerned, in particular, about the hostage, Brian Keenan, from Northern Ireland.  Many commentators, and I have read deeply about this over the last two days, feel that the lives of the hostages in Lebanon may have been endangered or their agony at the very least prolonged as a consequence of this incident.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1979" /> The modern faction within Iran will certainly have been undermined by what has happened.  I think they will find it very difficult to sustain themselves in their moderate views in a country where there is a very strong tradition of Islamic fundamentalism and where a moderate position is difficult to hold firm to.  The incident will have damaged the hope of an early rapprochment between Iran and the West.  Any people observing the position will be aware that over the past few weeks some quite worth while useful negotiations had been going on and these may very well have been put on ice as a consequence of this terrible incident.</P>
    <P>It is important to examine United States policy in the Gulf.  It is true to say that certain benefits have flowed from this.  It is important that a major international waterway should be kept open. It is important that oil supplies for the West and Japan should be secured.  It is important that the Gulf States should be protected against attack from hostile forces in the area, and that neutral shipping should be protected.  But the question must be asked, is the scale of the United States naval presence in the Gulf too large?  Increasingly liberal rules of engagement add to the likelihood of violent incident and commentators have stated that the rules of engagement were changed very recently and that the change had not been communicated to other people for whom this information would have been significant and that that is not unconnected with the incident. What has been played out in the Gulf is a very dangerous game.  All war is dangerous.  All war carries the risk of the loss of life and we have seen the effects of that on 3 and 4 July.  What is required is greater circumspection, more restraint and above all competence, because while there is always the likelihood of human error even in the most sophisticated situation &mdash; and certainly the equipment on the <i>Vincennes</i> would appear to be the most sophisticated in the world &mdash; it would appear that there was a monumental lack of competence and that is to be absolutely deplored.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1980" /> I come back to the fact that the Government did not choose to make a public statement of its regret at the loss of life.  I am not necessarily asking that they would condemn the American involvement in all of this because the facts have to be clearly established; there has to be an international commission of inquiry, but I do not see why a public expression of sympathy should not have been made known to the Irish people.  I understand that the Pope has sent condolences and messages of sympathy to the bereaved families and has let it be known.  We have sent a message of condolences but we really did not let it be made known to the public.  Expressions of regret have come from many other countries all over the world: Japan, Australia, Egypt, Holland and China, the list is endless.  In some ways we have been muted in our response to this in marked contrast to our attitudes when other incidents occurred and when we were less shy about coming forward.  I query the reasons for that.</P>
    <P>The incident underscores the need to end the seven year Gulf War.  The involvement of the United States in the Gulf is not necessarily conducive to peace and stability in the region, and we have had the proof of that with this terrible incident.  Iran is exhibiting a maturity, a surprising maturity, in the face of this dreadful occurence.  We are all aware of the situation in Iran and we all know of the very strong fundamentalist forces which prevail in some quarters, and given that situation to date they have shown an extraordinary responsibility and restraint in their reaction.  I hope they will turn the tragedy to serve the interests of Iran and that they will use it and use the public sympathy, which exists right around the world, to press for concessions at the United Nations Security Council and within the United Nations generally.  I hope Ireland will not be found hiding in the thickets of diplomacy when it comes to assisting in a quest for peace in that benighted area of the world.</P>
    <P>A muted response from this Government could, as I have stated, have serious consequences for the hostages.  We must <Col N="1981" /> remember that those who have captured numbers of hostages in Lebanon are the Hezbollah Movement and they are Iranian backed.  They are a volatile group of people.  They could very easily fly off the handle and retaliate against the hostages. I sincerely hope that this will not be the case and that ordeal of the hostages will not be prolonged as a result.  I fail to see why a spokesman from the Department of Foreign Affairs could say that this incident does not impact or impinge directly on the Irish people.  Given the fact that an Irishman is held hostage at the behest of groupings such as this, I feel there is a case to be made and that it does impinge on this country apart from the fact that we share a common humanity with all of those people who met their deaths so suddenly, so dramatically and so terribly.</P>
    <P>It could be interpreted that we were more concerned about our relationships with the United Nations than with the safety of the hostages, and I would be unhappy if that interpretation was put on our silence.  We must ask the question, and certainly when the facts come to light conclusively are we criticial or uncritical of the United States in this action?  Do we admire this action?  How do we feel about it?  I was interested to read a quotation from a United Kingdom Minister of Defence spokesman who stated that: &ldquo;I think it is general knowledge that the Americans have got rather more aggressive rules of engagement than we have&rdquo; and if evidence were needed to that effect we certainly have had it in this particular incident.</P>
    <P>I regard it as a privilege to have been able to raise this issue.  I am grateful that it was accepted and that we are having a debate and that there are so many people in the House this evening.  This House has been criticised in the past for not responding with numerical presence to debates of importance.  This is not the case here tonight.  The presence of so many Senators at this late hour is eloquent testimony to the fact that they care deeply, that they are concerned and wish to see a public expression of deep regret at this incident, and that they wish <Col N="1982" /> Government to pursue every avenue open to them to bring about peace and stability in the region.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say and also the contributions of my colleagues on this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Bulbulia on her alacrity in having this motion put down before the House in the immediate aftermath of the tragic events in the Gulf, and I join with her in expressing very deep regret and deep sympathy with the Iranian people on this tragic loss of life.  I also join with Senator Bulbulia in acknowledging the presence in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery of representatives of the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, an indication of the seriousness with which the representatives of Iran in this country take the debate which is before the House.</P>
      <P>It is never easy to stand in a Parliament and express genuine sympathy particularly at such a distance as we are in Ireland from Iran and the events in the Gulf generally.  The difficulty arises in attempting to convey from a small country on the periphery of Europe to a very large and, to many of our countrymen, a foreign country in the widest sense, the feeling of shock and revulsion many people feel at the action that resulted in the loss of 290 people.  To put it in perspective, if 290 people had been lost over our air space and those 290 people, God between us and all harm, were Irish, not only would there be a day of mourning, there would be a month of mourning.</P>
      <P>It is important for Ireland as a nonaligned country, as a neutral country in the EC, in expressing its sympathy with the Iranian people and with the families and immediate relatives of those who have been so suddenly and tragically killed, that we should not attempt to apportion blame at this early time.  In that spirit I welcome Senator Bulbulia's endorsement of the call by the Secretary General of the United Nations for the setting up of an international inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sad developments in the Gulf since the Iran-Iraq conflict started in 1969 dictate that such an inquiry is the only way <Col N="1983" /> in which both the participants in this instance would perhaps accept conclusions. Iran, a country that constantly refers to the United States as the great Satan, could hardly be referred to as objective in its attitudes towards the United States or any commission that would emerge from the deliberations of that country's military structure.  Similarly the United States, a country who experienced the humiliation and distress of seeing its embassy staff, legitimate diplomats going about their legitimate business, taken as hostages, could not be relied upon to institute an inquiry that would be accepted by the Iranians as impartial and objective.  Therein lies a dilemma.  I reiterate that Ireland as a non-aligned country is a neutral country and considering the history of the relationship between Iran and the United States and the on going Iran-Iraq war we could at best act only as an honest broker rather than taking sides.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious while speaking in our national Parliament on this issue that there are in Lebanon hostages allegedly held by the Hezbollah group who, if one is to believe news reports emanating from that area over a long number of years, make no secret of their allegiance and loyalty to the Imam Khomeini in Iran. Consequently, any remarks I make, and I am sure my colleagues will agree, must be tempered by awareness of the tragic reality that among those hostages is one of our own citizens, Brian Keenan.  Anybody who read in the <i>Observer</i> the reports by the returned French hostages on the week following their release, of the experiences they and their still imprisoned colleagues suffered has to be very circumspect in any comments or opinions expressed about the Iranian régime.</P>
    <P>I feel very strong sympathy this evening for the families and relatives of those hostages, especially the family of Brian Keenan in Belfast.  I should like to take this opportunity to ask the representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran present if they have any influence and compassion to convey to the Hezbollah group, either directly or indirectly, <Col N="1984" /> the feelings of the vast majority of Irish people that Brian Keenan's long darkness and that of the other hostages should end, and I think of that great churchman, Terry Waite, in the same context. Against that background this debate is taking place in relation to the loss of life of 290 Iranians.  It is sad that one must link the events of last weekend with the ongoing events in Beirut.  I wish it were not so but it is a fact of international life.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia has questioned the legitimacy of the United States in the Gulf.  I do not feel it is my right to question that legitimacy any more than it is my right to question the legitimacy of the ongoing conflict between Iran and Iraq other than to express the hope to see it ended, and ended soon.  However some questions must be raised and I would be remiss if I were not at least to put on record my own troubled observations about the events of last weekend.  I do not wish in any way to diminish the enormity of the loss of life that was experienced, but the Straits of Hormuz is today one of the most dangerous waterways in the world.  The high level of military activity in that area, the US presence notwithstanding, due to the conflict between Iran and Iraq, means that civilians going about their legitimate business in this area have in some cases lost their lives and in many other cases, their ships were damaged.  Yet, a civilian airliner with 290 innocent civilians on board chose its flightpath across this waterway when there was a confrontation between the <i>USS Vincennes</i> and a number of Iranian gunboats.</P>
    <P>I hope that the commission of inquiry will establish the circumstances surrounding the decision to allow that airliner to take off.  I will go no further than that.  We must be fair to both sides.  When reading the initial news stories one could not help but be horrified at the manner in which two surface to air missiles hit a civilian aircraft.  Until the matter has been fully investigated by a competent commission of inquiry, by an acceptable commission of inquiry, questions raised by the actions of the US commander on <Col N="1985" /> the <i>USS Vincennes</i>, by the Iranian military command who were involved in combat with the US boat, and the take off of a civilian airliner, remain unanswered.</P>
    <P>On a wider front, the implications of the events of last weekend for the continuing conflict in the Gulf, and the relations between the United States and Iran will need to be addressed.  In a political context, this was probably the worst time for such an incident.  This tragedy occurred at a time when the more moderate elements in the Islamic Republic of Iran seemed to be emerging strongly.  I accept that Mr. Rafsanjani and his moderates face a severe difficulty in calming the wild men in his administration, especially those religious mullahs whose brand of Muslim fundamentalism makes the rest of Islam and the wider non-Islamic world shiver.</P>
    <P>Recent events seem to indicate that there was a thaw setting in in that area. The activities of the Syrian Army in West Beirut, in reducing the influence of the Hezbollah, the identification of the area in which the hostages were being kept, the appointment of Mr. Rafsanjani as Supreme Commander of the Iranian Forces, the recent decision to release the French hostages, and the equally recent decision of the United Kingdom to reopen negotiations on payment of a loan to Iran, all these straws in the wind seemed to indicate that a break in the deadlock was imminent.  Those straws in the wind coupled with the tragic military losses or military gains, whichever side of the fence you are on &mdash; the losses by Iran of territory in recent offences by the Iraqis and the regaining of Iraqi land, and the harmorrhage of Iran from the ongoing military losses suffered by its conscripts &mdash; all seemed to suggest that, perhaps at last, the beginning of the end of the world's longest internecine conflict was in sight.</P>
    <P>Two surface to air missiles seem to have set back all these initiatives.  I pray that it is not so.  I pray to the same God as the Islamic people that, notwithstanding the deep shock, revulsion and anger against their sworn enemy, the United States, all that has been experienced by <Col N="1986" /> the people of Iran will be tempered by compassion.  Sometimes Christians think they have a monopoly on compassion, but there is much in the Koran to commend it to Christians.  The population of Iran adhere very closely to the tenets of the Koran, perhaps more than many of us Christians adhere to the tenets of the Bible.  I hope moderation will rule the day.</P>
    <P>The appointment of Mr. Rafsanjani as the Supreme Commander by the Imam Khomenei was a wise decision.  Mr. Rafsanjani has emerged as a man of moderation, a pragmatic politician.  As Supreme Commander, his efforts to combine the revolutionary guards and the regular Iranian Army into a united structure augurs well for the future of that sad country.</P>
    <P>I have little else to add to this debate other than to reiterate my deep sympathy and deep regret to the families and relatives of the 290 Iranian citizens who so tragically lost their lives last weekend and to hope that even the moderate element in the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran will not retaliate and so escalate an already delicate and difficult international situation.  I know there is an old saying &ldquo;an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth&rdquo; but if one keeps continually gouging out eyes and taking away teeth, eventually there is nothing left but emptiness, and then what sort of a world would we leave as a legacy to our children?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with everybody else in this House and not only in this country but in the civilised world, I would like to express my shock and outrage at the bringing down of a civilian aircraft by military action.  It seems to me that this is a most deplorable situation.  It is one that has occurred with increasing frequency in recent years.  The attention of the House has already been drawn to a similar incident involving the Russian airforce and the Korean jet liner.  The Israeli airforce, in 1983, in comparable circumstances, also downed a Libyan civilian aircraft.  It is a regrettable fact that these incidents appear to be occurring with <Col N="1987" /> increasing frequency.  Nobody who is not made of stone and who saw on the television news the faces of the relatives of those who were on that plane and the grief they so clearly expressed could do other than associate themselves with the strongest expression of human solidarity with them and share in their grief as human beings.</P>
      <P>It greatly surprises me, particularly in the light of the utterly inadequate response of President Reagan when he said that this was an understandable accident &mdash; I do not understand it.  I refuse to understand it &mdash; that our Government have not seen fit to make public comment condemning this situation.  The excuse, as I understand it, that it does not touch Irish people directly, is not, in my opinion, a valid excuse and is not one that is congruent with the Irish Government's policy, quite correctly, on another occasion when the <i>Belgrano</i> was sunk by the illegal activities of President Reagan's comrade in arms, Mrs. Thatcher.  The Irish Government at that time had the courage and foresight, and had the correct understanding of what the meaning of neutrality was, to distance themselves from that act which I consider, as do many of my countrymen, to have been a criminal act.  Apart from that, I would remind the House of the words of the great poet John Donne who said with regard to the deaths of all human beings: &ldquo;No man is an island entire of it self. When the bell tolls, send not to know for whom it tolls, it tolls for thee&rdquo;.  I believe that witnessing the grief and suffering of those relatives, who are not all Iranians, who also included among their numbers other nationalities for whom we also must grieve, innocent civilian travellers, we must call into question the intentions and activities of the American Navy in this area.  I will return to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I would like to make it perfectly clear, that my condolences are directed to the Iranian people and to the relatives of those who were injured and not to the Iranian regime, because I do not believe that the Iranian regime has the moral right to inherit the grief of <Col N="1988" /> those who were done to death in this fashion.  I remind the House that while this regime may contain moderates, there are degrees of moderation, and moderation in Iran may mean one thing; it means a very different thing to me.  I welcome the opportunity to say this in the presence of the representatives of this regime.  I cannot regard as sensitive to human rights a Government who clearly connive at hijacking, which is a related crime to the crime that was committed against the people of the world yesterday evening, and which openly barters for human lives.  It does not please me to learn that some of the nations of the world are prepared to return to the medieval system of ransom.  It does not please me that a sovereign Government, however constituted, however arrived at, should consider this an appropriate method of conducting their international discourse, as the Iranian regime so clearly does.</P>
    <P>I do not believe for one minute that being mealy-mouthed in this House is going to ameliorate the condition of those unfortunate people who are held very clearly at what is, if not directly, very close to being directly, the behest of the Iranian regime.  It would also point out that in a very curious way it was disclosed recently that this Iranian regime is in some measure complicit with the American Government for the instruments of torture which were supplied to the secret service of the Shah of Iran.  Here again there could, perhaps, be an international inquiry because, as I understand it, this machinery, redolent of the kind of machinery that was produced by Krupps and J.G. Farben during the Second World War, was sold by American companies to the secret police of the regime of the Shah.  What is the moral responsibility of the manufacturers?  Are they not to be held accountable?  Where is it now, I would like to know?  Is it true that it is currently being employed by the present regime?  I would like also that it should be transmitted back to Teheran that I, for one, am not impressed by a regime making statements with regard to human <Col N="1989" /> rights that has openly persecuted, humiliated and murdered so many thousands of its own citizens, that has isolated the Baha'i religion and subjected them to persecution, that has done to death and mutilated homosexual persons under its jurisdiction in its regime and has used that accusation, whether justifiable or not, to mutilate those people.  They have not the right to assume the role of defenders of human rights or to inherit the grief of those persons who were so tragically killed the other evening.</P>
    <P>I will pass on from that to direct myself specifically to the question of the events in the Gulf of Hormuz.  It seems to me very clear that, not only outside the United States but also within the United States, there are serious concerns about the involvement of the United States Navy in this area.  I would like to echo those concerns.  I notice that in the newspapers of today for example, what are coyly described as inflexible operating procedures may have been responsible for this calamity.  Again, notice the euphemistically technological jargon that is used to cover what is, in fact, a human tragedy of very considerable dimensions. Was this a necessary consequence of the presence of the American Navy in this part of the world?  A report in the World News Section of <i>The Irish Times</i> from Dubai suggested sailors aboard the <i>USS Vincennes</i> may have panicked when they shot down the jet.  What kind of response in military terms is panic, particularly when it involves the loss of innocent civilian lives?</P>
    <P>Here I may say in parenthesis that, I have been rereading the correspondence of George Bernard Shaw and he makes a point which we may well feel it useful to ponder.  He refused, during the Second World War, to condemn the bombing of civilian targets because he felt that warfare had become so abominable that catastrophes such as the bombing of civilian targets, such as large scale civilian casualties and such as the kind of thing that we witnessed last night were, rather than being regrettable, extremely useful in the sense that humanity was indivisible and it would actually act as a kind of <Col N="1990" /> pressure point upon Governments to bring home to them the real outrage, horror and mutilation of war in a way which they were apparently immune from feeling when it was simply soldiers, whether professional soldiers or conscripts, who were involved.</P>
    <P>There is also the question with regard to the technical elements, such as the transponder on board the aeroplane, the fact that there was apparently some degree of harassment by Iranian gunboats, which was perhaps understandable to use President Reagan's term, but unwise.  I think one of the most important points I would like to put on the record is that senior strategists within the American hierarchy of officialdom have stated clearly that they do not regard the presence of the American Navy in this area as either wise or tactically useful.  I would like to quote what Admiral Gene Le Roque, Director of the Centre for Defence Studies in Washington who is critical of his own Government's position in this matter said.  He said that the captain of the <i>USS Vincennes</i> clearly lacked adequate information when he ordered the missiles to be fired.  He went on to say and I quote:</P>
    <P>We have no business in my view no military reason, to be there.  We have every right to be there &mdash; it's international waters &mdash; but we do not contribute to the peaceful solution of that war by our presence.</P>
    <P>It seems that if the United Nations is to be of any use at all it should have a naval presence there.  After all, this small country honourably contributes to a military peacekeeping presence.  Is it beyond the capacity of the United Nations to organise an international, and, therefore, one would hope non-controversial, naval presence to keep open what is a vital international waterway.  Of course, the Iranian regime clearly understands that this is a vital international waterway and that is one of the reasons they are applying pressure in this particular area.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to support strongly the call by Senator Bulbulia for the establishment of an international <Col N="1991" /> commission which I believe should be under the auspices of the United Nations and if the findings of that international commission should be, as one surmises in the circumstances they must be, some compensation should be paid to the relatives. I would end by saying that nothing could be more cynical, more deplorable and more morally repulsive to me and to many other citizens than for any Government to construe a situation in such a way that it operates to the disadvantage of innocent civilians needlessly caught up in this tragic situation in the Middle East.  I hope the strongest possible message of outrage, and not of mealy-mouthed pleading, will go back to Teheran that we as a people who have a long tradition of suffering and a tradition of valuing individual human rights cannot take anything but the most serious view of a situation in which one of our citizens, Brian Keenan, is held in Beirut and in which the representative of a distinguished head of one of the Christian Churches is treated with such flagrant contempt with the connivance of a regime in Teheran which purports to have a religious basis for its political convictions.</P>

      <P>Before calling on the next speaker let me remind Senators that there are 15 minutes remaining before the Chair will be obliged to call on the Minister.  Senators Connor, Brendan Ryan, Ross and O'Toole, are offering.  There is no restriction on the amount of time that individual Senators may wish to take but perhaps they might bear in mind that there are now four Senators offering with only about 15 minutes remaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This Senator will be the soul of brevity.  I support his motion. Indeed I wish to formally second it.  I feel particularly sad to have to speak on the problems of this region so soon after my contribution on the region a week ago. On Tuesday evening of last week I raised on the Adjournment of this House the plight of Brian Keenan, a citizen of this <Col N="1992" /> country, held hostage in Beiruit.  My contribution then had to encompass the politics and the entangled and intractible state of political affairs in that part of the world.  The Chair will remember that I said then that the Irish Government should take advantage of the changing attitude of Iranian foreign policy towards the West and seek to use the better climate to the advantage of unfortunate people like Brian Keenan.  I remember saying at the time that the diplomatic thaw has created an atmosphere and a time to talk about the release of Brian Keenan that is &mdash; and that time is now.  I said that another incident in the Gulf or somewhere else could blow the air of détente to pieces.  So sadly that incident happened.  It came with devastating suddenness, with a truly awful and tragic loss of life a few days ago.  Now the least our Government can do is express their regret that this incident took place.  We should, as a country which is very friendly with the United States of America and not at all unfriendly with the Islamic Republic of Iran, seek to use our good offices with both Governments to bring about something bordering on normal relations between them or at least to do something that might end the state of war between them.</P>
      <P>The Gulf area is a cockpit in superpower rivalries for all kinds of strategic reasons, rather in the way that poor Belgium was the cockpit of rivalry between the centre and Axis powers in 1914.  This kind of incident has all the potential to ignite into the ultimate Armageddon involving the superpowers.  There are rights and wrongs on both sides of this row and the tensions go back a long way.  True, there was much resentment among many ordinary Persians at the role of the West in the overthrow of Mossadeq in 1953. There was resentment over the US continued support for the Pahlavi dynasty long after it was evident that the Shah and his peacock throne was a repressive tyranny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the overthrow of the Shah we had the implacable hostility of the Khomeini Government towards the United States, culminating in the seizure <Col N="1993" /> of the US embassy and the taking hostage of the embassy staff, an act totally unacceptable by any standard of civilised relations between two countries.  There was the execution of the Kurds and other opponents of the new regime carried out publicly, photographed and filmed publicly, for the world media.  These incidents did enormous damage to the international reputation of Iran.  Many observers, this one included, felt that Iran, occupying a part of the world where western civilisiation was born and flourished for golden ages, had somehow by the excesses shown in the early days of the revolution, stepped out of the realm of civilisation.</P>
    <P>While I believe that the Reagan administration is fundamentally hostile to the administration in Iran, President Carter who was President at the time of the Iranian revolution was not fundamentally hostile towards the Iranian revolution and would have gone a long way towards establishing normal friendly relations with Teheran after Pahlavi but he was thwarted from doing so, particularly by the case of the embassy hostages.  Since the advent of the Ronald Reagan presidency in 1980 the relationship and the attitude towards the revolutionary regime in Iran has been frozen in deep hostility.  I suppose it is true that the hostility is and was fully reciprocated by Teheran but one cannot escape the comment or the remark of Jesse Jackson, a candidate in the current American presidential race.  He said American policy in that area of the world was one of guided missiles and misguided policies. However, in recent months there were signs that the past ten years of hostility and isolation of Iran might be coming to an end.  Power in Iran was clearly passing to a group of pragmatists lead by Mr. Rafsanjani.  Mr. Rafsanjani has shown clear signs of statesmanship and courage. He clearly wants a negotiated settlement of this awful war with Iraq and in that quest he has used a language of moderation and reason.  Recently in another hopeful move he has become the effective commander-in-chief of the Iranian <Col N="1994" /> army and very evidently he speaks to the world in the language of reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Only last Saturday he very courageously, and I would say magnamiously, said that Iran had often pushed those who could be neutral into hostility and had done nothing to attract those who could be their friends.  We will not go into reasons for the present presence and build up of US forces in the Gulf.  We all agree that attacks on international shipping, in international waters, is unacceptable and intolerable and the role of America in coming in as an international policeman to protect shipping and to stop mine laying in international waters was admirable, if indeed it was not enviable.</P>
    <P>However, there comes a time when these military build ups become more provocative then useful and this in my opinion is what happened on Sunday last when the military presence went overboard and almost 300 innocent civilian plane passengers died, echoes of the <i>Lusitania.</i>  It is only correct that we should ask how this terrible miscalculation took place.  The US are the greatest military power in the world.  Their forces have at their disposal the most sophisticated technology, much of it delivery technology attached to nuclear weapons.  We must ask after what happened on Sunday whether this technology is as reliable and as accurate as it is supposed to be?  The <i>USS Vincennes</i>, we are told, is one of the most advanced guided missile cruisers in the world, with not just the most up to date tracking equipment, but with tracking and technological equipment which has been described as futuristic. Why then did this technology not identify this aircraft as an ordinary wide bodied passenger plane?  This kind of identification capability is, we are told, elementary to the technology on board this ship. The plane shot down is one of the most technically advanced passenger aircraft in the world with the latest transponder transmission to identify it.  So there should have been no mismatch or no misunderstanding technologywise between ship and aircraft.</P>
    <P>We also query the suitability of the personnel who operate and have their <Col N="1995" /> hands on the levers of the terrible fire power of the US.  Are some of those people when subjected to the heat and the reality of combat able to react properly and not become trigger happy and liable under pressure to make terrible mistakes and miscalculations?  These questions are asked by a friend of America and this friend of America has no problem in putting his name to this motion calling on our Government to publicly express our deepest regret on behalf of the Irish people that this awful incident had to take place and that we should do all in our power to see that this kind of thing never happens again by seeking to remove the reason for war between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran.</P>
    <P>We also must appeal to our Iranian friends, through the Chair, not to overreact over this.  Restraint is always the better part of valour.  We appeal to them to continue their recent policy of seeking better relations with those whom they have seen in the recent past as hostile or unfriendly.  We plead with them to do all possible to ensure that in this time of grief and high emotion the hostages in Beirut are not harmed.  Nothing could turn a real feeling of sympathy and sorrow for what has happened, which is not just a feeling of sympathy for the relatives of those who lost their lives, but is in a real sense a feeling of sympathy, condolence and friendship towards Iran itself.  This ironically creates the atmosphere to achieve what we know Rafsanjani and his pragmatic friends want to achieve.</P>
    <P>Finally, let us unreservedly do what the motion asks.  In 1983 we had no difficulty in expressing our regret and indeed our shock and horror when Russia shot down at Korean passenger airline over Sakhalin Island.  Ronald Reagan said that incident was a crime against humanity and a massacre and at this incident he said it was a terrible human tragedy.  We should have no difficult as a small neutral country of seeing it as a terrible human tragedy in every sense of the word and from every point of view so let us publicly express our regret.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment both the Minister and the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I am a bit astonished, I could say a lot about the regime in Iran, but I remember on 15 and 16 April 1986 when Korean Airlines Flight 007 was shot down by the Soviet Union, there was no circumspection about the denunciations then.  Words like murder and savagery and brutality etc. were thrown around with absolute abandon not just in this country but all over Western Europe and North America.  Nobody had the least inhibition about using language like that. Anybody who wants to read a fairly objective account of what happened then should read this morning's <i>London Independent.</i> The parallels are frightening and the circumstances do not differ that much.  Yet we now have the good guys doing something equally appalling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I condemned what the Soviet Union did without any qualms or reservations. If people cannot organise their awesome military might in a way that guarantees the security of civilian airlines it is highly questionable whether that power or that military might is any use to anybody, if it becomes a greater threat than the alleged threat they are trying to counter.  This particular incident has caused more deaths than the whole of the activities in the Gulf prior to this.  It is time that somebody said quite bluntly, you had better have a rethink.  What happened in <Col N="1997" /> the Gulf in the last couple of days was, I choose to believe, an unfortunate accident but it cannot be dismissed because it was an accident.  People who have accidents are often culpable, accidents and non culpability are not mutually exclusive. Because it was an accident does not mean that those who caused it were not culpable.</P>
    <P>Three hundred people were killed because either the United States authorities cannot give their naval commanders proper orders, the naval commanders cannot run their vessels properly, or the people who are in charge of the weaponry on those vessels cannot run their business properly.  Whichever the option, the truth is that an appalling mistake was made and those who made that mistake were in the wrong and they should not be excluded or equivocated about.  What they did was wrong and it does not matter who the regime was, it does not matter what you think of it, it was still wrong.  It is particularly ironic to suggest that because you disapprove of a régime the victims are somehow less innocent.  If anything it makes them more innocent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened was wrong.  Those who did it were wrong. They deserve to be reprimanded, if not condemned, because what they did was wrong.  A fundamental question mark hangs over the alleged reasons for their presence there.  They refuse to participate in an international peace-keeping force.  They want all the action for themselves. There are other reasons why it was wrong.  It should not have happened and it deserves to be condemned with the same ferocity that the Soviet Union were quite rightly condemned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out one extraordinary flaw in the Government's reaction to this.  The Government said, in response to a question about why they have not issued the required condemnation of this, that they do not issue statements if it does not affect Ireland <Col N="1998" /> directly.  That is nonsense.  Do we have no moral authority in the Government? I should like to refer to a statement quite rightly issued by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs this afternoon.  He said, referring to a previous incident about apartheid, that on that occasion he renewed the call of successive Irish Governments for the immediate and unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and his fellow political prisoners and welcomed the opportunity the debate provided to renew this call. That is in direct contravention to the statement issued by the Government about this issue.  They are going to have to make up their minds.  They cannot take the moral high ground on one issue and then not take the moral high ground on an issue when it affects America.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I seriously condemn the moral cowardice of the Government to take a stand on this issue.  No one is asking the Government to judge what happened.  We are asking them to stand up to the Americans and condemn what happened and the consequences of what happened.  That is consistent with neutrality and the sort of moral high ground the Government are rightly capable of taking on other issues, and rightly took this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I shall conclude by saying that while I, like everybody else in this House, deplore what happened &mdash; I do not know what happened but I deplore the loss of innocent lives &mdash; I would like to reiterate and underline what my colleague, Senator Norris said a few minutes ago.  The Iranian régime have no right whatsoever to exploit this for their own international benefit.  No régime I have come across in the world today has less respect for minorities or for human life than the Iranian régime.  It is wrong that this debate, and other world reaction, should be exploited by the Iranians for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us condemn what happened but let us not forget that this is the régime which is involved in hostage-taking, that this is <Col N="1999" /> the régime which is involved in hijacking, that this is the régime that condoned the storming of the US Embassy in Iran and that this is the régime that has murdered many of its minority citizens without any regard whatsoever for human life.  It is right that we should remember that today.  The message should go out, loud and clear, from this House, if we are to pass a motion of this sort, that while we deplore and express horror at what happened, that régime cannot take it as any message of comfort for them about their other activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for the extension of time and also the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine.  We had a discussion here some weeks ago about the atrocity in Lisburn, where the victims happened to be wearing British army uniforms.  At that time I took great exception to linking them with the régime they represented.  Similarly, I do not beleive that the medieval and unsustainable Iranian régime is relevant to the point here today.</P>
      <P>My views on it are quite simple and clear.  I could never support what is happening in Iran but the lesson to be learned from the event on Sunday night was that the most sophisticated war weaponry which can wreak havoc and deliver murder and slaughter with pinpoint accuracy from a range of over 1,000 miles, failed to distinguish between a passenger plane and a bomber.  The reason it is important to recall that at this point is because those who peddle in that hardware tell us that this will be our defence in the future, they tell us that we can rely on them.  Those same people, who now want the American Star Wars proposals and who cannot be relied upon to recognise aggression from anything else, are carrying the future of the world in a suitcase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot find the words to express the horror at the death of over 200 adults and 50 or 60 children.  There are no words to describe it.  I do not think anything can justify what happened or the reasons for <Col N="2000" /> it.  It was totally wrong and deserves to be condemned.  It is a reflection on the régime who had charge of the plane and on those whose bomb brought down that innocent passenger plane.  Neutrality is no excuse.  We have a clear duty to condemn and criticise this kind of action, whether it comes from those who purport to be our friends or our enemies.</P>

Gabhaim buíochas chomh maith leis na Seanadóirí nach bhfuair seans labhairt ar an ábhar seo ach a d'fhan ag an uair mhall seo den oíche.  Taispeánann sé an imní atá orthu agus, dar ndóigh, orainn go léir tar éis na traigéide nuair a cailleadh 290 daoine ar an Domhnach seo caite.</P>
      <P>Leaving all of the other considerations aside, the shooting down of the Iran Airline plane on 3 July, resulting in the death of 290 people, is a human tragedy of the highest order.  Like everyone else who heard the news, the Government were shocked at the terrible loss of so many innocent lives.  The Government have conveyed to the Government of Iran, through diplomatic channels, our profound sympathy at the tragic loss and have expressed to the friends and relatives of the victims our sincere condolences in their bereavement.  I know that Members of this House would wish me to avail of this occasion to repeat their heartfelt expressions of deep regret of what has occurred.</P>
      <P>Senators have, understandably, been concerned with the question of responsibility for these events.  There is clearly a conflict between the United States on the one side and Iran on the other on the facts of the case which were at the origin of this tragic occurrence.  It will be appreciated that it is not possible for the Government to adjudicate on the facts which are in dispute.  What we have done is to express our deep regret that so many innocent lives have been lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible to say, however, that one <Col N="2001" /> of the contributing factors to the tragedy is the effective state of war that exists in the Gulf and the threat posed thereby to the important principle of freedom of navigation in international waters.  The continuing conflict between Iran and Iraq lies at the heart of this instability.</P>
    <P>The position of the Government with regard to the conflict is clear and unequivocal.  In our view the UN Security Council, the body to which the international community has assigned primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, is the appropriate forum through which a solution should be found.  By adopting Resolution 598 the Security Council have shown that they are concerned to discharge their responsibilities in this regard.  Resolution 598 sets out a framework for finding a solution to the conflict between Iran and Iraq.  It is now almost one year since the resolution was adopted and we are aware that discussions on its implementation have been conducted with both parties by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.  The tragic events of last Sunday demonstrate the urgency of finding a way in which both parties can agree to find a solution within the UN framework.</P>
    <P>Here I believe it would be appropriate for me to say that innocent third parties such as Brian Keenan, who was mentioned by a number of Senators, and indeed the other hostages, have no responsibility for the continuation of the conflict or for the worsening of the situation in the Gulf.  I am sure Senator Bulbulia was not implying that any possible mistreatment of the hostages could be justified by what has happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government continue to call for the release of Brian Keenan and do not consider that his detention can be justified.  The Government will continue to do everything within their power to promote a solution within the UN framework.  We will do so against the background of our consistent support for all efforts to bring about a <Col N="2002" /> just and peaceful solution.  We will continue to avail of all opportunities open to us in bilateral contacts and in the United Nations to press for a speedy solution within the framework of the United Nations.  With our partners in the Twelve we are convinced that this provides the basis for a comprehensive, durable and honourable settlement.  The Twelve remain willing to offer any assistance they can to the Secretary General as he seeks to make progress in that area.</P>
      <P>While continuing to press for a negotiated settlement within the United Nations framework the Government have also made clear on a number of occasions our particular concern about specific aspects of the conflict.  We have repeatedly expressed our unreserved condemnation of the use of chemical weapons and the need for strict compliance with the principles of international humanitarian law prohibiting the use of such weapons in armed conflict. We have made known our concern at attacks on centres of population which further increase the suffering of the civilian populations of both parties.  We have also condemned attacks on unarmed shipping in the Gulf and made clear our support for the fundamental principle of freedom of navigation.  Our interventions are motivated by concern for the provision of international law as well as by purely humanitarian considerations. They are in no way inconsistent with our position of strict neutrality between the belligerents.  Pending the termination of hostilities for which we devoutedly hope and for which we will continue to work assiduously, we will continue both nationally and in concert with our partners in the Community to make known our views on matters of concern which arise in the course of the conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amid the recriminations over what did or did not transpire last week-end, one fact alone stands out clearly: the already alarmingly high death toll attributable to this conflict has been increased still further. We must hope that from this tragedy the impetus to build a just and enduring peace will grow.  A region rich in the resources of people and natural <Col N="2003" /> endowments deserves the opportunity to fulfil its undoubted potential.  The people of Ireland profoundly hope that a settlement acceptable to all parties can be arrived at so that two nations, with each of which we have ties of friendship, can be restored to conditions of peace nd stability.  The international community, through the United Nations, stands ready to play its part in the attainment of this objective.  We earnestly hope that this opportunity will now be seized so that the cycle of death and destruction can at long last be reversed.</P>
    <P>In reference to the motion tabled I hope I have made it abundantly clear that <Col N="2004" /> the Government have voiced their deep regret and will continue to pursue, as they have done, every avenue open to them to bring peace and stability to the region.  I can, therefore, agree with the terms of the motion as tabled.</P>
