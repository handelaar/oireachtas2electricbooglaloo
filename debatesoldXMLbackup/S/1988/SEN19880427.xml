    <Title>Seanad Chamber Repairs: Statement by Cathaoirleach.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call the Leader of the House on the Order of Business I wish to bring Members up-to-date on the repair work in the Seanad Chamber.  Senators will recall that when I informed the House on the first three quarterly progress reports by the Office of Public Works on the repair work on 22 July and 30 September of last year and 20 January this year I gave an undertaking to keep Members informed of the up-to-date position as quarterly reports by the Office of Public Works come to hand.  I now wish to make an announcement for the information of the House in regard to the fourth progress report by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works report that the work is proceeding satisfactorily.  The strengthening works to the floor are now completed and the gable wall does not now have to be demolished as originally thought.  Instead the existing stonework can be reinforced.  Reinforcing the wall instead of knocking it down has a number of obvious advantages and I quote from the report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It means the Chamber will not be exposed to the elements while the wall is being re-built.  It is considered more acceptable from a conservation point of view since the original stonework <Col N="484" /> will not now be disturbed.  As a consequence of this the distortion in the wall will not now be corrected but this is not structurally significant.  The change will also yield a small cost-saving.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Seanad ceiling which I know has been a cause of great concern to Senators, the reports states and I quote:</P>
    <P>We are now very hopeful that it will be possible to save the ceiling.  The investigation of possible methods of doing this is still incomplete but the prognosis now is quite favourable.  The areas of the ceiling which have already been lost will be faithfully restored.</P>
    <P>The report concludes by referring to the noise factor in the work which I referred to at length on 20 January last and I quote:</P>
    <P>The drilling involved in the new method of dealing with the gable wall is unfortunately very noisy but on the other hand has the advantage that the noisest part of the work of strengthening the wall will be concentrated into a shorter period.</P>
    <P>We are continuing to make every effort to minimise the level of inconvenience caused to the operation of the Senate and of Leinster House generally. Towards this end we arranged to have the drilling work continued in the week after Easter which is a holiday week in the building industry.</P>
    <P>The continued understanding and patience of the members of the Senate is very much appreciated.</P>
    <P>The report concludes on that note and I echo these sentiments and ask for the continued co-operation of Members which I have got from day one.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to refer briefly to the ventilation problem in our temporary Chamber.  As you know, this problem has been raised many times both here and also at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for some time now.</P>
    <P>Following extensive consultations with the Minister of State, Deputy Noel <Col N="485" /> Treacy, over the Easter recess air conditioning is to be installed within a number of weeks.  I hope that the installation of air conditioning will solve the problem as I am only too well aware of the discomfort felt by Members.  I have before me a letter which I received from the Minister this morning, after reminding him again that I wanted it for every Member of the House.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Dear Tras,</P>
    <P>I again refer to your recent letters regarding ventilation in the temporary Seanad Chamber.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Commissioners that, even with careful monitoring of the existing system and the fitting of air vents in the windows and of thermostatic valves, it has not been possible to prevent a rise in temperature while the Senate is in session.  There are two main reasons for this: (i) because of the large volume of water in this old system there is a long time lag before the action of the thermostatic valves results in a temperature change in the room; and (ii) the level of attendance in such a small room is very high and thus has contributed to the rise in temperature.</P>
    <P>It is considered that in order to overcome the problem it will be necessary to fit air conditioning units under two of the windows.  The condensers for these units will be located on the flat roof over the main entrance.  Work on this will commence as soon as security clearance of the proposed contractor is confirmed and should be completed within a few days with the least disruption possible to the business of the House.</P>
    <P>I hope that this will resolve these difficulties.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Noel Treacy, T.D., Minister of State.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator John Connor that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> The need for the Minister for the Environment to make an immediate increase in the roads block grant to Roscommon County Council in order that serious deficiencies on dangerous stretches of roadway in the county can be rectified and made passable again.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Gerry Reynolds of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The inclusion of County Leitrim as a pilot area for funding through the integrated rural development scheme.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Connor and Reynolds as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Connor's motion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded. Senator Reynolds may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 1 and 2 today.  Because the Labour Party have been given the opportunity to act as a group I think we should have a restriction on the amount of time each contributor should have to speak on the motion in their names since there is an amendment in from the Fine Gael Party.  The motion has been restricted to one hour and a half instead of three hours.  If the normal procedure that has been in vogue in terms of motions from groups were followed, it would mean that the Government Party would not have any opportunity to get involved in this. If we could have agreement that ten minutes would be the time for the proposer and seven minutes for everybody else, we might reach an accommodation which would be agreeable to the Labour Party and have a reasonable discussion on the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to hear the report from the Minister on the status of the Seanad building.  I am glad he recognised that the level of attendance is one of the problems that is associated with the temperature in <Col N="487" /> the building.  I never heard that thermostatic valves could be introduced which would lower the temperature in a House of Parliament.  Nevertheless, it does not appear that thermostatic valves are not appropriate in this instance and that the level of attendance is very good. I am delighted that the ceiling in the main House will not be disturbed because it is of major architectural importance.  The fact that it will not be disturbed is beneficial to everybody and we will all agree that it is a very good thing.  The fireplaces and ceilings in that room are of major importance architecturally and historically. I am delighted that there will be no great disruption of them.</P>
    <P>If we could have agreement on ten minutes for the proposer of Item No. 2 and seven minutes for everybody else, I do not think we should have any great problems on the Order of Business today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report on the work that is proceeding next door.  I hope that what I have to say now will not raise the temperature any further.  When we reached agreement on these motions and were allowed to have a one and a half hour debate at alternate periods so as to register our concern at some of the actions of the Government there was no suggestion that our time would be restricted further.  I did not ask the Fine Gael party to put down an amendment.  The Leader of this House is now looking for a reduction in our time so that Fine Gael can propose their amendment.  I agree and recognise that the Government side of the House are entitled to a ministerial response to a Private Members' Time motion from any group but, because of the fact that Fine Gael now want to amend our motion, we are supposed to forfeit some of the very limited time which has been allowed to us by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges where we discussed this at length and reached agreement on the procedure that was to be followed.  This is the first I have heard of a possible change.  It is rather <Col N="488" /> unfair that we have not been communicated with on this decision by different groups.  The Labour Party have not been consulted about anything.  We have not been consulted about sitting times, motions or anything else in this House since our members were reduced to three.  There will be other days.  It is unfair to reduce further the limited time that it has been agreed to give us.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear the good news about the progress in the reconstruction work next door.  I am sure we are all amused by the inference that the best way to deal with our present discomfort is that most of us should absent ourselves from debates.  Despite your prosaic rendering of the events, a Chathaoirleach, I was struck by the rich imagery.  It seemed to me you were talking not simply about the Seanad Chamber but about the state of the nation.  The walls will not fall down.  We will have a roof still over our heads.  It seems to me that these phrases are resonant with historical&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business, Senator Mooney and myself, in a rare moment of harmony, agreed before the Easter recess that the time was not suitable for discussing what is now Item No. 8 on the Order Paper: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann takes note of recent events affecting Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish releations&rdquo;, a motion and a phrasing that I understand, are agreed by all the parties and all the Members of the House.  I would suggest that his concern and mine have been somewhat alleviated by the passage of time, that the heated atmosphere then prevailing has now cooled and <Col N="489" /> that there should be no further reason for any delay in disucssing this motion.  In fact, sober and serious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am explaining, with respect to you and the Members, why it is appropriate that we should consider this motion at this time.  I suggest that it is appropriate that we should consider the motion now because the debate is already beginning, a serious and sober debate.  We should make our contribution to this debate.  There are two further reasons why we should now discuss Item No. 8.  One is the welcome intervention by the Foreign Secretary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, we are very pleased with the good news about the state of the Chamber next door and we hope that pressure will be exerted to ensure that we will be back there as soon as possible.  I have to take issue with Senator Ferris' remarks about the rights of smaller groups in this House. <Col N="490" /> It is a matter of record that the Leader of the House and his party have done everything possible to ensure that there is the fairest possible distribution of time. It is entirely appropriate that if there is a motion on the Order Paper with which we disagree we are entitled to seek to amend that motion to express what we feel is the true and accurate state of things.  I make no apology whatever for putting down that amendment.  It is entirely within proper parliamentary procedures. However, I feel that this matter can be resolved without the type of sour remarks made by Senator Ferris.  It is a matter which the Whips could talk about immediately after the Order of Business. I am quite sure that an arrangement can be found which will suit all parties and ensure that there is a fair hearing for all on this important issue.</P>
      <P>On other matters on the Order of Business, I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he could indicate to us what the programme of legislation will be for this session.  For example, there are the hardy annuals of the Order Paper, the Insurance Bill and the Companies (No. 2) Bill.  When can we expect to see the Committee Stage of these resumed? Can he indicate to the House what further legislation will be coming through this session?  It is very important that the Opposition should have an opportunity to know in advance what new Bills, if any, we may expect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also on the Order of Business, I would like to join with Senator Murphy in calling now for a debate which has been long promised on Item No. 8 on the Order Paper.  I do not need to rehearse the reasons why this is now an important issue and this is the appropriate time to discuss it.  I put my full support and that of my party behind Senator Murphy's call for a discussion on Item No. 8.  Finally, I would like to give notice that I intend tomorrow to raise the question of the extremely disturbing report in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that the Spanish Government may be about to dump large quantities of toxic waste 300 miles off the south-west coast of Ireland, in the Gulf Stream and in the prevailing winds.  I <Col N="491" /> want to give notice that I should like to raise that question tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the proposal made by Senator Murphy.  I should also like to say that I deplore the tone of the latter half of his proposal. Surely we have reached a point now where we must try to engage the different strands of thought and perception in Ireland, try to work through the conflict of interests, the conflict of prejudice, so that we can come up with something constructive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise an issue with the leader of the House on Items Nos. 6 and 7 on the Order paper, the Insurance Bill and the Companies (No. 2) Bill.  I am amazed that no explanation was given to us in the House about what was said in the Lower House recently when the question was asked as to what was causing the delay on the Companies (No. 2) Bill and the Insurance Bill and the Taoiseach announced that they were being delayed in the Seanad.  I have checked back on the record and on ten occasions within the past six months I asked the Leader of the House to order both these Bills and on ten occasions I got various different answers, mainly relating to the fact that they were not ready to be taken by the Departments in charge of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion that exchange, which was reported in the media, was damaging to the reputation of the House.  It has certainly added to and reinforced public opinion of what this House does and does not do, that it is a lazy, indolent House. We are entitled to an explanation.  I believe I have been misled in some sense by somebody over the past six months on these issues or else the Taoiseach has been misled.  Either way this House is entitled to an explanation.  This House <Col N="492" /> has the right to demand that its reputation is left unsoiled by exchanges or events over which it has no control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I now wish to state that I intend in future on the Order of Business, every single day, to propose an amendment that the Companies (No. 2) Bill and the Insurance Bill be taken unless we get a reasonable and public explanation as to why they are not being taken.</P>
      <P>The second item I want to raise is that I now want, on a weekly basis from the Leader of the House, a full progress report on how Seanad Bills which are at the moment in the Dáil are being dealt with.  I want to know the reason for the delay on some of them which have been with them for quite some time, why they are not being dealt with in the other House and why they have not come back to us.  It is time we started asserting ourselves and I look to the Leader of the House to represent us adequately in this matter, to give us proper explanations and to make it clear that we are not prepared to be made the patsys or the whipping boys for Departments which are not doing their work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Labour Party motion, let us not cod ourselves. The Labour Party are not going to be called to a Whips meeting.  We do not constitute a Whip.  If there is any problem about time, the matter has to be resolved here on the Order of Business.  If there is a difficulty I want to state on behalf of the Labour Party that, as far as I am concerned, the debate can continue next week.  I do not mean that it should not take place today but it can be extended beyond this week.  We are not bound to finalise it today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh, on the industry which you have shown in regard to the Seanad Chamber and the ceiling and the very obvious amount of work you have put into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> I would like to support what Senator Murphy said about a debate on Anglo-Irish affairs &mdash; Item No. 8 on the Order Paper.  It seems to me, with the best will in the world, that we have put this off for long enough.  I remind the Leader of the House that this was put off by agreement before and it was put off before that, but only on the understanding that an all-party, non-contentious motion should be taken as soon as possible.  That time has come at this stage and I do not see any reason why it should be put off any further.</P>
    <P>In the tradition that we are now establishing and the custom of taking all-party motions, and on a subject which I know is close to the heart of the Leader of the House and many others, I wonder whether he would give the House time for a debate on the situation in the Middle East.  We have a motion on the Order Paper, No. 44 in the name of Senator Norris, but it does not cover the global situation in the Middle East.  Were we to have that I think we would get an opportunity to condemn in the strongest terms the fact that three members of the Oireachtas are at present in the Middle East, courtesy of a guerilla terrorist organisation, the Palestine Liberation Organisation, and they are being wined and dined by a guerilla group out there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross, we have to get agreement to take No. 44 first of all and then you can make your speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think you want to take No. 44 a Chathaoirligh.  What I want is a debate on the Middle East situation. The point I was making is that these three individuals, while they are condemning violence in the Republic, are out there, courtesy of the hospitality of the PLO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not finished yet.  I will finish very shortly.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House, in view of his interest in the Middle East, whether he <Col N="494" /> thinks those people should be there, whether they represent us and whether they are doing this country any good in the eyes of the world by being feted by a guerilla organisation, an organisation which invented hijacking and which is now posing as a mediator in situations like that.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to say that what Senator O'Toole said about the Companies (No. 2) Bill is absolutely correct. We got, I think, another guarantee at the end of last session from Senator Ryan that the Companies (No. 2) Bill would come up on the second day of the second week in this session.  I hope that finally we will not only keep to that promise but that the Companies (No. 2) Bill will get an early passage through the Seanad and will not just come up for one day and then go back again after a couple of amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I would like to join the other Senators in welcoming the information you have given us with regard to the repairs to the Seanad Chamber.  I wonder if you could add to this by giving some information with regard to when the Chamber will be ready for us to reoccupy.  I would like to express a little concern about the level of literacy involved in the preparation of the Order of Business.  I am, I suppose, to a certain extent a professional grammarian and it causes me very considerable distress to note two spelling errors on the first page of the Order of Business &ldquo;gereatric&rdquo; and &ldquo;idicate&rdquo;.  I would like to &ldquo;idicate&rdquo; my concern in this matter, even though I recognise that we are dealing merely with the second official language of the State.</P>
      <P>I support the other Senators with regard to the holding of a debate on Item No. 8 but from a different point of view. I will confine my remarks to saying that I would welcome the opportunity to congratulate the Taoiseach on the statesmanlike way in which he has avoided the temptation to return the impertinent and offensive remarks of Mrs. Margaret Thatcher in kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also welcome a debate on the question of the Middle East and I would point out respectfully that Item No. 44 in my name and I am glad to say a number of other Senators' names would not be relevant because it deals, in fact, with the specific position of Soviet Jews.  However, I think it would be important to have a debate on the Middle East.  Although I suppose I am sometimes regarded as partisan in this matter, I hope I am not.  I would merely say with regard to the issue of Senators travelling to the Middle East that, if they are representing this House, I sincerely hope they make a genuine effort to see both sides and not to be partisan.</P>

Could the Leader of the House give us an indication of when the Government will be introducing the legislation they are purporting to be preparing in Strasbourg?</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that there is an inaccuracy in the motion. I am referring to the footnote at the end of the motion which reads:</P>
      <P>and further opposes the decision of the Minister for Health to close St. Mary's Geriatric Hospital, Drogheda.</P>
      <P>That is my home town and I would like to point out that the Minister has taken no such decision.</P>

A small number of patients are being transferred from the old fever hospital, which is attached to St. Mary's, and the Minister has given an assurance that no hospital in Drogheda will be closed unless there is alternative suitable accommodation in the town.  This motion, as written, is inaccurate.</P>

      <P>Taking up the point made by Senator Mulroy, I would like you to make a ruling on Item No. 2 as it is inaccurate.  The previous Government and the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, deliberately kept Beaumont Hospital closed for a number of years.  There is no reference to that in this motion.  In fact, this Government opened Beaumont Hospital.  Is the motion relevant at all in that there is no reference to Beaumont which was opened by this Government <Col N="497" /> but deliberately kept closed by the previous Government?</P>

Is that the urgency of the health service and is the Seanad serious in debating the financing of the health service in a motion selected by three members of the Labour Party?  Is that an ordered motion and is it any serious attempt to make a contribution to a difficult matter?  I do not believe it is.  It is sensationalising specific areas.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question.  It has already been agreed by the House and by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that we are entitled to a one and a half hour debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an agreement at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that the Labour Party should be allowed an hour and a half.  As a result of that agreement I thought we would take a Labour Party motion but, unfortunately, there is an amendment down by Fine Gael.  I suggested that to give everybody a reasonable chance to discuss this we should confine the proposer to ten minutes and that everybody else should speak for seven minutes, but there does not seem to be agreement on that.  The Minister will have the opportunity to come into the House and he can speak <Col N="499" /> for as long as he likes in reply to the motion.  That would not be in the interests of democracy.  I would like the House to agree to ten minutes for the proposer and seven minutes for each speaker afterwards. It has been suggested that we should increase the length of time and there have been various other suggestions. I am not going to increase the amount of time.  As a majority party, we were exceedingly interested in allowing minority groups in the Seanad to express themselves.  We gave the Labour Party the opportunity and the opportunity that has been given to them has been taken away from them by the amendment put down by Fine Gael and, as a result, we must have some balance in the debate. The only way to do that is to have a ten minute and a seven minute time limit to speeches.  I am prepared to have a vote on that unless there is agreement on it now.</P>
      <P>There is no difficulty about having a debate on the Middle East but this House should not be abused by any Senator in terms of any visit that is being paid by parliamentarians to any part of the world. The PLO were mentioned here as being a terrorist organisation.

      <P>Senator Ross &mdash; there is a major difference.  If we can get back to the Order of Business, the Order of Business for the day will be Items Nos. 1 <Col N="500" /> and 2.  The Insurance Bill and the Companies (No. 2) Bill are two items that have been matters of controversy.  The Taoiseach was right when he stated that the Bills were being held up in this House. The Bills were introduced in this House and they have not left this House.  He did not make any other comment except that. There is a guarantee that today and tomorrow the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, which many people have been looking for, will be pursued.  I am not suggesting how far it will be pursued but today and tomorrow that Bill will be pursued.  If the Adoption (No. 2) Bill has gone through, the Companies (No. 2) Bill will be taken next week and I will not give any guarantee as to when the Companies (No. 2) Bill will go out of this House.  The Companies (No 2.) Bill will not be &ldquo;mickey-moused&rdquo; out of this House.  It will be given adequate debate here and it will go out of this House to the other House as a Bill that can stand up.</P>
      <P>The Insurance Bill will come in as the next priority Bill once the Companies (No. 2) Bill has been pursued.  I will not give a time scale because there is no point in giving a time scale to Bills which are of such importance.  All I can guarantee is that next week the Companies (No. 2) Bill will come back in here and if it is pursued to the extent that it can be pursued the Insurance Bill will come in the week after.  The House will have plenty of business within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning said that the Whips would meet on some matter he referred to.  I would like to have the Cathaoirleach's ruling on a factual inaccuracy in the motion.

He also said there can be a Whips' meeting on this issue.  I believe the Leader of the House could greatly help the atmosphere which is getting off to an unfortunate start today.  He could help us greatly by agreeing to extend even by half an hour the time available for Item No. 2.  I am quite sure the entire House would agree with this.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Leader of the House &mdash; I deliberately did not interrupt him &mdash; in relation to a very serious accusation which he made, perhaps inadvertently, with regard to Seantor Norris's work.  Academic standards are precious and I am quite certain it could be deeply hurtful to be accused of faulty examination papers leading to failure particularly if, inadvertently, this was implied in relation to Senator Norris's department when, in fact, it appears as though it did not have any attachment to that Department.  I hope the House will acknowledge that Senator Norris should have that correction read into the record. As a former academic I would find it quite offensive to have it suggested that students of mine had failed their exams because of inaccuracies in the way in which I had set the examination papers.</P>

It seems <Col N="502" /> to me that on the Order of Business, whether we are away two weeks or four weeks, if we want to discuss anything that is remotely relevant to the Order of Business, even if we take some little time to say it, we should not be reproved, a Chathaoirligh with great respect, in the school-marmish fashion in which you have attempted to keep us in order, as if we were some kind of a prissy public debating society.

If this had been discussed with us beforehand I am sure that, as always, we would have reached agreement.  This was thrown at us moments before the Order of Business was announced and I will not have it changed just like that because it suits <Col N="503" /> somebody else.  If we want to get agreement let us have it in the discussion, but we are not invited to any discussion.  I got this agreement about Private Members' Business from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It was agreed by all sides that they would condescendingly allow us an hour and a half.  When the boot was on the other foot every group in this House, including the two members of the Government, had time for Private Members' Business.  All groups should have time for Private Members' Business and I accepted, because we were a small group, that we would have a lesser amount of time available, that it would be on one day at a specified time.  Now Senators want to reduce that specified time.  On principle I do not want to be obstructionist.  I am against the change because we were not consulted and there was not agreement on it.</P>

When the Leader of the House was replying he said he was putting it to the House, but what he was doing in essence was asking the House to agree to take Items Nos. 1 and 2 and included in that decision would be a time limit on the speakers for our motion.

The knocking of the Labour Party's time has been brought about by the fact that there is an <Col N="504" /> amendment in the name of Fine Gael. There is to be an hour and a half of debate on this motion.  The proposer of the motion has 20 minutes to propose the motion &mdash; that is the normal three hour motion.  If we allow that 20 minutes, the proposer of the amendment has 20 minutes equally and that means the Labour Party lose in terms of their time. What I am trying to do is to give the Labour Party the maximum time that can be arrived at.  I will not be brought into any further argument.  It is not the Government party who are eating into the time.  It is the fact that there is an amendment by Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>

It was used in earlier drafts of this Bill and this definition was carried over in error.  That is the reason we wish to delete the definition of guardian in section 1 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 1, as amended, agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> In page 3, before section 2, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>2.&mdash;In any proceedings before any Court in relation to the adoption of a child the Court shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like to say how pleased I am that we have now come to deal with the Committee Stage of this Bill and to welcome the Minister into the House.  It is very important that we should take this Stage carefully and with a great degree of care because, although we have something like 19 amendments, it is a technical Bill.  It is complex and it is in the best interests of all concerned that we should approach it with reasonable slowness and care.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland are very late in the day in taking this legislation which will enable the adoption of some legitimate children who are in care.  It has to be our fundamental and overall concern that children who are subject to this legislation will be the ones who will be of paramount importance.  I put down this amendment because I believe it is an important aspiration to incorporate in the legislation that, in any proceedings before any court in relation to the adoption of a child, the court shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>On issues such as this people can be swayed by emotional arguments in favour of the natural parents of the child or the adopters in the adoption case, and it is my belief as, indeed, has been my purpose in all other legislation related to children &mdash; and one about which I took special care when I was in a position to draft the Status of Children Bill &mdash; that this must at all times be of paramount and absolute importance.  That is why I ask the Minister to incorporate this in the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I am confident that the Minister agrees that fundamental to all legislation involving adoption is the fact that the welfare of the child is of paramount consideration. We would like to see this incorporated in the wording of the Bill so <Col N="507" /> that there would be no question of any doubt or equivocation about it.  The whole area of adoption is fraught with emotion.  I speak with some knowledge of this over a great number of years, having had contact with young women who on occasion have placed their children for adoption.  I know something of the very real pain attached to that decision making.  I know of the complexity of the whole area and the grave difficulty involved in coming to such decisions.  I also had contact with people who have adopted children and I have met people who have taken children in and had them removed before the final adoption order was signed.  It is true to say that there are conflicting demands, conflicting senses of priorities and very strong feelings about rights in this area. It is necessary and important to write into this long awaited Bill the amendment that Senator Fennell proposes because it is germane and fundamental to the whole area of adoption.</P>
      <P>While on my feet, I should like to say how very pleased and relieved I am to see this Bill back in the Seanad today.  It is complex and it is important that we get it absolutely right.  I was always conscious of the fact that, out there, there were a number of children awaiting adoption, a number of people willing, ready and longing to give those children a home and that any delay on our part was only delaying the day when those children would receive the home they so richly deserve.  I ask the Minister to consider very seriously the points we have made in relation to inserting this sentence in the Bill which in my view underpins the whole philosophy of adoption.</P>

      <P>I agree fully with Senator Fennell and Senator Bulbulia that the welfare of the child should be the first and paramount consideration in cases of this nature.  However, I do not propose to accept the amendment because I do not think it is necessary in this case.  The Adoption Act of 1974 already contains the following provision at section 2 and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> In any matter, application or proceeding before the Board or any court relating to the arrangements for or the making of an adoption order, the Board or the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (3) of the present Bill provides that the Adoption Acts 1952 to 1976 and this Act shall be construed together as one.  Thus it will be seen, that the provisions of Section 2 of the 1974 Act will automatically apply to adoption applications made under the Bill.  Therefore, I believe that this amendment is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's commitment and concern.  I accept that this question is covered in the Principal Act, but I have to say that this Bill, when enacted, to some extent will stand on its own.  I feel quite strongly that this expression should be contained in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I note that he is committed to this thinking in relation to adaption legislation and that it is enshrined in the Adoption Act, 1974.  I suppose there is a case to be made for consolidation of legislation which, of course, would take care of the whole matter.  In the absence of the necessary consolidation &mdash; and given that this Bill covers the welfare of a specific group of children and will, on occasion, be referred to as a single Act it is not superfluous and is not asking too much to seek to have that provision relating to the paramount consideration of the welfare of children enshrined in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I fully accept that the welfare of the child should be first and paramount.  It is stated quite explicitly in the new Bill in section 8 (3) that the Adoption Acts 1952 to 1976 and this one, when enacted, shall be construed together as one.  I am quite satisfied that the people who will be administering the provisions will have regard to the 1974 <Col N="509" /> Act.  I do not think there is any danger that any alternative would apply.  In relation to Senator Fennell's amendment I might add that her amendment merely obliges the court to consider the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration whereas the provisions of the 1974 Adoption Act oblige the court <Col N="510" /> and the board to consider the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>In page 3, lines 3 to 15, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an application is made by any persons (referred to subsequently in this subsection as &lsquo;the applicants&rsquo;) to the Board for an adoption order,</P>

    <P>(c)  the Board (having heard the health board in whose functional area the applicants ordinarily reside, any persons specified in paragraphs (a) to (h) of section 16 (1) (as adapted by this Act) of the Principal Act who wish to be heard and any other person whom the Board, in its descretion, decides to hear) is satisfied that, if an order under section 3 (1) in relation to the child to whom the application for the adoption order relates were made in favour of the applicants, it would be proper, having regard to the Acts and this Act, to make the adoption order, <Col N="511" /> the Board shall adjourn the application and declare that, if the order is made under section 3 (1), it will, subject to subsection (2), make the adoption order.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical amendment recommended by the parliamentary draftsman.  Section 2 (1) provides that where the Adoption Board have examined an application for adoption under this Bill and are satisfied that they would be prepared to make an adoption order if the High Court were to authorise them to do so, the board must adjourn the application pending the outcome of the High Court hearing.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear that only adoption applications made under this Bill will have to be adjourned by the Adoption Board pending a hearing in the High Court.  I am advised that there was a possibility that the Bill, as drafted, could have been interpreted as requiring the Adoption Board to adjourn all applications for adoption, not just those covered by the provisions of this Bill.  Of course, that is not the intention.  The vast majority of adoption applications will continue to be of a routine nature and will not require referral to the High Court.  The wording of the amendment is substantially the same as that of the original subsection. The only new element is contained in paragraph (b), which reads:</P>
      <P>but for this Act, the Board would not have power to make the order, and</P>
      <P>This makes it clear that the provisions here apply only to adoptions under the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear that the Adoption Board will be empowered to make adoption orders under this Bill in relation to children in respect of whom the board do not have power to make adoption orders under the existing Adoption Acts.  Section 10 of the Principal Act, that is, the Adoption Act of 1952, as amended by the Adoption Act, 1964, provides that the Adoption Board shall not make an adoption order unless a child is illegitimate, an orphan, or has been rendered legitimate by the marriage of his parents but whose birth has not been re-registered.  This amendment will enable the Adoption Board to make adoption orders in respect of children who do not fall into these categories but only where the High Court has made an order under this Bill authorising their adoption.  The restriction to orphans and illegitimate children will continue to apply in the case of ordinary applications under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1976.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;( ) Where an order is made under section 3 (1) and an appeal against the order is not brought, or the order is upheld in the Supreme Court, and <Col N="513" /> where the Board is satisfied that it would not be proper, having regard to the Acts to make an Adoption Order in favour of the persons in whose favour the order is made, the Board with the consent of the Court may, if it sees fit, make an Adoption Order in relation to the child to whom the Order under section 3 (1) relates, in favour of such other persons as the Board, having regard to the Acts, sees fit.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I simply want to formally propose this amendment in the absence of Senator Ryan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment for several reasons.  In the first place, the need for this amendment is questionable.  The type of circumstances it envisages are those in which between the time the High Court authorises the Adoption Board to make an adoption order and the time the board sit to make the order, some problem may arise in relation to the proposed adopters, so serious that the board would find themselves unable to make the order.  This is an extremely remote possibility and one which is unlikely to arise in practice.  I might mention that there is a roughly similar procedure provided for under section 3 of the Adoption Act of 1974. That is the section under which the High Court may dispense with parental consent to adoption and authorise the Adoption Board to make an order.  I am advised that, since this provision was enacted, there has never been a case where the board refused to make an order on foot of a High Court authorisation. However, it could be argued that no matter how remote the possibility, the legislation should be able to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the second point. What we are talking about is a case where a child has lived with a particular couple for at least 12 months, possibly much longer, where there is much love and affection between them and the couple wish to adopt the child.  A serious situation develops: perhaps the couple are involved in a traffic accident and are both <Col N="514" /> killed.  Whatever the reason, the child cannot be adopted by that couple.  The effect of all this on the child would be profoundly unsettling.  It might be some considerable time before he or she could develop emotional ties with a different couple to such an extent that he or she could be successfully adopted.  Against that background, the requirement in the Bill that the child must have lived with the new applicants for at least 12 months seems quite reasonable and prudent in the circumstances.  On the other hand the amendment seems to envisage a short circuit approach which in the long run might not be in the best interests of the child or the adopters.</P>
    <P>Finally, while the Bill would require the new applicants to make a fresh application to the High Court, this should not delay matters unduly as the court will have the benefit of its previous consideration of the position of the child and the natural parents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the Minister. I understand his reasoning in answer to this amendment.  Probably Senator Ryan would feel as do many of us that there has to be a solution, an answer, for all children who might be abandoned, neglected or abused.  The kind of scenario the Minister outlined would be very tragic and sad.  In those circumstances, if there were, say a couple on stand-by who could go through an accelerated procedure of acceptance that might constitute a solution. That may be what is envisaged.  I would agree that great caution and due care should be taken in appointing lifetime parents for a child.  In that context I agree that the amendment would not be appropriate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 19, to delete &ldquo;without interruption&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to delete the words &ldquo;without interruption&rdquo; in order to make this section less subjective and restrictive but clearer.  It is very doubtful whether we can say that in the case of failure by the parents such failure will continue &ldquo;without interruption&rdquo; until the child attains the age of 18 years.  That term is somewhat illogical and not really very sensible and makes any decision difficult. I have had a submission from the Adoptive Parents' Association of Ireland which the Minister may have had also. They take up this point, saying that while the court must be satisfied that all eight points apply in each and every case before it will make an order, these conditions are so tight that only children whose parents have abandoned them and disappeared themselves are likely to benefit.  That is a point worth noting.</P>
      <P>The only circumstances in which one could assume there would have been no interruption in caring for or interest in the children would arise if, say, the parents had abandoned them first and then disappeared from the country themselves. In section 3 (I) (B) the words &ldquo;without interruption&rdquo; are subjective and restrictive.  The omission of the words &ldquo;without interruption&rdquo; from the section would enlarge its scope and the court would have to be satisfied only that the failure was likely to continue until the child reached 18 years.  That is a very reasonable suggestion.  I suggest that those two words be omitted to streamline the provisions without being detrimental in any way to the objective of the section. I should like to hear the Minister's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated on <Col N="516" /> Second Stage, section 3 has been carefully drafted in close accord with the constitutional provisions relating to the rights of the family, of the child and in the light of various interpretations of those provisions handed down by the courts over the years.  A judgment of the Supreme Court in a case known as <i>in re Doyle and Infant</i> is directly relevant to the points raised by Senator Fennell.  In that judgment the Supreme Court decided that the right of the State to withhold a child from its parents lasts only for as long as the parents continue to fail in their duty toward the child and that the State's right ceases as soon as this can no longer be shown.  Although the judgment was delivered a number of years ago, the Supreme Court has never since changed or revised its interpretation. There is no reason to believe that it is likely to do so now.</P>
      <P>In the present context this means that, before a child can be adopted under this Bill, it is necessary for the court to be satisfied not alone that the parents have failed in their duty towards the child but also that it is likely that the failure will continue without interruption for the duration of the childhood.  If, on the other hand, the court believes that there is a likelihood that the failure of the parents will cease and that they will be in a position to resume their parental duties the adoption cannot proceed.  While at first sight this may appear unfair to the persons who wish to adopt the child, it is an important safeguard for the natural parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many parents fall down on their duty towards their children at some stage in their lives.  In most cases they quickly resume their duties towards their children and no lasting harm ensues.  In a smaller number of cases the failure may be more serious and the parents may be unable to care for their children for some considerable time due, for example, to alcoholism, drug addiction, depression, or many other reasons.  It would be an absolute tragedy if all of these parents were to run the risk of having their children taken away from them and adopted. <Col N="517" /> That is not what was intended or envisaged when this Bill was being prepared and it is something I could not support.</P>
    <P>The question of adopting children whose parents have failed should only, and under our Constitution can only, arise when there is no reasonable prospect of the parents resuming their duties. In order to ensure this, it is essential that the phrase &ldquo;without interruption&rdquo; remains part of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I should like to put on the record that I, like I am sure that everybody here, absolutely uphold the right of parents who, for whatever reason, are going through difficulties, whether financial or emotional, physical illness or mental illness, regardless of their social condition, to keep their children and rear them and that neither the State nor anybody else should intervene and take their children away from them. That is a fundamental concept we all accept because all of us have had experience or seen the dire conditions some families live in.  Some families can be most unfortunate and, despite their best efforts, they run into difficult times and by virtue of this children can be physically neglected.  In truth we have to say that social workers, doctors and people who deal with these problem families will inevitably give the benefit of the doubt to the parents and will not come in in an arbitrary way and attempt to remove the children from the family.  That is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are talking about here are children who are abandoned and the 1,600 children who are long term in institutions. It has to be said that some cruel parents would leave them in institutions. They know they are there and will be a guarantee for their old age when they go out to work or whatever.  That kind of thinking exists and I would be concerned that, in the event that these children were going for adoption and going through the procedure of being fostered by a family for the 12 months, this would alert the parents.  Even as I say this I am aware <Col N="518" /> that it might be a red light to them and they might say: &ldquo;If we do not look after our children now and appear to be living up to our duty, we will lose them.&rdquo;  It would be a good thing if they came to their senses and realised that they might lose their children.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with this section because I believe the words &ldquo;without interruption&rdquo; in paragraph (B) would inhibit many adoptions.  They could be very destructive in the context of people's genuine and sincere attempts to adopt children.  I believe this Bill, on completion of its passage through the two Houses of the Oireachtas, is due to be tested.  We all hope that will happen because, as most speakers said on Second Stage, it is essential.  Perhaps this phrase could be taken out so that the section could be streamlined and not be so restrictive.  It could then be fully tested in all its form as a completed piece of legislation and this issue could be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court's decision was given some time ago and thinking and attitudes have certainly changed since then.  I support the idea that parents should realise their duties and responsibilities to their children and should not be interfered with for any frivolous reason. This section could make it extremely difficult for them to do so and I wonder if it would reduce even further the number of children who would be eligible for adoption.  Because it is going to be tested perhaps that should be left to the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be happy if this phrase was removed because either or both parents, through no fault of their own, may be incapacitated, ill, or depressed. It may take months for a mother to recover from her depression and realise the importance of the bond between herself and her child.  In those circumstances I would not like to see this removed because it could lessen her chances to retain her child due to an illness over which she had no control.  I recognise &mdash; and perhaps Senator Fennell intended to mention this &mdash; that a parent <Col N="519" /> may keep in touch with the child by way of a birthday card or at Christmas time. That does arise and perhaps Senator Fennell had it in mind.  My colleague, Senator Wallace, mentioned it to me.  I believe that would be taken into consideration by the court, but I do not think it would not have a great bearing on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that raises the question of what is an &ldquo;interruption&rdquo;. What are we talking about in terms of an interruption?  Perhaps we should have a definition of what that constitutes.  Some people might say that a birthday card is an interruption.  Are we talking a birthday card or a week-ends parenting or a day's parenting once in four or five years?</P>

      <P>Paragraph (B) states:</P>
      <P>it is likely that such failure will continue without interruption until the child attains the age of 18 years,</P>
      <P>Obviously the court would have regard to all the circumstances in interpreting that section.  I sympathise with the point made by Senator Fennell but I believe it is important, both in terms of the constitutional rights and, indeed, as a safeguard for the natural parents of the child, that we should leave the words &ldquo;without interruption&rdquo; in the section.  It is interesting that in the Bill which was presented to the Dáil in 1986 by the previous Government the words &ldquo;without interruption&rdquo; appeared in a similar section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard both Senator Fennell and the Minister on this point, perhaps the Minister could assist the House by giving some indication of how an assessment might be made in a satisfactory manner that parents would be likely to continue without interruption to fail to be exercising their parental responsibility.  Under paragraph (I) (A) it is a matter of fact that can be established that, for a continuous period of not less than 12 months immediately preceding the time, the parents of the child had failed in their duty towards the child. <Col N="520" /> Perhaps the Minister can assist us by telling us how there could be a prediction over a period of perhaps 16 or 17 years, depending on whether the child is a year old or slightly older at the time the assessment is made, that the parents would fail without interruption or in other words, would not, in any circumstances, assume parental responsibility.  I wonder if this matter has been considered from a practical point of view as to how evidence to that effect might be adduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to understand how a court could make a judgment based on the words &ldquo;without interruption&rdquo; in this part of the Bill.  For example, if the mother of the child is 18 years of age, how could a court come to the conclusion that she should lose her rights in relation to the child just because a judge thinks she will not change over the next 18 years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

      <P>As I said, the court must be satisfied that it is likely that the natural parents will continue to fail in their duty towards the child, without interruption, until he is 18 years of age. The expression &ldquo;without interruption&rdquo; is designed to eliminate cases where there is some prospect of reconciliation between a child and his natural parents. It would be a matter for the court to decide if such a reconciliation is possible and then it would not be proper to proceed with the adoption of the child.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how far we can pursue this point.  The actual wording of the section is &ldquo;and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court&rdquo;.  I agree that the court has to be satisfied but it has to be shown to the satisfaction of the court predicting ahead over a period of what may be 17 or 17½ years.  It would be helpful if the Minister could indicate how this was assessed by his advisers what was envisaged when this wording was included as being the likely manner in which it could be shown &ldquo;to the satisfaction of the court&rdquo;, in other words demonstrated in an evidential way.</P>

      <P>There is no attempt in the Bill to define what is meant by &ldquo;failure&rdquo;. It is a matter for the High Court to decide this issue in each individual case in the context of the wording of the Constitution. As Members of the Seanad are aware, it will be a matter for the Adoption Board in the first instance to agree that an adoption should take place in a particular case and then it will be a matter for the health board to make the application to the court.  Presumably they will present the evidence to the court on the basis of their knowledge and an investigation of the case and the court will then make a decision in each individual case.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he is aware that CARE, the <Col N="522" /> campaign for the care of deprived children, have drawn attention in information leaflets circulated to Members of this House, to their concern about this section.  They actually instance this section as one of the things which gives them cause for concern.  They say that the conditions which have to be met before the child can be considered for adoption are unduly restrictive.  They list three of them, one of them being precisely the section to which Senator Fennell has referred.  In view of the professional expertise of this organisation and their considerable bona fides in this matter, I wonder if the Minister would like to comment further on this.</P>

      <P>With regard to the wording, perhaps we could approach it in a different way.  Perhaps the Minister could identify what would constitute the possible predicted interruption which would be likely to prevent a court from being satisfied.  The health board must show, to the satisfaction of the court, that it is likely that such failure will continue without interruption.  What exactly is &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; in those circumstances. Can the Minister say what the tangible nature of that interruption is so that we will know how it might be possible to predict that there would be no likelihood of that?  Would the prediction of any sort of contact by the parents with the child prevent paragraph (B) from coming into effect?  The court have to be satisfied that the failure will continue, without interruption, until the child attains the age of 18.</P>

      <P>If the natural parents resume their duties, in other words if they start to look after the child again, the court will want to be satisfied that there is no prospect of reconciliation between the parents and the child.  While I accept the expertise of the Adoptive Parents Association and the expertise they have at their disposal, nevertheless it is significant that, on the advice of the Attorney General in the present Government, and presumably on the advice of the Attorney General in the previous Government, which was available to both <Col N="523" /> myself and my predecessor, the same wording appears in both Bills and that it was felt necessary to include the words &ldquo;without interruption&rdquo;.  It appears to me that, even if the words &ldquo;without interruption&rdquo; were taken out, the court would still be obliged to be satisfied that the parents were neglecting their child and would continue to neglect their child until the age of 18 years.</P>

      <P>I accept that but I think it is very different.  If the facts of a case are presented and they are sufficient in a court hearing, a decision must and would surely be able to be made on the basis of <Col N="524" /> those facts, without predicting down the years, as if somebody has that wisdom, that the lack of care or duty will continue for the child's lifetime.  I would be concerned if the Bill was not going to be referred to the courts for a decision before it is totally effective but, in view of the fact that it is going to be tested, perhaps we should take this out and make it more streamlined.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 46, after &ldquo;applicants&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided that no order under section 3 (1) shall be made solely because of the income and/or living circumstances of the parents of the child.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like formally to move amendment No. 7 to section 3, which is on the Order Paper in the name of Senator Brendan Ryan.  I have pleasure in moving this amendment on behalf of Senator <Col N="525" /> Ryan because, as I understand it, it is his intention that the operation of this subsection shall be to ensure that there shall be no discrimination in this legislation on the basis of class, social or economic background, the philosophy of which is already enshrined in our Constitution. I am sure the Minister will have no difficulty in agreeing with it in principle and I look forward to a positive reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. There is always a risk in determining matters like this that people see the suitability or the importance of the child's environment in the context of the physical circumstances in their home, such as having a car, a nice house, good furniture and so on.  It should not make any difference, and should not be considered in this context, that the child comes from a home where the living circumstances are not as satisfactory as, perhaps, a social worker might consider they should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be sympathetic to the thrust of this amendment as moved by Senator Norris on Senator Ryan's behalf but I believe it is not either necessary or appropriate to add the proviso that Senator Ryan seeks to add.  It is clear that the court must have regard for a number of factors.  First, it must have regard for the matters we are considering, that there is a failure on the part of the parents that has endured for a considerable length of time and is predicted to endure until the child is at least 18.  Also in the clause immediately preceding the part where Senator Ryan would like to add the proviso, it is clear that the court must have due regard for the rights, whether under the Constitution or otherwise, of the persons concerned, including the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The court must first of all have regard to the rights of the parties concerned but specifically to the rights of the child.  Then there is a formulation; the court must be satisfied that it would be in the best <Col N="526" /> interests of the child to make the order. The courts have already interpreted that phrase in our adoption law and it clearly has been developed by the courts as being a very child-centred concept.  It certainly would not be a concept that would be capable at this stage of becoming the narrow issue of whether the parents were economically well off.  I do not share the apprehension Senator Ryan may have had on this point.  It is not necessary specifically to include the amendment he proposes because it would not be open to a court, either under the existing approach, or under the specific wording of this section, to have regard to and base a decision solely or even predominantly on the factors in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the amendment put down by Senator Ryan and moved by Senator Norris and I agree entirely with the interpretation Senator Robinson has put on it.  A child should not be taken from his natural parents and adopted solely because their income or living circumstances are considered inadequate. As the Bill is drafted, however, there can be no question of a child being taken away from his or her parents and adopted simply because of the inadequacy of the parents' income or living conditions.  This would be anathema to the Irish way of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 states the criteria upon which the High Court must consider an application for adoption.  Only where parents have demonstrated total failure to carry out their duties towards their children should adoption be an option.  This section has been drafted by the Attorney General in the light of the provisions in the Constitution.  It safeguards adequately the rights of the natural parents.  I do not consider this amendment is necessary and I do not propose to accept it.  Senator Robinson has outlined the situation exactly and the general thrust of this Bill would be totally opposed to any child being adopted or taken from his or her natural parents because of their economic situation.  This <Col N="527" /> would be totally unacceptable and is well safeguarded in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, after line 49, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() Where the parents of the child consent to an order being made under section 3 (1) and where the Court is satisfied that the parents are properly informed as to the meaning of the consent, and where the Court is further satisfied that such consent is entirely voluntary, the Court may make an order without further enquiry authorising the Board to make an Adoption Order in favour of the applicants.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is another amendment in the name of Senator Ryan which I propose simply to propose formally.  I feel that Senator Ryan would wish the phrase &ldquo;entirely voluntary&rdquo; to be stressed and I so stress it on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I find this a very interesting amendment and I would certainly support it in considerable measure.  As I understand it, Senator Ryan is proposing that where the parents, fully understanding the position &mdash; and he makes that clear in the form of the amendment &mdash; and fully consenting to the position, do consent in effect to abandon their rights as parents, there should be a shortening of the procedure and that the courts in those circumstances need not be satisfied about A, B, C, D and E because, in fact, the situation is different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I feel would be a necessary further safeguard &mdash; a further safeguard in particular of the position of the child and the rights of the child &mdash; is that perhaps Senator Ryan's amendment might be <Col N="528" /> itself amended by retaining as a clause in it the sentence at the end of the present section 3 (I) so that it would not be necessary for the court to be satisfied with section 3 (1) (I) (a), (b), (c), (d) and (II) (a) and (b) and (III) but that the court, in the circumstances of this new subsection, must still be required, if it so thinks fit and is satisfied having due regard for the rights of the child etc. to act in the best interests of the child.  In other words, it is an interesting proposal for an amendment to have a different approach in what I would imagine, would be very rare circumstances. There would be circumstances where the parents, knowing that they themselves could not provide for the parenting of their child, would consent, having fully understood the position.  It would still be necessary for the court to be satisfied in relation to the rights of everybody concerned, particularly the rights of a child and also in particular, that it was in the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>In the absence of Senator Ryan, this is an amendment which might well be reformulated, perhaps on Report Stage of the Bill.  I would simply ask the Minister if the position has been considered where, in what would be undoubtedly unusual circumstances, for example, one parent had been ascertained to have the AIDS virus and the other parent had very serious problems and it was most unlikely that they would be able in any way to be involved in the parenting of their child and they were anxious to have the adoption process completed at an earlier date. Then it would be appropriate not to require these kind of proofs to the satisfaction of the court as contained in the present subsection which are really appropriate to the case where you do not have consenting parents.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless it would be important and appropriate that the court should remain the body with responsibility for weighing up both the rights of all the parties concerned, notwithstanding that the parents were consenting, and also the best interests of the child.  That would allow for the situation where, for example, even though the parent wanted the order <Col N="529" /> to go ahead in that way and wanted to consent to it in order to accelerate the process, the court might say: &ldquo;No, this is not a case where we are satisfied that it is in the best interests of the child,&rdquo; and that would be the case.  It is appropriate that consideration should be given to the possibility of the devising an approach which would be appropriate in circumstances where the parents, knowing they could not parent the child, were anxious to accelerate the process of adoption. I ask the Minister for a response on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on the amendment.  It is an horrific thought I am sure for those of us who could not envisage a situation where two parents would in a positive way offer their child for adoption because it would suggest to me that there must be great deprivation, probably financial deprivation in that home.  I would not want to think that in this country we could have a situation as bad as that, that in effect people were so poor that they had to give up their children.  The example Senator Robinson gave is an interesting one and one that may come into play.  Having said all that, I recall when I was discussing adoption with one of the child care agencies some time ago the point was made that the Bill which deals with the adoption of legitimate children was going to deal with everything except married parents who feel incapable or unable to rear their child or children and want as it was expressed, in a positive way to give them up for adoption.  The argument at that time was made that, in effect, if the parents were quite certain they could not provide for the child &mdash; we might be thinking about a family where there were eight or nine children and perhaps another arrived and they could not cope with the thought of rearing that child as well &mdash; they would be put in the position of having to appear to abandon, abuse or renege on their duty to this child before he or she would be eligible for adoption or could be fostered. I was sceptical at the time and I felt this was the wrong approach to child care or to parents who were in difficulties.  I <Col N="530" /> would not want to think that things could be so bad for any set of parents that they would effectively volunteer to give up their child for adoption.  I have been assured that there are cases in which it could happen.  There could be a need for it.</P>
      <P>I can sympathise with this amendment. The crucial words in the amendment are: &ldquo;are properly informed.&rdquo;  No matter how parents might feel at a given point about having their child taken and adopted they should be properly informed and realise the total implications and the implications later on when the child will be an adult and will have to be told the circumstances of his or her adoption.  It would be very difficult for the children to cope if they were told that two reasonably healthy parents actually gave them up for adoption.  I have very mixed views about this but I have to say it was something that was put to me by one of the child care agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have reservations about this amendment by virtue of the fact that you might come across parents with subnormal intelligence who might just say: &ldquo;Yes, we consent and are fully informed.&rdquo;  From whom does the court get the information that the person has been properly informed?  Is it from the social worker?  I note from the nods that the courts are informed by the social worker.  I am not happy about that at all because a person of subnormal intelligence may be intimidated by the atmosphere of a court and say yes.  There is a great danger in this to the parent who may not fully realise the consequences and will automatically say yes.  In those circumstances, the consent being entirely voluntary would be in grave doubt.  That would prompt me to have reservations about the amendment.  I would be very slow to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment because I believe the proposals contained in it would be both unconstitutional and undesirable.  Let me explain my thinking on this.  It has long been believed that it would not be constitutionally <Col N="531" /> possible to enact legislation providing for the adoption of legitimate children.  This belief stems from the guarantees to protect the family and to respect the rights of parents contained in Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution. Article 41.1 provides that: &ldquo;The State recognises the Family ... as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights,&rdquo; In Article 42.1 the State&rdquo;... guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide ... for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.&rdquo; While most commentators focus on the constitutional rights of parents, it is important to note that the Constitution speaks of the inalienable right and duty of parents.</P>
      <P>This, as I see it, is the key to this matter. Parents have constitutional duties and one of their prime duties is to care for and protect their children.  If the parents are unable or unfit to care for their children the Constitution in Article 42.5 permits the State to step in &ldquo;to supply the place of the parents.&rdquo;  It is on this provision that the present Bill is founded.</P>
      <P>However, I believe that the Constitution does not allow parents who are fit and able to care for their children to simply walk away from their responsibilities. This is totally unacceptable.  The Constitution describes the duty of parents as being inalienable, meaning that which cannot be given away.  Thus it is not constitutionally possible for parents who are able to care for their children, but who simply do not wish to do so, to surrender their parental duties and place their children for adoption.  By contrast, the rights of an unmarried mother have always been regarded by the courts as alienable; hence the constitutionality of a single mother placing her child for adoption has never been in doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the constitutional difficulties I would argue that it is not in the public interest generally to allow parents voluntarily to place their children for adoption.  Even if there was no reference to the family in the Constitution, most <Col N="532" /> people regard the family founded on marriage as the basic unit of our society.  Any attempt to allow married parents to give their children up for adoption would present a serious undermining of the family and might not at the end of the day be in the best interest of children generally.</P>
    <P>I am aware that adoption with the consent of the parents is permitted in other jurisdictions.  I do not think this, in itself, is a sufficient reason for us to introduce such legislation here.  We have a very strong belief in and commitment to the family and we should not make any apologies for this.  This amendment would only serve to weaken the family. For this reason and because of the constitutional difficulties I mentioned earlier I think this amendment should be rejected.</P>
    <P>Finally, as I have indicated already, it would not be possible, as our Constitution now stands, to provide for adoption with the consent of the parents.  The only way in which such a change could be made would be by amending the Articles in the Constitution which relate to the family.  For my part &mdash; and I speak on behalf of the Government &mdash; I would be totally opposed to such a change.  In the final analysis, such a change would require the support of the people in a referendum.  I do not believe that support would be forthcoming.  I totally reject and oppose this proposed amendment which is totally unacceptable.  I cannot see why any support should be given to this proposal which would, at the end of the day, be a contradiction of the earlier amendment put down by Senator Ryan when he referred to parents who would not be able to support the children and who would be in a situation where it would be easier to take the children from them.  I have no hesitation in opposing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be an impertinence for me in the absence of consultation with my colleague, Senator Ryan, to attempt to interpret what precisely was in his mind.  If I might develop a point here with regard to the rights of <Col N="533" /> the child and the respect for the institution of the family founded upon marriage, and so on, about which the Minister has spoken so passionately, I do not see quite the contradiction he does between this amendment and the earlier amendment because there is a question of will involved.  The earlier amendment dealt with the situation where the parents were willing and felt able to continue a loving and positive relationship with the child, whereas here there is a clear absence of will or desire.  The Minister has referred to the imprescriptible and inalienable rights of the child in this matter.  Unwilling parents may signify their desire to surrender the capacity to care for a child to a loving family situation and it does not seem that the kind of difficulties outlined by the Minister exist at all.</P>
      <P>I say this in particular because I believe that what we as legislators should be concerned about are the rights of the child to be brought up in a positive and loving environment and that cannot be done simply by deciding that we have this abstract concept of the family to which every politician with one or two exceptions feels it necessary to pay at least lip service with the interests of the voters and the plain people of Ireland in mind. I am much more concerned about the reality of the situation and I do not believe that you can force a loving situation where one does not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept a good deal of the constraints which the Minister has identified under the Constitution in relation to the rights of married parents, but there is room to consider very seriously an amendment along the lines of what Senator Ryan has in mind but with the kind of safeguard that I mentioned when I first spoke in support of this amendment.  I support the idea of considering the circumstances where parents could recognise that they cannot bring up their child but want to accelerate the process of having the child adopted and to facilitate it positively because they know they are unable to exercise any <Col N="534" /> parental role and responsibility.  This should not be based on the decision of the parents, partly for the reason the Minister has identified.  It should not be the parents deciding solo and automatically getting an order.  It should be the parents being able to indicate the reasons they believe they cannot exercise their parenting role and for the court to be satisfied, taking into account the rights of all parties including the rights of the child and the best interests of the child, whether it is appropriate to make an order.</P>
      <P>There are circumstances at the moment where married parents consent to the adoption of their child under Irish law.  This is where the child was placed for adoption and the natural mother subsequently married the father of the child. The child is then legitimated by that marriage, but the child remains eligible to be adopted, provided the birth has not been re-registered as being a legitimate birth under the 1964 Act where there is a provision that that child would remain eligible for adoption but the natural father who is now the married father would have to consent.  Both parents could consent under current Irish law to the adoption of their child.  That is provided for because the child had been placed before the natural mother married the father. Therefore the child was eligible to be placed for adoption and it would be considered that that would be an appropriate circumstance.  If the natural father did not consent and could not be deemed to have agreed to place the child for adoption, it is possible that the child would not be adoptable because the father had not, as a married father, consented.</P>
      <P>The Minister was a little bit dogmatic in his first reply.  It is not quite as black and white as the Minister was saying. Under Irish law at the moment in particular circumstances married parents can consent to the adoption of their child without all the safeguards which are in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we are facing a different situation. We are going to broaden the possible circumstances where a child can be eligible <Col N="535" /> to be placed for adoption, and eligible to be adopted, although the child is a child born within marriage of married parents.  I go a very long way on the necessity to be very careful in the approach and I admit and take on board the constitutional difficulty.  However, there is an issue to be addressed which is where the failure is not so much a judgment on the parents by somebody else but is, perhaps, a judgment by the parents of themselves saying: &ldquo;We cannot cope.  We are living apart&rdquo;.  One may be an alcoholic.  These may be very difficult circumstances.  They believe they cannot under any circumstances parent the child.  They have not been doing so. The child is in a home.  They know this, admit it and consent.</P>
    <P>I now come to the point raised by Senator O'Connell querying the nature of that consent.  That is a problem which exists at the moment in adoption law.  It is a problem which exists with natural mothers.  It is a problem which must cause anyone concern.  A number of these natural mothers fit exactly into the category which Senator O'Connell was talking about.  They very often are young, not very experienced, a bit intimidated by social workers, and so on, and yet the courts regularly make an assessment of whether it was a valid agreement place, meaning a valid agreement to place the child for adoption.  Then, even if the natural mother has not signed the final consent form, her consent may be dispensed with if to do so is in the best interest of the child.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution there is a difference between the position of the natural mother who does have a constitutional right to the care and custody of her child but does not have an inalienable and imprescriptible constitutional right. Bearing in mind the Minister's reference to the constitutional position, yet, it is correct that there is both a right and a duty, but I would not go so far as to say that the parents cannot have a self-assessment, not the final word, and this <Col N="536" /> is the point I am making.  I am not supporting Senator Ryan's amendment as it is presently worded.  Senator Ryan's amendment may, perhaps, be putting forward the proposition that parents can self-assess their own failure and consent and he wants the process then to be that the adoption order be made.</P>
    <P>I am saying something different which is that, if the parents self-assess that they cannot cope, that can be a substitute for the health board adducing evidence of the failure over a 12 month period, the predicted failure up to the 18th year of the child and so on, of the capacity of the parents.  It could be, for example, that the form of the approach might be that the parents would self-assess themselves as being unable to cope and, on that basis, the court would assess whether in fact there was a failure on the parents as they have self-assessed and as they wish, therefore, to consent to an adoption order being made in relation to the child.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, while bearing in mind the constitutional framework and the difficulties, to have a look at the issue. Perhaps the circumstances would be relatively unusual, but let us not blind ourselves. We have a high abortion rate in this country.  Abortion is the termination of an unwanted pregnancy and it is high in this country.  We have to admit that. We have unwanted pregnancies and unwanted births in marriages.  We have marriages which break down.  We have enormous social and other problems within marriage and we are providing in this Bill for a situation where there can be an assessment by the health board and by the court of the failure of the parents. We are not providing for any situation where there can be self-assessment by the parents of their lack of basic capacity to parent their child and their desire to substitute better parents and to facilitate that process and allow it to happen.</P>
    <P>That is an important issue which should be considered.  As the Minister said, it is a standard approach in other countries. Married parents can decide that they cannot bring up their own child and that they wish the child to be adopted.  We have constitutional constraints but we <Col N="537" /> have the same human problems between parents and children.  There is nothing about the Irish weather or the Irish sky that makes us unique.  We need to look very carefully at the problem and examine it as a genuine problem and see whether it is, in fact, possible to devise a formula.  It is something we should come back to on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>It is difficult, in the absence of Senator Ryan, to know exactly what he was getting at when he put down the amendment but in the course of the debate I am confident that we have thrown up the various facets.  I must say I found the Minister's reply irritating.  I accept the constitutional restraints which he outlined.  I have no problem about that at all but he just conjured up such a cosy picture of what Irish society is like.  Listening to Senator Robinson &mdash; and indeed it is my experience of life &mdash; I take the view that it is just not so cosy.  There are situations &mdash; they may be very rare but I can envisage this happening &mdash; where people are wrung to the point of making a decision that other people would be better to parent their children.  It is rare and it is exceptional but if it so happens the process should be accelerated.  They should not have to wait while various proofs are brought forward and assessed in their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to what Senator O'Connell said about the possibility of money lurking in the background.  When the Minister spoke I had visions of transistor radios or, in other cultures, certain blandishments which can come into a situation like that. I felt that was the sort of thing he had in mind.  Everybody who has spoken in support of this amendment to some degree or other would not in any way countenance a sort of bartering approach <Col N="538" /> or a &ldquo;child for sale&rdquo; type scenario.  That is anathema to right-thinking people. Nevertheless, it is valid to consider a situation where, for reasons which we could only guess at, parents would consider that adoption for their legitimate child is in the best interest of the child. If that was the case, why should they be subjected to a lengthy procedure and have to have it proved that they are unfit parents?  I would like to see this surfacing again on Report Stage because in much of our legislation we are inclined to hold the view that all is well out there in Irish society and what we like to call traditional values, attitudes, outlooks and various sacred cows are very firmly in place.  That is not necessarily the case in my experience.</P>

      <P>In this Bill we are certainly breaking some new ground in relation to the rights of children and the rights of parents.  The sections of the Bill we are dealing with now are very specific in outlining the procedure that has to be gone through.  That is only right and proper.  For my own part, I am against anything which would speed up this procedure because I could see at some time in the distant future abuses arising from a procedure of the kind proposed in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the rights of a child is the right to belong to his family and the right to be cared for and looked after by his parents.  I certainly do not go along with Senator Norris' assessment that somehow politicians would glibly support the family as the cornerstone of society.  I believe in that and I believe that the vast majority of Irish people believe in it.  I would not say it in this House if I did not feel strongly about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson questioned the constitutionality of the Adoption Act, 1964. I am aware that doubts have been expressed about the adoption of legitimate children.  With respect to the Senator, that is a different question.  If there is a constitutional problem with the 1964 Act, that still does not take away from the objections I have raised to the introduction of adoption with the consent <Col N="539" /> of the parents.  On the contrary if, and I repeat if, the 1964 Act is unconstitutional, the proposed amendment is definitely unconstitutional also.</P>
    <P>With reference to Senator O'Connell's point, if this amendment to the Bill were allowed it could give a case to parents who are going through a difficult period to give up a child for adoption.  There is no doubt about that and I am not unaware that that arises all the time.  I know a family, going back 42 years now, and when the last child arrived it looked practically impossible to cope with that situation. There was an old procedure in the early part of the last century where the relations in America requested one child to be sent over to be reared in a more affluent society.  Many families agreed at that time to give children an opportunity of which they felt they were being deprived here in Ireland but surely the right of a child to be reared with his own family, parents, brothers and sisters, is more important even than that opportunity?</P>
    <P>Parents going through a dark and difficult period in their lives might be tempted to resort to this particular provision if it was included in the legislation and then as time passes the situation may change dramatically for them.  Many young people today who were reared in their own families, even going through that difficult period, of which I am personally aware, would say at the end of the day that it was far better to be in that family circle than to be adopted or given away.</P>
    <P>We have surrogate motherhood and all the problems which arise in that particular area.  Women, for financial gain, have been encouraged to be surrogate mothers and this could happen here as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, and I are opposing the amendment for very sound reasons.  We are not being emotional about this.  I feel very strongly about this section and I know that the majority of the Senators would feel the same if there was any danger that this amendment could be used for <Col N="540" /> monetary gain.  Monetary adoption is illegal.  We are requesting the Seanad not to support this amendment.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, I understand that for the purposes of this Bill we are talking about the family as described in the Constitution, but the Minister did make an off-the-cuff remark in expressing his own personal view that the family was the cornerstone of Irish society.  In what way does he envisage the family when he speaks in that personal vein?  I would be interested to know.</P>

      <P>I find it interesting that the Minister referred to the reference I made to the 1964 Act as though I was challenging the constitutionality of it.  I did not approach it on that basis.  Maybe the Minister was distracted when I was speaking.  All I was doing was pointing out that, under Irish law at the moment, we do have a provision where married parents can consent to the adoption of their child and we are envisaging in this Bill children who are born to married parents being eligible to be placed for adoption and to have adoption orders made if the procedures in this Bill are carried out.  The Bill, as it stands, only envisages a kind of judgment on the parents by a health board initially and then by the court being satisfied about X number of factors and, if you like, assessing the parents as having failed and as being predicted to continue to fail to exercise the parenting capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment in this Bill we do not envisage the possibility of the parents making an initial what I have called self-assessment of the fact that they cannot cope with the parenting responsibility and a judgment on themselves that they have failed and would fail to exercise the parenting role in relation to their child. We have not envisaged the possibility of such parents being able to so indicate <Col N="541" /> by way of consenting to the child being adopted.</P>
    <P>The Minister is obviously not even keen to examine this possibility.  He seems to feel that it threatens the whole life of the family to an extent.  I find some of this very unreal and I always have.  Ten per cent of births in this country now are outside marriage.  The parents and children involved are families, as far as I am concerned, and I do not see the wonderful artificial distinction.  I do not see why we have to deal only with 90 per cent of children and leave out the other 10 per cent and somehow make rigid rules in one direction.  We deal with human beings and many of them suffer because the law is not sensitive to their needs and does not respond adequately.  We are too rigid in some of our structures and this would be an example of that.</P>
    <P>Let me now come to the question raised by Senator O'Connell of the possibility of parents being induced by monetary gain.  There is nothing new in that. That possibility can exist for single mothers.  It is certainly something to be guarded against.  It is, as the Minister said, quite illegal.  It is necessary to be vigilant about it, but why should we suddenly be concerned about married parents when we already have that exact situation whether it is the validity of the consent, the possibility of inducements being offered, whatever the circumstances may be, and we need not get excited about the possible impact of certain issues.  We have those issues already.  We have experience of them and I think we would know that it would be necessary to ensure that that kind of thing did not happen and was not a factor in relation to adoption.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again, lest there be any doubt about it, that I have made it clear that I am not talking about parents carrying out a self-assessment which leads to the conclusion that they cannot cope and would fail to be able to exercise the parenting role and, therefore, there should be an adoption.  I am saying that should be the way they can commence a court process, or a court process can be commenced by adoptive parents with the <Col N="542" /> consent of the natural married parents in order that the court would then assess. The Minister is correct &mdash; I am aware of this and alert to it &mdash; that in a recent case on adoption, a case in which I was involved myself, the Supreme Court, in identifying the rights of children, identified the rights of all children and then went on and said that, in addition, the child of a marriage has the right to grow up and be parented by the parents of that marriage.  That is the constitutional framework in which we operate.  The child has a right to it, but again, only if it is possible that that will be the case.  If there is a failure of the parents, then Article 42.5 can come into play and that failure can be accounted for and other approaches can be adopted.</P>
    <P>What I am not convinced about is the Minister's thesis that failure can only be determined by a judgment of the health board first and then of the court on the basis of a kind of inquiry into the behaviour of parents, not a process where failure can constitute a self-assessment by parents vetted by the court, if you like, assessed then by the court, but assessed because of what the parents bring before the court, if I could put it that way.  I just do not see that there is such a void between one approach and the other.  I come back again to the fact that I think we are unique almost in not having a consenting approach to adoption by married parents.  Perhaps the Minister could tell me if there are any other countries in Western Europe where married parents are prohibited by the Constitution from consenting to the adoption of their children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <P>Would Senator Robinson not think that where a temporary problem might arise for parents they might be tempted to part with their children and the amendment would facilitate this and also prevent it being properly looked at?  Many young couples are in difficulty at the moment.  They would not in their normal senses consent to do this but as a result of the problems and the stresses they are suffering, they might be temporarily imbalanced and they might <Col N="543" /> consent to do it.  This amendment would facilitate this being done very rapidly without an investigation, whereas, if we allow the normal processes of investigation, this could very readily come to light.  This is what we are guarding against.  Of course, adoptions can take place and do take place for monetary consideration but where the financial problems may be of a temporary nature, this would not be in the best interest of the parents or the child.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here a little with the perception and the reality. The perception from the Minister's and the Department's point of view is the perception of the Constitution and the constitutional family and the aspirations the Constitution has for the family and that families in Ireland will all and forever conform to that aspiration.  The reality is something different.  The reality is that in this country we have quite a serious breakdown of the family structure, the separation of couples, the neglect of the children.  In that circumstance, we have to accept that there are family type structures other than the constitutional family to which the Minister referred.  Let me take the case of a couple whose marriage has irretrievably broken down and who cannot get a divorce and terminate the marriage.  They may even go through a religious ceremony on the way, live with a second partner and establish a second family.  I would defy anybody to say that that second family structure for the mother and children, caring and loving each other and not harming anybody, is not as worthy and due for protection in all aspects as the first family we see as the right and proper family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to Senator Robinson as the debate has gone on, I have to say that she has put forward a very good case. I do not think she was suggesting what Senator O'Connell has just said, that there would be a too speedy decision made on the basis of a temporary setback in a family.  As Senator Robinson has put it, if the parents were able to assess themselves and make their own personal <Col N="544" /> expression of what they wanted and it went through a court procedure subsequent to that, that would ensure that there would not be any abuse.  Any mature and developed society has to look at these things.  I do not think we can forever say: &ldquo;No, it is against the Constitution&rdquo;, be very pious about it and say: &ldquo;No, we cannot allow that kind of thing to happen&rdquo;.  If there is neglect and suffering and deprivation and if that situation can be improved, with all the safeguards necessary, we should beckon the way there.  I do not suggest necessarily that here today we should do that but we should say we acknowledge that things are as they are, not as we would like them to be, and that we have to begin talking in terms of our social policy in another direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the hypothetical examples cited by Senator Fennell and also Senator Robinson quite persuasive. Senator Robinson instanced a situation in which one of the parents was found to be HIV positive, there was a poor prognosis and so on.  I know this is something that concerns people, particularly people who have, unfortunately, got an addiction to drugs.  It can, in my opinion, be an act of caring and compassion on the part of a married couple in this kind of circumstances which could not possibly be described as being of a temporary nature to hand their child for adoption and to make provision for him or her.  It must surely relieve the anxiety of such a parent as to the future of the child after their death to be enabled to make this kind of provision as a matter of judgment while they are still alive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I thought was most persuasive in what Senator Robinson said was that it is not just a capricious decision of the parents that we are addressing here at all.  It is part of a process and the process has several elements.  Those elements include not only what has been correctly described as self-assessment but also a second part of the process involving a judicial decision.  The anxieties of the Minister are not fully realistic with regard to the impact this may have on the family <Col N="545" /> structure of this society and I am not convinced by the introduction of hypothetical situations, hypothetical brothers and sisters and so on.  Not all families have to contain large rafts of siblings particularly in these slightly more technologically advanced days, thank God. Perhaps it would be improper for me to comment further upon the operations of the family to which I am not entirely accustomed.</P>

      <P>The courts decided that the family referred to in the Constitution is the family founded on marriage.  The courts decided that, not the Government and not politicians.  If the level of births outside marriage is 10 per cent which has been mentioned here, that interpretation may need to be reviewed.</P>
      <P>In relation to the 1964 Act, I just want to refer back to Senator Robinson's point.  Where a child is born outside marriage, where the parents marry afterwards but the birth is not reregistered though the child is legitimated by virtue of the fact that the mother has married the father, in those circumstances the 1964 Act is operating very satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very progressive Bill.  I do not agree with this idea of self-assessment of one's ability to rear one's children, or be in a position to provide for them.  I do not accept that.  That is one of the reasons why we are not accepting the amendment. The procedures which are included in this Bill have been very carefully prepared and there are quite a lot of streams to go through before an adoption will take place.  To allow the parents to institute this, which has been proposed, I find, and I make no apologies for this, totally unacceptable.  It is also unconstitutional. To make it even possible, you <Col N="546" /> would have to have an amendment to the Constitution and the people would have to decide.</P>
    <P>At some future date, if some of the Members here are in Government, let them proceed and put forward those arrangements.  At the end of the day the people have the final say on the Constitution, and rightly so.  I am delighted they have that power.  They will decide if that ever arises.  At this stage, in this Bill, for constitutional reasons and for other reasons, we are opposed to it and we are not agreeing with the arguments that self-assessment or people's wish for economic reasons or other reasons to have their children adopted should be acceptable. This amendment is not accepted by the Government and we are opposing it.</P>

    <P>having regard to the crisis and chaos in the health services, which is causing widespread and unnecessary suffering to people in need of treatment and hospitalisation and leading to a two-tier health care system, which will result in loss of life, calls on the Government to provide the necessary <Col N="547" /> funds to re-open the following hospitals:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Auxiliary District Hospital, Kilkenny,</P>

    <P>with their full quota of 1,036 working beds in service at the time of closure, and further opposes the decision of the Minister for Health to close St. Mary's Geriatric Hospital, Drogheda.</P>
    <P>It does not give me or the Labour Party any joy to move a motion couched in these terms which deals specifically with all the hospitals which have been closed by the Government to date.  We have listed them and they are included in the motion.  I will not repeat them because they will appear in the Official Report. We lodged this motion because we are acutely concerned about the widespread hardship and unnecessary suffering that have been created for people who are in need of hospitalisation, who are sick, old and unable to provide hospitalisation for themselves.  As result of the closures of all these hospitals which total 1,036 beds, we are satisfied that our concern in this <Col N="548" /> regard is justified.  Under the 1970 Act, as the Minister of State will confirm, most of the decisions to close these hospitals were not taken by the Minister but were as a result of resolutions passed by health boards which were afterwards agreed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>This was particularly true in the five hospitals in the south east region which is my own health board region and deals with St. Vincent's District Hospital, Tipperary, the Auxiliary District Hospital, Kilkenny, Bagenalstown District Hospital, County Carlow, Brownswood Hospital, Enniscorthy and Lismore District Hospital, County Waterford.  Those hospitals were never identified by the Minister as being eligible for closure.  His predecessor, Deputy Desmond, publicly stated that he had no intention of closing sub-acute hospitals in the hospital structure. They were cost effective; they were a necessary part of the structure; they were cheaper to provide the sub-acute care that was needed rather than the acute hospital beds to which people are now forced to go to if a bed is available. In nine cases out of ten acute beds are very scarce.  They are not available on demand as they should be in a society that purports to have an interest in its people.  The cost of these beds usually runs at three or four times the daily cost of a sub-acute bed in the past.  Deputy Desmond, when he was Minister for Health, publicly stated that he had no desire to close district hospitals in the sub-acute structure.</P>
    <P>A document was published on the psychiatric services which dealt with a possible future structure for psychiatric care and stated that it would be advisable and worthy of consideration that people should be looked after as far as possible in the community.  That document was adopted by the then Minister as a working document in principle and was recommended to him by various experts in the field, but the structures in the community were not put in place.  Therefore, there was no question of putting that documentation into action until the community was ready to take psychiatric patients.  My colleague, Senator O'Shea <Col N="549" /> will develop that point further in regard to the implications today.  One of the reasons the health boards made these decisions &mdash; not that they wanted to make them but they were forced to make them &mdash; was the inadequacy of the funding given to them by central Government and approved by the Dáil for the various health boards in the Health Estimate each year.</P>
    <P>That is why it amazes me when I see an amendment from Fine Gael which clouds the whole issue and requests the Government to examine the financing of the health services.  This from a party who voted in the Dáil in favour of the Health Estimate which has created the problem for the health boards that they are unable to provide the same level of health care and bed numbers as they did in the past. I have heard the arguments from the professionals, from doctors in particular, and doctors in the Fianna Fáil party, that <i>vis-à-vis</i> the European standard and the number of beds per head of the population, Ireland has too many hospital beds.  I ask: who sends a patient into a hospital?  It certainly is not a politician &mdash; not a Member of the Dáil or Seanad.  It is not a county councillor.  It is a doctor. If there is a query about beds being occupied by people who do not need hospitalisation, we should ask the medical profession if they are over-recommending people for hospitalisation.  If that is the case, that is a whole new debate.</P>
    <P>What the Labour Party and I are suggesting is that where there is a need, seen and perceived and proven, for hospitalisation which the health boards cannot provide, there is a fault in the system.  People who are sick, who are in need of hospitalisation, are referred to hospitals.  When a sub-acute hospital like a district hospital is closed, the only place left for that type of patient if they need hospitalisation is either an acute hospital bed at four times the cost or a geriatric bed.  That is what happened in the southeast. I was told recently by a medic in charge of the assessment unit of a geriatric hospital: &ldquo;Michael, you will have to wait for somebody to die in this hospital <Col N="550" /> before there is a vacant bed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a pity.  It is a tragedy that you have to wait for an inmate to die before a vacancy is created.  We would all appreciate it if they could be looked after in the community, in the welfare home structure and all these other structures of private nursing homes which are admirable and give an excellent service in the community.  The two-tier health system we are talking about which is being created by the lack of response from the statutory powers is that people who have medical cards are being pressurised into going into private nursing homes and sending for their GP.  They are unable to be supported by beds subvented by the health boards because of the cost factor. They are now paying £20 or £30 a week more than their old age pensions to keep them in some sort of frugal comfort in some institutions where they can have medical care, limited as it may be.</P>
    <P>Our old people do not deserve that kind of treatment.  I am sorry the Government in all their planning and all their fiscal rectitude had no priorities whatsoever when they decided that the Health Estimates would be cut to such an extent that health boards would be forced, and they are being forced, to make decisions they do not like.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we had to go to the High Court about the closure of our district hospital.  We won the case in part, but we had to pay half the costs.  The community had to pay £8,000 to prove that the health board convened a meeting that was not in accordance with standing orders.  They still decided to close our hospital.  The Minister rightly said to me that he did not want to close the hospital but the health board decided, and he accepted.  The same thing is happening now with the two acute hospitals in Cashel and Clonmel.  I have been told by the health board members that they are being forced to amalgamate.  The Minister has stated publicly that he had no intention of closing or amalgamating these two hospitals.  Still the health board are going to close them.  They have no funds.  It is giving the health board an excuse to run down the one that loses the <Col N="551" /> vote.  That is not the way to deal with health care.  That is not the way to deal with the kind of problems we have.</P>
    <P>Of course, we are prepared to sit down and discuss &mdash; we offered to do so in the past &mdash; how this could be done in a structured way, with priorities.  If that were the case, we certainly would not have closed the hospitals first and then talked about a structure and a hospital plan, which the Minister has been accused of not having.  He does not have an overall plan except to give the health boards less money, let them close as many hospitals as possible, and then we will talk about it.</P>
    <P>This afternoon on the Order of Business there was a query about the validity of this motion.  It was queried by Senators who had an interest in one hospital.  I have an interest in all the hospitals.  There was a suggestion that there was something incorrect about this.  The reason I included as an addendum the fact that it was not included in the closed group is that I am aware of the Minister's intention to close St. Mary's Geriatric Hospital in Drogheda.  I give that information on the following basis.  A question was put to the Minister for Health in the other House by Deputy Bell.  He asked him if he proposed to give sanction for the closure of St. Mary's Hospital in Drogheda, County Louth; the outcome of discussions between his officials, the North Eastern Health Board and the Board of Drogheda Cottage Hospital; if there will be a reduction in geriatric beds in Drogheda; and if there will be any job losses.  The Minister for Health gave a written answer on Tuesday, 1 March 1988.  He said:</P>
    <P>My Department, the North-Eastern Health Board and the authorities of Drogheda Cottage Hospital are currently engaged in discussions as to the future role of the Cottage Hospital.  The intention is that Drogheda Cottage Hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;which is a private hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" />&mdash;&mdash;would take on the role of providing long-stay geriatric accommodation for the area which would facilitate the closure of St. Mary's which is the existing long stay hospital in Drogheda.</P>
    <P>That is what the Minister said on 1 March.  That was not enough &mdash; to say in a House of the Oireachtas that by keeping one hospital open it would facilitate the closure of the other.  A meeting was held in the Custom House on 13 April, chaired by the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, at which the following people were present: Mr. Farrell of the health board, Mr. Clarke and Mr. Scully, Dr. Irwin, Dr. Carney, Mr. Orr and Miss Fallon from the Drogheda Cottage Hospital; and from the Department: Mr. O'Dwyer, Mr. Mooney and Mr. Edwards.  These people discussed the closure of St. Mary's.  The first item on this minute, which has been circulated to members of the health board, stated that, &ldquo;it was agreed in principle that Drogheda Cottage Hospital would become the long-stay geriatric unit for Drogheda and that St. Mary's Hospital should be closed&rdquo;. That is why we have included St. Mary's Geriatric Hospital in the motion.</P>
    <P>Two former Ministers, the present Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Health and Deputy Barry Desmond, committed themselves not only to the cottage hospital, to which Deputy Desmond said he would give £1 million towards refurbishing, said they would build a new geriatric hospital in Drogheda.  This was said by two former Ministers for Health about the cottage hospital and the need for a geriatric hospital.  That is why the motion is valid. That is why we want to be specific.  That is why we do not want this motion to be affected by amendments from anybody else.  We want to talk about how we should plan the hospital services and about the acute drop in morale in health board workers.</P>
    <P>That is why we cannot understand why this amendment was put in.  We wanted to argue with the Government that they had agreed to proposals from health <Col N="553" /> boards to close various hospitals throughout the country and had given inadequate funding to allow some of these institutions to remain open, forcing hospital boards to make the same decisions.  We are suggesting that that should not have happened without a proper plan.</P>
    <P>Now that they have been closed, the only way to address this is to commit ourselves as a priority to this area.  We are asking the Government to have priorities in the area of acute beds which are an essential part of our health structure, our health requirements and our health entitlements for people who are paying PRSI and PAYE.  These people are paying for the costs.  This Government brought in further legislation to charge them for their already existing entitlements.  That was not enough.  They reduced the funding to health boards to make it impossible for them to continue in this area of health care.  I request the Fine Gael Party to withdraw the amendment and let us see what the Government have to say about these individual institutions throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. First, I would like to deal again with what has arisen regarding St. Mary's Hospital in Drogheda.  I would like to emphasise the word &ldquo;morale&rdquo;, the morale among staff who operate within the health service. It was only last week, after a sit-in in the matron's office at St. Mary's, that a senior health board official was sent over and read the minute of the meeting, which Senator Ferris alluded to, held under the chairmanship of the Minister for Health in the Custom House on 13 April.  The staff were not consulted at any stage about what was being discussed or what was likely to come.  This was the first indication they got of what was happening.  Now we are facing the situation when the only public hospital in Drogheda is about to be closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ferris referred to the commitment given by Deputy Desmond regarding the provision of an extra £1 million for the reconstruction of the Cottage <Col N="554" /> Hospital in Drogheda and the provision of a new geriatric hospital.  Indeed, the present Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, when he was a member of the health board, was one of those promoting such an undertaking and commitment, which incidentally was given by Deputy Haughey, the present Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The people in Drogheda have been very badly treated.  We in the Labour Party are very concerned that, the trades unions and the staff until they sat in and demanded information, that information did not come, in spite of the fact that a meeting had already taken place at which it was decided to close the hospital.</P>
    <P>In the motion proposed by Senator Ferris we refer to the closure of hospitals. Since Fianna Fáil came to power in March 1987 15 hospitals have been closed and a total of 1,470 beds all over the country have been lost.  In addition, three more hospitals are likely to be closed in the future.  Drogheda, Dublin and Cork are the others.  A grave threat stands over other hospitals all around the country.</P>
    <P>This is only part of the story because no fewer than 3,617 beds have been closed in hospitals in the country.  No branch of the services has been spared: 2,659 acute beds have gone, 3,349 geriatric beds and 609 psychiatric beds have been closed. As well, 2,000 staff have gone from the service.  We cannot over-emphasise this point of morale when we talk about 2,000 people gone, when in the minutes Senator Ferris referred of the meeting in the Custom House it is stated that a voluntary redundancy package will be offered in Drogheda Cottage Hospital and St. Mary's Hospitals.  People in the service are uncertain of their future.  They do not know what is coming.  They are overworked.  The whole system is in chaos and obviously the people working in these conditions cannot function at the level they would like.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to stress is the fact that it costs £36,000 to educate a consultant and £23,000 of that comes from our taxes.  We are heading down the road to a two-tier health system and those who are paying taxes for the education <Col N="555" /> of these consultants are now being denied services because there is absolutely no doubt that there is a very solid pattern abroad in which the numbers of public beds are being diminished.</P>
    <P>I shall refer to the South-Eastern Health Board region which is the region I know best; it is the region where I live.  The South Eastern-Health Board suffered a £6 million cut back in 1987 and there will be a cut back of a further £6.2 million in 1988.  This is where I find a lot of difficulty with the Fine Gael amendment. If you take money out you lose services and staff and it is about time we cut out the codology.  There is no use saying that we can now come up with a plan after the money has been taken out and get our health services back to where they were before the present Government came to power.  The stable door has been left open because Fine Gael did not oppose the Government when the Health Estimates came before the Dáil.  On that basis I say it is hypocritical to come up with something like this now which gives the impression that vastly reduced money can provide the services that are required.</P>
    <P>Looking at the South-Eastern Health Board region and in particular the new regional hospital which is under construction at Ardkeen, I am very concerned about whether this Government are serious about continuing that project. I asked the Minister of State the same question before the recess at Easter and he said it was a matter for another day. Let me give some figures which illustrate why I am concerned.  In 1984 we were informed by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, who gave the go ahead for this hospital, that the hospital would cost £40 million to construct.  It would cost a further £10 million to equip and would cost a further £26 million per year to staff and run.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the South-Eastern Health Board budget as it is.  The budget for general hospitals in the South-Eastern Health Board region in 1987 was £34 million.  That has been reduced to £31.5 <Col N="556" /> million in 1988.  Something like £11 million went to Ardkeen, according to the estimated out-turn from the South-Eastern Health Board in 1987.  Where are the £26 million plus the additions which must be put on for inflation since 1984 to come from?  I am very suspicious that this Government are not serious about completing that project at Ardkeen.</P>
    <P>Local Deputies have been saying: &ldquo;Your health services are being cut back in the Waterford area but in five or six years everything will be grand.&rdquo;  That is a lot of consolation for the people who need health care and in particular the public patients who need health care at the moment.  More worrying and something that concerns many people in the south-eastern region is the fact that the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, stated in the Dáil that the national norm for surgical beds is 0.06 per thousand &mdash; in other words six beds per 10,000 people. Ardkeen, the Waterford Regional Hospital, caters for not alone the Waterford city and Waterford county area but also for south Kilkenny and the New Ross area.  There is a total population of 137,000 people in that catchment area. On the Minister's own figures this would require 82.2 surgical beds.  At present there are 67, and with cutbacks already in hand that is to be reduced to 52 surgical beds, fewer than two-thirds of the norm the Minister spoke of in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>When this Government came to power there were 84 acute surgical beds in the Waterford area.  There are now 67 which is to be reduced to 52 and, on the Minister's own admission, this is reducing things to a very dangerous level.  Either he believes in the figures he presented to the Dáil or he did not.  Certainly he has left the Waterford area in a catastrophic position because only emergency procedures are being carried out.  I do not want to go into specific cases but old people, for instance, who need surgery, though not urgently in the sense of an emergency or of their lives being in danger, but who are suffering greatly, are being told that in 12 or 18 months they may get health care.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in their much spoken of <Col N="557" /> programme for the last general election complained that health cuts were hurting the old, the sick and the handicapped.  I will refer for a moment to the handicapped. I believe that, because psychiatric beds have been reduced, psychiatric patients are being discharged into the community without being ready for it and I ask the Minister to investigate the suicide rate because I have reason to be worried about this problem.</P>

      <P>This motion is the Labour Party's most interesting one as, indeed, is the amendment from Fine Gael.  The difference between the two is that Fine Gael are adopting a very responsible role in this.  To put it in any other way would show a degree of irresponsibility because what they are saying is &ldquo;When we were in Government this is what we planned.&rdquo;  The trouble with the Labour Party is that they try to forget they were in Government and this is the big problem they face.  They cannot get away from it.  They were in Government and they carried out a programme of hospital cutbacks and closures.  They did that and they cannot deny it; they cannot run away from it or suddenly say they are all pure now and want to forget they were in Government.  They were in Government with Fine Gael.  They carried out the policy on cutbacks and they must accept responsibility for it.</P>
      <P>This was on the cards while Deputy Desmond was Minister.  There is no denying this.  To be fair to Fine Gael, they were responsible. They looked at this and they knew they would be seen to be hypocrites if they were to support this motion.  They put down an amendment. They recognised that there was chaos, that perhaps some of the decisions were on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and they looked at it that way.  They are not unaware of the problems facing the country and how they are to be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are spending £1,300 million on our health services, a very large sum by any standard.  Fianna Fáil came into power in March and had to prepare a budget, a far from pleasant one.  They were in a <Col N="558" /> dilemma.  Unless they took effective action the country would be in serious trouble and we would have had the International Monetary Fund moving in to decide our affairs.  When Mr. James Callaghan was Prime Minister in Britain the IMF came in and took over there.  The option open to this Government was whether they should allow the IMF to move in and engage in radical revision of our social services resulting in the abolition of, say, the unmarried mother's allowance, the deserted wife's allowance, disability allowances and so on.  The Government had to weigh all of those issues.  They were faced with an unenviable problem.  They had to effect cutbacks in our services and within a very short time.  I am not saying they were perfect but they had to carry out emergency surgery in our health services.  It did not call for great deliberation.</P>
    <P>You do not sit in an office and work things out while the place is on fire.  You must take emergency action and that is what they did.  They were faced with the prospect of having to take hard, very courageous decisions, with many of which I did not agree.  That does not take from the fact that I had to admire their courage in so doing.  I must pay tribute to the Minister with whom I disagreed. He was very courageous; he stuck to his guns in saying that was what he had to do.  We all know that, on occasion, he was chased from some hospitals.  He was given a very rough time, but he took on the task.  He did it and we are seeing now the results in the public response.  The opinion polls are showing that he did the right thing.  They testify to the fact that what this Government did was met by a positive response on the part of the public.</P>
    <P>We should put matters into perspective. Sitting on the Opposition benches, as I have done for years, it is very easy to attack and criticise.  The bible of a former Minister for Health, Brendan Corish, and his staff of Labour advisers was entitled <i>Health Care Rationing By Coupon</i>.  It was a very interesting booklet. There are many copies in the Labour Party offices.  It was the bible of the <Col N="559" /> Labour Party and of former Minister, Brendan Corish and his advisers, ex-Senator Flor O'Mahony and others, who used it over and over again to illustrate to us why the health services were getting out of control in terms of cost and how we must contain them.  I might quote from it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In that book it is contended that the more you supply the greater will be the demand.  That is the whole tenet of the booklet.  If we provide £2,000 million for health services there will be a demand for £2,100 million.  The demand has continued like that.  More money does not necessarily mean more health.  We should bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>Some of the hospitals listed in this motion are very dear to Senators in the south-eastern region, politically very dear to them.  District hospitals are an anachronism; one wonders should they exist at all.  Let us be honest; if we are talking about a proper health service for our people, do district hospitals constitute the answer?  Can we say honestly in our hearts that district hospitals are the answer?  Take the example of Monkstown Hospital.  It should have been closed many years ago.  I have maintained for years that it should have been closed.  I was amazed it was kept open because it had been serving no purpose.  It may have been serving the purpose of the vested interests running it, with prestige for those in charge, but that is all.  Monkstown Hospital should have been closed years ago.  I advocated many years ago that it should be closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to see St. Laurence's Hospital listed in the motion.  The former Minister, Deputy Desmond, wanted St. Laurence's Hospital closed.  He worked feverishly to have Beaumont Hospital officially opened.  Part of that aim was to close St. Laurence's Hospital.  Do we want to re-open St. Laurence's Hospital. Should we close Beaumont and re-open St. Laurence's Hospital?  Where does <Col N="560" /> Jervis Street Hospital feature in all of this?  There is not a word about Jervis Street.  What are we doing about that?</P>

      <P>In terms of hospitals generally we must streamline our health services if we are to serve our people properly.  Many hospitals are a danger to patients because they do not have adequate services.  I went to Athlone many years ago for the Labour Party to talk to them in terms of providing a proper hospital.  Having a one surgeon hospital was a danger because the man was over-worked and could not provide a proper service.  My instructions were to go and explain that.  We must put the matter in perspective and ask ourselves: are these hospitals serving a purpose?  We would all like to see hospitals in every corner of the country.  When the economic position is favourable, when we have the GNP that will enable us to do so, then I hope we will have more hospitals.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;aware of the chaos in the health services brought about by <i>ad hoc</i> decision making and crisis management with a consequent dislocation of services, loss of bed numbers, drop in the morale of health care workers calls on the Government to examine the financing of the health services and to publish a plan to indicate how, in the light of moneys available it intends to provide an equitable, comprehensive and cost-effective public health service which is a basic right of all citizens and to indicate the specific changes in the system of administration it intends to implement to achieve these purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment I might say <Col N="561" /> that this party are being consistent in their approach to health and other policies. What we recognise we do not have is a consistent policy and programme to effect the cuts or savings we accept are necessary.  I do not need to remind Senators or anybody else of the classic signposts erected by Fianna Fáil prior to the last election.  I am sure people in the Fianna Fáil Party hated those signposts and the message they carried being quoted back at them.  We saw time and again: Health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the lonely.  A number of people who saw those signposts looked at them and said: &ldquo;At least Fianna Fáil care.  They are a caring party.  They are saying they are not going to effect cuts.  They will not hurt the old or the sick.&rdquo;  I am quite sure they had some influence on voting in the last election.</P>
    <P>I would like to say to Senator O'Connell that it is all right if you are young and healthy &mdash; you do not think you will ever be sick &mdash; or if you are sick and rich.  Such people will not be bothered. Probably much debate in which others indulge goes over their heads.  You tend not to consider your needs in the health care area &mdash; a lot of people do not &mdash; until ill health affects you or your family.</P>
    <P>In this House we have an obligation seriously to consider what is happening. With all due respect to Senator O'Connell and his perception of this party the last Coalition Government and so on, we should remember that we are now one year down the road.  In that year we have seen considerable chaos, agitation, distress, a terrible mish-mash of health services. I suggest we are witnessing the total abandonment of a good health service, built up over the years and which served our people well.  We have watched as hospitals were closed in a brutal, thoughtless manner, nursing staffs cut back, out-patients departments restricted all leading to an inability on the part of people who are ill, in stress or worried to get hospital beds.  Hardly a day goes by without a chronicle of despair by someone suffering because of the hamfisted manner in which our health system is being administered.  We read stories in <Col N="562" /> the newspapers.  We heard a story today about the Adelaide Hospital.  We hear reports on radio.  Indeed it must be said that the people we hear of or read of are those who are sufficiently assertive to complain.  They bring their problem or deprivation, or somebody belonging to them, brings them to the attention of a newspaper or radio reporter.  What about all the others who have not got that power, who do not have those contacts? What happens to them?  They are the lonely, unseen, suffering people.</P>
    <P>We are spending £1,300 million on our health services.  The public are not getting good value for money.  They are paying very dearly for those services.  We are seeing the emergence of a two-tier system of health care.  It is beginning to resemble health care as it has obtained for years in the United States.  We have always wondered how social status determines the health care of people in America where the poor can be abandoned to indifferent treatment.  That is what we are moving toward here &mdash; indifferent health treatment and worse for the majority of people.  That is not the whole story.  Old people or parents of families are now living in dread of there being illnesses in their families.  They worry about how they will cope with it.  Many are neglecting other needs.  Many people are now joining the VHI who would not otherwise have spent money on health insurance.  This is an indication of their concern about health care and their anxiety about becoming ill.</P>
    <P>Of course health cuts could be effected.  Some savings are capable of being effected on expenditure on health issues but, in effecting savings, clear thinking and planning are needed.  It should not be done on a regional or local basis but rather from a national prospective taking account, on the one hand, of resources, skills, personnel and, on the other, people's needs impartially and fairly determined.  This has not happened. We have watched the Government lurch from one crisis to another, patching up here and making do there. There is just no public confidence in the Government, in their ability to care for <Col N="563" /> our health needs.  We have seen an agenda of calamities from the abolition of the Health Education Bureau to the débacle in regard to Barrington's Hospital in Limerick.  Government policy on cutbacks is hamfisted and clumsy.</P>
    <P>What do people want?  They want to be reassured that the health service to which they had become accustomed will not be permanently scarred by Government policies.  They want equity and fair play.  Many people can point to cutbacks and staff rationalisation in general hospitals staffs.  In other words, personnel in the lower grades are being cut, or rationalised, virtually leaving alone the staff hierarchies of consultants and specialists.</P>
    <P>Savings should be made across the board.  No one group should be excluded. All should carry a fair amount of the savings implemented.  What is happening in the health area was brought home to me recently when my husband was ill and needed an appointment with an orthopaedic specialist.  My general practitioner said he would have to be listed three months hence for an appointment.  When I expressed surprise my general practitioner told me how lucky my husband was, that public patients must wait 16 to 18 months for an appointment.</P>
    <P>In the present climate there are some groups more vulnerable than others. Among them I would give priority to the old, men and women who are ill and deserve good care at the end of their lives.  They are not getting such care. This is what probably influenced me and others most &mdash; the number of old people who are ill, who are being sent home from hospital to die because this Government do not care that we do not have a developed system of community care.  In another country if would be possible to send old people home into the care of their family or a relative because there would be a sophisticated community care system, a network of nurses and caring personnel.  Such community care has been a casualty of the cuts effected here. There is no vestige of community care, in a real sense &mdash; like having day care <Col N="564" /> centres, or public health nurses.  There had been a development in that direction, something with which most of us would agree.</P>
    <P>There are the areas affected &mdash; such as maternity, child care but particularly the old, the people who need homes.  In this context I might quote from a contribution in this House by Senator O'Connell on 23 March, 1988, at column 112 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>We have a growing population over the age of 65 for whom it is impossible to get a bed, it is absolutely impossible. This is happening not just in the past year but it has been going on for the past three or four years.  We are not making provision in any way for these people who are over the age of 65. Because of the way the services and health in general over the years have improved due to developments in technology and medicine many people will live longer.  They become a burden on the community....  This is something that we have to look at.  This is an opportunity for another look at this whole matter.</P>
    <P>We need to revise what has been done. We need to look at what is ahead because we cannot continue tolerating the cuts we have seen in the last year.</P>

      <P>I have pleasure in seconding the Fine Gael amendment.  I notice that it seems to have upset the Members of the Labour Party who put down the motion in Private Members' time.  I would just like to remind them that we have a right, an entitlement as a political grouping, in the Seanad, to put down an amendment.  We do not apologise for that at all.  In fact it is a rational, sensible and intelligent amendment. While I understand the tremendous distress an anxiety caused by the closure of the hospitals, quite frankly, when I saw these hospitals listed I felt that to suddenly, tomorrow morning, turn around and open all these hospitals would cause crisis upon crisis.  Consequently, I thought the Labour Party motion an absolutely extraordinarily simplistic <Col N="565" /> motion to put down, really one that showed no evidence of evaluation, planning, reasoning or an awareness of the financial realities within which we must all operate.  In this list of hospitals I, too, queried where was Jervis Street in all of this, where is Baggot Street, where is Sir Patrick Dun's?  If one is going to list all the hospitals that have been closed why not do it comprehensively, which is the very least those other hospitals that have been closed deserved?</P>
      <P>I have a horror of politics intervening in the whole health care area.  Nevertheless we live in a very real, practical world and I suppose it must be the case. To me, the provision of health care is just far too important for cheap political shots, for the sort of shroud politics that we see.  That is not my term, that is only used, I think, by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond.  I would regard that as a very low form of politics, that frightens the vulnerable, causing upset and distress, all in the name of gaining political points and point scoring. In fact it undermines the very people for whom health care is so vitally important. I would hate to think that anything I would say in the context of this debate would have an upsetting or undermining effect on any of those vulerable people.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris spoke about the Fine Gael amendments clouding the issue. Then, in the course of his contribution, he queried the Government's priorities. I would put it to Senator Ferris that that is precisely what the Fine Gael amendment is designed to do; it is designed to query the Government's priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ferris spoke in relation to Cashel and Clonmel, contending that the whole question was being raised again in the south east region.  Of course both he and I served on the South-Eastern Health Board.  We are well aware of what is happening.  I gather there has been a special committee established to look into the Cashel <i>versus</i> Clonmel hospital and come forward with recommendations. There is a very real fear that if the vote is won in one direction the other hospital that loses will be run down. I do not think that is any way to plan a <Col N="566" /> health care service &mdash; on the basis of a vote taken at health board level.  That is not good enough.  There has to be an overview, an evaluation and then a democratic input.  Something should not be decided merely on the basis of an argument at local level.  It should be put in a national context and be related to available resources.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat sick of the Government lecturing the public on their voracious need for more and more health care.  It is not on to do that.  You have to recognise the fact that it is important to have logic underpinning health care provisions, recognising that there is an inexorable rise but also planning for that rise. Senator Ferris said he resented &mdash; I think it is not too strong a term to use &mdash; the presence of the Fine Gael amendment because he wanted to argue with the Government.  I would much prefer to reason with the Government and to appeal to their good instincts &mdash; I am sure there must be some in the Government &mdash; in relation to health care services.  I would regard mere arguing about health care as a very sterile activity, indeed. By logic and by reason I would hope to persuade them that the absence of a plan, or overview is something that is distorting the delivery of health care on the ground to our people and that that is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The Government must have recognised that fact at some stage.  They set up a commission on health funding with specific terms of reference.  The terms of reference come into the Fine Gael amendment.  The commission on health care funding were asked to bring forward a plan to provide an equitable, comprehensive and cost effective public health service.  In the course of his reply I should like the Minister to let us know how many times the commission on health funding have met, how far along the road they are in their deliberations, when they are expected to report and when action will be taken on foot of their report?  I think I am correct in saying that an undertaking was given to the leader of my party that the commission on health funding report would be laid before the <Col N="567" /> Houses of the Oireachtas and that there would be a debate on such a report.</P>
    <P>That kind of debate and report on the health care services is long overdue.  In the absence of a debate, in the absence of the possibility of consensus about the delivery of health care, what is happening out there is <i>ad hoc</i> planning, crisis management, quite frankly, chaos.  Much of it is hitting the headlines and much is not. A lot of it is quiet and sorrowful.  It is ending up very badly indeed.  It is unacceptable. Because of that people like myself and others who speak today wish to debate the health care services.  There is no point in having a callous, simplistic philosophy that the books must be balanced no matter who suffers.  That is just not good enough.  I do not believe that that could possibly be Government policy.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Shea in his contribution spoke about the morale of health care staff.  I am glad he did because that is contained in the Fine Gael amendment.  I take it he would agree that morale among health care workers is at an all time low precisely because of the absence of planning, because they do not know where they are going, because they see the patients &mdash; for whom they care and for whom they are powerful advocates &mdash; suffering as a consequence of the absence of Government planning.  I am pleased to note that Senator O'Shea recognised that aspect of the Fine Gael amendment.</P>
    <P>We want a humane, rational and planned approach.  I want to reiterate the right to health care of every citizen in a civilised community as not being open to question.  The question is: how do we plan this?  I am fearful of what lies ahead. We read in the papers that some additional £400 million cuts will be effected in the autumn.  It is unthinkable that these would bite at the health care services without a careful evaluation and study and the bringing forward of, at the very least, the report of the commission on health care funding, a White Paper on health care services, or a full debate and, <Col N="568" /> hopefully, the possibility of some consensus on what it is possible to do in relation to the delivery of health care.</P>
    <P>In an ideal world it ought to mean that every one of our citizens is entitled to the best health care service available.  In the Ireland of today, I am not so sure that it can absolutley mean that.</P>
    <P>We must remember that there has been a huge expansion in medical technology, what is called high-tech medicine.  We have to take decisions on what proportion of our scarce money is to be spent in this area, what proportion will be spent on acute beds, on long-stay beds, on psychiatric care and on so many elements of health care.  I appeal to the Labour Party to adopt a mature, rational approach, to stop this shroud politics, this panicking of people, this symplistic, naive and pathetic approach to the whole issue of health care.  Blazoned on their banners is: health care is a basic right.  I do not disagree with that.  I accept that the Government do not disagree with that, but it has to be done on the basis of a plan, an evaluation, on the basis of a realisation of the amount of money available to us to spend on health care.</P>
    <P>For that reason I second the Fine Gael amendment.  It is sensible.  It meets the position obtaining.  It recognises the crisis and chaos caused by the absence of planning and appeals, one hopes, to what are the better instincts of the Government.</P>

      <P>That is correct.  I cannot agree with the motion or the amendment. Both use a very sensational kind of lauguage, such as crisis and chaos.  I do not notice at all that crisis or chaos in the health services.  Certainly, as chairman of the Association of Health Boards of Ireland, I have not come across that at any of our meetings.  In the north west there have been no hospital closures for the simple reason that our hospitals were closed 15 years ago.  We adopted a proper regional system.  What too many regions tried to do was to retain their county <Col N="569" /> system, at the same time maintaining a regional system.  You cannot have both. With good management those hospitals which did provide acute services could be used for other purposes without causing any hardship or problems.  That is what we did in the north west.</P>
      <P>I should also like to remind the proposers and seconders of the motion and the amendment that you would have the impression that they were never in power at all themselves.  Indeed I might remind them that on 10 December in the Dáil the previous Government told us that, in their four years in office, there had been a national cut of 3.8 per cent in funding of the health services.  Indeed in that period the allocation to our health board was cut, in 1983, by £3.4 million, in 1984 by £1.7 million, in 1986 by £2.2 million. I heard much of that same scare mongering at health board meetings.  I must say that I did not agree with those cuts although some of my party were making them.  At the same time, it was agreed within our health board that we would live within our means, that we would adopt a budget and estimates and work within them.  For that reason we were able to manage our affairs with no hardship being occasioned.</P>
      <P>I do not agree at all that there is any hardship being suffered even at present. I should like to pay tribute to the various health boards on the great job they are doing.  Indeed I might congratulate the Minister on the way in which he is managing to keep the health boards in check. It should be remembered that a previous Minister had intended to abolish them, leaving local representatives with absolutely no say.  It was his proposal to have one board only &mdash; Bord Sláinte &mdash; located in Dublin which would dictate the services for the entire country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening now is a far cry from the attitude that was displayed then. One would think that during the time of the last Government no hospitals were closed.  Many hospitals were closed and, indeed, the hospital in Longford, which I pass on my way home, was closed and there was no big hullabaloo about it.  It <Col N="570" /> was accepted by the Fianna Fáil Party, by the Fianna Fáil politicians in Longford and by the health board.</P>
    <P>There was, and is, no crisis.  The health boards are being run very ably and efficiently.  Over the past number of years they were run on shoestring budgets but there was no hardship as a result.  There still is no hardship and there will be no hardship.  It is grossly unfair for healthy, able-bodied people to try to promote this type of attitude and make it tougher for people who may be ill or seeking hospitalisation who now believe they will not be able to get into hospital.  I have spoken to many people who have been in hospital and they thought the services in the hospital were great.  They thought before they went in that there would be no places for them.  The services in hospitals are good and I want to pay tribute to the hospital boards, the staff and those who are administering the health services in a very fair and sincere manner.</P>
    <P>It is grossly unfair to suggest that there is chaos in the health service.  There is no chaos.  It is a good service and it is being properly and democratically implemented through the health boards. We are all proud and delighted about that.  The motion and the amendment are nothing more than an attempt to sensationalise the situation.  A hospital that is not facing closure has been listed in the motion as facing closure.  I am amazed that people put forward those type of motions without first doing proper research.  It is grossly unfair.</P>

As I said earlier today on the Order of Business, I have no doubt that the footnote &mdash; which I believe was added at a late stage &mdash; about the hospital in Drogheda is inaccurate.  The Minister has taken no decision to close St. Mary's Hospital.  A Labour Senator said earlier that he was aware of a proposal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a proposal; there is no agreement.  The situation at present in relation to the hospital in Drogheda is that discussions are on-going between the North Eastern Health Board, the Department of Health and the Cottage Hospital to transfer 20 patients from the old fever hospital, Fatima Hospital, which is attached to St. Mary's Hospital, and to accommodate them in the Cottage Hospital.  That is phase one of the operation. Phase two of the operation is down the road and it is for consideration by the North Eastern Health Board.  I should like to remind Senators that Deputy Desmond issued an instruction to close Monaghan Hospital in 1982-83.  He said at that time that he would not give the go ahead for Cavan Hospital unless the North Eastern Health Board closed Monaghan Hospital.  Monaghan Hospital is still open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the difficult financial constraints on the Minister.  Nobody likes it when hospitals are closed but I should like to remind the Labour Party that they were part of a Government who over four years, spent £12 billion.  There is not much evidence that any of that money was spent in my constituency.  If we even had the interest that is being used to service that £12 billion, I am sure we would not be debating this motion here <Col N="572" /> today.  The publicity being generated by the Labour Party in Drogheda and the publicity they can command in the town is causing anxiety to patients and their relatives and it is affecting the morale of all the staff in all the hospitals in Drogheda.  This is wrong, I have no doubt that it is being done for party political reasons only and I believe the vast majority of the people in Drogheda are aware of this also.  I resent the leaflets that are being handed out by the trades councils which state that if St. Mary's Hospital is allowed to close, sick and elderly people will be sent home or moved to hospitals in Dundalk, Ardee or Navan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is a need for a complete re-assessment of the medical services in this country.  I am confident that the Minister for Health will not alone maintain the service in Drogheda but improve it.  There is a need for a geriatric assessment unit in the town and I hope that the site of St. Mary's Hospital will be retained so that, when the economy improves, we will be in a position to build a geriatric hospital there in the long term. However, in the short term we have got to realise that phase one is being discussed and no decision has been taken to close St. Mary's Hospital.  I hope when things improve this hospital will be maintained.</P>

      <P>The Labour motion and the Fine Gael amendment seek to give the impression that the changes which are taking place in the health services are unnecessary and are being implemented without insight on an unplanned basis.  As I will explain to the House, this is a distortion of the true position.  There is a clear and justifiable <Col N="573" /> rationale underlying the major changes which have occurred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are some transitional problems, they arise from the rate of change rather than from any lack of soundness in the objectives which are being pursued with both firmness and care.  I want to start by putting the changes in the appropriate financial and policy context.</P>
      <P>Arising from measures outlined by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement, total spending on the health services in 1988 will amount to just below £1.3 billion.  This amount takes account of the continuing funding of the community drugs scheme, the transfer of the disabled drivers assistance scheme from the Revenue Commissioners to my Department and an increase of 3 per cent from next July in the rates of allowances to disabled drivers.  The provision of almost £1.3 billion is only slightly less than the 1987 figures.  Having regard to the financial effect of the savings made in 1987 and carried through the year I am satisfied that the amount will allow for the provision of an adequate service, particularly to those most in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my assessment during 1987 of the unavoidable difficulties encountered by the health agencies because of late notification of their allocations I ensured that, in respect of 1988, agencies will know well in advance of their 1988 allocation. The Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon was, therefore, glad to be able to notify agencies in October 1987 of their allocations which enabled health boards, voluntary hospitals and other bodies to plan their service delivery in good time. This also allowed agencies to plan in such a manner which would ensure that resources would be spread over the year and that agencies would adopt a strategy <Col N="574" /> of service delivery consistent with their financial resources.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I have to reject suggestions that agencies are necessarily engaged in crisis management in 1988.  Those who took a positive approach to their task and exercised good management skills have been able to adjust to the priorities in services in line with their budgets.  If, for whatever reason, some agencies failed to act in this manner, there may well have been difficulties but these were not primarily due to a shortage of resources.  I would suggest that it is wrong to attribute to the whole system problems which occur only in parts of it and which are often the result of inability or unwillingness to manage change.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline briefly some of the main elements of change now taking place in the health services in line with Government policy.  I have to say that some of the areas which require change were clearly identified before this Government came into office; yet very little positive action was taken to implement these changes.  I put it to the Senators from the two parties who formed the last Government that they had aspirations to rationalise the acute hospital system, develop primary health care services, develop health promotion and preventive services and improve the managerial arrangements at all levels of the system.  The achievement of these objectives is what I am about, as is clear from the changes taking place in the service. In accordance with Fianna Fáil policies, I am also, conducting a review of health service funding arrangements.  I am rather surprised that Senators should object to and seek to set aside the achievement of many of the objectives to which they and their parties subscribe. Perhaps they are disappointed that action has been substituted for words.</P>
    <P>I think all of us would agree that we must continue to make available to the people of the country a health service that is effective, efficient and equitably distributed.  We have developed a first class health service with very wide political <Col N="575" /> and public support for these aspirations. In recent years we have had difficulty in maintaining the required level of public funding and it seems only prudent to take a good look at how we are using available resources and how well we will continue to fund services in the future.  The point made by Senator O'Connell is quite correct.  Irrespective of the funding available to the health services, there will continue to be a demand for the money that will be provided. I believe that the £1,300 million provided from the public purse is a considerable investment in the health services and one which, at the end of the day, the taxpayer has to pay for.  That basically is the situation.  If we had unlimited funds available to us, that would have to be taken into account, but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>It is because of these considerations that I have appointed a commission on health funding who are currently examining in detail the question of funding the health services with a view to providing the best possible advice to me and the Government.  The terms of reference of the commission are very broad and range well beyond any narrow consideration of funding mechanisms.  I have specifically requested the commission to make recommendations not only on the extent and sources of the future funding required, but also on any changes in administration required to ensure an equitable, comprehensive and cost effective public health service.  The linking of the funding in question with such considerations as equity, comprehension and efficiency was deliberate.  The funding issue is not being considered in a vacuum.</P>
    <P>While I will refer later in my response to other initiatives which are relevant, it appears that the Fine Gael amendment seeks to pre-empt the commission's report and recommendations.  I was glad to hear Senator Bulbulia clarify her party's position on these matters and I accept that the commission's report should provide the basis for a full debate on many key issues of our future policy <Col N="576" /> on health services.  I expect to have the commission's report later in the year.  In addition, I expect, as a result of the work being undertaken in my Department that, in advance of next year's allocation to health agencies, I will be in a position to introduce improvements in the existing resource allocation mechanisms.  I believe it is particularly important to ensure that all agencies can be assured that they have been given a fair share of the available resources having regard to well known and easily understood criteria.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity this evening to outline the policy in relation to acute general hospitals which seems to have given rise to the motion put down by the Labour Party members.  My objective at all times is to provide an efficient, effective and caring health service within the limits of the funds allocated for that purpose by Dáil Éireann.  I have to say, however, that there can be no question of providing additional funds to reopen the hospitals listed in the motion.  This is not only because of the difficult budgetary situation but also because it would not be in the best interests of an effective, integrated hospital service to reopen them.  I am amazed at the list of hospitals outlined by the Labour Party which is totally unrealistic.</P>
    <P>With regard to the seven district hospitals listed in the motion, I should first of all say that these hospitals were owned and managed by the health boards who have statutory responsibility for providing hospital services in their functional areas.  In my view the health boards, as the bodies involved at local level, are in the best position to determine what the local needs are and I do not intend to interfere with their decisions to close these hospitals.  I do not feel I have any reason to do so, for the action of the health boards is in line with the policy that the number of hospitals and hospital beds should be reduced to a level which we can afford.</P>
    <P>I am sure this House is aware that the general hospitals consume over 50 per <Col N="577" /> cent of all health spending.  It is imperative that hospital costs be controlled if we are to make any progress in achieving the budgetary targets and yet ensure that adequate funds are available for the other necessary and desirable services.  This has been the principle of health policy for well over 20 years.  It remained merely a principle until the advent of this Government who have taken steps to convert it into reality.</P>
    <P>The first step in this regard was the establishment last year of a review of the acute hospitals system so that the rationalisation and development of hospital services could proceed on a planned basis.  The review established, yet again, that the number of beds in the system was well in excess of the number required by reference to the Department's planning guidelines and the level of provision elsewhere.  Between them, the seven district hospitals listed had a total budget of £2.724 million and these funds can now be used to develop community care services in the areas concerned. Indeed, the district hospitals closed in many areas have already been replaced by community care services for the elderly.</P>
    <P>I have encouraged and assisted this process through the provision of funds where necessary from the national lottery. We have provided £45,000 and £40,000 respectively from the national lottery to assist in the establishment, on a local community support basis, of nursing facilities in the buildings which previously accommodated Kilrush and Lismore district hospitals.  In that regard I believe the Labour Party are not well informed in relation to the developments which are taking place.  If they were aware of the situation, they would not have listed Kilrush District Hospital which has actually been reopened as a community base.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach will confirm that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>These beds will be able to provide a crisis intervention service for <Col N="578" /> those elderly people who cannot continue to live in their own homes.  Similarly, I have provided £40,000 towards the establishment of geriatric day care services in the Geriatric Hospital of the Assumption in Thurles, in St. Vincent's Hospital, Tipperary and in Bagenalstown.  A notable aspect of these developments which I greatly admire is the involvement of the local community groups in the new community care services.  These are models of community involvement and a credit to the local people concerned.  It is an initiative which I hope to foster and develop.</P>
      <P>There can be no question of providing funding for the reopening of those hospitals listed in the motion which are not district hospitals.  The financial imperative has again merely acted as a catalyst to bring forward the implementation of agreed policy.  In these cases the principle in question is that hospital services should be provided in a smaller number of larger centres.  This principle was advocated over 20 years ago in 1968. It is not possible to provide hospital services of the highest medical standard in the existing multiplicity of small centres. Time does not allow me to go into greater detail with regard to each of the hospitals but I would like to highlight a few points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acute hospital review group found that there was a surplus of beds in the Mid-Western Health Board area and that hospital services were fragmented between the three hospitals in Limerick City.  This did not make for economic or medical sense and it was clear that one of the voluntary hospitals had to close. The Department and the Minister decided that Barringtons Hospital should close and their budget of £1.6 million is now being used to greater effect in providing services in the remaining hospitals in Limerick &mdash; St. John's and Limerick Regional Hospital.  In that whole episode I cannot help recalling the enthusiasm with which the Labour Party supported the privatisation of St. John's Hospital in an effort to reverse the decision on the closure of Barringtons Hospital.  That was an unbelievable decision on the part of the Labour Party <Col N="579" /> who, in theory and in public, are opposed to private medicine and yet in practice they were prepared to vote for private medicine in relation to St. John's Hospital in Limerick.  In fact, under a Labour Minister, more private beds were opened in this country than under any other previous Government.  This was certainly an indication of a policy reversal or U-turn on the part of the Labour Party in Dáil Éireann when this matter was debated last year.</P>
    <P>The same rationale lies behind the closure of the North Infirmary in Cork, where there are four hospitals within a small area, and in Monkstown which serves an area of Dublin already admirably served by several hospitals, among them St. Vincents, Elm Park, one of the major hospitals in the country.  Similarly, the acute beds in Drogheda Cottage Hospital cannot be regarded as indispensable, given the presence of the large nearby 360 bed hospital of Our Lady of Lourdes. It makes sense in terms of efficiency to combine long stay institutional services, currently provided by the Cottage Hospital and St. Marys' Hospital, in one site.  The Cottage Hospital was chosen for attention because of the much higher physical standard of its buildings.</P>
    <P>Beaumont Hospital has replaced the old St. Laurence's and Jervis Street hospitals with a facility which can provide an excellent service.  I am not sure why St. Laurence's Hospital is listed in the motion.  Do the Senators wish me to close Beaumont Hospital and transfer the services back to the old unsafe St. Laurence's Hospital?  Seriously, it seems like a totally unrealistic motion.  From what I have said it is clear that hospital closures have not been necessary merely for the reduction of public expenditure but also for the development and implementation of the integrated hospital policy.  The Department and the Minister are fully committed to ensuring that this country receives, and continues to receive, an exellent hospital service.</P>
    <P>The present financial constraints, necessary and generally accepted though they are, do not diminish the difficult <Col N="580" /> management decisions which have to be taken in order to continue to provide a range and standard of services which are acceptable and affordable.  It is the essence of good management that workable and balanced choices are made and carried out.  These choices must represent a clear commitment to the maintenance of priority services across all programmes which protect, in particular, those who are dependent on the provision of care service and are unable to provide for themselves.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the reorganisation of health board structures is one of my priorities in improving and developing our health delivery system.  I use the word &ldquo;reorganisation&rdquo; deliberately. The question of the abolition of the health boards is not on my agenda.  I accept that changes need to be made in relation to the framework of health boards.  The relationship between boards and their management, the role of the boards and the role of managers in achieving agreed objectives.  There is also a clear need for a more positive and supportive approach to the development of managers and managements system.  A similar agenda is appropriate in relation to major non-statutory bodies responsible for the delivery of services.  The most effective approach to health board reorganisation is to identify the failings and shortfalls in the existing structures, to test different delivery systems to establish their values and general application and then to make the necessary adjustments in structures, management and responsibility.</P>
    <P>Initiatives I have taken in all of these areas will be evaluated as soon as the pilot phase is complete.  At that stage I will be in a position in the spirit of consultation with the relevant and professional and staff interests concerned to make the necessary structural changes.  In addition my Department, in conjunction with health board management, are reviewing the co-operative and managerial functions of boards to identify the factors in the existing framework which hinder a more effective and efficient management of services.  The existing health <Col N="581" /> board management structure is divided between different care programmes &mdash; hospital, special hospital and community care.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement that this is an artificial divide and, given the nature of health and social services and the interrelationship of all such services, a different structure, perhaps geographic rather than programme-based, would seem to be far more appropriate to meet present day demands.  A geographic service manager would be clearly identifiable within the community, would be responsible for meeting local health needs and would be held accountable for the effective delivery of local services.  I intend to further assess the strength and weaknesses of this approach.  I am satisfied that the approach I have outlined will achieve the improvements necessary.</P>
    <P>I wish also to refer to a pilot project in the North Western Health Board area which I have identified as suitable for testing and developing innovative options and approaches in relation to the organisation, management and delivery of health services.  The pilot project will encompass a range of services, including community medicine, mental handicap and some social services.  The basic objective of those involved in this project is to establish what changes are required in the existing organisation of services to ensure that they are appropriate and responsive to the needs of the population and that the working relationship of the personnel involved is fully productive.  It is in all our interests to ensure that the delivery system is properly structured, responsive to change both now and in the future and can deliver a quality service.</P>
    <P>Since taking office the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, has expressed the need on several occasions to develop a strategic plan for the future development of health services.  We must produce a plan which concentrates on the achievement of progress in a small number of critical areas and which ensures that these priorities will be fully reflected in the resource allocation process. Considerable preparatory work on <Col N="582" /> the development of such plans has already taken place.  The major conference of my Department's discussion document <i>Health</i>&mdash;<i>the Wider Dimensions</i> was very successful and focused attention on the future direction of health policy and the factors which should determine how best to proceed.  The removal of identified health inequalities in line with the Government's stated object of protecting the vulnerable and less well off in our community will be a major factor underlying my approach to health policy and resource allocation.  It is my intention to have a developmental plan prepared as soon as the findings of the commission on health funding are available.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the rationale which underpins the changes which are taking place in the health services.  A planned approach is being taken to the implementation of the many changes which are necessary.  I ask the House to support the Government in the policy which they are pursuing to ensure that an effective and efficient health service is available to all who need it.  In this context I must say that the work undertaken by the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon over the past 12 months is attributed to his capacity to handle the particular brief.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to conclude but I must express my regret that I did not have a copy of the Minister's speech.  I realise that he was restricted in time and had to literally gallop through it.  I believe there was bad news in that script for Senator Mulroy.  The Minister of State confirmed what the Minister for Health had said about St. Mary's Hospital.  I am sorry about that because I believe St. Mary's Hospital played a useful role in Drogheda.  I note from the final minute of that meeting &mdash; and I am alerting Senator Mulroy to this &mdash; that a meeting to finalise all these arrangements will be held in the Drogheda Cottage Hospital at 5 p.m. on 12 May.  The Senator should sit up and take notice because the Minister is agreed that this hospital should be closed.  This was stated at a meeting chaired by the Minister and <Col N="583" /> has been confirmed by the Minister of State in his speech.</P>

      <P>People including the Assistant Whip of the Government Party questioned the validity of this motion because there were inaccuracies in it.  Thankfully this debate on the motion was allowed to take place because this is where you can decide whether or not something is valid.  A meeting of the Star Chamber group in Drogheda to put the pressure on not to allow this motion to be taken can create political problems.  That is what happens when decisions like this are made by a Government who have no plans.  I have no objection whatsoever to the Fine Gael amendment but it was put down two years too late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I know and appreciate that. There is nothing wrong with the amendment but it should have been put down before all these hospitals were closed. This is a very relevant point and Senator O'Connell referred to it.  During Deputy Desmond's period in office it was said that hospitals were being closed and if said often enough people will believe it. The Deputy did not close any hospitals which were not recommended for closure by health boards.  The only hospitals recommended for closure by the health boards were the ones that were being replaced by better hospitals.  The Deputy highlighted the Monkstown Hospital and admitted that that hospital was being kept open by somebody who had a vested <Col N="584" /> interest in it.  I mentioned earlier that there may be medical vested interests who want to keep hospitals open but that is for another debate.</P>
      <P>The Minister said &mdash; and it is difficult to quote from a speech delivered like that &mdash; that there were unavoidable difficulties in this Health Estimate and in the allocations of funding.  He said also that money creates demand.  That immediately raises the question: who is creating the demand for these health services? It is not the people.  People do not want to go into hospital unless they are sent there or told by medics that they need to go there.  I am defending their right to get a bed when they are told they should have one.  If the Government feel that medical people are over-prescribing they should deal with those people directly and not deal with them indirectly through the poor who are not able to make these judgments for themselves. This is what we are faced with.</P>
      <P>I accept that Senator Farrell was being absolutely legitimate when he said there is no crisis in his health board area, but he confirmed there was no closure in the health board area.  That is why there is no crisis.  There is an availability of beds.  That is how it should be done. The Senator incorrectly stated that, over the period in which Deputy Desmond was Minister for Health, the health boards were short of money every year. I wish to put this in context because I want to be absolutely specific about what I am talking about.  I was a member of a health board for ten years and each year we determined at health board level what we needed and we sent the estimates to the Department.  The Department allocated what they thought was the correct amount.  The difference between what they gave you and what you had looked for was the cutback.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More money was always allocated than in the previous year.  This is the first year, following on last year's cuts, that less money has been given to the health services than in the previous year, irrespective of what was asked for.  It was irrelevant what you asked for.  The <Col N="585" /> Department allocated the amount in plenty of time but health boards were told that was all they were getting.  This is a real cutback because it is less than what the health boards got the year before.  That is what we are talking about here.  It is a great thing to have a community service in a hospital and the Minister has complimented the community.</P>
    <P>Sub-acute district hospitals have been closed down without a replacement service being provided in the community.  A community hospital has not been opened in place of St. Vincent's District Hospital in Tipperary.  We have asked for it.  We do not even have a community structure agreeable and willing to do it.  Are we talking about day care centres, meals on wheels?  I am talking about sub-acute hospital services which are an economic service.  The Minister of State, the Minister and the Government have replaced cost-effective sub-acute hospitals with specialised acute beds, costing the taxpayers four times as much money as they would have cost in a district hospital.  Do not tell me what you want to do with community services.  What have we in Lismore?  The Minister said we have not researched the matter.  We know what is in Lismore.  The Minister should ask the Fianna Fáil people in Lismore what is there.  Some people resigned from the <Col N="586" /> party because of what happened there.</P>

      <P>I could go on forever but I want to be absolutely fair to the Members who considered this motion was worth amending.  I accept that the amendment would have been valid at the time of the health board estimates or at the time of the Health Estimate in the Dáil, when we knew and Fine Gael knew that there was not enough money to run the health services.  They had to be rationalised.  We saved £15 million over ten years, but we did not lose a bed.  We did not lose any jobs and we did not lose a patient.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - County Roscommon Roads.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The road network in County Roscommon &mdash; that is, all grades of roadway &mdash; is among the very worst in the country.  The county or minor road network in this county is the most deteriorated, the most deficient, the most dangerous, in short, the very worst network of county or minor roads in the whole country.  This evening I call on the Minister immediately to increase the block grant to the Roscommon local authority in order that remedial work can be undertaken to ameliorate the misery <Col N="589" /> and the humiliation felt by thousands of people in the county who live along these roads and who must use them as access to their homes, their farms, their schools and, indeed, their work.</P>
      <P>The Minister may have no news for us tonight other than to say he has no money but we do not accept that.  There is a clear responsibility on the Government to maintain the public highway.  When the deteriorated and deficient state of the public highway threatens life and limb &mdash; that is a fact &mdash; and when it threatens livelihoods and when children can no longer reach their schools &mdash; that is another fact because school transport services are being withdrawn from these awful roads &mdash; the Government cannot plead inability to pay.</P>
      <P>In relation specifically to Roscommon, the relevant statistics and figures show the injustice which is being done to this county by the Government in terms of the allocation it gets to maintain and keep in order its road network.  The county has 3,330 kilometres of county road; 1,250 kilometers are classified as primary or more important county roads, not to be confused with national primary roads or national secondary roads.  We are talking about the more important mileages of the county roads.  A recent survey shows that 550 kilometres, or approximately 45 per cent of this category, are seriously deficient, barely passable or downright dangerous.  The remaining 2,080 kilometres are not yet fully surveyed to determine the level of danger and deterioration but that will be soon available. However, conservative estimates ahead of the survey suggest that 55 per cent of this second category, all 2,080 kilometres of it, are either dangerous or impassable and that the stretches that are reasonably acceptable in relative terms are nevertheless rutted and potholed over all the better stretches.  The genesis of the disaster, of course, goes back to the madness of 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking 1977 as the base year we find that the expenditure on county road maintenance in County Roscommon was £731 per kilometre.  In the current year, <Col N="590" /> 11 years on, the expenditure is £350 per kilometre, more than halved in money terms.  In real terms the cut is unbelievable because the building cost index has increased by 247.9 per cent from May 1977 to the end of 1987.  If we were to spend at the same level on maintenance as applied in 1977, the expenditure now would be £1,812 per kilometre.  I have just mentioned that instead we are spending £350 per kilometre.</P>
    <P>There is another set of statistics which shows the serious disadvantages of Roscommon and, indeed, a few other counties in the west in relation to road funding, particularly county road funding. I will quote from an analysis of the level of expenditure on county roads in 1986 prepared by the Minister's own Department which refers to all local authorities in the State.  In 1986 the amount available to Roscommon County Council to expend under this heading was £420 per kilometre and this year that figure has fallen to £350 per kilometre.  In 1986 Dublin County Council had £4,700 per kilometre to spend on county road maintenance. Tipperary South Riding had £1,300 per kilometre to spend on county roads in 1986.  County Wicklow had £960 per kilometre, County Limerick, £934; County Cork had £866, County Kildare had £760 and the Minister's own county of Mayo had £410 per kilometre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That has gone up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not think it has. The Minister would want to take note of that particular statistic.  Galway had £400 per kilometre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are just facts and figures and I am not saying anything to denigrate any of the counties I mentioned.  These are facts and it is important, if we are to make our case, since all things are relative, that we bring in all the relative figures so that a proper judgment can be made.  This gross injustice in determining the size of the allocation is a throw-back to the days when the total valuation of all the property in an administrative county determined the size of that authority's budget. <Col N="591" /> Naturally areas like Dublin with a very high density of buildings, all valued for PLV purposes, won out in this system. Naturally counties like Wicklow and south Tipperary, with very good land, highly valued under the old PLV system, won by this system also.  Counties like Roscommon and Mayo, by and large with poor land and low valuation, are put at a very serious and unjust disadvantage when this otherwise abolished system is used as the base to determine the size of the budget.</P>
    <P>This system takes no account of the fact that a typical western county like Roscommon or, indeed, Mayo has greater difficulty in maintaining rural roads because of the subsoil conditions the roads are necessarily built upon.  It is estimated that almost 60 per cent of the minor roads in County Roscommon are built on difficult or water-logged soils. This gives an instability to the road pavement which leads to easy breakdown. Also, there is the greater level of rainfall in western counties which is most damaging to road surfaces.</P>
    <P>Factors like these are the relevant matters that should be taken into account in determining budgets for the various counties.  With the present crazy set-up we have now counties where there are fewer problems deriving from the land and fewer problems deriving from the elements are faring much better than the counties in the west which have all the difficulties of land and of the elements.</P>
    <P>A recent report by the county engineer in Roscommon showed that the funding for county road maintenance alone &mdash; leaving aside any new improvements &mdash; was only 37 per cent of what is needed and 63 per cent short of what is needed and that the remedying of all the accumulated deficiencies on the complete county road system would cost an estimated £80 million.</P>
    <P>Members of the Government, the Minister included, have engaged in enormous reams of rhetoric about developing forestry, tourism, peat bogs and, indeed, farmland.  Very often the rhetoric is just nonsense, if judged by any follow-up <Col N="592" /> action.  It amounts to utterly dishonest nonesense, if not chicanery, to engage in this kind of verbosity while the basic infrastructures which service these activities and these industries, the county and main road systems, are allowed to destruct into quagmires and moonscapes of ruts and patholes, fatal both to human and machine life.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that if there is to be any integrated rural development programme which is now enunciated by the EC and if these policies are to succeed, the first thing we must improve is the basic infrastructure in the areas where they will be applied and that is the road system.  There was a Dáil debate in Private Members' Time on the condition of county roads.  It was a motion proposed by Fianna Fáil on May 22 1985.  The then spokesperson on the Environment for the Opposition, Deputy Bobby Molloy, now departed of course to other climes, had this to say on behalf of his party and I quote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There are literally millions of potholes in County Roscommon.  No doubt there are almost as many in the Minister's own county.  I plead with him here tonight to increase the block grant to County Roscommon from something just over £500,000, a totally unrealistic figure.  I know money is very short but here is an area of clear Government responsibility.  Life and limb are threatened. We plead with the Minister to increase our allocation.  Thank you.</P>

The relevant information is available in my Department as a result of ongoing contact with local authorities as well as submissions received from local authorities and representative bodies such as the County and City Engineers' Association.  Detailed information has been received from all county councils in response to a departmental circular issued in May 1987 about the condition of the network of county roads together with the estimates of the level of investment required to remedy deficiencies in the network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am considering the information in the context of the preparation of a proposed blueprint for road development.  State road grants totalling £150 million have been made available to local authorities in 1988; £120 million has been provided for road improvement works and the balance of £30 million has been provided for road maintenance.  While the 1988 provision is £16 million less than the provision <Col N="594" /> in 1987, it is still a substantial sum at a time when reductions have to be made in most sectors of public expenditure to improve the state of the public finances.  The 1988 provision sees, in fact, an increase of 11 per cent in real terms compared with 1982.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor spoke of the need for additional investment in the county road network.  Primary responsibility for the network of county roads, including the assessment of the need for improvement and maintenance works on them, rests with the local authority.  However, because of my particular concern about the state of county roads and the system of county roads, I have taken special measures in recent times to increase the level of State funding for works on these roads.  In 1987 I allocated a total of £15 million to local authorities for the strengthening of county roads compared with £5 million allocated by a previous Government in 1986.</P>

      <P>Block grants totalling £20.2 million were also provided to local authorities in each of the years 1987 and 1988. This year I have also relaxed the conditions which apply to both the county roads strengthening grants and the block grant to allow local authorities greater flexibility in deciding how the money is to be spent.  County councils have been informed that they can now use the block <Col N="595" /> grant for roads on surface dressing and repair of potholes on primary county roads.  County councils can also adopt a more flexible approach to the grant for strengthening county roads which should be spent on primary county roads as far as practicable.  Where it is evident that a stretch of road with a number of potholes is in need of strengthening, the remedial works can qualify for the strengthening grant if the cost of the strengthening is more than half the total cost of the work.</P>
      <P>The specific measures to be undertaken on foot of the State grant assistance are matters for each individual local authority. Under existing arrangements the cost of works on county and regional roads falls to be financed by a combination of State road grants and local resources.  The relevant State grants are the block grant, county road strengtening grant, special improvement grants and grants for EC western package schemes. In the case of Roscommon County Council, road grants totalling £1,691,000 were allocated in 1988 under those headings. These include a block grant of £592,000, a county road strengthening grant of £675,000, a grant of £234,000 under the EC western package and other special grants of £190,000 and the level of expenditure from local resources is a matter for determination by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to compare one or two of the figures.  In 1980 the State and local resources total expenditure on non-national roads in County Roscommon was £1.05 million.  I allocated this year, in 1988, £2.67 million.  I want to inform the Senator, through you a Chathaoirligh, that the block grant and the county road strengthening grants and FEOGA grants are all allocated on a strict mileage basis, somewhat different from the method adopted by my predecessor in office.  Should the good Senator or any other Senator wish me to go into any detail about the means adopted by my predecessor in the divvying up of the money for road grants I will be quite happy to do so and it will be shown up in <Col N="596" /> exactly the light which the good Senator from Roscommon well knows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We did better under it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>County road maintenance, the basic subject matter to which the motion refers, is not met from State grants at all.  It is met from local resources.  That is apart from the recent change in the surface dressing and the change in the block grant which was welcomed by all and sundry as a major breakthrough and something that was requested by county councils up and down this country for many years and never conceded until this Minister and this administration allowed it to be done. It has had an enormous impact on what I being done to relieve the situation.</P>
      <P>The moneys available to me for road grants in 1988 were fully allocated to local authorities in November last.  I was a little upset to hear the Senator say that the Minister no doubt would suggest that there was no money but that he did not accept that.  I would like to know at some stage whether he is saying that I am misleading the House in that matter or whether he is suggesting that the Government have some other funding available to them that I know nothing about.  The fact is that I have no other source of finance available to provide for increases in the individual grants notified to any local authority.  Any increase I would or could give to one authority could only be provided by withdrawing grants that have already been notified to other authorities and I am not going to do that.  I would regard that as being inequitable.  In any event, I am satisfied that each local authority received their fair share of the funds available to me in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that the situation in Roscommon is as bad as the Senator suggests. He does not have the most deficient and most dangerous road situation in Ireland.  He was using rather inflamatory language and his speech was more for local regurgitation than a serious attempt to assess the position in pragmatic terms. I will prove my point by making reference to the position that exists in Roscommon <Col N="597" /> County Council in so far as their total financial position is concerned.  It may be of some interest to the House to hear this.  Roscommon's current financial position is relatively sound at present in comparison with very many other county councils throughout Ireland.  There was a substantial improvement of £541,000 in their revenue account during 1987 to give them a closing credit balance of almost £130,000.  The credit situation on the current account is offset by a substantial debit balance of about £1 million on the capital account.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the large debit on capital account, the council had a cash surplus of £120,198 at the end of 1987.  I wonder how many other county councils in Ireland could boast the same.  That overall cash surplus enabled Roscommon County Council to avoid overdraft borrowing for the last three months in 1987. How many other county councils could say the same about their financial position? I would also point out that the debtors in County Roscommon exceeded £2.8 million at the end of 1987.  If there was a serious reduction in the number and the level of the debtors it would cetainly lead to a very improved situation in the council's current finances and would enable them to undertake much stronger maintenance works on their county road system the funding of which they are responsible for anyway.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" /> All that being said it is obvious that Roscommon is not in a disadvantaged situation is so far as the distribution of moneys available to me is concerned and I would refer the good Senator to remarks made by colleagues of his, from his own party in the other House, where they persistently suggest to me that more money should be spent on the road networks in and around Dublin and in and around Leinster.  They say they have a higher and greater usage of vehicluar traffic than roads in the west and they suggest that Roscommon, Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Cork and Kerry get more than their fair share of the money that is going about.  On taking office I dispensed with the system of divvy up that was practised by my predecessor, which was inequitable, and I divided strictly on the mileage in each county and consequently Roscommon gets its fair share straight down the line as every other county in Ireland does.</P>
    <P>In regard to the future, the blueprint which I will be announcing and publishing shortly will address the question of the medium and long term development needs of the entire system of public roads, national, primary, secondary, regional, county and whatever, including the roads referred to in the motion.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28 April 1988.</P>
