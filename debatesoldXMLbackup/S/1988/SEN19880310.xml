      <P>I have notice from Senator Paul Bradford that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the reduction of the annual State grants to the community development association, Muintir na Tíre, the need for funding to be provided from the national lottery.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Nuala Fennell of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to indicate when allocations from the national lottery will be made to voluntary organisations.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters by Senators Bradford and Fennell as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Bradford's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Fennell may give notice for another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two questions on the Order of Business I would like to ask which, I hope, are of a non-contentious nature.  The first one is that I do not understand why the Order of Business for today has been adjusted to exclude a debate on Anglo-Irish relations.  Perhaps the Leader of the House could correct me on this, but my understanding was that we were to spend all day today discussing Anglo-Irish relations, Item No. 7 on the Order Paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only the first point. I have several other points to make and they are coming to me as I go along.  The second point I would like to make is to ask the Leader of the House to explain why we are not taking Anglo-Irish relations today, why we are taking the B &amp; I Line Bill.  If there is an urgent reason for taking Item No. 1 today, why was this not explained to the House when it was agreed that we would take a full day's debate on Anglo-Irish relations?  If there is a reason why the B &amp; I Line Bill should be taken &mdash; a money reason &mdash; it was well known at the time it was agreed to take Item No. 7.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That was my second point. I would like to ask the Leader of the House about the Companies (No. 2) Bill. The Companies (No. 2) Bill came to this House some time last May or June.  We are now only half way through Committee Stage.  I would like to know what the plans and prospects are for the Companies (No. 2) Bill and when we are going to take the next part of that Bill.  Third, and finally, I would like to know when it is proposed to take Item No. 7 if it is not proposed to take it today.  If we finish the B &amp; I Line Bill early, could we start Item No. 7 today and finish it next Tuesday or on St. Patrick's Day, if necessary, which would be an appropriate day?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few brief points on the Order of Business.  I asked the Leader of the House, in the midst of other happenings, why there was such urgency about the B &amp; I Line Bill &mdash; the same point raised by Senator Ross. My more important point today is, can the Leader of the House give us some definite indication as to when Item No. 5, the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, will be taken.  Week after week this has been raised.  Week after week we have been told shortly, as soon as possible, in the very near future.  Nothing has happened &mdash; there has been no movement.  As things are going it could be well after Easter before we get to that Bill.  There is an urgency about it.  There is almost certainly all-party agreement on what has to be done.  I urge the Leader of the House &mdash; I know it is not in his hands &mdash; to put pressure on the relevant people and to express the disquiet of all sides in the House about the tardiness with which this Bill is proceeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>When is it intended to take the International Development Association (Amendment) Bill?  I concur with the Leader of the Fine Gael group in what he has said about the Adoption (No. 2) Bill.  This is a Bill which is not about finance or desiccated arid subjects. It is one which affects little children who can be adopted once this legislation is passed.  It is about people who are longing to adopt these children.  For that reason it is inexcusable that there is delay.  I cannot understand it and I find it quite unacceptable.  I hope the Leader of the House will be able to give us the assurances we need that it can be taken next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will we take the Companies (No. 2) Bill next week?  If so, will Government amendments be circulated to us at some reasonable time in advance of next Wednesday?  The Companies (No. 2) Bill and all of those Bills have been sitting there for some time.  One is <Col N="2204" /> beginning to get nervous that something may spring out of the woodwork at very short notice on some of these when the Government finally get around to drafting their amendments.  It is not the fault of this House that a major work load of Government legislation is lying undealt with.  It is not the fault of the Leader of the House or of the Fianna Fáil Whip, but of the Government.</P>
      <P>The message should go back from this House that this House has done its job well on Government legislation but the Government have not done their job well on the legislation.  I concur fully with the remarks of Senators Manning and Bulbulia about the Adoption (No. 2) Bill. It is not our fault.  We have done our job well.  We have facilitated the Government in every way we can and they have been less than courteous to us in letting us know why these delays happened.</P>

      <P>It would be useful to know next week's sittings and the sittings of succeeding weeks.  The Insurance Bill has not been mentioned this morning.  I know many Members on both sides of the House have put a lot of work into that area.  It is my understanding that the Department are ready to take the Bill.  I wonder when it can be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer briefly to matters raised yesterday by Senator O'Toole regarding the AIDS debate.  He said I misquoted him, which I did, and I think I owe him an apology.  He was referring to safe methods of sex and I thought that he was encouraging them, since he was mentioning them.  I hope he will accept my sincere apology, knowing that he is an intelligent and gracious man. I thought I would explain myself.  The word &ldquo;deviant&rdquo; means <i>de via</i> or off the road, people not travelling the same road with me.  If people took offence at that, of course I apologise to them.  The phrase in recent times has come to have a pejorative sense when it is applied to people who, if you said they were deviant would be regarded as abnormal because of their attitudes to certain issues or because of <Col N="2205" /> their orientations or their political affiliations or whatever.  Heaven forbid that I would suggest that any Member of this House is abnormal in any way.  However, if any Member considers himself abnormal, in addition to the public global apology I will offer him a personal apology.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be sitting one day next week Wednesday.  Regarding the Insurance Bill, we hope to have information on that before the end of the day. I will get a date for the taking of the Committee Stage of that.  Regarding Senator Ryan's query on the Companies (No. 2) Bill, I can assure him that if the Government are bringing in amendments the House will have prior notice of these amendments so that the Opposition will have time to consider them.</P>
      <P>I share the concern of Senators regarding the Adoption (No. 2) Bill and I assure the House that the Minister also shares the concern that is being expressed here by various people.  It is not my style to have to get up here week after week and say that we will take this legislation in the near future or as soon as possible.  I will see the Minister today and get a definite date on which we can actually take it.</P>
      <P>I would not accept the statement that matters of finance are uninteresting and arid.  Matters of finance can be fertile ground for job creation and for the preservation of various items.  One of the reasons we are taking the B &amp; I Line Bill today is that there is an extreme urgency in getting the extra finance which is needed to allow B &amp; I to continue to operate.  The Bill is of major importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Item No. 7 is concerned, it is the hope that by agreement we will take that, without giving a guarantee, the week after next or at an early date.  The reason I do not particularly want to take that motion today relates again to the fact that we agreed to give it an all-day airing, and if we start to break it up the impact will not be as effective as having a full debate on it.  Item No. 5 I have dealt with &mdash; Senator Manning's point.  Senator Bulbulia asked about the International Development Association (Amendment) <Col N="2206" /> Bill.  We will be taking that on Wednesday next week.</P>

    <Title>B &amp; I Line Bill, 1988: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The enactment of this short Bill will enable the Minister for Finance to purchase sufficient additional shares in B &amp; I to give effect to the recent Government decision to provide the company with up to £11 million in Exchequer equity in 1988.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the provision of additional equity is required to enable implementation of the B &amp; I's plan of action which came before the Government last December.  That plan had been requested by me in May of last year soon after I had taken office.  At that time I found that the restructuring package involving substantial Exchequer funding which had been put in place in the course of 1986, aimed at turning the B &amp; I round, had failed in that objective. Substantial losses had been incurred in 1986 and were similarly forecast for 1987 and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>In December 1985 the board of B &amp; I submitted proposals to the then Minister for Communications for a financial rescue package aimed at restoring the company to viability.  In the context of these proposals the Government, in February 1986, approved equity injections totalling £38 million, £20 million to be paid in 1986 and £6 million in each of the years 1987 to 1989, inclusive, the 1988 and 1989 injections to be subject to the achievement by B &amp; I of profit targets determined by the Minister for Communications with the agreement of the Minister for Finance.  The targets set were a profit of £500,000 in 1987; of £1 million in 1988; and of £2 million in 1989. The company had forecast a trading loss of about £5 million in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of 1986, B &amp; I received £20 million from the Exchequer. <Col N="2207" /> By March 1987, however, the company were in serious financial difficulties.  The 1986 trading loss had been £6.8 million, or £1.8 million more than forecast, and far from expecting to meet their modest profit target in 1987, the company were, in fact, forecasting trading losses of nearly £15 million for 1987.</P>
    <P>In May 1987, I brought the B &amp; I situation to the notice of the Government and subsequently on 27 May, as I already mentioned, I called in the board of the B &amp; I.  I made it clear to them that the Government were extremely concerned and dissatisfied with the company's losses and that they would not countenance such losses in the future.  I directed the board to submit to me as soon as possible an agreed plan of action, for implementation in the autumn, aimed at restoring the company to viability.  The company had already exhausted the £6 million Exchequer equity allocation for 1987 and to provide time for preparation of the plan of action and to prevent disruption of B &amp; I services during the peak tourism season, the Government agreed to provide the company with additional Exchequer equity of up to £8 million, of which £6 million would represent an advance of the 1988 instalment due under the 1986 restructuring package.  In the event, the company drew down £5 million of this additional allocation in 1987.  They recorded a loss in that year, including financial charges, that is a very important inclusion, of £10.6 million.  In the two years, 1986 and 1987, the company received, therefore, £31 million in Exchequer equity.  An Exchequer guarantee was also issued during 1987 in respect of bank borrowings of £6 million which had been incurred by B &amp; I with the Minister's consent in 1986.</P>
    <P>Why did B &amp; I continue to incur such heavy losses?  Too much has been made, in my opinion, of the impact on the company of the policy of air transport liberalisation and lower air fares initiated by my predecessor in 1986 and greatly intensified by me since then.  Many would argue, including B &amp; I, that competition <Col N="2208" /> from air services was a major contributory factor to the deterioration in the company's performance.  While I accept that the liberalisation of air transport did not make the Company's job any easier, I feel that commercial organisations have to react positively to adverse changes in their environments.  This applies to car ferry companies, including B &amp; I, no less than to other commercial enterprises. Such enterprises must develop and promote new initiatives and must also cut their costs.  In the B &amp; I's case, there were many other factors other than lower air fares contributing to the company's poor performance, not least the self-inflicted wounds of industrial disputes in late 1986 and early 1987 and inherent cost weaknesses in B &amp; I operations, particularly on the freight side.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it should be self-evident that the benefits to the economy and the community as a whole of lower air fares, greater air access and a boosted tourism sector far outweigh any adverse impact on the revenues of B &amp; I and indeed the results of the crash tourism programme I initiated in 1987 bear this out.  For the first time in the industry's history total tourism revenue is estimated to have topped the £1 billion mark.  More than 2.1 million visitors came to Ireland in 1987 and total out-of-State revenue amounted to over £720 million.  This represented an increase of 12 per cent and 11 per cent respectively, on the previous year.  Arising from this improved performance, Bord Fáilte estimate that 4,000 new jobs were created in the tourism sector in 1987.</P>
    <P>Senators will all be aware of the lengthy and difficult negotiations between B &amp; I management and unions last year which resulted in the submission to me by the board of B &amp; I in December 1987 of a plan of action which had the across-the-board support of the B &amp; I work force. One of the points I insisted on when I met management and unions earlier in the year was that the plan had to be agreed across-the-board because otherwise I could not see any chance of success. I recognise the significant concessions made by the company's work <Col N="2209" /> force in agreeing the plan and the responsible and constructive attitude taken by the B &amp; I unions, under the auspices of ICTU, during these negotiations.  I should also like to acknowledge the contributions made by the Chairman and Managing Director of B &amp; I, Mr. Alex Spain, by the members of the board and by the management of B &amp; I towards achieving the plan of action.</P>
    <P>The broad strategy of the B &amp; I plan is to create a new low cost company able to hold their own in the increasingly competitive passenger and freight markets, through a reorganisation of services, the shedding of more jobs, a reduction in pay and changes in conditions of the remaining employees.  The main features of the plan are as follows: A reduction of 585 in staff numbers from 1,464 to 879; a guarantee of industrial peace from the B &amp; I unions until the end of 1990; an across-the-board pay cut of 5 per cent from 1 January 1988, a pay freeze until June 1989 and extensive changes in working conditions; a reorganisation of car ferry services.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I-Sealink agreement, which expired on 31 December 1987 was not renewed.  The Liverpool service was terminated on 1 January while an independent B &amp; I Rosslare-Pembroke service was resumed at the same time.  The Dublin-Holyhead service has been intensified and now operates on a two round trips per day basis all year round instead of just during the peak season.  The car ferry, the <i>Connacht</i>, will no longer be required and will be sold.</P>
    <P>On the freight side, the B &amp; I-Pandoro UK Trailer Service agreement has been replaced by a new agreement with Pandoro under which B &amp; I no longer will be involved in door-to-door services but will concentrate on the port-to-port business only.  The B &amp; I's European Container Service will be made more cost efficient through the reduction of staff and other costs.</P>
    <P>The implementation costs of the plan, which mainly comprise redundancy compensation payments, are being largely financed by the sale of assets, principally the <i>Connacht.</i>  The bulk of the £11 million <Col N="2210" /> financing requirement for 1988 relates to payments of capital and interest on B &amp; Is existing bank loans and bank overdraft facilities.</P>
    <P>Having noted the company's plan of action and their across-the-board support by the work force, the Government on 11 December 1987 agreed on the basis of the plan to provide the company with up to £11 million in Exchequer equity in 1988.  The Government also decided to review the position not later than the autumn of 1988 on the basis of detailed comparisons of the company's performance against forecasts.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the way in which the 1986 restructuring package, which included Exchequer funding over a four year period, went so badly askew, I am sure Senators will agree that this time we must proceed cautiously as far as the demands on the Exchequer are concerned. It is a reasonable response on the part of the Government to B &amp; I's plan to allocate further funds up to £11 million for 1988 for the company and to review the position later this year on the basis of performance against forecast.  The plan forecasts a small operating loss, that is before financial charges, for 1988.  My Department will be receiving regular and frequent interim reports from B &amp; I during the year and I will be closely monitoring the situation myself.  Indeed the Department are already receiving them.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that the future of B &amp; I cannot be assured by Government support alone.  They are equally dependent on sustained commitment on the part of the management and workforce in the provision of continuous reliable and efficient services.  I trust that the combined efforts of the board, management and staff will ensure that the new strategy of a leaner B &amp; I will mean a cost-efficient operation capable of exploiting new business opportunities and of providing the type of low cost shipping required for the development of our trade, tourism and general economic growth.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the work he put into recognising the problems of B &amp; I and his attitude over the past 12 months to the moneys that were being lost by B &amp; I.  He is making it clear to this semi-State body that he is not going to take any messing. The Minister must admit that if any company set up by the State has been messing since its formation, it is B &amp; I.  With all the money that has gone into this company &mdash; we talk about getting tourists to the country and making sure our tourism is recognised; it is our second biggest industry &mdash; we would be better off if we gave each person coming into the country a voucher to travel some other way and it would be cheaper.  It is unbelievable the way year after year, month after month this company are able to come before the Government and say they have lost this, that or the other.</P>
      <P>I am involved in an area in Cork where in the late seventies and the early eighties a lot of money was invested, in particular in the harbour in Cork, to build a structure that would suit B &amp; I turning around their ships.  This company argued at that time that ships were being built to provide a better service.  They said that if they got this they would make profits.  From 1978 to 1987 they got £70 million.</P>
      <P>It is unbelievable that the company can come back constantly, irrespective of what Government are in power and say to the people that they need extra this or extra that.  It is unbelievable that they can say they need extra ships, they need new ships, they need a particular type of ship because they must go into an area where other ships cannot go, particularly Liverpool. The <i>Connacht</i> is now being sold. The B &amp; I's new action plan since 1979 has been failing constantly.  I realise that there must be a State ferry across the Irish Sea.  Nobody is making any objection to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a deal with Sealink and then the deal is broken.  That is not working. The <i>Connacht</i> was built in 1981 at a cost of £21 million in Verolme Dockyard.  I admit that in another country it could have been built for much less.  That is a <Col N="2212" /> loss to the dockyard and also to B &amp; I. We refurbished the ship in late 1985 and now we are selling it because we do not want it.  If any other company or person announced this they would end up in jail. This is unbelievable.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has put a lot into this and that he spoke with deep concern. I do not think B &amp; I should be subsidised constantly.  We had no messing with Irish Shipping.  We have people going across the Irish Sea at cheaper rates and with fewer losses.  The B &amp; I brought about a situation, particularly in the Cork-Kerry region, where no service was made available. They are getting a very high subsidy every year, irrespective of what Government are in power, and there are no services available to the Cork-Kerry region.</P>
    <P>We decided to get our own ship.  We leased a ship with a once-off payment of £500,000 from the Government of the day, backed up by the Government who came into power last year.  That ship was three months late getting on the market. No marketing had been done.  At the end of the year, with no help from B &amp; I, with a reduction in fares in early June because of the low cost air flights, they totally undermined the situation.  They knew a ferry which was doing well from Cork to Swansea, a ten hour sea journey was in competition with them.  Long sea journeys do not pay.  The B &amp; I said in early 1981 that in no circumstances could they have long sea journeys.</P>
    <P>The price of diesel and oil was enormous at that time and they were right to say they wanted a three and a half hour sea journey, yet some years later they reduced prices and undermined people who were trying to run their enterprise at very low costs with the leasing of a ship from a Polish company, a total investment of £1.1 million and losses at the end of the year of under £300,000.  The Government said: &ldquo;Yes, we must now continue to subsidise them and we are prepared to give them £300,000 this year&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That was one ship provided at a cost of only £300,000.  B &amp; I were supposed to make £500,000 profit in 1986 but they <Col N="2213" /> said: &ldquo;Sorry, we will have a deficit of £7½ million.&rdquo;  How can anbody walk into any Minister's office and say: &ldquo;Certainly, we know we can make a profit in 1986&rdquo; and come along a few months afterwards and say: &ldquo;We lost £6.2 million.&rdquo;  If there was a public inquiry into this there would be a revolution.  It is just not on and I do not see any reason why this should be allowed.  We would be much better off to paint the ships a different colour and start again.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing problem of people working in B &amp; I with no recognition by anyone, including the board, of what is wrong.  Why is there a strong emphasis on saying that a person who goes by plane would not go by ship?  The main reason you go on a ship nowadays is that you bring a car.  You are certainly not going to go on a ship if you do not have to. Those who are emigrating with no money and must get across the Irish Sea at the cheapest cost possible are the only people who travel by sea.  If you have £80 or £90 you can fly there in an hour.</P>
    <P>The only people who want to use a ship now are those who are leaving the country, who cannot get jobs here.  Ships are also used to ferry exports out of this country and to ferry trucks in and out. Early this year there was an ongoing argument in Rosslare with a private company set up by hauliers.  B &amp; I undermined them to make sure they would get back into Rosslare again and bought them off.  What kind of business is going on at all?  We know there will be losses this year and they will never make money.  They do not have to as they will get their cheque at the end, irrespective of who they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect the company have lost money and at the same time they are selling off assets they have only just brought and refurbished.  A particular ship was refurbished late in 1985 to make sure we would get better business going into Liverpool, and now that is <Col N="2214" /> stopped.  In 12 months it has changed. This is not long term policy, or long term thinking.  The plan of action they are talking about is at a high cost to the State.  It would be much better to give every person £20 a head and tell them to get their own form of travel.  That is the point I am trying to make.  Is it worth it?  It will be the very same next year and the year after because it is B &amp; I.</P>
      <P>How is it that other shipping companies can make money?  How is it that a company that was set up in Cork had very little loss and no marketing survey was carried out until April of last year?  They needed only £300,000 more with a ten hour sea journey, pushing a ship at full speed across the Irish Sea.  Every facility possible is being given to B &amp; I.  We could be here for a day or a month and the Minister knows that we would be better off to eliminate the company and start again.</P>
      <P>Why should they sell off the <i>Connacht</i> and yet be in the process of leasing another ship?  Where is the logic there? If the Cathaoirleach were doing that what way would we be?  I do not understand it at all.  Every facility possible is being made available to them.  If I got an explanation I would accept it but no explanation is being given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Government and the Minister on this Bill.  He has certainly put a lot of work into B &amp; I and, indeed, into tourism in general since taking office.  Tourism increased by 11 per cent or 12 per cent last year on the previous year and 2.1 million visited us which meant, in reality, that £720 million came into the country to help our economy and 4,000 new jobs were created.  It took hard work and good negotiating.  The Minister is certainly to be congratulated on that magnificant effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has also waded knee deep into this very difficult B &amp; I problem.  It certainly is a very big problem when you think that in 1985 a package of £38 million was put together by the previous Government for them.  By 1986 they had got £20 million of that and by 1987 they were supposed <Col N="2215" /> to be heading for £500,000 profit.  Instead of going for £500,000 profit they were on their way to a loss of £15 million.  There is no doubt there must have been some very bad management and bad handling.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to have taken this by the scruff of the neck when he called in the board of management and laid it very positively and firmly on the table that they must either come up with a proper plan of management or get out. In plain language that is what the Minister told the board of management.  It was one or the other, no more nonsense.  We have had enough of it and rightly so.  It took a very strong Minister to tell those people that.  I feel he is going to get results.</P>
    <P>They went to work and came back with a plan of action and a complete new restructuring.  They did something which I am sure many of us thought there was no way they would do at the start of that year, that was, to agree to shed up to 600 jobs, take a reduction of 5 per cent in their wages and give an undertaking that there would be no strikes prior to 1990. That is a great commitment from the staff.  We should support this Bill because they seem at last to be saying to themselves: &ldquo;Right, we have got to get the sun out of our eyes; we have got to see reality; the day of living in an airy-fairy world, when we could call on the Exchequer and the Government would not abolish us, is over; this is our final chance; we do it now or it is the end of the road.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>B &amp; I, in spite of the dark picture we can paint about them, seem to have brought about 1½ million people in and out of the country last year, which must be on the plus side for them, about 816,000 passengers and 126,000 motor cars.  We must give them credit for that plus.  I imagine we are all prepared to give this organisation one more chance as they have done a lot of straightening out.  They have put a lot of work into it and they have made sacrifices.</P>
    <P>I would not be totally opposed to the sale of the <i>Connacht</i> since it will finance voluntary redundancies.  There is no way we could expect the Exchequer to fund <Col N="2216" /> this.  They have to fund it out of some of their assets and make what is left work more efficiently and more profitably.  It is worthwhile giving them this try.  I welcome this Bill.  I feel confident that the Minister will not be disappointed after the amount of hard work he has put into trying to make an organisation that seemed to be running like a boat without a rudder, completely out of hand with no control, yield to his strong arm and muscle.  I believe the company will now be a success given this chance.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to give this Bill the sort of welcome which Senators on the other side of the House are giving it. It would be better for B &amp; I and the finances of the nation if the Bill were not passed by this House.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear what Senator Cregan said and I agree with a large amount of it.  This Bill, to a certain extent, exposes the Government's and the Opposition's attitude to a problem of this sort.  I should remind Senator Cregan that many of the criticisms which he was levelling against the history of the company should be laid firmly at the door of the Coalition Government who, time and time again, pumped money into B &amp; I, almost indiscriminately, and did very little about it in effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various ineffectual committees were set up from time to time to keep certain elements of that Coalition Government happy but which, in effect, achieved nothing.  The previous Government continued to put money into B &amp; I and from this Government, in Opposition, one heard very little about withdrawing money from B &amp; I.  It is not really a political point but just a general point to say that roles change very quickly and that people find themselves in awkward situations when they change sides in the House.  I suspect that, despite Senator Cregan's very eloquent speech, saying quite harsh things in that rather deceptive Cork lilt of his, the Fine Gael Party will oppose the Bill with their words but will probably cop out and abstain if it comes <Col N="2217" /> to a vote here as they did in the Dáil.  I sympathise with their situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach may but I do not think I have to, I was just drawing my remarks to a close on that point I feel slightly provoked at this stage to extend them if necessary because I feel they are in order and possibly relevant.  I like the spectacle of the Cathaoirleach defending the Opposition because I feel they need it.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why B &amp; I have escaped the gallows once again.  From my examination of the accounts which are available &mdash; a lot of them are not &mdash; they seem to have a terminal illness.  If you look at the restructuring that has gone on in the past six months, or the proposed restructuring, you will find that it is not as dramatic or fundamental as those who actually promote it maintain.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that there is some sort of misplaced loyalty on the part of the previous Government and this Government towards B &amp; I.  There were good and explicable reasons why the previous Government actually supported B &amp; I.  I can understand the political implications for this Government supporting the company but it would have been much easier and more courageous if the Minister had sat down, looked at the deplorable record of B &amp; I and said: &ldquo;It is now time to stop.&rdquo;  This so-called last chance seems to me less convincing that the last chances we have had before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my belief that B &amp; I should have been closed last May when the Minister took over and this House and the other House should not be asked to give the company another penny.  It is a classical case of a dying company which cannot survive for any possible reason.  I regret this House is now being asked to vote more money for B &amp; I.  It is very difficult to debate this subject in this House because, as the Minister knows, there are no accounts available for B &amp; I for the last two years, so we are actually being asked to vote money to this company <Col N="2218" /> without being able to look at the performance of the company in any sort of detail.  There are only draft accounts available for the last two years.</P>
    <P>We know that B &amp; I for the last ten or 11 years have not been subject to any normal commercial criteria.  It is quite an extraordinary company and it is unbelievable how they are being run and being allowed to run.  The fault for that lies fairly and squarely at the feet of different Governments.  It is inconceivable that in private industry this could have happened, that a public company could have been run on this basis.  The shareholders' funds are, in fact, negative in B &amp; I.  The shareholders of a public company simply would not have tolerated this sort of a situation.  The company would have been closed in about 1976; yet, for some reason which has not been explained, for some spurious loyalty to the national interest, the company have been kept going.  It seems that the Government even last May could have dictated to the unions and the management what was to happen.  It is not beyond the imagination of the Minister and his Department to have a look at this company and say: &ldquo;The following is to happen or you close.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government would not be averse to dictating in situations which suited them.  I am glad to see the Minister has taken over where the Cathaoirleach has left off.  The history of the company is deplorable.  The company have only shown profit for one year in the last ten or 11 years.  The Government in the last nine years invested £73 million in B &amp; I, £31 million of which has come in the last two years.  Far from the situation getting better, for some reason neither the Government nor the Opposition saw the warning signs but actually accelerated the pace of subsidy to B &amp; I in the last two years.  I recognise the willingness of the Minister to tackle this problem.  I feel he is being too lenient and willing to compromise and concede possibly a bit too much in this.  His willingness and the <Col N="2219" /> willingness of the Government in this whole sphere is to be commended, but I feel it would have been better if he had gone the whole hog and just cut it out.</P>
      <P>It has not been recognised in the House today how many attempts were made to solve this particular problem, that this is only, possibly not the last, the latest in a long succession of various attempts which have been set up to look at B &amp; I, suggestions, action plans and other unsuccessful and failed efforts.  We had an interDepartmental committee in 1981 and an operating plan in 1982 which was to be set up to reduce permanently B &amp; I cost structures.  Exactly the opposite, of course, happened and we are now in 1988.</P>
      <P>In 1985 a new managing director and chairman were sent in to restore the company to a profitable operation.  I am not saying his arrival had the opposite effect but certainly from 1985 onwards no such thing happened.  In 1986 and 1987 the profits of B &amp; I have been massively off target, targets which were described by the company as challenging, which, of course, is a euphemism for totally unrealistic. Despite heavy Government injections they were massively off target in 1986 and 1987 and the 1986 restructuring plan as a result turned out to be a complete and utter joke, an unrealistic joke, a farce in financial terms and one which did not work.  The Minister certainly has recognised that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, of which I do not take great pleasure in being a member, is one which is not exactly commendable on this particular issue because that committee have looked into this problem before.  They have produced one report which has been ignored and are in the process now of producing another report which seems to be totally irrelevant, because to be producing a report on B &amp; I now and not to have completed it &mdash; indeed, there was a meeting yesterday and I think a meeting has been called for next week to discuss the B &amp; I and produce a final report on the company after this legislation is <Col N="2220" /> actually passed &mdash; seems quite ridiculous because the whole thing will be irrelevant and redundant by the time this legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>That historical report contains one or two fairly innocuous recommendations for the future but it has no teeth, I would like to ask the Minister to say what status that report will have, whether he will consider it, whether it will be relevant, whether it will gather dust on the shelves and whether it will even be debated in the Dáil or the Seanad because that report is completely irrelevant at this stage seeing that it will be proposing solutions after we have actually passed legislation.</P>
    <P>It is of dubious value at this stage to apportion blame or to give the reasons why B &amp; I has been a complete disaster. In July 1986, two months after the May 1986 restructuring plan, which was to be the solution to the problem once and for all, again, Ryanair changed all that.  The Minister said he thought the deregulation of the airlines, the introduction of Ryanair and the cutting of air fares, has been exaggerated a bit.  I am not sure whether that is true but I know that in 1986, according to official statistics, 196,000 passengers moved from sea to air and that 31,000 less cars travelled on B &amp; I.  That is an enormous figure.  It was certainly a contributory figure to knocking the 1986 targets and the restructuring plan for six.</P>
    <P>It seems strange that at that time while the Minister's predecessor was pumping money into B &amp; I he was deregulating air fares.  He must have know that these two actions were, in fact, contradictory and that doing one would be to the detriment of the other and all he was really doing was tipping the scales a little in the other direction and creating a large problem for himself on the sea routes in the near future.  Nevertheless, this is what happened. Ryanair appear to have pinched an enormous number of passengers and it appears that that will continue.  That is not to ignore that efforts were made, that the staff were reduced by approximately 500 in that year and that costs were cut by £5.5 million.  The Minister attributed <Col N="2221" /> some of the setbacks in 1986 and 1987 to the strikes.  That is probably unrealistic. If that were true, it would only be a temporary problem.  The strikes were short-lived and I do not think they would be responsible for a very significant fall in profits.</P>
    <P>In late 1987 we eventually got the new action plan which the Minister has required from the company &mdash; after he had given them £8 million to tide them over.  That plan of action seems to have been an honest attempt at cutting the company to a manageable size but no more than that.  It sets targets of £2 million profit over the next four years, which works out at about £0.5 million per annum, having predicted that it will show a small loss initially.  Although there are some serious efforts to tackle the problems, like the closure of the Dublin-Liverpool routes, the large number of redundancies, the promises of industrial peace in 1990, the 5 per cent reduction in wages and a wage freeze until then, I do not believe there is any reason for believing that this will finally put the company into profit, because the company have never worked under normal commercial standards.</P>
    <P>Instead of saying the company are being monitored very closely and will be reviewed again in the autumn, the first thing the Minister should say is that there will be no more money forthcoming whatever happens.  One of the principal problems with B &amp; I over the years has been that they have known full well, subconsciously or consciously it does not matter, that whatever losses they made the Government would bail them out. The Government have bailed them out and continue to bail them out.  Despite the fact that there have been scenes of drama over the last six months, the message of financial rectitude has got through to management and workers but I believe behind that, there is still a belief that whatever trouble they get into there is still the Government standing behind them to put further funds into the company. The first thing the Government can say is, &ldquo;Come what may, no more money. You are now on your own and if you do <Col N="2222" /> not work it out this time, you sink.&rdquo;  That is what would happen in private enterprise and that is what should happen here.  Exchequer funds in the past have acted as a disincentive to profit and made this company into a charity subsidised by the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>There is danger in the deregulation argument.  The Minister and I would be in disagreement about its significance but one thing we can be certain about is that air fares will continue to come down, competition will increase in the future and under EC rules, deregulation will intensify.  This cannot augur well for B &amp; I.  It means either they will have to reduce their own costs, which would be very difficult, or they will have to give up the ghost.  Over-capacity in freight on the Irish Sea will continue; that is inevitable.</P>
    <P>The very marginal profit projections made by B &amp; I in the 1987 plan, and the so-called challenging targets, will mean that the company are still exposed to world economic movements for which they have no responsibility and for which to a large extent they cannot be blamed. If the company are exposed to these world economic movements, for instance, and interest rates go up, the company's debt servicing bill goes up dramatically with a debt like that and tiny profit projections as a result leave very little room for manoeuvre.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that B &amp; I are simply part of a declining industry, part of an unprofitable industry, and it is realistic for the Government to close them down and leave it to private enterprise to fill that gap.  Where there are profits to be made on freight or passengers services on the Irish Sea, you can be absolutely certain that private industry and private enterprise will spot them and take them up immediately but where there are no profits to be made, I cannot see why the State should subsidise these services.  It seems that B &amp; I have had too long a lease of life and should not be given another chance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill and welcome the opportunity to express my views on this important matter, not <Col N="2223" /> because of the benefits that will accrue to the area I represent, but because I believe the Minister and the Government have the nation behind them in this positive approach.  Therefore, it is essential that a fairly wide range of opinion be expressed here on the introduction of this Bill. Everybody knows the Minister has approached this problem in a very positive way.  He is doing a man's job handling a difficult situation.  The public have the impression that B &amp; I passenger and freight services have ground to a halt.</P>
      <P>Coming from a county that lost its railway service, I could not agree with Senator Ross.  If we had to rewrite the history of the railways the easiest option for the Minister would be to chop.  I am glad that he is not taking that option. There is much more at stake here than survival, the conditions of pay or the bad performance of B &amp; I.  The issue is much bigger than that.  I would have liked the Minister, Deputy Wilson, to have been in charge when consideration was being given to the future of the railways that served my part of the country.  Therefore, I believe I am qualified to some extent to make a contribution on this Bill in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The real difficulty I see is the lack of success by B &amp; I.  The money, whether it is £9 million, £17 million or £38 million is important, but bad performance is much more serious.  The Minister and the Government acknowledge that we are an island and must have a good efficient passenger service under our own control. They could not look at it any other way because we are dependent on that kind of transport.  The Government's initiative, and the Minister's personal contribution, are timely.  The nation is very interested in how well the Minister succeeds on this occasion because everybody who pays tax is contributing to this company to some extent.  Many people in the tourist business are depending on B &amp; I's success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, my part of the world will not benefit to any great extent from the success of B &amp; I, but we will pay if they fail.  If they are successful the benefits will accrue to the nation and to the <Col N="2224" /> tourist industry.  I do not want to sound too critical, but the part of the country that benefits from heavy subsidisation and capital intensive input stands to win if B &amp; I succeed in bringing many more tourists into the country.</P>
    <P>I want this package to work and I want the Government incentives to be accepted by the management and staff of B &amp; I.  They would be foolhardy to expect the nation to continue to think they have a God-given right to be subsidised, and that they should be nurtured and kept in existence at all costs.  That is not a practical approach.  In the agreement, of which the Minister has given us details, it is proposed that there will be a reduction of 585 in staff, from 1,464 to 897.  In terms of their performance B &amp; I freight service are not understaffed.  I say that knowing only about the bottom line of their achievements.  In the circumstances, and looking at the trading and working of that company, to be getting a 5 per cent increase and to have the Government pick up the tab, is not bad.</P>
    <P>The Minister is on the right course. The majority of the people are strongly behind him.  I would not go as far as to say the Minister should be waiting at the end of the term with an axe, because nobody performs very well if the hatchet is waiting to drop.  The Minister has adopted the proper approach by offering these incentives.  He hopes his efforts will be recognised by workers and management and that they will achieve the necessary results.  That is encouraging him and the Government to pursue this course.  I am 100 per cent behind the initiative taken by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I ask the workers, the management, and B &amp; I passenger and freight services to think of parts of this country that will not benefit from their business.  In Donegal we introduced a ferry service between Moville and Glasgow.  It has to be sustained on an economic basis on a route where there was very low traffic and on a seasonal basis.  That service was difficult to sustain, but they had no Government subsidies of any kind.  If part of the contribution made by the nation to B &amp; I went towards the retention of that service <Col N="2225" /> we would be very happy.  The tourism industry would develop in a county that has a third of our beaches and has great development potential.  We are not getting any of the cake that will accrue from the input of these millions of pounds. The Minister is aware of this because he represents an area that has not come off as well as it should.  He knows what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the overall view is that this company is important to the nation. I hope the Minister is successful in establishing a clear understanding with the management and staff of B &amp; I and that they are not going to hold the nation to ransom because, if they do not perform well and achieve results, the Minister has the power and the intention of providing this country with a good passenger ferry and freight service.  It is possible to achieve these goals if B &amp; I workforce and management work together.  The Minister's approach is a positive one.  I am sincere when I express the hope that this offer to the workers and B &amp; I will be successful.  It is too important not to be a success.  We support the Minister's efforts to discourage workers to believe there is no end to the State's input because to believe otherwise would be folly.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his positive approach.  It is what we expect from him.  We are lucky to have somebody who has the muscle needed to achieve results in this difficult area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address a few points in this Bill.  Listening to the debate and looking at the history of B &amp; I, gives me no sense of joy or surprise.  The Minister heard contributions made by Senator Cregan and Senator Ross.  If one were to address oneself to the financial implications of the package to support B &amp; I, one would be obliged to examine the history of the company, how they functioned under various Governments, and how they performed under earlier packages which had been funded by the taxpayer.  If we do that, we must question why any Government at any time should take on board the problems that have been forefront in B &amp; I and still assist <Col N="2226" /> them by providing State resources, which are strictly curtailed and audited.</P>
      <P>We are going through a phase in our development which insists that every pound spent by Government must have a pay back.  Since the Minister was generous enough to put £11 million additional equity into the company this year, obviously there must have been a justification for it.  One could say that the policy of fiscal rectitude had ended if one were to look at the financial implications alone, and compare them with previous plans and losses that accrued.</P>
      <P>There is a small dimension to this problem which is not being touched on, although it was touched on briefly by Senator McGowan who comes from a county which needs and hopes for tourist development as does my own county of Tipperary.  These are areas to which B &amp; I can make a major contribution.  If one was to apply fiscal rectitude to the development of this country, many of the infrastructural facilities we now enjoy and that the State has supported could not be maintained.  It is difficult when looking at balance sheets to quantify the advantages of State support in some of these areas which are not profit making in the true sense of the word, but which are essential in the overall economic development of the country.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the company in 1965 were &ldquo;to provide and develop a modern, efficient, profitable national and comprehensive surface transport system to and from Ireland.&rdquo;  That is what the company thought their brief was then.  They talked about efficiency, for which the Minister has been striving &mdash; I congratulate him for the way he tried to achieve this by negotiation, consultation and ultimatum &mdash; and they also considered they had a national responsibility which is one of the reasons, probably the only reason, this Government, or any previous Government, had for continuing to put public money into this company when obviously there was no payback in the balance sheet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the country as a whole, there was an obvious pay back.  The Minister quantified this today, when he indicated that <Col N="2227" /> the total tourism revenue into this country last year amounted to £720 million.  It is obvious that B &amp; I have played their role in accruing some of that income.  We know that competitiveness in the area of surface transport and that the new competitiveness in air transport makes that much more difficult for B &amp; I to achieve.  In 1987 they helped the country to reach that figure of £720 million.  We must not disregard our responsibilities as an island nation.  We have to provide our own surface transport system.  It is the responsibility of the State not alone to ensure the economic development of this country but that we have the means to transport essential commodities when so required.</P>
    <P>In their second report of 1978 the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies stated that they felt &ldquo;B &amp; I included broader obligations in its corporate aims&rdquo;.  They were talking about the social obligation B &amp; I have to the community.  That puts in context the obligation the State has to a company like B &amp; I. CIE, Aer Lingus and all the other transport authorities, have a social dimension and a national economic dimension.  One cannot merely look at the balance sheet to justify State funding in this area because of the other dimension. It was right that this Government and the last Government should set targets for the company and differentiate in those targets, the economic and profitable areas, the capitalistic outlook on what their role is, and then have a socialist attitude to their social obligations, and there are many.  This is recognised by the company, and certainly it was recognised by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  That puts all the figures in context.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of reference to some of the problems that have arisen in the company.  The Minister himself mentioned that the difficulties they had with the company's poor performance &ldquo;was self inflicted wounds of industrial disputes.&rdquo;  Nobody denies that there were some industrial disputes, but <Col N="2228" /> in my experience there are rarely industrial disputes which are not, and cannot, be laid at the door of management.  On this occasion management, apart from recent management, seems to have got off scot free in any reference to previous decisions of the company involving the acquisition and the provision of docking facilities in other countries, and probably an over-capacity now, which necessitated capital investment by the company.  One could question how much of that docking facility or port facilities elsewhere, particularly in the UK, are still being used by the company, for what purpose and what return on that investment is forthcoming. It would be nice to be able to read that in a balance sheet and see if those management decisions were justified.</P>
    <P>There were also Government decisions about the building and acquisition of facilities for the B &amp; I.  I do not think anybody in this House would deny that there had to be political and social justification for some of those decisions. Nobody would question the fact that this was of benefit to the areas involved in the assembly of those ships because it generated employment and the State benefited by way of PAYE, tax and so on.</P>
    <P>If one is to make those kinds of political and management decisions for electoral or any other reason, there must and should be an overall long-term plan as to the future use of the product being assembled.  This has been borne out by the fact that we have decided to sell the <i>Connacht</i> to repay some of the workforce &mdash; we are literally asking them to buy out their jobs.  No wonder there may have been industrial disputes in the past.  All the sacrifices had been made by the workforce &mdash; the number of job losses were agreed after protracted discussions, dialogue and never ending meetings.  These problems between the management and the workforce were aired on television and in the media every day.  What other work force in this country would have agreed to the decimination of their numbers, to a reduction of 5 per cent in pay, to the freezing of any other pay up to <Col N="2229" /> 1989, and a complete change in working conditions?</P>
    <P>All these areas of industrial relations had been achieved in the past by negotiation and agreement with other managements.  No wonder there was a problem. Nobody is saying that all of these things are not necessary if the enterprise is to succeed or survive in the future. That is why, in the final analysis, the union were responsible enough to accept a most unpalatable package for them. Their brief is to try to foster employment in a particular company whether it is semi-State, State, or private and to ensure that the working conditions of their employees are protected and index linked to buffer them against whatever might happen in the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister paid a special tribute to those employees because they have made all the sacrifices.  Nobody denies that in the past, in this area alone, there were unusual work practices to say the least. They had to be tackled.  The Minister had the co-operation of the unions in tackling them.  In the overall context we have to look at what the Government are trying to do with what is essentially a national carrier &mdash; a surface carrier &mdash; with an obligation to the State to show a profit, if possible, to be efficient, to give employment, to protect the tourist industry and the freight service.  That is why I have no qualms about supporting the Minister's efforts in this regard in ensuring that the State is prepared to put up the equity.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with asking for a report and dialogue on the company's performance.  You will find in research, especially from the figures before us, that the workforce will play their role.  They have been the major losers.  It is tragedy that we have to sell off assets to buy out men's jobs which were originally negotiated and agreed as being necessary. That gives an indication of my attitude towards some of the management of this company.  I know Mr. Spain made great efforts to turn the ship around, so to speak, and became unpopular in the process. He realised that he had a brief which made it very difficult for the old system <Col N="2230" /> to continue <i>ad infinitum</i> and that we would not pass legislation which would indemnify poor work practices or inefficient management.  In the area included in the new project I was delighted to see that an effort will be made to exploit new business opportunities.  If that is not done this company will fail because there is a limitation in the area of tourism with all the competition which arises.  The success of this company, restructured as it is, will depend on a new dynamic management which will exploit new business opportunities not only between Ireland and the UK but between Ireland and the Continent. There is a lot of movement of people, of motor vehicles and of freight between Ireland and the Continent and that is where the future of the company lies.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made great efforts and he should be commended for those efforts.  The fact that he had to come before the House and be taken to task by people who are more obsessed with fiscal rectitude than others makes it difficult to balance the job we are trying to do.  The Minister has the support of our party in endeavouring to ensure that we have a national surface carrier which can give a social dimension to its enterprise as well as an economic one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I too want to join in the compliments to the Minister.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies under the previous Administration as well as the present one, I can vouch for his exceptional interest in his portfolio in Opposition and obviously now in Government also.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us is not an easy task for the Minister.  He does not underestimate the scale of the task facing the company. For several years past the B &amp; I has been a very troubled company.  It is right and proper that Members of the Oireachtas should have the opportunity to scrutinise its operations in a critical way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The B &amp; I have been a loss making company for many years.  Nonetheless they made a significant contribution in <Col N="2231" /> the area of passenger services and, therefore, contributed in a positive way to tourism.  They provided valuable freight services and, moreover, over a long period they provided valuable jobs.  Right now, it is necessary, in the harsh realities of the eighties, to implement a programme of retrenchment.</P>
    <P>The achievements of the company have been effected at a price to the taxpayer. Looking to the future, the equity injection, which is the subject of the Bill, is essential at this point in time.  I share the view that there is a need for an Irish-owned cross-channel ferry service for strategic reasons.  It is important, in terms of national strategy, to have an Irish-owned ferry service.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledges that the deregulation of air fares has presented greater difficulties for the company, but that is not the sole answer.  The Minister has to take into account the national view in looking at the transport part of this portfolio which is obviously linked to tourism.  That means he has to look at all forms of transport.  The deregulation of air fares has greatly increased the market for air travel and has contributed, in a very positive way, to the growth in tourism into the country.  In other words, the low cost strategy that resulted from the deregulation of the air fares has greatly expanded tourism.  This has been an important component in the Minister's courageous and imaginative plan which he implemented on coming into office to tackle the tourism area.  The evidence is there, with more than £1 billion earned from tourism in 1987 for the first time.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I have to face increased competition because of air competition which means that they will have to redouble their efforts in the areas of marketing. New marketing strategies will clearly be necessary.  Indeed, during 1987 the actual reduction in the losses encountered was due, to an extent, to the response in introducing imaginative and innovative strategies by the B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>Of course it is tough on the workforce and difficult that there should be such a reduction in staff numbers but really <Col N="2232" /> there was no choice.  The Minister has rightly said that, notwithstanding the exceptional efforts of the workforce and their trade unions to face reality, their efforts were adversely affected by self-inflicted strikes in late 1986 and early 1987.  The plan now in place provides for a period of peace for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I want to make one further point which has to do with relating performance to results.  I warmly welcome the undertaking now for the provision of interim results by the company so that performance can be measured against forecasts. These regular and frequent interim reports are necessary for political decisions on the company.  Indeed, I would urge the Minister to apply the same regular reporting arrangements to any other State-sponsored body under his control and to encourage his Cabinet colleagues to do likewise.  As a member of successive joint committees and commercial State-sponsored bodies I have noted over the years that one of the more serious drawbacks in the performance of these companies is the delay that has occurred in the provision of accounts by the companies which, in turn, delayed remedial action which was so often necessary. It has not been unusual in the past to find a period of 18 months elapsing before the publication of accounts.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House.  I support the compliments expressed in respect of the workforce and it is also fair to compliment Alex Spain and his board colleagues who have had to cope with an extremely difficult situation in recent years.  I also share the Minister's view that innovative and imaginative strategies will be necessary to cope with competition in the period ahead.  It will not be an easy task.  There are no easy answers.</P>
    <P>The plan is not the total solution.  The response from management and workforce alike must be to provide, as the Minister puts it, a continuous, reliable and efficient range of services.  The practices of the best managed companies indicate that value for money is the key criterion and if that is there and the quality of the product is there and the appropriate <Col N="2233" /> service is provided for customers they will use the services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this Bill.  As the Minister stated, we are talking only about the enactment of the legislation in order to allow the money promised under the plan to become available to B &amp; I.  However, the issue that the previous speakers have been addressing is the history to date of B &amp; I and the Minister's future plans.</P>
      <P>It must be clear that the plan being enacted by B &amp; I is the last effort to enable them to get their house in order. They had many difficulties down through the years and considerable sums of money have been invested in the company. They have run up many extraordinary losses.  It is time for everybody to realise that a more responsible attitude must be taken not just at Government level toward B &amp; I but within the company towards its own future.  The day of reckoning has long gone.  We are approaching the problems of the company from a commercial point of view and I certainly welcome that.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross made some valid points when he discussed what the future of B &amp; I should or should not be.  It is clear there are still two options the Government should consider.  Option number one which Senator Ross proposed, and indeed quite a number of people would be of this opinion also is that we should cut our losses and let B &amp; I float peacefully away.  That proposal is attractive and it would certainly be proposed by many people who fear that the future of B &amp; I will be like its past, with many platitudes and good intentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other option, the option being proposed by the Minister and the company in their plans &mdash; one to which I would give serious consideration &mdash; is to enact the plan which would allow B &amp; I to get their house in order, improve their services, improve their cost effectiveness and get into a profit-making situation. There is a wealth of experience in the B &amp; I company.  They have a dedicated workforce whose strike record, apart <Col N="2234" /> from 1986, has been more than favourable in comparison with other companies. The company has tremendous assets. When you consider the company's experience in the business over many years, the workforce which has had a good history of labour relations and the assets, they must be allowed this one last chance.</P>
    <P>We cannot, of course, gloss over the huge losses that have occurred in B &amp; I down through the years.  As Senator Ferris stated, B &amp; I are significantly different from other shipping companies in that they have a serious social consideration. That was referred to in the last report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee when it stated that its obligations went beyond those of a modern shipping company which, of course, would be to be efficient, profitable and comprehensive.</P>
    <P>The obligations of B &amp; I include social obligations which have placed certain restriction on them and have also increased their losses.  We must clearly identify these losses in the overall losses of B &amp; I and we must accept a certain amount of social losses.  In the past we could identify those social losses but from now on there can be little, if any, room for this type of social loss.  Some of the decisions that obviously led to those losses were questionable, perhaps they were wrong, but we must be prepared to learn from them and ensure that it does not happen again.</P>
    <P>When discussing B &amp; I one often gets the impression that it is like a floating CIE, and they face the same type of problems.  If we are ordering that they provide a comprehensive service in areas which are not always profitable we must be prepared to take some of the consequences that will accrue.  Companies which have an element of social obligation, from time to time, adopt a very liberal attitude in what they can and cannot do and the losses they believe the Government will accept.  From now on we will have to tighten up in this area as well.</P>
    <P>I mentioned labour relations and I think it was one of the points illustrated in the Oireachtas Joint Committee report. <Col N="2235" /> From 1968 to 1985 the company lost only 14 days in industrial disputes.  That is something which is very favourable and commendable and is the type of record that will be needed under the new plan if the company is to survive.  In 1986 a disastrous strike cost the company £5 million.  That is something which can never be repeated and when you consider that £5 million as part of the overall losses of the company over the past number of years you would have to regard it as the most serious period in the history of B &amp; I.  It is a period that cannot be explained away in a debate here this morning.  It was a strike which had many angles to it.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the plan now accepted by the Government and the unions would seem to indicate that such a scenario will not occur again.  We must be aware that the unions in the latest plan have made a major sacrifice in accepting the cutbacks in staff, the 5 per cent wage reduction and a wage freeze.  It is a good sign that unions and workers in a semi-State organisation are prepared to accept that the day of the free lunch is over.  They are prepared to accept that their company has to operate in a more commercially-orientated fashion in the years ahead.  I hope this kind of thinking will not stop in the B &amp; I but will spread to other organisations in the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the liberalisation of air fares, and its effect on the B &amp; I.  He rightly stated that, from time to time, B &amp; I explain away their losses too easily by referring to the numbers lost to the air travel trade.  It is to be welcomed that the air travel trade has become more accessible to the general public.  That is a matter on which I anticipate my colleague Senator Daly will be commenting.  B &amp; I's response to the air fares deregulation was very slow.  They should have been able to anticipate it earlier and acted accordingly.</P>
    <P>The two other shipping companies which operate within the Thirty-two Counties &mdash; Sealink and Belfast car ferries &mdash; had to operate at the same time <Col N="2236" /> and under the same pressures as B &amp; I but, because they are private companies and had to be more commercial, they reacted in a more effective manner to the threat from the airlines.  We should not forget the relative success of Sealink and Belfast car ferries in comparison with B &amp; I in dealing with the air fares deregulation factor.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that air fares will remain at their present level and perhaps decrease further.  Many more airline companies will be willing to operate the Ireland-England route.  Because of that B &amp; I must react now and plan in advance rather than talk about it afterwards and react at that stage.  I welcome the recent efforts of B &amp; I to attract more passengers. During the past few months it would appear that they were running a high powered media campaign to this effect.  I hope it will be successful.  It appears to be effective and they are getting the message across very well in the newspapers and on radio in particular and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There is a need also for new ideas and new vision within B &amp; I.  Senator Ferris referred to the fact that they should be looking beyond the Britain to Ireland routes to continental Europe in order to run their services.  If other ferries find it profitable and are interested in these routes, there is no reason B &amp; I should close off that option.  There are certain cartels and agreements in operation but B &amp; I should look further afield for new routes in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Another area that is becoming popular in the tourism sector and which they should consider is the cruise line area. East European countries are trying to develop a major industry out of their cruise ships and they are operating out of Britain very economically and efficiently. Some of the conditions of work would not be acceptable to the people in B &amp; I but, due to earlier retirements and people wishing to travel more, the tourism industry is becoming more important. When we see B &amp; I selling off a ship which they built at enormous cost a number of years ago in order to pay off some of the redundancy package, it is a <Col N="2237" /> pity they would not consider alternative uses for this ship.</P>
    <P>The plan agreed by the unions and the Minister is to be commended.  I would like to refer to the employment in the plan.  B &amp; I have agreed to reduce the workforce from 1,464 to 661.  That will make the company more effective and more efficient.  After the redundancies, the shore based personnel in relation to the on-ship based personnel will be greater.  Those are figures I wonder about.  Why is there a need for such a high number of shore based personnel? Out of a workforce of 1,464, 661 were marine personnel and 803 were shore based personnel, and after the redundancies the shore based personnel still outnumber the marine personnel.  Perhaps the Minister can give an explanation for that when he is summing up.</P>
    <P>Other issues were raised in relation to B &amp; I.  One of these issues is the publication of their accounts.  They have always been a few years behind but we must accept that companies cannot bring out their annual accounts as quickly as we would like.  It would be welcome if accounts were available on a six monthly basis so that the public and Members of the Oireachtas would know whether they were keeping up to their targets.  When we hear in 1988 that the 1985 figures were very far out it is little consolidation and does not give us time to react as we should.  I hope figures will be available earlier and that on two or three occasions throughout the year we will have an opportunity to discuss how the company are going and react accordingly.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals made as part of the plan was that the company should split up into a holding company and an operating company.  That is good in that it would allow the losses to be taken care of by the holding company and through the operating company we would be able to identify how the company are going on a day-to-day basis and on an annual basis and whether they are operating on an efficient basis.  As part of our plan it is necessary to keep a close watch on them and to have the figures available to <Col N="2238" /> us so that we can judge whether the plan is working as it should.</P>
    <P>Another item which needs to be discussed in relation to B &amp; I is the difficulties they face as a result of the UK berthing facilities.  The Dún Laoghaire berthing facilities provide unrestricted facilities to B &amp; I's major competitor, Sealink.  However, the facilities available to B &amp; I in Britain would not seem to be as favourable.  I do not know why, but I hope that the position will change.  What B &amp; I allow to their competitors should be allowed to B &amp; I in Britain and perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</P>
    <P>I have very little further to say in relation to B &amp; I.  We have been far from happy with the performance of B &amp; I down through the years and, while there is a certain doubt about their ability to see through the plan of action agreed with the Government, we must allow them one last chance to do so.  It would be too easy to let the company sail away into oblivion.  We need a national shipping service.  B &amp; I have all the necessary facilities provided they act more commercially in the future and provided a very close watch is kept on the company by the Government and the Oireachtas. I hope, and it is absolutely vital, that the plan works.  The unions have made sacrifices on behalf of the workforce.  The Government, on behalf of the taxpayer, have made further sacrifices in order to give B &amp; I a chance to continue.  I hope they use this last opportunity wisely and that when we discuss B &amp; I again in this House we will have seen the company go from strength to strength, that we will have seen a fall-off in what they formally call these extraordinary losses.  In the present economic climate no company, be it State or semi-State, can be allowed to go unfettered.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by wishing B &amp; I success in the years ahead.  I hope that they will stick strictly to be plan; if they do I am confident that it will work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the previous speakers and welcome the Minister here this afternoon.  We support his <Col N="2239" /> efforts in this particularly difficult situation that confronts his Department, and indeed the Government.  We cannot debate the B &amp; I issue in isolation.  We cannot &mdash; and the Minister has made this abundantly clear in recent debates with the company &mdash; debate the performance of this company as a commercial operation because, of course, the preservation of a national sea carrier is fundamental to the whole operation of industry generally and particularly the tourism industry.  For this reason I think it is opportune that the Minister has taken the direction envisaged in this legislation to again throw, as it were, a lifeline to B &amp; I to say that the Government are still satisfied that all being well and having put their house in order B &amp; I can do the job they were orginally intended to do for the taxpayers of this country.</P>
      <P>It is abundantly clear from the Minister's comments here this morning and from other contributions that from now on B &amp; I cannot be debated solely in the context of commercial viability.  If that were the case the company &mdash; and even the slimmed down B &amp; I &mdash; could not be allowed to continue to survive.  If we are asking the company to respond to, for example, the recent onslaught of air fare cuts and to play their part in the Government's strategy of making surface transport into this country accessible to every tourist, the B &amp; I's continued existence would have to be focused in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy for people to say that B &amp; I should be profitable and making a lot of money and so on but, of course, in the total context of the modern tourism debate the existence of surface carriers with State support, such as B &amp; I, is an essential ingredient in the Government's tourism plan.  In the face of evidence of the initiatives of recent days, the Department of Tourism and Transport and Bord Fáilte have indicated to us that they will focus in a considerable way in the coming year on the British market.  Everybody who is interested in tourism would agree that is the primary market on which to focus, but it can only be done if there is an attractive surface package available to <Col N="2240" /> the UK tourists.  They are not by and large interested in flying to this country. If they are going to come here they will bring their own cars and trailers and as a consequence we must be capable of offering them an attractive package on a carrier.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to have a price cutting war in the skies; we must respond to it on the seas as well.  That has knock-on effects.  It has certainly knock-on effects on the company's ability to be profitable. We cannot have it both ways.  It is similar to the CIE debates in that respect.  I entirely concur with the comments made here this morning that there was a great need for B &amp; I to slim down and to endeavour to at least address themselves to the problems of ongoing losses.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied &mdash; and indeed the public generally are satisfied &mdash; with the new slimmed down B &amp; I which can now probably offer a better service than they offered three years ago with twice the staff.  I am aware that they had at least one other ship operational but to go from a staffing level of 1,400 odd down to 600 odd and still be satisfied they can provide a service is commentary in itself and does not require any further examination. It begs the question as to what the other 800 staff were doing over the past couple of years?  There was no price war between the airlines and B &amp; I had a virtual monopoly, they had a cartel on the Irish Sea and they still could not make money.  Obviously the Minister has addressed himself to that question and has satisfied himself that it still can be done on the basis of a good mix, of being commercially aware and still filling the social vacuum to which Senator Ferris referred.  Of course, there is definitely a very great social factor involved.  It is all very well for people to say here that B &amp; I have had their day and that we should throw the service open to commercial considerations and so on, but the fact is that if we had a privately owned commercial operation at present on the Irish Sea there would be nothing to stop them from at any time, for example, now during the tourist season, saying: &ldquo;it looks like it is not going to work, it looks <Col N="2241" /> like we are not going to make any money so we will close down the line.&rdquo;  It would be the death knell of many tourism resorts in this country in the coming year if that were the case.  There is an onus on the Government to ensure that there is a continuity of service.</P>
    <P>Certainly B &amp; I have provided us well in the past and despite the fact that there has been many jaundiced comments on their activities here this morning, it cannot all be apportioned to the work force.  In acutal fact I would suspect that a relatively minor amount of it can be apportioned to them.  We would have to definitely focus on the empire building programmes of the late seventies and early eighties and we in the Cork port particularly suffered from those grandiose plans of the late seventies where the harbour board were exhorted to go to Ringaskiddy and spend millions of pounds of taxpayers' money in building one of the finest marine based facilities in this country.  Almost in a nonchalant way just as the development was about to finish B &amp; I said they changed their minds and were not coming into Cork anymore and left the entire facility standing there high and dry.  It required, as the Minister is well aware, local initiative to find another ferry service to fill the vacuum on the southern corridor to service what is the biggest tourism region in this country &mdash; where in excess of 30 per cent of the national tourism plant is located.  Suddenly we found that we had no supply or no access to the UK mainland by virtue of the fact that B &amp; I decided overnight they had made a mistake and it was not opportune for them any longer to go into the southern region, so they just pulled back to Rosslare.  That is the kind of lack of planning that has left B &amp; I where they are today.  The Minister is in a Macbeth like situation, he is in so deep that he has to go on rather than go back.  His reaction in that particular scene has been laudable and we in the Houses of the Oireachtas will have to examine the situation on the basis of our national responsibility and the responsibility that shipping line has to the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2242" /> Now there is a very positive and cohesive effort being made.  We have had a signalled response from the union and they are to be complimented as it cannot have been easy for the union executive to accept the kind of medicine that was being meted out &mdash; the responsibility cannot be laid solely at their door &mdash; to put the company in a fighting condition. The company will have to do a lot more in the whole area of marketing in the light of the Minister's examination of tourism policy and, particularly, of the Bord Fáilte policy in future.  Cognisance will have to be taken of the significant role that B &amp; I will have to play in that total scenario in the future.  We cannot have tourism planning in isolation in the future.  We cannot have the airlines doing one thing, the sea carriers doing something else and Bord Fáilte doing something else, which in effect in what they have been doing in the past.  They have all been operating in their own little vacuums and ignoring the others as if they did not exist.  The one thing this Minister has done is pulled these groups together into a cohesive unit.  When we go abroad in future to sell &ldquo;Ireland Limited&rdquo;&mdash; and limited it is &mdash; it will be on the basis that we have addressed ourselves successfully to this very vexed problem of access transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be aware, now that the winds of change are blowing in B &amp; I, that there is still a need to examine the individual performance of the various ships.  That has been commented on.  I am a director of the Cork-Swansea Ferry Company.  We distributed questionaires to our own passengers last year and many of their comments were along the lines that it was a pleasure to travel on a ferry service that seemed to be concerned about the well-being of the travelling passenger.  Quite often that was only an aside on the B &amp; I ships in the past.  I have travelled on their various services over the years and certainly that was the case.</P>
    <P>There was a blissful indifference to the problems passengers might have on most B &amp; I ships.  Now that we seem to be back on the rails I hope there will be a recognition of the need to ensure that the <Col N="2243" /> company will operate in a responsible fashion.  The shrug of the shoulders the &ldquo;too bad&rdquo; attitude if the passenger is not happy must end.  Sometimes when on board you found your cabin was not available or the restaurant had closed because they felt like closing it or quite often you walked upstairs at night to find the bar had closed.  That kind of thing is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I would not like this comment to be misconstrued as a general comment on the calibre of the Irish workforce, but it bears comment that we could bring in a crew from abroad, a Polish crew, and get this consistent comment about the courtesy and the concern of the staff on board that ship for the well-being of the passengers, which is fundamental to the whole well being of the company.</P>
    <P>Other areas were touched on by Senator Bradford and I will not repeat them.  There is obviously a new era of cruise shipping coming to the fore.  The eastern bloc countries have proved there is a vacuum in this area.  It is debatable whether the type of ship than B &amp; I at present have in their fleet is suitable for cruise work.  We should look at this opportunity in the future because there is no point in talking about tourism being the biggest single industry in the world into the next century if we are not prepared for it.</P>
    <P>There is little point in operating daily services if a service every second day in the winter might suffice.  The concept of cruising to the Canaries or wherever could be investigated.  We are not that far away from sunnier climates that cruising could not be considered.  There are other aspects, for example, the company of which I am a director made sizeable profits last year in reacting to things like jazz festivals, rugby international weekends and so on.  I think B &amp; I must use imagination in the marketplace in their efforts to become competitive and ultimately to become at some stage in the future a profitable operation.</P>
    <P>There is room for everybody on the Irish Sea.  I would not want to think the ongoing nature of Government subsidy <Col N="2244" /> would be used as a kind of a crude device to scuttle every other ship on the Irish Sea.  I was a little disconcerted by Mr. Spain's comments on a recent television programme when he said confidently that &ldquo;his company would be the only operator on the Irish Sea at the end of this year.&rdquo; I do not think that kind of comment is worthy of the Chairman of a semi-State company because he is operating from the high ground of ongoing Government subsidy.  That should not be the ambition of anybody.  I hope there is room in the marketplace for everybody.  We should be striving for efficiency and effectiveness and a return for the taxpayers' sizeable commitment that has been the Government's support for B &amp; I over the past number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Callaghan in clearing this question about how much the employees contributed to the near demise of the company. The situation is quite the opposite. Newspaper reports referred regularly to the troubled shipping line but their reports of corporate review and statements always avoided an examination of B &amp; I's history.  Had they troubled themselves to examine the history and causes of the poor financial situation in B &amp; I, there is no doubt they would have got back to the point where the Irish Government actually acquired B &amp; I in the early sixties.  The stated reason given for the acquisition was to achieve a greater measure of influence over cross-Channel transport. Against that essentially strategic objective, the company was given a mandate to operate in a commercial manner. There is a slight contradiction in wanting a greater measure of influence over the cross-Channel transport and, at the same time wanting to operate in a commercial manner.  In other words, the company had a very serious social obligation put on them and, at the same time, they were asked to compete in a commercial way with other users of the sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the B &amp; I boards tried to follow that mandate and achieve a balance. Decisions by successive Governments, as between commercial criteria, <Col N="2245" /> political consideration and strategic necessities, have not always favoured purely commercial considerations and, consequently, problems arise when you get into that sort of territory.  Let us examine the criteria again.</P>
    <P>When the board was established in 1965 the corporate objectives were to provide and develop a modern, efficient, profitable, national and comprehensive surface transport system to and from Ireland.  The Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies in their second report in 1978 stated that they felt that B &amp; I included broader obligations in their corporate aims.  On the one hand, media criticism reflected on the workers in the company.  The media also imposed their views on the public that, in fact, the B &amp; I had got this broader obligation, but in taking on this broader obligation they themselves were guilty of considerable malpractice.  Certain things happened which left an impression in the public's mind that the B &amp; I people running the business were at all times guilty or inefficient.  If anyone reads the reply Mr. Mulligan gave in the second report they will see quite clearly that they were genuinely concerned to try to live up to the commercial and social obligations imposed on them.</P>
    <P>I do not think that they had much of a chance but, at the same time, one wonders when they were given a chance by further subsidies and assistance whether they made the best use of it.  For example, one questions the purchase of the jetfoil in 1979.  They purchased it at a cost of £7 million and subsequently sold it for £5 million.  The balance had to be written off in the 1984 accounts.  The service commenced in 1980 and the vessel operated on average at 95 per cent performance, but it was the missing 5 per cent that received the adverse publicity.  Media interference is not that helpful when people are in difficulty.  We can be critical of the purchase of the jetfoil and question whether they surveyed the market correctly. We must question if fuel costs and interest rates on the loan etc. were examined correctly against the overall situation and whether it could have been <Col N="2246" /> a viable proposition or not.  Other things happened also which we criticised in this House with great justification.  However, we had an opportunity to examine the reports by the members of the board and, therefore, we had a more considered opinion of what was going on, rather than the light and unresearched opinion of many people who were commenting in the daily papers.</P>
    <P>It is true to say they purchased the <i>M. V. Connacht</i> and the <i>Leinster</i> at Verolme dockyard in 1978 at a cost of £41 million. If the vessels had been purchased abroad, and this was admitted, it is estimated the cost would have been approximately 30 to 40 per cent less.  Let us look at the situation.  They were crying out for work in the Cork area.  The Verolme dockyard was under threat and here was an opportunity to provide employment in the area. A decision had to be made where to buy those items.  The company were confused by the commercial and the social obligation imposed on them.  They went to the Verolme dockyard.</P>
    <P>It would be better for us to admit that we think they should have gone abroad and bought the ships.  Because we feel like that, we criticise the management for not being totally efficient.  On the other hand, some of us might have been screaming that the work was going out of the country.  While we can say now that the work should have been sent out of the country and the company should have realised this 30 to 40 per cent savings, at the time we would probably have screamed our heads off if the work had not gone to Verolme dockyard.  To some extent the management &mdash; I am not making excuses for them &mdash; were on to a bit of a hiding to nothing when the conditions imposed on them were to be very profitable without forgetting the social obligations.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I stated to the committee who were investigating this matter that they had an overriding social obligation to the community.  This was manifest in the money expended on building the new ships at Verolme to keep the business in Ireland.  The company incurred a significant expenditure in meeting the social <Col N="2247" /> and national obligation but only, as they said themselves, because the Government required them to do so.  We lacerate them for looking for more money and for not trying to rationalise but they are put in a situation where they have to laugh with one side of their face and cry with the other.</P>
    <P>The Government were breathing down their necks telling them they had a social obligation to go to the Verolme dockyard. We cannot do that and then criticise the company for having done it.  We should take this aspect into consideration when we are being critical of management. I do not for one moment suggest all was efficient.  There was inefficiency, and there were many things that could have been done, but they were in this dilemma.</P>
    <P>Extra money, £7.5 million, was spent also on refurbishing ships which were then sold at a considerable loss.  One wonders whether the cost of development and the passenger terminals which were built in Cork, Swansea and Pembroke and the four docks in Liverpool were a good investment?</P>
    <P>The number employed before this rescue package was 1,464 people; 661 were marine personnel and the remaining 803 were shore based.  After the redundancies, shore based personnel will still outnumber the marine personnel and one wonders whether that smacks of total efficiency also.  One begins to wonder about that.</P>
    <P>The blame can be laid on successive Governments rather than on the management or workers of B &amp; I.  For example, they are burdened with a travel tax.  At present the fares to London with B &amp; I are £6 for a child and £11 for an adult, but there is a tax of £5 on the child's fare, and a tax of £5 on each adult fare.  Let us assume two adults and child go.  It costs £27 in fare and an additional £15 in tax, the tax amount to almost 50 per cent of the cost.  When you compare that with, for example, the budget air fare to London of £91, and the travel tax is still £5, you can understand B &amp; I's problems in regard to this tax.  It certainly <Col N="2248" /> accounts for some of the problems of B &amp; I.  A first class air fare to New York is £1,199 plus £5 tax.  We must start to think in commercial terms.  We want B &amp; I to be commercially viable.  If we are to give them more money we will have to give serious thought to certain matters.  You cannot ask the company to be commercial and then put them at this terrible disadvantage.  From day one they are at a disadvantage because of the convenience and so on of air travel.  By our own deeds we create situations for B &amp; I, which they find very difficult to cope with.</P>
    <P>We have to admit to ourselves that over the past 20 years successive Governments have undercapitalised B &amp; I, in terms of their commercial and social obligations. As a result they have incurred losses of £99 million in capital charges since 1965 and they have been at the mercy of international currency fluctuations and high interest rates.  Because of their social obligations they insisted that car ferries should be built at Verolme Dockyard at twice the cost of overseas ship building.  That is a criticism we now level at B &amp; I, but what would we have said at the time?  The workers who suffered redundancy have a greater right than we have to query the rationale behind the insistence by Government that the work should be done in Verolme Dockyard.  While they are being criticised by the media for their own standard of behaviour the workers have a right also to suggest that these things undoubtedly contributed to the public and Government perception of B &amp; I as a loss making operation, although the State contributed equity.</P>
    <P>There are some areas where we can be critical and there are other areas where the workers can be critical. The workers in many ways have more right to be critical than anyone else.  The workforce have been decimated.  They had the bad experience of earlier redundancies when people were very shabbily treated in regard to pension rights, etc.  It has nothing to do with the present Minister that the workers have had this kind of background experience.  When we take <Col N="2249" /> an overall global view of the situation we cannot just say that the workers were at fault, that the management on their own were at fault, but we can say that, collectively, successive Governments undercapitalised them over the years.  We cannot say whether, through some inefficiencies, that there were some awkward situations with regard to industrial relations, <i>et cetera.</i>  Taking the past point with regard to industrial relations, in recent times the workers have gone overboard in their submissions to the company to meet the conditions laid down. There is much more to be covered but, in view of the fact that I have another task to perform, I will leave it at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. J. Daly Mr. J. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's wish for a speedy passage of this Bill because it is very important and there is a deadline on it.  I have not much to say as it has been fairly well debated already this morning.  There has been a lot of adverse comment on B &amp; I.  Some were justified, some may not be justified if other factors are taken into consideration. I see a social side to B &amp; I as well as a commercial side.</P>
      <P>B &amp; I are taking their passengers to Britain at a special reduced rate.  They were compelled for a number of reasons to reduce their rates.  They are at one disadvantage which the Minister might look at, and that is they have to pay on a fare of £20 a Government tax of £5. You can get an Aer Lingus fare, or any other airline going to the United States, of £1,000 and still pay a Government tax of only £5.  In one case the Government are taking about 25 per cent of the fare and in the other they are taking only about .5 per cent.  That is a disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did a very good job in relation to airlines as did the previous Minister and Commissioner Sutherland when he introduced the lower fares, and when we had a big battle with the airline companies and had the issue of deregulation. Deputy O'Malley when Minister <Col N="2250" /> in the previous Government, and even when he was not a Minister made strong cases against fares in Aer Lingus. In my own small way I made a contribution to the reduction of fares by Aer Lingus by pointing out that they had a fare of £69 to Britain which turned out to be a sham.  They were taking the people out and were not bringing them back and the tickets were no good after 14 days and the treatment by Aer Lingus was not very good, as I experienced in Britain. There is a certain amount of anti-Irish feeling in Britain and people are a bit upset about it.  I do not know if that is justifiable but there is no justification for the way in which the Irish people in Aer Lingus treated their passengers over there &mdash; they would knock them into the streets and would not even talk to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister refused Aer Lingus a licence to fly to Knock because it had already been taken up by Ryanair.  I congratulate him on that because if Ryanair had not done it Aer Lingus would not have been interested.  I suggest to the Minister that as there is no service between Farranfore and Dublin and aircraft that Aer Lingus were going to fly to Knock be used to fly from Farranfore to Dublin and give us a service in Kerry Airport.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach may wonder what Aer Lingus has to do with B &amp; I, but they are interrelated.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his success in reducing the numbers of people employed in B &amp; I.  They are doing as good a job if not a better job with 500 or 600 fewer people.  One would wonder what those 500 or 600 people were doing all along.  They were there in the days of wine and roses when there was no competition to B &amp; I from airlines, when the air fares were high but they still lost money.  Now that the service is streamlined perhaps things will improve.</P>
    <P>I have a soft spot for B &amp; I because I travelled with them on a number of occasions and it was very handy, you could do a day's work in Dublin and go down at 10 o'clock at night and be in Liverpool in the morning and have your hotel bill and all in the one operation.  It <Col N="2251" /> was very economical and sea travel is very good provided you have the time. That is the difference between air and sea travel.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy for anybody who does not have a job.  I have no sympathy whatever for anybody who has a job and will not do it.  That is a problem we have in this country.  Many days are lost in strikes, particularly in the public service: people are held up to ransom, they can get blisters on their heels walking behind other people with banners.  That day is gone and we will have to face facts.  We are in a new age and we have to be realistic.  People will have to do their work.  The days of the free lunch are gone and we have got to earn our money. Anyone who has the opportunity to earn money should be very glad to have that opportunity because there are a couple of hundred thousand people who would like to have it.</P>
    <P>I conclude by wishing the Minister well.  He has done a good job.  I hope that continues and that when 1990 arrives it will not give people a licence to start the same thing all over again.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to ask B &amp; I to take a look at going further afield in their activities.  Cruising is very important. People going on holidays, say to the Canaries, can go to Dublin Airport and arrive at their destination at 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and the same applies to their return trip.  They would almost need a holiday again after that.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan referred to B &amp; I making use of the important features such as rugby internationals and spring and horse shows and other big events.  If we put on features like that they could attract business.  There is a future for B &amp; I provided they play their cards and do their job well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht agus mhol gnéithe eagsúla i gcás B &amp; I.  I want to thank the Senators for their contributions and for the various suggestions they made <Col N="2252" /> with regard to the making of a viable commercial enterprise out of B &amp; I.  That would be my opening remark &mdash; the brief that B &amp; I have from the Government, a consciously taken decision by the Government, is to become commercially viable, and the plan, which is outlined in my opening speech, is the vehicle for achieving this.</P>
      <P>Senator Cregan made a very valid point about how expensive it would have been to get rid of the company and he indicated that he thought that if we used the money that was spent on the B &amp; I to give free vouchers to travellers to the country we would have been better off.  I do not accept that because we have in the company and its property valuable assets and what we are doing is what I have said, trying to bring about a position when as a straight commercial company it will be making a profit for the country.  It is true to say &mdash; and I am referring to remarks made by a number of Senators &mdash; that ships were built at Verolme Cork Dockyard on the expressed wish of the Government, ships built for the B &amp; I.  I think that a general bottom line rather than a specific bottom line is the important matter here.  The economics, as anybody knows, are a protean science and whereas there may have been a dearer ship at Verolme, and this point was made by a number of Senators later on in the debate, the wages, PRSI payments, the income tax, etc., which accrued to the Exchequer from the operation in Cork were not negligible nor of course in anybody's philosophy is the fact that hundreds of people were employed over a number of years in the building of those ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that in cars, plus tourists using cars, and heavy freight lies the successful future for B &amp; I.  They will have a certain income from foot passengers but as has been pointed out in the debate, the ever lowering air fares will leave that area less profitable than it used to be because it is a faster way to travel and when the rates approximate and when you put hotel charges, etc., into the budget, the foot passenger area is not one from which B &amp; I in the future can expect <Col N="2253" /> to gain substantial profit.  It is also true to say that they took more than 816,000 passengers to Ireland last year, and that is a substantial number.</P>
    <P>With regard to the strategic importance of it, certain doubts have been cast upon that belief.  Recently there was a Sealink strike and anybody sitting at my desk would realise the importance of having a company of our own.  Mushroom producers, meat producers, producers of other perishable goods peppered my office with phone calls.  There were <i>cries de coeur</i> coming from all parts of the country to try to get goods out of the country because Sealink were on strike. It is important to take note of that, it is an important ingredient, it may not be the predominant one that dominates all our thinking, but it is an important one, one that was recognised by some of the Senators, and discounted by others.</P>
    <P>A number of people, including Senator Cregan who made the introductory contribution said, that shipping companies are making considerable profits.  It is well known that shipping companies in general, both deep sea and short range ferry types have not been the most profitable places to invest money for some time.  This is a world wide phenomenon and it is as well to put it on the record of the House lest people think that B &amp; I losing money was in some way out of kilter with what was happening in the shipping business throughout the world. I was disappointed in the contributions of a number of people who did not make an analysis of the new plan, the plan that is meant to make the company commercialy viable.</P>
    <P>The unions adopted a responsible attitude throughout the debate.  They knew that the situation was either to come to an agreement across the board with management or to go into liquidation.  They knew that and they responded to it in a way which was complimented by a number of Senators during the debate &mdash; a cut of 5 per cent in their earnings, a freeze on pay increases over a period and the guarantee of industrial peace.  That was no small plus for the company in their new situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2254" /> Senator Farrell linked the importance of B &amp; I to our determined effort to develop the tourism industry.  It was a question of having a viable plan, as he said, or of sinking.  He indicated that from studying the old procedure a sense of reality had come to the company both at management and union levels.  I just want to reiterate what I said a moment ago, that 816,000 passengers were taken to the country by B &amp; I and that 1.44 million tonnes of freight was shifted and the points I made about the Sealink strike are highly relevant in that context.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross made a lengthy contribution and knowing his philosophy I more or less expected that the points he made would be made.  He indicated that he thought it would be better if the House did not pass this legislation.  I would just like to ask him if he wanted the Government to liquidate and, if so, if he wanted the Government to pay the upwards of £45 million owed by B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>A sum of £45 million is no small potatoes, if you will pardon the expression, at present when the Goverment are cutting down hard on expenditure over the whole spectrum of our national economy.  If we liquidate it, does he envisage the country without a ferry service?  I made the point already about what happened when Sealink were on strike.</P>
    <P>Did he want a monopoly on the Irish Sea?  We shrink from monopolies because we know that when there is a monopoly the tendency of the boardroom is to inch up prices and consequently make it more difficult for our exporters.  It is well to know that the Government took over B &amp; I in the mid-sixties in different economic circumstances from those which prevail today.  It was a boom decade, but it was a private company which failed at that time and the State had to take that company over.  It is as well to remember these things if we want to achieve a balance in our judgment about this company.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross said things were not quite as dramatic as I or the Government maintained. My opinion is that it is quite dramatic for 1,000 people to find themselves <Col N="2255" /> out of jobs &mdash; 1,500 to 1,600 people if you take the total before the redundancies took place.  It was definitely dramatic for the workers.  It would be highly dramatic for their families and it would be dramatic for exporters.</P>
    <P>It is a loss, as Senator Ross pointed out, to both Houses of the Orieachtas that the accounts were not available for the past two years.  I understand they will be available shortly.  I do not condone the late publication of accounts.  The reason for the late publication is, as everybody knows, that the situation was very bad.  I believe that all of these companies should produce their accounts as soon as possible after the end of their financial year. Indeed, in the Dáil, when I was in Opposition I put down an amendment to shorten the time and the then Minister indicated to me that the time I was demanding was a little too short, and he put a limit on the time in that instance.  I had written down that Senator Ross did not make an analysis of the plan because with his expertise and knowledge in these matters I would like to have heard his opinion during his speech.  He gave that opinion later.  There was an <i>amende honorable</i> at the end of his speech. Unfortunately he said that he did not think it would work, but at least he had made an analysis of the plan.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross advanced the criticism that we did not define the objective.  I contend that that is not true.  I made it quite clear to management and workers, separately and in a joint meeting, last May what my objective was.  The objective was no different from that which Senator Ross would advance as a valid objective for either a semi-State company or a private enterprise, that is to say, we wanted them to get their house in order, we wanted them to achieve viability in the full commercial sense of that word.</P>
    <P>I have to agree with Senator Ross that colossal sums were paid out.  I have to agree that could not continue, and it will not continue.  He pointed out that in 1985, 1986 and 1987 the company were massively off target.  Again, I have to agree. <Col N="2256" /> The purpose of the whole re-arrangement is to put an end to that.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross asked about the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State Sponsored Bodies and whether it would be relevant, or if it would even be debated.  I will not be making the decisions about whether it will be debated but in so far as it takes accounts of this new plan and these new developments, of course it will be relevant.  It will be particularly relevant to me since I made it quite clear when the agreement was being made that the Department, I as Minister and the Government will be reconsidering the whole position in the autumn.  So the results of the deliberations of the committee will be important to me and to the Government.  I must say that the people who are acting on that committee and who brought their expertise to bear on this debate also deserve my gratitude and thanks.</P>
    <P>The reference to Ryanair by Senator Ross was pertinent.  I stated quite clearly that I did not accept the argument that it was merely the lowering of air fares that caused severe difficulties to B &amp; I Line. It was a factor &mdash; anyone who looks at the figures will have to admit that.  It is that which led me to the conclusion that a heavily targeted and sharp marketing of the advantages of B &amp; I line for those who are coming with cars, on holidays or on business, is the area to go for.  Freight is also an area to rely on, not freight <i>tout court</i>, but the roll-on, roll-off freight for which the exporters are showing a great preference.  As Senators know, the door-to-door service has been scrapped as part of the new plan.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross was wondering whether the strikes were significant.  The fact is that the only strike which was mentioned cost £5 million.  That is not a bagatelle in my book &mdash; I suppose when dealing with large sums of money on the Stock Exchange it might be, but I would love to live until the time when £5 million will be a bagatelle.  In agreement with the contributions of other Senators, the industrial relations record in B &amp; I has not been a bad one.  Everyone must concede that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2257" /> Senator Ross made the point that there is a feeling B &amp; I in that the Government will bail them out and that this might take from motivation &mdash; there is still a belief that when the chips are down the Government will help.  We have made it quite clear that the situation as it obtained before could not continue.  We found that private enterprise was toying with the idea of taking the company over provided the Government paid the £45 million debt.  I do not suppose I have to make a comment on that.  The fact is that we are giving this plan a chance.  We are getting monthly accounts of the revenue and the costs and how the budget and the reality relate to each other.  We will make our decisions in the light of the information which comes through in that way.  We have left the board of management in no doubt whatsoever about what we expect them to achieve.  I know that air fares will continue to fall, as Senator Ross said.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross mentioned over-capacity for freight on the Irish Sea.  I have no evidence that there is over capacity at the moment for freight on the Irish Sea.  That is why I say that with the transport of cars and heavy freight therein lies the future as far as I can see of B &amp; I.  He ended with a ringing appeal to close B &amp; I down and let private enterprise take over.  I am no enemy of private enterprise or of efficient profit-making State ownership either.  We must realise that most private enterprises in this country have been liberally supported over the years by the State purse as well.  I am not criticising that as a <i>modus operandi:</i> I am merely stating it as a fact.</P>
    <P>The Government decided to review the position of B &amp; I not later than autumn of this year &mdash; I want to put this on the record straight &mdash; on the basis of detailed comparisons, as I have just said, of the company's performance against forecast. Given that that is the Government's position, it would not be appropriate for me to speculate on what may or may not happen at the end of the year.  It is up to the company now to perform to the best of their ability and to make sure they meet, and indeed exceed if possible, the financial target for 1988, the financial <Col N="2258" /> target they have set themselves under the plan.  I was glad to hear suggestions from various Senators as to other areas where they might explore.  The more of that kind of contribution the better.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan has a complaint, which I share, about the loss of railways; in his case in Donegal in my case in Cavan.  We had the luxury of both the Great Northern Railway and the Midland Great Western and Southern Railways serving my native parish when I was a schoolboy.  Now we have no railway at all and I continue to regret it.  Senator McGowan raised the question of social implications and leaned heavily on them. I understand his position.  He is no slouch when it comes to plugging the case for Donegal no matter which particular area of national life he is dealing with.  He said the company must work efficiently.  He admitted that B &amp; I operations were not impacting on Donegal but he was willing to say that B &amp; I should be supported if this had a good economic effect on the rest of the country, which from a Donegal man is a fair confession.  He said that management and staff must realise they cannot continue to get subventions and subsidies over the years.  That was the general theme in the House.  I probably might be hearing more about the ferry from Moville to Glasgow but I am not making any comment on it as of now.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris stressed the importance of efficiency in the operation, that there was a national responsibility involved in the case of B &amp; I.  He spoke in a complimentary fashion about B &amp; I efforts to increase the number of tourists into the country during 1987.  The statistics of 126,000 cars, 816,000 passengers and 1.4 million tonnes of freight are genuine figures and are a measure of the contribution B &amp; I are making.</P>
    <P>He and other Senators mentioned the docking facilities.  It is a fact that B &amp; I have not got the best possible slots at Holyhead.  My officials at the moment are working on that.  We expect to put a good deal of muscle into the talks with the owners of Holyhead in this regard. We have a counterpoint in that Dún Laoghaire is a facility available to all <Col N="2259" /> comers.  I do not accept any &mdash; I am not saying responsibility because I was a member of Government at the time &mdash; blame for the placement of the building of the ships.  It has been brought up in the Dáil and in the Seanad.  The decision was a proper one at that time.</P>
    <P>The Senator also paid a tribute to the workers and I have done so myself.  The question was, are we going to swim or are we going to sink.  They knew that was the position, they acted accordingly and they have made it somewhat easier anyway to achieve commercial viability. No private enterprise would have taken the responsibility of B &amp; I at that time.  As I said, the question of what the Government's decision in autumn will be depends on performance in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris, again among others he was the first to mention it in the course of the debate &mdash; emphasised the importance of looking at new business opportunities. He talked about the importance of dynamic management and he &mdash; others were specific later on &mdash; indicated there should be marketing force, so to speak an eager beaver marketing force, looking for new opportunities to exploit in the commercial business of the company.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery, who is a member of the committee and gave us the benefit of his membership and of the study that is being done in that committee, said that proper scrutiny of the operations is critical. He complimented the company on their good passenger and freight performance as evidenced by the statistics given and made the very important point that as a company B &amp; I provided a substantial number of jobs over the years. That is not something anybody can leave out of consideration, either on economic or social grounds in considering the fate of any company.  The strategic point was made by Senator Hillery.  I do not think I have to emphasise my own experience, it was only a short experience, when Sealink were on strike, a strike incidentally which did not start on the Irish Sea.  It started between Britain and France.  It <Col N="2260" /> had nothing to do with the Irish Sea operation whatsoever.  This again, shows how an enterprise can be affected by something over which it has no control whatsoever,</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery, as becomes his profession, emphasised the importance of B &amp; I sharpening their marketing.  I hope they will read this debate and realise how conscious this House and the Oireachtas generally is of the importance of this. Senator Hillery raised the comparison of performance and forecast.  I guaranteed already in my speech that this was taking place.  As a matter of fact, for other companies also the same procedure is being followed as of now.  I agree with them.  It will not be an easy future.  A good service is needed and strong marketing.</P>
    <P>In a lengthy contribution Senator Bradford made many points.  He made the point that, as it seemed to him, it was the last chance.  It is a fair summary.  The day of reckoning is an ominous kind of way for putting it, but he used the words anyway.  He went along with some of Senator Ross's suggestions that the thing to do was cut the losses and let it go.  It was one option.  He did not come down heavily on the side of that option but he mentioned it with some favour.</P>
    <P>The other option was to take advantage of the expertise that was already there, not to scatter it, not to get rid of it, but to pay attention to what has been substantially a good record in industrial relations.  He also said we would have to take cognisance of the assets.  The assets are very considerable.  He dealt with the serious social consideration and said that it placed restrictions on the company as a purely commercial venture.  I make the point that there are bottom lines and bottom lines.  There are specific ones for the specific commercial company.  There are national ones and, in particular, something that came up for criticism time and time again, the placement of the building of the two ships in Cork.</P>
    <P>He complimented the unions on their major sacrifice and thought with me that the deregulation argument was exaggerated but criticised B &amp; I for being too <Col N="2261" /> slow to react at that time.  He thought that Sealink were more successful.  It is not for me to comment on a private company. I said &mdash; it is true &mdash; that the shipping buisness generlly, both deep sea and the short linkage shipping, have not been the most successful businesses in the past few years.</P>
    <P>He emphasised the importance of new ideas and, in particular, the idea of linking Europe into their operations.  Europe is linked in already in the freight situation. I mentioned that in my opening speech.  He was the first to mention &mdash; others agreed with him &mdash; the cruise potential.  I reiterate what I said already. Ideas are important and the more of them that come from people of experience in the commercial field or even, specifically, who have shipping and marine expertise, the better so that the board of management will know of the interest of the Houses of the Oireachtas and also take advantage of any ideas which, when tested, they may find commercially viable.</P>
    <P>He raised the point about the shore based personnel and the seagoing personnel. The redundancy package is being worked through at the moment.  While it has not been concluded, the shore based numbers will be reduced more than the seagoing numbers when the final count is made.  I can put that on the record of the House now.</P>
    <P>As many Senators said, we will be watching the accounts closely.  One point he made that I would not agree with is that the Members of the Oireachtas and the public generally should know month by month what the accounts are.  I do not think one could do that.  If you had a monopoly situation yes, but where you have commercial rivals I do not think it would be wise to let other people know exactly how you were going on.</P>
    <P>We did not accept in the original proposals the idea of the holding company. That will come up for consideration again.  It has not been accepted.  I mentioned that we are working on the berthing facility at the moment.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan, who has expertise in the tourism area and personal <Col N="2262" /> involvement in it, emphasised that he regarded B &amp; I as important not merely in the tourism area but in the matter of industrial exports.  He complimented the management and the unions on the acceptance of this new slim line company and he emphaised, what we have been emphasising, that it is important for the company to make money and to make a commercial success of it.  Whatever social factors come to mind, this is what this House and the Oireachtas generally are looking for in this instance.  He made a very good point that if the situation had been reached where the company had been a private company, it might well have closed down at that time and left us in the middle of the tourist season with a back-up of industrial perishable exports and no place to go.</P>
    <P>He raised the point of the individual performance of the ships and how important it was to see to it that a good service was provided on the ships.  I have to agree with him, not specifically on B &amp; I.  I have had experience of less than sharp, efficient and courteous service on ferries. It is not good enough.  I know what I am talking about because fairly close relations of mine did summer holiday work from a university on certain ships. I was appalled by the general attitude of staff, as they relayed it to me, to customers.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years or so B &amp; I have concentrated on that aspect.  Aer Lingus have special studies, seminars and influencing group meetings to see to it that courtesy and efficiency, and the customer is always right philosophy, are instilled into their staff.  I would like strongly to support what Senator O'Callaghan said.  He made a comparison between Irish staff and other staff but that does not take away from my total support for his views on that.</P>
    <P>He, too, mentioned the potential of cruise business.  I accept that.  The first thing I want them to do is to prove themselves between now and the autumn and, as soon as they have proved themselves and begun to make profit, I would like to see that type of expansion or expansion <Col N="2263" /> into any other field in which they could make a profit.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte paid a well-deserved tribute to the workers and their attitude during the discussion.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, as the House knows, made a significant contribution at that time but there seems to be an ambivalence there with regard to the placement of the contracts.  We are going back a bit. It is not very productive to go back too much, but I maintain that the placement of the ships at that time was a good thing for the economy of the country generally. Admittedly, they may have been somewhat cheaper in Japan.  I have not heard any complaints about emigration from Japan or a lowering of the standard of living, so it does not pain me that they did not get two contracts from here.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte also made the contrast between shore based and seagoing staff. I indicated to him what was happening in that regard.  All reference to the travel tax will have to be referred to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, who will deal with it in his usual efficient and possibly ruthless way. The £5 tax is a larger proportion of the ferry charges than it is of the fares from Ireland to New York.  That goes without saying but it is not an exorbitant imposition. In my opinion as far as children are concerned the percentage looks high.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly referred to the contrast between services.  He had an unfortunate experience with Aer Lingus and he worked it into his contribution on B &amp; I. It shows the intensity of his feeling in that regard.  He said he hoped that it highlighted in some way the importance of giving full information about fares and about the reduction of fares.  I am grateful to him for his remarks about the efforts to bring down air fares and about the help that was given to me by the European Commissioner, Mr. Sutherland.  He was a useful ally.  In the end, of course, the Treaty of Utrecht was more powerful than either myself or Mr. Sutherland and held up the package for a considerable time.  We got over the Treaty of Utrecht <Col N="2264" /> and in December 1987 succeeded in putting the package forward.  I may say now, if the Leas-Chathaoirleach does not shoot me down, that I will be signing tomorrow with Lord Brabazon an air agreement which is even more liberal than the liberal passages in the European air agreement.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I, as Senator Daly said, provide a very good service, in particular in the area the Senator mentioned.  Many years ago I had to emigrate and when I came back to Dublin for a job interview were it not for the fact that I could get a night's sleep on route back I would not have been able to come for that particular interview &mdash; what is more I got the job &mdash; at a time when the service being provided for thousands of people between this country and Britain was appalling and atrocious.  I often regret since that I did not jump on a herring barrel and rally the hundreds of Irish people who were being so badly treated on that particular service at that time.  That is one of my regrets.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly stressed that it was important that B &amp; I should know that there was no licence to do again what has been happening over the years.  That is certainly true.  He also mentioned the possibility of cruises.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Seanad for the wide-ranging debate and for the ideas they have put forward.  Even where I did not agree with these ideas I was very glad to hear them expressed because I know they represent a philosophy with regard to the commercial life of the country.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say how much I appreciate, how much, I am sure, the House appreciates, the serious way the Minister treated the debate on Second Stage and the very detailed replies he gave to our contributions and which were extremely helpful.  While one may not agree with them it is refreshing because it does not always happen that one gets quite such a useful response to a Second Stage debate in this House.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of things I would like to clarify.  First, I should like to know what stage this plan is at now.  We are obviously in a transition stage where the plan is about to be implemented, that is why this Bill is here but certain measures have been taken.  The redundancy package is being implemented at the moment. I do not know whether we are at the stage now that we can get monthly accounts. Maybe the Minister could give us some indication about what they are showing, if we are getting that, and how the company have been doing since November-December. On top of that maybe he could tell us when the 1986 and 1987 accounts will be ready because, as he said, it has been difficult to debate this aspect without having the audited figures in front of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first question the redundancy package is being worked out and the monthly accounts we are getting already show that the company are on budget.  I am very pleased to say that as of now.  Regarding the publication of the outstanding accounts, it sounds like an evasive adverb but &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; is the best I can say.  I genuinely believe that that will be shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us any indication about the criteria they will be using.  I presume B &amp; I are under permanent, almost daily, review or certainly monthly review.  It appears that what will happen is that there will be a more formal review in the autumn with maybe some announcement or some public indication of where we go from here.  I would like to know if the Minister could give the <Col N="2266" /> House any indication of the criteria which will be used for that review.  Could he give the House an assurance that there will be no more subsidisation of B &amp; I? If by the autumn B &amp; I are not on target, if the plan has proved a disappointment, can he give the House an assurance that the Government will not come back once again and say &ldquo;ah well, there are special factors&rdquo;, that they may say there has been a bad tourist season, that the weather has been bad or that there has been a strike or something like that.&rdquo;  Can he assure us that he will not then say &ldquo;we are off target but we will give them another chance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is something which worries me a great deal.  There are always special factors, there are always extraordinary items in accounts like these.  I would like an absolute guarantee that we will not see the Minister pouring funds once again into an unprofitable organisation which is out of target.  If I cannot get that, maybe he can say what he will be looking at, as a priority, in this review in the autumn.  In other words, is the commerciality of B &amp; I the only criterion used or if the company are not commercial will the employment element be important or is it to be B &amp; I's service to the nation as a whole, which is a very nebulous and very intangible concept, which will be important?  What will be the top criteria and what criteria will be used when the Minister will have to make another decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to commerciality, the employment and service to the nation, all three factors will have to be taken into account.  I do not want to prejudge the assessment which will take place in the autumn.  What will weigh very heavily is the question of whether B &amp; I are making a profit and will continue to make a profit.  As emerged during the course of the debate there was one suggestion of a separate fund &mdash; this was mentioned by a number of Senators &mdash; a separate compartment for dealing with the debt.  As the Senator knows very well, a substantial draw on the funds of the B &amp; I is the servicing of the debt.  That will have to be considered <Col N="2267" /> in the light of the achievement of the company under their new plan by the autumn.</P>

Senator Ross prefaced his question with a useful little word, &ldquo;if&rdquo;.  I would be a very foolish politician, let alone a member of the Government, to answer at this stage a hypothetical question about what the financial position will be in autumn.  I outlined the general principles which will guide the Government <Col N="2268" /> in their consideration of this matter in the autumn when it comes up for review, as both management and unions know it will, because that was stated at the time of the inauguration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  It is extraordinary that on a Bill of this sort which spells out a principle of the State funding an unprofitable company, should have such extraordinary ideological unity in the House.  That is what we have seen this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister said in his reply is very significant.  He said that B &amp; I were not alone in that they were part of an industry which was unprofitable worldwide. That is one of the problems we will have in the future and that is why it is quite extraordinary this Bill has been passed almost unanimously.  If it is a worldwide phenomenon, as the Minister so rightly said, that this type of shipping <Col N="2269" /> industry, of freight and passenger industry in shipping, is contracting then we are a little foolish to have allowed this Bill to pass without opposition today, apart from myself.</P>
    <P>It is the principle I am worried about. It is the principle of the State willy-nilly funding NET, Irish Steel in the past and semi-State organisations.  This principle, although I commend the attitude of the Government in attacking it, has been promoted once again to a smaller extent because although the Minister did get the unions and management to knock their heads together on this particular issue, the principle is still there, that they are getting money from the Government. What we have not heard, and what I failed to get from the Minister on Committee Stage &mdash; I knew I would fail to get it, to be realistic &mdash; was an assurance that this would not happen again, not only that it would not happen again in the area of semi-State bodies, but that it would not happen again in the specific case of B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>What I dread, but what I anticipate, is that this plan will not work and that B &amp; I, having contracted, will come back to the Minister.  It may not be this October &mdash; maybe this plan will work for a few months &mdash; but because of the nature of the industry, because of current events and trends throughout the world, I anticipate B &amp; I will come back to the Government and say they will cut their workforce again, as they have done before.  I have lost track of the number of reports and plans which have been written about this industry which have not worked and this is just another one.  They will come back to the Minister and say they will take measures similar to all the others, and once again, will ask for another £1 million, £5 million, £20 million and pay off their debt.</P>
    <P>That is the principle which as not been attacked.  The issue has been attacked in a very specific way.  The industry has been thinned down but what I think we have here, unfortunately, is a failure to attack the principle of subsidising highly unprofitable organisations and closing them down.  That is not meant to be a <Col N="2270" /> heartless declaration.  I agree with the Minister that industrial relations in B &amp; I have been extremely good, but I believe it is inherently a badly run, dying industry and should be allowed to have a peaceful burial.</P>

      <P>I take a different point of view to my esteemed colleague, Senator Ross, on this issue and I want it to be clearly on the record.  This Bill reflects a very pragmatic approach to the resolution of a problem and the unity of approach and support for what is in this Bill, reflects the unity of approach that exists in the company in order to resolve the problems of the company.  We are not talking about an ideological solution to a problem of commerce, we are talking about a pragmatic resolution of a problem that has arisen.</P>
      <P>In an industry which, as my colleague would say, is in trouble worldwide and is not making a profit, I would hasten to remind him, and I am sure he is well aware of the fact, that a company in that same industry is being floated publicly on the Irish Stock Market.  I know enough about industry and economics to know that that kind of thing would not happen if the private sector did not feel it was a profitable and commercial operation. There is no difference between what we and the Government are attempting to do here today and what will be happening tomorrow morning in the private sector. We have taken a fairly major step forward. I compliment the Government on taking this position and would like to be recorded as having so said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Because Senator Ross' comments were pertinent to the Bill and to the discussion we had most of the day, I need to put on record our attitude on this matter.  I think he has ignored the concept of the debate we have had on the Bill which dealt with not alone the economics but the social obligation of <Col N="2271" /> B &amp; I.  It is not just as narrow as looking at the balance sheet.  I am quite serious when I asked him and the Minister about a hypothetical problem.  If the company are still in trouble the financial institutions will have an obligation to help. They have as much an obligation to consider the national interest as anybody else, whether it be Government or workers.  It is the demands by the financial institutions that have created the situation where the Government have to give further money.  Perhaps the banks in the national interest, would consider a moratorium if speaking hypothetically, the company are still in difficulty.  That question should be asked, as well as asking the Government if they will close the company if they do not succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to make a couple of comments on what Senator Ross said in particular. First, he said the principle worried him. There are principles and principles, and one of the principles I would subscribe to is that I do not want to see a monopoly on the Irish Sea.  If we withdraw B &amp; I from the Irish sea, it will be a case of monopoly.  I recalled during this debate that my office was inundated with calls from people who had perishable goods to export across the Irish Sea and who had no way of doing it when Sealink were on strike, a strike incidentally which broke out not on the Irish Sea but on the Channel between France and England.</P>
      <P>The second point is that the fundamental principle on which this Bill rests is that we have asked management and union to produce a commercially viable operation.  This is the objective we have set them.  I have indicated to the House that we will be examining the position in the autumn and we will be taking the necessary factors into consideration at that time.  While it is true that Senator Ross did not get an assurance from me that it would not happen again, he also did not get a statement from me that it would happen again.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Seantor Paul Bradford that he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the reduction of the annual State grants to the community development association, Muintir na Tíre, the need for funding to be provided from the national lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Ferris, wishes to make a contribution and I will give him whatever time I have left at the end of my contribution.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise in the House the present financial problems faced by the Muintir na Tíre organisation.  As the Minister is aware, last year was the golden jubilee of Muintire na Tíre.  In its 50 years existence, we can safely say that no organisation throughout the country has done more for community development and for progress at local level than Muintir na Tíre. The Muintir na Tíre organisation was founded to promote self-help and self-reliance among rural communities and it has lived up to the ideals of its founding father, Canon Hayes.  Any of us who is aware of the existence the community organisation, Muintir na Tíre, in his own area can illustrate by many examples the tremendous work they have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are approximately 200 Muintir na Tíre community councils, with average of 25 to 30 members in each, so we are talking about a minimum of 5,000 committed Muintir na Tíre people throughout the country.  The work they have done at local level has made a major difference to the economy of their areas. <Col N="2273" /> They have produced major local environment schemes, they have done tremendous work in relation to the tidy towns and tidy villages and have helped their own local areas attract tourists and industries. They have organised talent competitions, such as tops of the communities to foster entertainment among the members.  Having seen some of these competitions, I must admit that they are to the fore in illustrating a depth of local talent &mdash; musical talent, singing and dancing, around the country &mdash; that we do not often see on television.</P>
    <P>In my area, and throughout east Cork and the Cork county in general, the Muintir na Tíre organisation is very strong.  The fruits of their work can be seen as you travel throughout the area. In a village called Conna, for instance, they have built a major sports complex, admittedly with the help of Government grants, but the local contribution was raised by Muintir na Tíre.  The centre has made an enormous contribution to the area.  They have been instrumental in attracting two factories to the area, and now many local people are employed in their own village.</P>
    <P>Another village called Kilworth now boasts a very well known craft centre. This has been directly as a result of the efforts of the local Muintir na Tíre community council.  Only a few months ago the work of this craft centre was on display in London.  That is another typical example of the work being done by Muintir na Tíre.  In the Carrigtwohill area of County Cork, there is a wood product factory which employs nine people.  It is not receiving any State assistance and was the brainchild of Muintir na Tíre.  That is another striking example of that organisation's success.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of Muintir na Tíre's dedication is their community alert scheme which, at a time of growing threat to elderly people throughout the community, has been a tremendous source of help and encouragement.  In many areas where the community councils exist, the signs as you enter those areas indicate a Muintir na Tíre community alert scheme is in operation.  This is a trend we should <Col N="2274" /> welcome.  Again, we can thank Muintir na Tíre for it.</P>
    <P>My motion refers to the present severe financial difficulties being faced by Muintir na Tíre.  The national office of Muintir na Tíre in Tipperary town has been receiving a grant of £30,000 from the Department of Agriculture since 1980. This grant has been cut to £15,000.  The direct result of that cut is that the three staff at headquarters had to be laid off and the headquarters office closed.  That was a retrograde step.  It might be saving a very small amount of money in the short term, but it is doing untold damage to such a strong and valuable community organisation.  The people involved in Muintir na Tíre have told me they are facing what they would consider a life or death situation as regards funding and the effects it is having on their organisation at local level.  Without a headquarters and headquarters staff, they cannot receive the direction they would wish and they cannot operate without that assistance. It is absolutely vital that they receive funding from a central agency.</P>
    <P>For some time they have been trying to avail of national lottery funds to help their financial plight.  Indeed, no organisation is more fitting to receive national lottery funds than Muintir na Tíre.  We hope national lottery funds will be used for the betterment of the organisations which would receive them.  Undoubtedly any money received from any Government source by Muintir na Tíre will be used in a very fair and effective fashion. We need not worry about funds being wasted on an organisation such as this. Whatever they get they will spend wisely.</P>
    <P>I am not sure why the Department of Agriculture have been the funding source down through the years.  Perhaps, the Minister would explain that.  Muintir na Tíre in recent months have made applications to quite a few Government Departments seeking funds.  They have been unsuccessful so far in receiving anything extra from the Department of Agriculture and Food.  They have also applied to the Department of Education for national lottery funds and have been turned down.  They have applied to the <Col N="2275" /> Department of Health for lottery funds and have not received any reply so far, but are hoping for a positive response.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have good news in his reply and that the Government will be forthcoming with funds for Muintir na Tíre.  Because of their present financial position Canon Hayes' house may have to be sold off.  It would be an extremely retrograde step to see that memorial to such a great man having to be sold off due to a lack of funds.  The £30,000 they received on an annual basis since 1980 was not even enough.  That was the bare minmum they needed even to run a threadbare service.  If we could at least get back to that starting point it would help.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I appeal to the Minister and to the Government to make funding available to Muintir na Tíre in the knowledge that it will be spent for the betterment of the community.  The Government, community and taxpayers will get a tenfold return on whatever they make available to Muintir na Tíre.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to join with my colleague, Senator Bradford, in speaking on this Adjourment Matter with particular reference to the drastic cut in the funding from the Department of Agriculture and Food to Muintir na Tíre.  Muintir na Tíre were founded in the town of Tipperary by the late Canon John M. Hayes who was parish priest of my native village of Bansha for many years.  I was involved with him directly in the initial stages of the youth movement within Muintir na Tíre which involved the young people in the parishes throughout the country where Muintir na Tíre were active.  The concept of involvement in parish affairs through a formal structure which involved working people, business people, farmers, youth and women was probably 50 years in advance of people's thinking at that time.  It produced a structure which has survived.  Muintir na Tíre survived the changes in economic climate and became a major force in voluntary rural organisations.  The very name, <Col N="2276" /> Muintir na Tíre, stems from the people of the land which is probably why they came under the Minister's jurisdiction for funding.</P>
      <P>What a tragedy it would be if this Government, in their present restricted financial circumstances, were the cause of closing down one of the strongest voluntary organisations in the country.  This organisation is doing work the Government could never do by bringing people in a community together to benefit from one another, and benefit themselves and the area as a result.  They have been involved in every facet of community life and rural life: agricultural shows, variety shows, community alert programmes, tidy towns competitions, and all the items to which Senator Bradford referred, the whole concept of rural week, the election of the national executive and the prestige of a small organisation.  They have staff and offices in many parts of the country, but particularly in Tipperary town where the organisation was founded.  My colleague, the Government Whip, was an organiser for Muintir na Tíre and travelled the country with Fr. Hayes as I did. This is something which transcends the ordinary economics of cutbacks in various estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are making a plea to the Minister, whose Department have indicated a drop of 47 per cent in the grant-in-aid to all these organisations, thus reducing the Muintir na Tíre grant by 50 per cent, to use his good offices with every other Department affected by the work of Muintir na Tíre to increase the funding. The National Social Service Board, which the Government wanted to do away with and the concept of individuals being involved at community level, have an increased allocation this year.  As the Government have seen the folly of their ways in that area, perhaps there are funds available to the National Social Service Board which could be diverted to Muintir na Tíre to prevent the closing of their head office which is next door to me.  The staff who are on notice were involved since their school days and they are now faced with the prospect of a redundancy <Col N="2277" /> package and with unemployment.  I am sorry that this has happened.</P>
    <P>My next door neighbour, Michael Lynch, is the national president of Muintir na Tíre, a man who has devoted all his spare time and energies to the furtherance of the idea kindled by Fr. Hayes 50 years ago about the foundation of a movement and which has been subscribed to generously by bishops, archbishops, priests and civic leaders throughout the country.  This was proved last year when they celebrated their golden jubilee and experts from all over the world came to listen to the message of Muintir na Tíre how they had succeeded in this country and how a similar association is to be started in Italy, America and in other countries where they had not even thought of involving people in a voluntary way.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong in the Government supporting voluntary organisations such as this and, if the Minister's Department cannot match that challenge, he has an obligation to ensure that some other Department does so.  Any assistance that could be given to Muintir na Tíre would be a welcome reprieve for a most prestigious voluntary organisation from which the Government and the country has got tremendous value for a very small outlay.  I do not think any Member of this House, would oppose the concept of continuing that support, minimal though it was.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also use his influence within the European Community. Tomás Roseingrave, who was a past officer of Muintir na Tíre, is a member of the Social and Economic Council and his office together with that of the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, should be used to ensure that EC funding, structural funds or regional aid funds, is made available. Surely we are not bereft of ideas.  We must put our heads together and try to prevent the closing down of Muintir na Tíre, the sacking of their staff with all the trauma involved for all the different parishes.</P>
    <P>Today we have a united appeal.  I am sure Senator Ryan will join with us in this <Col N="2278" /> appeal to the Minister to ensure that the Government are aware of how we feel Muintir na Tíre should be treated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from Tipperary town and, as Senator Ferris said, I worked for Muintir na Tíre for a number of years as an organiser.  I was going to school in the thirties when Muintir na Tíre were first established.  They celebrated their 50th anniversary a few months ago.  It would be a very sad day for Ireland if this organisation had to go out of existence.  The £30,000 they received from the Department in recent years was their sole revenue.  One may ask why the guilds of Muintir na Tíre throughout the country could not support headquarters but every guild has it own work to do.  They are a community in themselves.  They are trying to raise money for halls and everything else. When the chairman of Muintir na Tíre and the national executive and others said to me that they would have to close down and go out of existence I found it hard to believe this could happen in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am not putting the blame solely on the Department of Agriculture and Food. Muintir na Tíre should never have been under the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I do not know how that happened. This year the Department had to cut all grants and subsidies of this kind by 50 per cent and Muintir na Tíre could not be classed as an exceptional case for funds. Muintir na Tíre should come under the area of responsibility of other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that at present the Minister for Health is looking at Muintir na Tíre and hopes he will be able to make some money available from the national lottery.  However, he has explained to me that he cannot just give money to Muintir na Tíre <i>per se</i> that any moneys given must be for a certain project, and the project he was considering was community alert. This was established some few years ago by Muintir na Tíre and is being carried out in most parishes.  I am sure that that operation is saving the Department of Health some money, money that they <Col N="2279" /> might otherwise have to pay to community care personnel.  In parishes where there is community alert in operation, there are fewer robberies and so on. People involved in community alert are on the lookout for old people especially, and if they do not see them around they call to their homes to see if they are all right.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a parish in County Tipperary, that does not have the alert system, and where a man was dead in a house for three weeks this year before he was discovered.  That is the type of work Muintir na Tíre are doing and I do hope that as a result of what has been said here today, and what has been said elsewhere, some Department in the Government could come up with, at least, the £15,000 that was taken from the organisation last year.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would like to thank Senators Bradford, Ferris and Ryan for their contributions to this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us who are committed to the well being of local communities and notably those in rural Ireland can identify strongly with the objectives and the work of Muintir na Tíre, an organisation established in 1937 by Canon Hayes.  Muintir's expressed objective was the promotion of practical Christianity in the civic life of rural Ireland.  In more specific terms Canon Hayes saw this objective being achieved through uniting communities in a spirit of community service, neighbourliness and self-reliance, through fostering advice, local patriotism and through fostering a sense of responsibility towards the needs and problems of the local community.  Canon Hayes hoped also by this means to break down class antagonism and conflicts between sectional interests and to secure a unified <Col N="2280" /> community approach to solving the community's problems.  This was at a time of considerable depression also in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Since its foundation over 50 years ago now, the organisation has worked steadfastly and consistently for the betterment of local communities and has set a headline for all of us as to the benefits of a more participative and self-reliant society.  Over the half century there have been many changes in the countryside with the growth of industrialisation, the exodus to cities and, more recently, the much increased prosperity of our agriculture. These developments while most welcome, brought with them also their own problems.  But the basic tenets of Canon Hayes's approach to difficulties, those of self-help and self-reliance remain as valid today as they did in 1937.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, will launch in the near future a programme of integrated rural development, on a pilot basis.  No programme could have a serious chance of success unless it encouraged local communities to take a greater measure of responsibility for economic and social growth in their own areas.  The thrust of the Government's proposals will be on fostering local initiative to achieve both economic and social development and to obtain this there is a need for a greater degree of co-operation of effort between the various State and voluntary organisations currently working to improve rural conditions.</P>
    <P>The very essence of Muintir na Tíre is its independence and emphasis on voluntary service and participation in community effort.  The State's contribution was always seen as a practical gesture in helping with its finances.  Muintir na Tíre would never have wished to become dependent on the Exchequer. Nevertheless I recognise that finance can be a worry to voluntary organisations and fund raising can dissipate energies which could be put to better use.</P>
    <P>Among others, Muintir na Tíre will have an important role to play in this developmental work since the improvements which have already been achieved <Col N="2281" /> by this organisation will form a groundwork on which future development can be built.  It is only by taking control of their own destinies that communities can hope to achieve the kind of improvement which will lead to more jobs and better incomes and so make a better future for themselves and for their children in their own areas.  The integrated rural development programme will help communities to help themselves and will be looking to existing organisations which have a history of achievement in this area to assist in this work.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of great regret to the Government that having regard to the state of the national finances it found itself compelled this year of retrenchment to include its contribution to the running costs of Muintir na Tíre among the cutbacks. It did not, however, eliminate the contribution but reduced it from £30,000 to £15,000.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food is not responsible for the disbursement of assistance from national lottery funds.  He did, however, endeavour to have an allocation from this source made available to Muintir but has learned with regret that the Muintir area of activity is not at this moment one of those designated as eligible for lottery funding.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with one point that <Col N="2282" /> was raised by Senator Bradford in the course of his contribution.  Apparently grant aid for Muintir na Tíre was started in 1956 on the Marshall Aid package, that was the agreement between Ireland and the USA where grants of £10,000 each were made from counterpart funds to Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Feirme and the ICA at that time.</P>
    <P>I would like to say, in conclusion, that having listened to the various points made by the three Senators well and bearing in mind that the three are Munster men, two from Tipperary and one from Cork, and realising the importance of Muintir na Tíre which is near and dear to their hearts, I will have another look at the position regarding national lottery funds to see if anything can be done that will assist.  I am not obviously in a position to make any promises at this moment but we will undertake to have another look at the matter.  Senators are probably aware that the Taoiseach's Department deals with the lottery in so far as cultural matters are concerned so I will conclude by saying that we will have another look at it to see if any assistance can be got from any source for Muintir na Tíre.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.50 p.m. until 12 noon on Wednesday, 16 March 1988.</P>
