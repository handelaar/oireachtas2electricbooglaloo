      <P>I have notice from Senator Joe O'Toole that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need to establish a pilot scheme for Teilifís na Gaeltachta because £0.5 million has been set aside from the national lottery by the Government since November last for this scheme.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John A. Murphy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clarify the Government's attitude to the Mawhinney proposals on integrated education in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Philip Hogan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to retain the school transport service to Tullaroan national school, County Kilkenny, as operated for the school year 1987-88.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the several changes in the international patent scene, the need <Col N="2266" /> for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to indicate how this will affect the workings of the Patents Office.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Labour to restore funding to ensure commencement of work on community projects under the social employment scheme in the following places in County Roscommon: Ballaghadereen, Roscommon town, Frenchpark, Loughrea, Elphin and Tarmonsbarry.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators O'Toole, Murphy, Hogan, Bulbulia and Connor as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment of this House.  I have selected Senator O'Toole's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Murphy, Hogan, Bulbulia and Connor may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business for the day is Items Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  Could I suggest, with the indulgence of the House, that on Item No. 1 we go past Report Stage and directly on to the next Stage and that discussion can take place without any inhibitions on the next Stage?</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, could the Leader of the House give an indication of the finishing time today? Will it be normal finishing time for a Thursday?  In fairness to all of us, including the staff, it would be nice to know now.  I realise the Leader of the House has to complete the work but is it his intention to sit next week and, if so, on what day?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, the question is relevant because this House will be rising next week.  I am asking a question of the Leader of the House for information. The Dáil passed the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, 16 September 1987.  It is my understanding that this country is not yet a party to the Vienna Convention of the Montreal Protocol for the Protection of the Ozone Layer.  These have both been passed by the Dáil without division. Is it necessary for this House to accept these two protocols before this country becomes a party to that Convention?  I do not want an immediate reply, but is it necessary to have it laid before the House before it rises for the recess?  I am sorry, a Chathaoirligh, it was relevant to the Order of Business.  I have no objection if, in terms of procedure, it is possible to go ahead with the Bankruptcy Bill, as indicated by the Leader of the House.</P>

      <P>I would like to voice my disquiet at something that occurred yesterday and my hope that there will not be a repetition.  Last night, we were debating Committee Stage of the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Bill and the Leader of the House found it necessary to use what I would describe as strong arm tactics when he introduced a guillotine motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would also like to express the hope that we will have item No. 5 &mdash; the debate on Northern Ireland &mdash; taken. I would like to place on the record of the House, as I drew to the House's attention yesterday, the fact that unfortunately an item in my name which had been on the Order Paper for a year has dropped off and I gave the House an undertaking that I would be putting it back on.  I have so done, but it is not yet on the Order Paper. I would like to draw the attention of the Leader of the House to the fact that because this item was not taken, a serious situation has been allowed to continue &mdash; a decision of the Supreme Court handed down yesterday refers &mdash; which will cost the taxpayers £5 million.  I hope that the Leader of the House can give some indication, in the light of the urgency of this matter, that planning legislation will be brought forward as is indicated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House, first, when we intend to go into summer recess; secondly, if the outrageous decision of the Government last night to guillotine that Bill was motivated by a wish to go into summer recess, thirdly, whether the Seanad is now working under new rules or whether it is working under old rules; and whether the guillotine is going to be used when, and if, the Government wish it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not think it is in the interest of the House or of any of us to start this morning by asking if item No. 1 will be guillotined and if Item No. 2 will be guillotined.  That is a matter for the House and it is a little unfair.</P>

If it embarrasses the Government and it looks for publicity, so be it.  I welcome publicity if it embarrasses the Government if the Government are going to behave in that way.

      <P>As Senators will be aware from the resolutions passed in the House last Tuesday, Committee Stage of this Bill was taken by a former joint committee on legislation and there are no amendments.  We cannot have a Report Stage debate.  We are into Fifth Stage, as has been agreed.  This is usual when a debate is confined to the Bill as content. Therefore, for the help of Senators participating, speeches can now be made on Fifth Stage, and as there is a gap since all this happened the Minister might like to come in and bring the Senators up to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the first time for the Bill to come before the present Seanad, I should say a few words about the background to it.  It was introduced following the report of a committee set up to examine the existing bankruptcy law and practice and, in the main, gives effect to the committee's recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It consolidates and modernises the whole law of bankruptcy.  It provides a more efficient and speedy method for realising the property of bankrupts and arranging debtors; it aligns bankruptcy law more closely with the law governing the winding up of insolvent companies, <Col N="2272" /> particularly in regard to preferential payments; and it provides for winding up in bankruptcy the estates of persons dying insolvent.</P>
    <P>The Second Stage was taken in the Dáil early in 1983.  Subsequently, it was referred to the Joint Committee on Legislation. It was examined in a sub-committee of the joint committee, under the chairmanship of Senator Maurice Manning, during 1984 and 1985 and a number of amendments were agreed.  In May 1986 the joint committee reported the Bill, as amended, to both Houses.</P>
    <P>The Bill passed Report and Final Stages in the Dáil on Wednesday, 29 June.</P>
    <P>On Report Stage in the Dáil, I introduced a number of amendments arising out of undertakings given to the sub-committee. These relate primarily to a bankrupt's entitlement to awards arising from actions for personal injuries and the like, the removal of certain obsolete provisions regarding acts of bankruptcy or implications of insolvency, the updating of provisions challenging transactions made by a debtor prior to bankruptcy and the provisions governing the sale of a family home, as well as the retention of the procedure whereby a bankruptcy can be wound up by a trustee and committee of inspection as an alternative to having it administered by the official assignee.</P>
    <P>I also accepted a number of Opposition amendments on Report Stage.  The main thrust of these amendments was to ensure that, before bankruptcy proceedings can be initiated against a debtor, a creditor must have a debt of at least £1,500.</P>
    <P>It is a great source of pleasure to me to officiate, so to speak, at the final stages of the placing of this measure on the Statute Book.  It has been a very long time in preparation.  The Bankruptcy Law Committee were appointed in 1962 by the present Taoiseach when he was Minister for Justice.  It reported ten years later and another ten years elapsed before this Bill was published.  In fairness, I should say that the delay in bringing forward the Bill was due to the fact that the EC Convention on Bankruptcy that was then being negotiated would have <Col N="2273" /> required radical changes in our legislation. It was some years before it became clear that hopes of finalising the convention within a reasonable time were unlikely to be realised and that it would be better to go ahead with the Bill.  Moreover, fairly extensive revisions had to be made in the text of the Bill prepared by the committee.</P>
    <P>But the House will not want me to dwell too long on the past so far as the Bill is concerned.  Nevertheless it would be remiss of me if I did not pay tribute in this House, as I did in the Dáil, to the members of the committee for their dedicated work over a long period on this complex branch of the law &mdash; during meetings, all of which took place in the evenings.  Sadly, many of the members of the committee, including their distinguished chairman, the late Mr. Justice Budd, are no longer with us but, for those who remain, this will be a very special day.</P>
    <P>I also want to thank my predecessor, Deputy Noonan, who introduced the Bill and shepherded it through the joint committee and, in particular, Senator Maurice Manning who chaired the subcommittee of that committee throughout their deliberations and as a result of whose activities only a few matters remained to be disposed of on Report.  Senator Fallon and others were also on the subcommittee.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and trust that it will now agree to signify its approval of the measure as amended and pass the Final Stage so that the Bill can come into operation not later than 1 January next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, I welcome the Bill into the House today.  I am very pleased that the Minister has been able to bring it in at the end of this parliamentary session and that the important updating which has been waiting so long in the whole area of bankruptcy law can now take place.  It is the first major reform of the bankruptcy laws in this country in almost a century.  Many of the changes in this Bill are updates and in some cases the abolition of laws that came on to the <Col N="2274" /> Statute Book well over 100 years ago. The whole concept of bankruptcy was very different then when there were many penal aspects and when otherwise fully law abiding citizens could find themselves facing extremely draconian measures as a result of a bankruptcy which was not their fault.  The time taken to get to this stage is perhaps not an example I would commend to the House or to the general law making process.  It has been too long.  The ten years for the commission to report was over long but, as the Minister said, we were entering into a phase where many aspects of our law were about to be harmonised with various aspects of the EC law.</P>
      <P>At least the length of time was used to bring in other changes that might not have happened but for our membership of the European Community.  In being critical of the length of time this legislation has taken to get through the Oireachtas the fault certainly is not with the present Minister, he might have dealt with in quicker but he has moved reasonably quickly on the matter.  The blame must be shared equally by the last Government.  The Bankruptcy Bill, 1982, went into committee in 1985, the final Report of the committee was issued in November 1985, but it should not have taken three years to get to this stage.  I know elections have intervened and other things have happened in the meantime, but I am glad we are at this stage today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, there have been many distinguished names associated with this legislation down through the years.  The present Taoiseach, when Minister for Justice, set up the commission which investigated the bankruptcy laws.  The report prepared by the late Mr. Justice Budd was an example of the type of public service report which has been at the disposal of the State from the early stages.  There have been various Ministers for Justice associated with the reforming legislation as well.  This Bill got very detailed, dispassionate and nonpartisan scrutiny.  I believe the type of committee procedure which was used to process this Bill is something to which <Col N="2275" /> both Houses should pay greater attention. It was possible in the calmness of the committee room to go through this Bill in great detail.</P>
    <P>Senators Fallon and Seán O'Leary were both members of that committee, as were Deputy Mervyn Taylor, Deputy Michael Woods, Deputy Alan Shatter and Deputy Seán Calleary.  They all worked calmly and with great expertise to finalise the legislation.  They had one interest only, and that was the common good, the public good, and seeing that the best legislation got on the Statute Book.  There was one further feature of this committee which commended itself greatly to me, and that was the participation of the officials of the Department of Justice: two of the three who were very much involved in that Bill are happily here with us today.  What was very refreshing and very useful in the work of that committee was that it was frequently possible to go into a sos where we could, off the record, get enlightenment from the officials of the Department of Justice who could explain to us some of the more technical details of the Bill.  It was a procedure which greatly commended itself to all.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the courtesy, the helpfulness, the sheer technical expertise of the officials of the Department of Justice who nursed us through that Bill.  I and others have been frequently a little critical of civil servants, but in this case I have nothing but the highest praise for the civil servants involved.  I would like to put my thanks, and I believe the thanks of all of those who served on the committee, firmly on the record.  I should have said for the record that the first meeting of the committee was held on 7 November 1984.</P>
    <P>However, looking at that committee, I would commend this procedure to the Government for other legislation.  The Companies Bill might have been better served if it had been discussed by a joint committee, with the possibility of Members getting expert advice from departmental officials.</P>
    <P>This legislation is coming in here cold <Col N="2276" /> today.  Most of us, to a certain extent, have forgotten about the Bankruptcy Bill.  When one is involved in a Bill, one talks to the various groups concerned, one tries to study what is involved, and one becomes almost totally immersed in it.  Most of us at this stage are fairly cold on the Bankruptcy Bill.  We know it got a very good scrutiny, we certainly do not want to reopen the debate today; we want to see it on the Statute Book and we believe it got as detailed a scrutiny as any Bill ever got going through the House.  I would commend Members to read the reports of the committee.</P>
    <P>This debate has not been accompanied by the press and media publicity which is normally associated with Bills going through both Houses.  It is important at this stage that the Minister would have his Department prepare a fairly detailed statement for public consumption as to what the changes are.  We may find there are many people who will not read the reports of the Seanad and if they are depending on the papers, who are not represented here today in the press gallery, they certainly will not hear that this Bill has become law.  I would ask the Minister in the interests of the public to have his Department prepare a digest of the major changes involved and that this be circulated to the media and to other interested groups so that the effect of what is happening will be apparent to all. I would ask the Minister in his concluding speech today to indicate the changes which were brought about in Report Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome the Bill, I think it is going to have far-reaching implications. It is a very important updating of, in many cases, outdated and, in some cases, penal legislation.  While the procedure adopted took too long I believe it was the right procedure.  I ask the Minister if he would engage in a campaign of enlightenment so that the general public are aware of the far-reaching changes involved in this legislation.  May I thank the Minister and his officials for their extraordinarily good service during the passage of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill seeks to consolidate and update the entire statute law relating to bankruptcy.  It has been pointed out that the Committee Stage was taken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC.  Senator Manning and I were members of that committee.  Senator Manning mentioned that we were perhaps &ldquo;rusty&rdquo; on the details of that committee, but I will always remember it because I was getting phone calls to be here on Fridays and Mondays.  I can even remember being told on the evening of our Ard Fheis to be here for a meeting. I will always remember it.  The committee met from 7 November 1984 to November 1985.</P>
      <P>While we were discussing bankruptcy law, what emerged clearly was the fact that so many other legislative measures were relevant to the bankruptcy laws &mdash; family law and home protection legislation. As we clearly understood, if the bankrupt person owned a house only, that could have repercussions for the family and the wife, and in that context, the family protection legislation was discussed. Even now we ask, how will it fit in, for example, with the Companies Bill?</P>
      <P>The reality of life is that the whole area of debt and debt collection, the problems of bankruptcy, is an ongoing and changing process.  In this year's Finance Bill we had the power to attachment &mdash; purely a revenue matter, and in the 1986 Finance Bill we had the infamous introduction of the sheriff.  It has been said that this legislation has been under discussion for the past 26 years.  I believe it will always be a changing situation.  In that period, many eminent groups have had an input into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were endeavouring to have a more speedy method of revising the estates of bankrupts, the official assignee and the minimum amount of petitioning creditors' debts.  Those are the aspects I remember most.  We have to make the point, and there is no reason for hiding it, that in this country, and probably in every country, there is a stigma attached to bankruptcy.  Many companies go out of business owing a lot of money and <Col N="2278" /> it is seen in a different light.  For the individual to be declared a bankrupt is having one's name entered in Stubbs Gazette and people have a horror of that happening.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as has been said by the Minister, is a very complex and highly technical one.  One could argue that it needs constant updating. As a member of that committee I, and I am sure the other members, developed a much greater understanding of the complex aspects of the practical problems of bankruptcy. The Minister has congratulated all concerned and so has Senator Manning who was the chairman of that select committee. I, too would like to congratulate everyone involved in drafting and formulating the Bill over the past 26 years.</P>
    <P>My role started in 1984 as a member of the select committee and I would like to congratulate Deputy Michael Noonan who was then the Minister for Justice and, in particular, his civil servants who impressed me very much.  As Senator Manning has said, and I restate the point, the Committee Stage was dealt with at a very leisurely pace.  If we found we needed to clarify aspects of it we were not happy with we could adjourn and come back and the civil servants would have the information.  Generally I thought the civil servants involved in that Bill were top class; they understood their brief.  They had the expertise and for that I congratulate them.  I also thank Senator Manning who was a very committed chairman.</P>
    <P>I support the view expressed by Senator Manning in regard to the Bill.  It might be a good idea for the Minister to issue a statement.  Some months back the Minister issued a statement of two pages dealing with the Intoxicating Liquor Bill which said it all.  Something like that again would be very helpful.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Collins.  In his reign as Minister since March 1987 he has been notable for bringing worth-while important legislation before us.  He has improved this Bill in the short time he has had an input into it.  I was very much aware that he <Col N="2279" /> would not leave it on his desk for too long.  He has the signal honour of having made the final move to make this Bill part of the law of the land and for that I congratulate him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to welcome this Bill and to congratulate the Minister and the various persons associated with it during its long period of gestation. I believe it is a humane one and one which protects the human rights of those persons who are unfortunate enough to become involved in bankruptcy proceedings.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a large number of people share the views expressed by Senator Fallon and that this situation is one which causes shame and distress to the individual.  In case there is anybody who may be undergoing this who will read these reports, let me cheer them up by referring them to the correspondence of George Bernard Shaw which I am currently perusing in which he actually writes to say to somebody in the process of going bankrupt that bankruptcy can be a very good and refreshing process and that a large number of those leading commercial figures in the England of the 1930s had gone through at least two and had always come back to make greater fortunes, so it may not necessarily be other than a temporary purgative operation, it may in fact be good for the system.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister to expand on some of the material contained in his speech, particularly where he says that among the principal amendments introduced by himself in the Dáil are amendments relating primarily to a bankrupt's entitlement to awards arising from actions for personal injuries and the like. I assume this means that if a bankrupt is injured and receives an award consequent upon that injury that, because of the nature of this award, it would be exempted from bankruptcy proceedings and charges.  It seems this is precisely the kind of humane thing that is needed in bankruptcy legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If somebody happens, either through negligence or through a situation which is <Col N="2280" /> no fault of their own, through prevailing economic circumstances, to be driven into bankruptcy and they are then injured, that injury is the paramount feature of the situation and that any such awards should be protected by this legislation. I assume that is what is meant.  I have looked very quickly through the Bill while other Senators were speaking but I could not locate the exact section and I would like to be reassured by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I would also like to welcome the Bill.  The first committee was set up to deal with bankruptcy legislation in 1962.  That is a long time ago.  I have noted that it was ten years before they submitted their report.  As commented on by Senator Fallon, they worked at a very leisurely pace since they took ten years.</P>

      <P>It passed on then to a very active sub-committee of which Senator Manning was chairman.  I would like to congratulate him and Senator Fallon for the work they put into it; they were almost called out in the middle of the night to attend meetings here.  I would also like to congratulate the present Minister in having brought this legislation to finalisation.  He will probably go down in history as the Minister who brought it to its final conclusion since it was first considered in 1962.</P>
      <P>When we do not get an opportunity to discuss legislation in committee we are often vague about it, but since it was discussed by a select committee I am sure that they put long hours and hard work into dealing with it.  Select committees are a good way of dealing with difficult legislation.  Possibly in the near future we will see other select committees set up to deal with complex legislation.  It would be a good idea.</P>

      <P>I do not want to enter any note of discord into the congratulations which are flowing backwards and forwards across the floor of the House.  In <Col N="2281" /> principle, I agree with them.  It is a very useful exercise that a Bill of this sort and complexity should be considered by an all-party committee and recommendations made on as non-political a basis as possible.  I have to admit, that because of the speed at which legislation is going through this House at the moment, I have not read the Bill in detail and I have not had time to construct a speech on it.  I should also like to congratulate those who have had an input into this Bill.  An enormous amount of hard work has been done.  It should be pointed out that this debate has been a bit short on detail today and it has been short on detail because Members of this House have not had time to consider the Bill in full and it is a very complex Bill. That I regret and I think that fact should be placed on the record.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to point out formally that those who were so keen on curtailing a speech on a Bill here last night are not present and I would like to ask if there is a quorum in the House.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Members of the Seanad for their contributions this morning on this legislation. This is probably one of the most discussed measures dealt with by the Oireachtas, certainly during my political life.  It is legislation that has been teased out in the greatest detail by very dedicated Members of this House and dedicated Members of the other House in committee under the chairmanship of Senator Manning, and by my predecessor in the previous Government, Deputy Michael Noonan, very ably assisted, as mentioned by Senator Manning, by the officials of the Department of Justice.  Because of its complexity, this legislation required that sort of approach to ensure that we would get the best possible results from the efforts that were <Col N="2282" /> required to be made.  It is not too often that we have the opportunity to finalise legislation 26 years in the making.  A lot of effort has been put into it down through the years, from the day the present Taoiseach, as Minister for Justice, established a committee to examine fully this complex subject and to advise him on what should be done.</P>
      <P>It is with regret that I say that many of those people who sat on the official committee are no longer with us to see their work being finalised today.  Indeed, many of those from the Oireachtas involved in the committee gave of their time and efforts to this legislation, often at their own personal inconvenience as mentioned by Senator Fallon.  During the period that committee sat two of the members Senator Manning and Deputy Desmond O'Malley had serious car accidents and were hospitalised, and the clerk of the committee, Mr. Dwan was injured in a car accident as well.  I do not know whether that had anything to do with the subject matter under discussion at the time but it must be interpreted as a sign of their dedication to be present at all meetings on this very complex subject.</P>
      <P>The committee recommended a number of amendments for Report Stage.  Also on Report Stage, Deputy Michael Noonan and Deputy Sean Barrett of the Fine Gael Party tabled additional amendments which I was able to accept.  I will go into more detail on these amendments later.  In all 25 amendments were tabled and all were acceptable. I would like to avail of the opportunity in this House to pay a special word of thanks to Deputies Michael Noonan, Sean Barrett and Michael McDowell of the Progressive Democrats whose help in getting this legislation through is very much appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Manning's comment that we probably have gone cold on the Bill &mdash; if I may borrow the phrase used &mdash; I agree wholeheartedly with his suggestion that a public statement on the changes involved should be made when the Bill becomes law.  We have become cold on the Bill and I believe that it would be very useful and <Col N="2283" /> essential that the public and Members of both Houses should be reminded of these changes.  We could also do this on other Bills such as the Data Protection Bill which was dealt with in this House yesterday. We should let people know exactly what is contained in that Bill.  We will issue the statements; not everybody will be interested in them but at least we will be able to enlighten those who would have any sort of interest in them, professionally or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Here I am thinking of the confusion that existed immediately after the Intoxicating Liquor Bill became law.  There were so many vested interests involved that it is very difficult to imagine that the Bill could have been signed by the President, its provisions become operative, and that the vintners knowing that they could stay open longer than they were staying open.  If I were in a flippant mood and in another place I probably would say other things that might be more appropriate to the occasion but I had better be very careful of what I say on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have often been accused of being slow to change but I think we had better keep off that ground for the time being.  I will certainly take the advice of Senator Manning as regards that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point made by Senator Fallon in relation to bankruptcy and company law, one of the main aims of the Bill is to align the bankruptcy of the individuals with the law regarding the winding up of insolvent companies.  The Senator rightly referred to the stigma of bankruptcy and to the problem as regards the family home.  We have sought to meet these concerns by ensuring that bankruptcy proceedings can only be initiated if a creditor is owed a debt of £1,500 at least. As the Senator is aware, the figure was increased, from £1,000, following acceptance of an amendment on Report Stage <Col N="2284" /> put forward by Deputies Noonan and Barrett.</P>
    <P>As regards the family home, an amendment to section 61 lays down guidelines to assist the court to postpone sale.  On Report Stage the following changes were made by way of official amendments.  I am, of course, excluding drafting amendments. The first amendment related to after-acquired property.  The purpose of the amendment to section 44 was to ensure that the provisions of the Bankruptcy Bill, which in principle vest in the official assignee on adjudication, all the property of a bankrupt, would not interfere with or prejudice the established case law and practice governing these rights of action and awards deriving from them.  Another amendment made it an offence not to comply with section 20, which requires a bankrupt to notify his change of name and address to the official assignee.</P>
    <P>Section 59 deals with the avoidance of voluntary settlements and the amendments were made to this section as a result of suggestions made at the sub-committee that the section should be updated.  Briefly, voluntary settlements, such as the transfers of property, will be void against the official assignee, (a), if made within two years of adjudication in all cases, and (b), if made more than two years but within ten years of adjudication unless the parties claiming thereunder can prove that the settlor was solvent at the time of the settlement and the whole interest of the settlor in such property passed to the trustee on the execution of the settlement.</P>
    <P>The following settlements are exceptions to this provision: (1)  settlements made before and in consideration of marriage; (2), settlements made in favour of a purchaser or incumbrancer in good faith or for valuable consideration and, (3), settlements made on or for the spouse or children of the settlor of property which has accrued to the settlor after marriage in right of the spouse.  The sub-committee considered that the concept of &ldquo;property accruing in right of the spouse&rdquo; is now obsolete in the light of the modern matrimonial property legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2285" /> They also considered that the ten year period should be reduced to five and the views of the sub-committee were given effect to in that amendment.</P>
    <P>The Bill was also modified in relation to the sale by the official assignee of the family home.  It provides for the court in deciding to postpone the sale and this official amendment arose out of discussions by the sub-committee on the vesting of the bankrupt's property on the official assignee, the avoidance of pre-bankruptcy transactions entered into by the debtor, and the official assignee's power to sell or dispose of a bankrupt's property.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed about the position of the family home in the context of the Bill and of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, and the Succession Act, 1965.  An official amendment to section 61 was put down in the sub-committee requiring the prior sanction of the court to the sale or disposition of the family home.</P>
    <P>While it was pointed out that the family home vested in the official assignee, subject to any interest attaching to it, that the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, did not deal with the ownership of the family home and that a Bill was being prepared to provide for joint ownership of a family home by both spouses, it was agreed to re-examine the position again. Various options were considered.  It was decided that a provision should be included in the Bill giving effect to the sub-committee's suggestion that the Bill should contain guidelines for the court in the exercise of its discretion to postpone the sale of a family home.  Accordingly, section 61 (5) enacts that the court should have power to postpone a sale where appropriate, having regard to the interests of all concerned and all the circumstances of the case.  It follows the trend of modern insolvency laws in permitting the interests of dependants of the bankrupt other than children, to be considered, such as the grandparents. The Central Bank was also designated as the bank which would deal with the official assignee's accounts.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the trustee clauses, the <Col N="2286" /> effect of the amendments was to retain the trustee clauses.  It was decided to retain these clauses, that is, the procedure by which a bankrupt's estate could be wound up by a trustee and a committee of inspection as an alternative to having it administered by the official assignee, because of the increase in the number and size of bankruptcies.</P>
    <P>When I say official amendments, these amendments came to the Minister of the day from the sub-committee.  Then there were other amendments which I will describe, for the sake of convenience, as Opposition amendments on Report Stage.  As I have already said they were accepted and they provide that the creditor must have at least a debt of £1,500 before initiating bankruptcy proceedings against the debtor and they ensure that the Bill must come into operation not later than 1 January next.  Deputy Michael Noonan suggested that if I felt that that type of guillotine measure might in any way frighten me off from meeting my deadline he would withdraw it.  I was quite prepared to take that on and I have no doubt that they will meet that deadline. I think it is good that the deadline is there for us because Members know that the Rules Committee have to do a lot of work between now and the time the Bill comes into operation.  I have no doubt that they will be able to meet that deadline.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris asked about the position of a bankrupt who has been awarded damages in a personal injuries case.  We have made amendments in the Bill to deal with this.  The amendments arise from discussions which took place in regard to section 122, which enacts that it will be an offence for a bankrupt not to disclose after-acquired property, that is, property which comes to him after his adjudication.  The question was raised in the sub-committee as to the position of rights of action in respect of injury to the person or character of the bankrupt and of damages recovered by a bankrupt in such actions, such as, actions for personal torts.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out that while rights of <Col N="2287" /> actions of the bankrupt generally speaking vest in the official assignee those in respect of injury to the personal character of the bankrupt do not, and furthermore, the damages recovered by an undischarged bankrupt for a personal tort do not vest in the official assignee.  In practice, this means that if a bankrupt obtains an award arising out of a personal tort the damages cannot be intercepted by the official assignee, and so long as they retain the character of damages he cannot lay claim to them as after-acquired property.</P>
    <P>There is a wide variety of cases involving awards for injury to the person or character of the bankrupt, awards for injury to his person and to his property, and awards arising out of actions for personal earnings after bankruptcy.  It is the purpose of the amendment to ensure that the provisions of the Bankruptcy Bill, which in principle vest in the official assignee on adjudication, all the property of a bankrupt, do not interfere with or prejudice the established case law and practice governing these rights of action and awards deriving from them.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (5) proposed to be inserted is based on the saving clause common to section 1 of the Statute Law Revision Act, 1896, and the Statute Law Revision Acts of 1962 and 1983, section 2 in each case, where its purpose is to emphasise that the mere repeal of a statute does not affect any established rule or practice based on it.</P>
    <P>I am very thankful to the Members of the Seanad for their help and in having this much-talked about Bill finally enacted.  The suggestion by Senator Manning that a detailed statement be prepared and issued will certainly help to ensure that the public generally will understand what we are doing here today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We had initiated a discussion on amendment No. 4 to section 15 and the Chair had indicated it was related to amendment No. 5 and other amendments which deal with the composition of the board, the number of people on the board.  In amendment No. 5, we specifically request the Minister to appoint employees of the company as directors on the board and, indeed, on the sub-board.  Concern has been expressed to us by the unions representing workers in the public sector such as the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants, the Federated Workers Union of Ireland and the Irish Transport and General Workers Union and other unions about this.  As is the normal procedure when setting up boards and sub-boards in State, semi-State and private companies provision is made for workers to be represented at the appropriate level.  That is not a request that the Minister should turn down and we are surprised that the Bill, as published, makes no provision for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act does not make reference to the new forestry board.  If the Minister agrees to include the new company under the worker participation legislation I will be satisfied.  I should like to remind the Minister that at the time Teagasc was established the Minister for <Col N="2289" /> Labour gave us an undertaking that that body would be included in the worker participation legislation.  However, the Minister responsible for Teagasc, Deputy O'Kennedy, refused to honour that undertaking.</P>
    <P>It is our view that we will not make any progress in regard to worker participation if we do not insist on specific provisions being included in legislation.  Worker participation is a good principle to be associated with and workers have a lot to offer at management level.  I have no doubt that officials in the forestry division would make a tremendous contribution to the new board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view nine is a reasonable number of directors for Coillte Teoranta.  I appreciate the reason for the amendments but an increase in the number to 12, as proposed by Senator Ferris, would not be warranted given the size and operations of the company. Frankly, 12 directors would be too many and that number would not have any real impact in terms of increased operational efficiency.  In fact the opposite could be the case.  On the general issue of worker directors I should like to state that I fully appreciate the views expressed by Senators, and others, on this.  My record shows that I have always been concerned for good staff relations, recognising as I do the important contribution which staff in any organisation make to its development. It has always been my view that the most important resource of any organisation is its staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In appointing the directors of Coillte Teoranta I am determined to select only those whom I judge to have the necessary qualities to make the maximum contribution to the development of the company which has such a vital role to play in the economic wellbeing of the country. On many occasions in the past, and indeed in the present debate, Senators have pointed out very forcibly the danger in appointing people in a representative capacity to boards of State-sponsored bodies.  I do not propose, therefore, to <Col N="2290" /> appoint anyone in such a capacity to the board of Coillte Teoranta.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise to the House that this approach does not in any way reflect an anti-worker sentiment.  As I have already pointed out, my record proves otherwise.  This simply reflects my genuine view, which is shared by many Senators, that the best way of ensuring the most effective development of Coillte Teoranta is to appoint its directors on the basis I propose.  In saying this I do accept that others have a contrary and legitimate viewpoint.  I should also mention that in my dealings with staff in the Forest Service I have found diverging views among them in regard to the appointment of worker directors to the board of the new company.  Again, differing viewpoints on an issue of this kind are not surprising.  I do intend, however, to appoint employees of the Forest Service to the board of Coillte Teoranta on the basis of the individual contribution they can make.  While the Government will make the final decision on this matter I would, naturally, welcome any views which the relevant unions may wish to offer.</P>
    <P>I also intend to avail of the consultative procedures under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988 in relation to the participative arrangements at sub-board level in Coillte Teoranta. Senators can thus be satisfied that the contribution which employees can make to the new company will be recognised in the appointment of employees to the board on the basis I have indicated. Participative arrangements at sub-board level will also be an important means of providing for an employee input into the working of the new company.  I do not propose, therefore, to accept these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I indicated in my reply that I will be appointing directors from the staff to serve on the board of the company.  I told the House that we will be proceeding to abide by the provisions of that Act at sub-board level.  If the Senator considered the position of other State bodies, for example Aer Rianta, he will see that the appointment of worker directors followed a conscious decision by management, unions and staff to begin the process of planning for the appointment of board directors.  Those ultimately selected had gone through the process of management and had been involved in the budget process and other serious matters in regard to the company. Therefore, they were ideally qualified to move from sub-board level to board level.  The important thing is that I should not say that I can nominate a person or that I can appoint directors.  The important thing is that the worker directors when appointed should be in a position to make their best contribution to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to tell the House that the Forest Service is changing from a Civil Service organisation to a new company. Many of the reports on the Forest Service have suggested that the structure is not suitable for the commercial demands that will be made on forestry in the future.  I would not like to cement the existing structure in regard to the appointment of worker directors at this stage.  I would prefer to consider a structure for the future, to commence at sub-board level and move on from there to get the best possible arrangement.  I should like to assure the House that I have travelled the length and breadth of the country to have discussions on this issue.  I met the unions involved and had discussions with staff representatives.  I heard differing views from the staff on the concept of worker directors.  Some are against the concept while others are for it.  However, I must make it clear that I accept the <Col N="2292" /> views put forward by Senators in regard to this and also those expressed by Congress who are making an issue of it.  I should like to assure everybody that the course we are travelling is a safe one.  It allows for the appointment of staff to the board by the Minister of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have very strong views on the issue of worker directors but it is important in any new organisation that we ensure that worker directors should come from two streams. There is a huge difference between a former civil servant who would be an administrator, a person who would be guided at all times by the written word, and the person who has worked in the forests.  In the development of our forests it is important that we have the views of those who have worked in them.  I accept that in the last four or five years there has been a change in forest husbandry. For example, the Forest Service do not for some reason plant trees in a straight line.  Foresters do not plant trees in straight rows any more and they do not seem to get around to pruning.</P>
      <P>This means that in 30 or 40 years time all timber will have knots and will be of a lesser standard that what is being harvested at present.  There should certainly be a forester or somebody working in that area on the board so that there would be a direct input.  If some bright spark puts forward a proposal to save £X million it should not be at the expense of whoever will be cutting the timber in 60 years time who will find that he has nothing only firewood for sale.  I have been horrified while walking through the Slieve Bloom Mountains to find that no preparation is put into the planting of trees.  People there seem to plant a tree where they get a space in the undergrowth. That is not the best utilisation of the land and it certainly will do nothing for the quality of the timber that will be harvested in 40, 50 or 60 years time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that the composition of the board has a mix of expertise and disciplines.  The new board will be an improvement on the Forest and <Col N="2293" /> Wildlife Service who have done marvellous work in the past but are clearly not able to cope with the commercialism that has ground the industry to a halt. They find difficulty in resisting the powerful multinationals who want all the forest products for nothing.  We need to have hard-nosed people on the board who know both sides of the business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, we accept that the Minister has agreed to include this new company under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988, and this is a step in the right direction.  In order to bring it to fruition the appropriate thing for him to do would be to accept our amendment No. 5.  We accept that the Minister has talked to people throughout the country, to various staff and individuals, all of whom have differing views. The only way to get the view of any group of workers is to consult with the union representing them and not with individuals. Of course individuals, whether they be in political groups or whatever, will have different views on all matters. The only way to achieve a consensus on what a group require is through an electoral process.  Congress and indeed all the unions affiliated to them have set down a structure of election whereby the workers involved at the various levels have an opportunity to vote for whoever they consider is the appropriate person to represent them at board or sub-board level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his support in this concept.  It is highly dangerous for the Minister to by-pass that procedure and to take it upon himself to decide who should be on the board, whether they be in the Minister's Department, the Civil Service or out in the forests.  The affiliated and paid-up members of trade unions are the appropriate people to decide who should represent them.  That procedure was adopted in all other State and semi-State companies set up by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a procedure that we should not lightly move away from because we could find that only workers who have the ear of the Minister of the day &mdash; not this Minister &mdash; would be sure <Col N="2294" /> of a nomination to the board and those people might not represent the views of their colleagues.  Therefore, I cannot accept the guarantees given by the Minister. I appreciate that the designation of the company under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act is a first step.  The next logical step would be for the Minister to accept amendment No. 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the Bill on this section.  Worker participation is a good concept.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach and Senator Ferris have dealt with it very well and it also has my support.  It would be very beneficial for the workers in that it would give them a sense of participation in the running of the new company.  Companies could be full of administrators who know what is happening idealistically, but realistically they might not be as well versed as persons who have been in the business or the industry for a number of years.  I have slight reservations &mdash; I would like the Minister to correct me if I am wrong &mdash; if the Minister of the day has power to appoint a worker director to the company. What Senator Ferris said about trade unions nominating people to boards of semi-State bodies possibly is a better procedure because it gives all the workers an opportunity to voice their opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to leave the House under no illusion with regard to the general practice of appointment to boards.  It is not my intention or that of some other Minister to have the board appointed at ministerial level.  The practice over a very long time has been that the Minister of the day would establish the first board.  Secondly, Senator Ferris might have inadvertently indicated that all semi-State boards have worker directors. I know he knows that is not a fact but perhaps it is no harm to try on occasions to make an argument based on that kind of premise.  Roughly seven semi-State boards have worker directors and ultimately many others, like Aer Rianta, will follow suit.  The question of worker directors should be considered &mdash; I have every sympathy towards it &mdash; in <Col N="2295" /> the light of progress made, as sub-board level.  It is clearly preferable to build on that kind of foundation and infrastructure so that there is the fullest possible participation of workers in the management of this company in the future.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald is unique in many ways because he has a capacity to be absolutely complimentary and at the same time to find a channel through which he rifles fairly ably.  With regard to pruning, I wish to tell the illustrious, long-serving Senator that the position has improved considerably in the past two years.  For a number of years very little pruning was carried out but we have restarted the process.  I accept that all the ground is not being covered but the position is certainly improving.  I do not know that time of night the Senator travelled through the forest &mdash; it certainly was in the night time &mdash; when he noticed that the lines were not straight.  That is not peculiar to the Senator alone.  I suppose there are places to travel to in the day time which are quite nice also.  I have not had the opportunity very often to be in the forests at night time but I think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the lines are very straight.  There may be occasions when there is an odd twist due to the terrain, but that would be a management decision.  The foresters in my Department and their staff are well aware of the best way to achieve a good plantation and Senator McDonald should have no fears in that regard.  I have no wish to stifle the debate on this Bill but we have given much consideration to this question. As I said, I want to accommodate the House by including, as soon as is practicable, in this Bill the provisions of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the nomination of the first board I am agreeable to the appointment of people from the staff of the Forestry Service.  I want the sub-board development to take place as quickly as <Col N="2296" /> possible and to build on that so that we can meet the wishes of this House.  I would not want to indicate that there is very much further scope in relation to this because very firm decisions have been taken already.  I have indicated the same view to the other House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 9, line 19, after &ldquo;Finance&rdquo;<Col N="2299" /> to insert &ldquo;and any proposed alteration shall be notified by the company to recognised trade unions and staff associations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Minister would have the fullest consultations with the trade unions and staff associations.  In this amendment we are requesting formal notification of any alteration by the company to the recognised trade unions.  The Minister has admitted that he has had widespread discussions.  We are satisfied that he does recognise the role of the trade union movement representing staff.  We accept that but we want to ensure that the company would also give the same recognition to the trade union movement.  In view of the attitude of many people to privatisation nowadays it is important that those representing staff and their associations would be consulted and notified by various companies of what is taking place.  If companies bring their workforce along with them, they will be more efficient and profitable, giving everybody an incentive to ensure viability, especially in the case of a new company like this one which we all want to be successful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not anticipate any great difficulty in so doing.  Let us face it, any good, commercial company will ensure there is the best possible liasion and consultation with its staff.  As Senator Ferris has said, that is most important and creates overall confidence.  The best way to ensure such confidence is that, whenever changes are being mooted which affect staff, the widest possible consultation would take place.  I can assure the House that will be the case. The provisions of this amendment would oblige a company to consult unions and <Col N="2300" /> staff on every single issue but, as the House will appreciate, from time to time in the course of a commercial business decisions are taken, many of which would have no direct bearing whatsoever on staff.  In fact, they would be to the benefit of staff but might well not lend themselves to prior consultation.  In such circumstances we are endeavouring to protect the flexibility and commercial freedom we will allow this company but in the normal process when matters affect staff the ordinary consultation procedures will be adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important request because the section reads:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in the Companies Acts, no alteration in the memorandum of association or articles of association of the company or of any subsidiary of the company shall be valid or effectual unless made with the prior approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously in any such alteration the approval of the Minister with responsibility for forestry and that of the Minister for Finance will be required.  We are requesting that at least, out of common courtesy, the company would notify the recognised trade unions and staff associations. We are not seeking their approval.  I understood from the Minister's initial response to my comments and those of Senator O'Shea that he expected that would be the case.  If the Minister will reflect our views that it would constitute good business practice for the company to do so, we will accept that assurance but we do need some assurance.  Otherwise this company could go off merrily about its business, ignoring many people with the exception of the <Col N="2301" /> Minister for Finance and the Minister with responsibility for forestry.  That is not an unreasonable request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We had this debate on the last occasion this Bill was discussed.  Perhaps Senators sometimes tend to ignore the fact that Ministers have been appointed through a democratic process and would be anxious to ensure that such matters are properly attended to.  I have no problem in giving the House a guarantee that I will be requesting the company to comply with this kind of situation in so far as it affects staff.  We are trying to ensure that there is not an obligation to consult on all business, much of which may have no direct bearing on or relationship with the staff but could be required for normal commercial and good practice in the interests of the staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (2), line 27, after &ldquo;represents the&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;minimum and maximum&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 17 basically deals with the thorny question of valuation of forestry property. I have an amendment down also for the establishment of a reserve account.  I hope that the House and the Minister will bear with me if I quote from the Report of the Review Group on Forestry part of chapter 4, which deals with the valuation of forest estates:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2302" /> 4.3 Forestry is an investment where payments and receipts are spread over periods of up to 50 years or more. There is no definitive method of valuing a forest estate.</P>
    <P>4.4 Expenditure on a forest crop is highly concentrated in the early years and the greater part of the income comes towards the end of the rotation. We used discounted cash flow methods to appraise the investment.  The discounted cash flow method converts, by discounting, all future net revenue and expenses to their present value.  This enables an investment to be appraised in terms of</P>
    <P>(a)  net discounted revenue... assuming a given discount rate; and</P>
    <P>(b)  internal rate of return.</P>
    <P>4.5 A valuation of the State forest estate can be used to:</P>
    <P>(a)  assess the value obtained from State capital expenditure on forestry;</P>
    <P>(b)  provide a periodic statement of movement in the value of the forest assets owned by the State;</P>
    <P>(c)  quantify the longer term and more recent historical performance of the State forest investment programme;</P>
    <P>(d)  provide a numerate base for decisions in commercial forest management;</P>
    <P>(e)  assist in calculating the levels of efficiency achieved in the carrying out of silvicultural operations and the influence of overheads on efficiency; and</P>
    <P>(f)  indicate the impact of non-commercial influences...on forest management decisions.</P>
    <P>That states the reason for an amendment on evaluation.  One of the issues within the forestry Department is how much our estates are worth.  In the setting up of a new company, it is essential that we have a minimum evaluation and maximum level.  In this context, amendment No. 9 to section 17 becomes self-explanatory. When you have a maximum and minimum set-up, a reserve account would then be established.  This would be a great indicator of how the new company is <Col N="2303" /> progressing financially.  If we do not have a reserve account, we can get into all sorts of problems wondering, if the valuation is set too high, whether you are putting the new company under a lot of financial pressure to try to establish a strong financial base.  If it is set too low, the company are shown as doing much better than their achievements.  The amendments are relevant and are extremely important to the setting up of the new company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment on what Senator Reynolds has been saying. I want to know how the valuation will be established.  The national forest estate is about 400,000 hectares and about 350,000 hectares of that is planted.  It has a planted value today.  The value of forests in normal growing years increases, perhaps, by about 5, 6 or 7 per cent per annum.  That is not taking into account interest, inflation and so on.  I am talking about the real value of forests as the yield increases.  In this section of the Bill the Minister talks about consulting with the company and the Minister for Finance etc. but there must be some other expertise being brought into play actually to determine the real value of the forest estate.</P>
      <P>It is very important at this stage that a real, meaningful value is put upon it. That has all kinds of implications for the performance of the company thereafter, because the valuation will be the basis on which their performance, their profits etc., will be measured.  When you make up a balance sheet for any company, naturally their fixed assets or growing assets will be a major reference point in determining the health of the company.  It is very important, when this is determined, that it is determined, first, by the right kind of people, that the right kind of expertise is brought into play to carry out a realistic and real evaluation of the estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Reynold's amendments carry the implication that the company could revalue transferred <Col N="2304" /> assets upwards in the course of time and that the Minister for Finance therefore could lose out, as his shareholding would relate only to the value of the original assets.  That, however, would not be the case.  The revaluation of the assets of any company is a normal accounting matter which does not affect shareholders' interests.  If, for example, the forest estate transferred to Coillte Teoranta were revalued upwards, the excess over the original valuation, in accordance with company accounting procedures, would be represented by a capital reserve which is part of the shareholders' funds.  The Minister for Finance, therefore, would not lose out in the case of such a revaluation. I might also mention that under section 38 of the Bill the Minister for Finance will have an important input into stipulating targets in relation to payment of dividends by the company.</P>
      <P>As I have mentioned, Senator Reynolds' amendments imply that a revaluation will always be upwards. Amendments No. 9, for example, proposes that each adjustment in the minimum value should be accompanied by a corresponding issue of further shares to the Minister for Finance.  This amendment does not cover a situation where the valuation of original assets is revised downwards.  It would be inappropriate, therefore, to incorporarte this amendment into the Bill, at it does not provide for all eventualities.  There is no particular reason why a valuation cannot be put on the forest estate and other property being transferred to the company. We intend to do that and, as was done in New Zealand in the recent establishment of their State Forest Company, to agree with Coillte Teoranta appropriate accounting principles in regard to the treatment of transferred assets.  As I have mentioned, any consequent increase in valuation can be dealt with through the capital reserve, the normal method of treating such evaluation.  While I appreciate the underlying basis of the Senator's amendments, I think that my approach to valuation is simpler, more clear cut and I do not propose, therefore, to accept them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2305" /> Finally, it has not been the practice, in establishing State companies, for the relevant Minister to be able to give on all occasions the value of the assets being transferred.  As far as I can recall, in the Bill on the transfer of Bord Telecom and An Post, the valuation was not known at the exact time of the passage of the Bill through the Houses.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister. As far as evaluation in forestry is concerned, I think that the Minister would have to agree with me that one of the major problems has been trying to set the proper value on the amount of forest estate that we have.  My amendment may not have any relevance as far as downward evaluation is concerned, but I put it in with a totally positive attitude.  I am hopeful that the company will be very successful.  As I stated on Second Stage, forestry development is looked upon as one of the major economic reforms that will help us along the road to economic rectitude.  It was a positive amendment in the sense that the revaluation would be upwards.  It is a very technical and complicated amendment.  I understand what the Minister said but the Bill basically is to establish forestry and it was with that positive attitude that we proposed the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The underlying theme of the amendment is that the value of forest estate will continue to rise in future years. The Minister gave us a warning and we should always be mindful of warnings of this kind because no commodity or product is guaranteed to keep on rising in price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the timber industry worldwide and especially in Europe, where our closest market might be, it is obvious there is a huge deficit.  I am not sure of the figures but the deficit for timbers in Europe at the moment is absolutely amazing.  There are countries in Scandanavia &mdash; and if you travelled in Scandanavia you would think all the land is covered in forests &mdash; which do not even meet their own needs although a great proportion of the land is under forestry. <Col N="2306" /> Therefore, the theme of our amendment is optimistic in the sense that it foresees the value of the forest estate rising in future years.  Given the destruction of tropical forests, the rain forests, the lack of forest growth in the industrialised parts of the world through acid rain and the fact that remedial measures are not being taken to an extent sufficient to make an impact, there is a huge market and rising prices.  The old principles of the market will come into play &mdash; when the product is scarce, the price will rise.  That is one of the oldest principles in economics.  The only thing that would spoil all that would be if timber was replaced by another product, synthetic or otherwise.  We are confident that the value of forest estate will continue to rise for at least the next 35 years.</P>
    <P>In relation to valuation, the Minister did not answer the question as to what kind of expertise he would be drawing on to put a real value &mdash; and this is very important &mdash; on forestry estate.  The Minister did not reveal at the time of the transfer to Telecom, the value of all the equipment, lines and so on transferred to the new company.  The same applied to An Post.  Nevertheless, I am sure that there exists within the Forestry and Wildlife Service a valuation &mdash; maybe not an official valuation &mdash; of all the forestry estate and perhaps the Minister will reveal that to the House today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <P>I accept what both Senators said in relation to the likelihood of a continuing upward value of the forest estate.  In relation to Senator Connor's query in regard to the European Community, the present position is that they import over 50 per cent of total timber <Col N="2307" /> requirements, valued at over £15 billion and second only to oil imports.</P>
      <P>The valuation of a forest estate is very complex.  First, it will have to be decided if average market prices for timber will be to taken in a specific year or over a previous ten year span.  Then one has to compute the maturity of the crop and work back on a discount to the present time.  It is a complex business and different figures have been put forward.  We are not at the stage where we could say precisely what that is.  It is obviously into hundreds of millions of pounds and is not essential for the passage of this Bill.  We are continuing to work on this process so that we can have the valuation at the earliest possible date but I assure the House that that is not essential for the passage of the Bill.  It is not essential for the establishment of the company and there are many examples, not only here but in other countries, where companies have been established and in some cases it has taken a couple of years before the assets are decided.</P>
      <P>We should remember that the shareholding is practically all in the hands of the Minister for Finance.  It would be an entirely different matter if there was a different breakdown to the shareholding. All those shares are held by the Government or by the Minister for Finance. Therefore, it does not make a material difference of it is somewhat greater than we anticipate at present.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The Minister shall not transfer or alienate his share in the share capital of the company.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments refer to the section which empowers the company to issue shares to the Minister to hold that part of the share capital of the company.  In other legislation, which specifically deals with the setting up of An Post and An Bord Telecom, there was a provision that the Minister shall not transfer or alienate any of his shares in either company.  If the section is passed unamended, some or all of the company could be sold off without further reference to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware that section 9 (3) ensures that any such decision of the company would have to have his approval and that of the Minister for Finance.  A similar provision strengthened the original Postal and Telecommunications Act. We are now seeking a provision that neither the company nor the Minister could dispose of this nominal share that has been given to the State in recognition of the contributions we have made down through the history of the State in putting the whole infrastructure of forestry in place.  We are now transferring it to a private company and have given the commitment to follow through with further public capital investment.  In recognition of that, the Companies Bill recognises the Minister's right to have a share in the company.  We are trying to ensure that the Minister keeps a share and if he intends to dispose of it &mdash; a fundamental point &mdash; that some reference would be made to the Houses of the Oireachtas or <Col N="2309" /> to strengthen it further by saying that the Minister should not dispose of this share. We should be grateful that the Minister is getting a share in the company but, in fairness to the principle about which we are concerned, those amendments deal with the specific section of transfers of shares.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these three amendments together as they all relate to the recurring theme of share sales and issues.  It has been said to me in another forum that section 21 is a charter for privatisation of Coillte Teoranta. In my view, that is a rather jaundiced view of the section which reflects the thrust of other legislation on State-sponsored bodies which in the case of SFADCo, Irish Steel Holdings, the national film studios, etc., incorporated similar provisions or was silent on sales of shares by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The Bill, therefore, follows the standard practice in other legislation on State-sponsored bodies, with the exception of the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983, which prohibits the sales of shares by the major shareholding Minister.  The provisions of the Bill make it clear that the State will be the major shareholder in the company and, accordingly, section 21 contrary to some views which have been expressed to me is not intended as a means to privatise the company.  It would, however, be unreasonable to put an absolute prohibition on sales of shares by the Minister for Finance or to restrict the issue of share capital in the way proposed by certain Senators.  This would be contrary to the thrust of other legislation on State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one share issue to the Minister for Energy under section 18 is in recognition of his policy and other responsibilities <Col N="2310" /> under the Bill, and thus confers on him the powers and duty of a shareholder in Coillte Teoranta.  It is highly unlikely that he would wish to sell his single share or that a buyer would be found for it.</P>
    <P>Senators have recognised that the new company must be given the freedom and flexibility to conduct their operations in the most effective way.  It would, therefore, be a negation of that principle to restrict the issue of their share capital in the way proposed by amendment No. 11. This amendment reflects similar provisions in the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983, which, as I have said, is an exception in the context of the generality of State-sponsored bodies legislation.  I do not propose, therefore, to accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has more or less assured us that, although this section would allow for privatisation, it is most unlikely to happen.  The Minister has given a commitment that this would be a busy, fruitful and functional company and that it would not be sold off.  This section will ensure that the State will retain its share in and commitment to the company.  That was why we moved this amendment.  We are satisfied with the Minister's reassurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case made by Senator Ferris.  There is a real danger in this legislation.  I accept the Minister's good faith on the issue.  I have listened closely to what he said on Second Stage but I am sure he will recognise the concern of any citizen of the State.  What is happening in the medium term &mdash; a period of five to seven years &mdash; is that we will be investing in our huge national resources.  Since we last met, I have been considering the various scenarios that would be possible over the next few years.  When I spoke on Second Stage &mdash; and the Minister referred to it on a number of occasions &mdash; I mentioned the lack of EC money which is tied very closely into this section.  It is disgraceful that, on the one hand, companies like Irish Life, a State company, can buy afforestation and qualify for European <Col N="2311" /> grants, or, that AIB, a commercial, private, profit-making operation, can buy forests and get State support while on the other hand, the State cannot get support from Europe in its afforestation project. What can we do with our present afforestation? We can let it sit there, develop and within a very short number of years, try and get a certain amount out of it every year.  As it stands now, there is a temptation for the Government to dispose of their shares.</P>
      <P>This amendment attempts to restrict the Government from disposing of their shares, a sense to put temptation out of their way, because it must be very tempting to realise that even if they put nothing into this area for the next number of years, it will develop very slowly and will be worth a lot of money to a private company.  Even though the State, cannot afford to develop our forests without a huge input of cash, if we tell Irish Life to buy them as soon as they do so they qualify for an 80 per cent grant.</P>
      <P>There is a huge temptation here.  That is what makes this Bill different from any other legislation the Minister referred to. As well as being a national, natural resource, it is also something that could be liquidated very simply by the State.  It is for that reason that we have put down this amendment.  We recognise what could be done over the next few years. Ideally, what we would like to do would be to pour hundreds of millions of pounds into afforestation and to then take our profits from it as a continuing industry in ten year's time.  I know from anything I have read about it that the Minister's Department would also wish to do that but it worries me that we are setting up something now that can actually undermine that plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the present Government or any Government out of it, and put in an unscrupulous Minister for Finance with scant regard for the resources of the nation and he might exploit the Minister's legislation in years to come.  For that reason Senator Ferris has made an extremely strong case in support of this amendment.  It is unfortunate that the <Col N="2312" /> Minister cannot see what he has accepted.  We accept the Minister's good faith on the issue.  His record is certainly very solid.  His heart is in the right place but he might not be there in five years time, not to mind his heart.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider this issue.  We will not push it but our views are very strong on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify the points that Senator O'Toole has made in relation to the grants and support to the private sector <i>vis-á-vis</i> Irish Life or Allied Irish Banks.  That does not exist in the context of the purchase of semi-mature or mature assets.  It revolves around actual planting, greenfield operations.  The same thought has run through my head on occasions.  We have to be careful not to argue against these grants being allowed to facilitate extensive planting on the basis that they are not at present being afforded to the State because what could emerge from that is that the existing grants available for that purpose could be discontinued rather than extended to the State.  We must be more positive at EC level to try to get support for the State plantation the Senator envisages.</P>
      <P>This is a general provision.  It applies to a great number of State bodies and it certainly is not a charter for privatisation. Since I went into the Forest Service there have been a number of significant advances made in terms of the resources that were made available to enable this extensive Bill to be introduced.  There has been an extension in plantation, increased harvesting and development on the EC side as far as private grants are concerned, research into further downstream processing, added value and new projects.  All of these clearly show that we have an organisation capable of quite rapid expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say to the staff in the forestry service that I am quite happy that that resource is there.  I would not like to see it too sheltered.  I would like to see it form the bodywork of the generality of State companies.  The Senator seeks to put in a provision not because he is afraid <Col N="2313" /> of me but because he is afraid of who might follow me, but whoever does take my place can, if he has a majority, change legislation if he so wishes, no matter what provisions the Senator puts in.  I want to be more positive about it and I want to respond to the reaction I have got in the Forest Service.  I do not want to see that organisation go on in too sheltered a way because it is capable of disproving the need for any kind of privatisation because the capacity, the ingenuity, imagination that are there will ensure that it will develop in a contracted and positive way. That is the general framework we would like to see in operation.  I see it a little differently in the context of forestry as being positive rather than restrictive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said, but there are two things that should be very closely addressed here. I take the point that legislation can be brought in by any Government, but what we are now facing into is a period where the State has to put a lot of money into forestry.  Let us bring ourselves forward by five years.  In five years time the right-wing press could say that we have this national asset here, this forestry, the State having paid in 1988 or 1989 £40 million per year or whatever, that is costing us a fortune and that we could sell this now for a couple of hundred million pounds.  Suddenly to the right-wing press it becomes a simple black and white situation. Notwithstandig the fact that it is a huge, growing, capitalising investment. That is one point.  We want to make it difficult for that to happen and if it had to come through the legislation that would be one way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other thing the Minister did not really address in his response to the Second Stage is that we never went eagerly enough for this EC money on this issue.  That is my view.  The blame can lie wherever it should lie; let whoever the cap fits wear it.  Perhaps we never were hungry enough to try for EC money.  One of the reasons for this is that somebody recognised somewhere that if we were to get that money it might interfere with the Common Agriculture Policy and it was <Col N="2314" /> not a very political attractive proposition to get involved in taking this particular money which might in some way impinge on the CAP.  I wish to put on the record that as far as I am concerned money for forestry would be money well spent, and if that means a reduction in the amount of money we get from the Common Agricultural Policy, then so be it.  I would not have any difficulty with that; I accept that votes are probably not dependent on that, but I would certainly take a very firm line on that issue.</P>
    <P>A selling job needs to be done by Coillte Teoranta in order to sell what they produce.  Their first appointment should be a good PRO, so that the people will know what they are doing and that this is year-by-year capital appreciation and that, therefore, we will not have somebody saying in five years time that it is costing us all this money and we could sell it: that only could we stop it costing us money but we could sell it and make a fortune for the State.  The other point I would make is that we should demand that European money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to agree with Senator O'Toole on the question of the efforts that were made up to quite recently with regard to adequate funds for forestry from EC sources.  I accept that there can be a conflict between the Common Agricultural Policy and forestry programmes.  Next week we will have Commissioner Andriessen over to further discuss this matter, but we have set in train the organs which can help us to have a sustained effort in Europe to extract the maximum support for forestry and to put that programme in the context of a roads programme or other national programme and get the financial resources from that sector to help it to develop.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of the fears of privatisation to which Senator O'Toole referred, at present the Forest Service require a fairly substantial Government commitment each year to maintain the existing programmes.  In a commercial sense one really does not have saleable shares at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2315" /> The other aspect of that is that within a few years the Forest Service will be returning a profit.  At that stage, based on my hopes for the development of forestry and what I think the organisation is capable of doing, I consider the Government will be getting a return on its investment and the pressures to move in that direction will have changed the other way around.  If we get down to business on a proper basis that is the kind of result we will get.  I accept the point in regard to EC funds and I am doing all I can to change what has been the practice up to now.  The figure up to 1987 was something like £4 million, which is a pittance.</P>

      <P>I have one concern in relation to section 30 which relates to the keeping, auditing and publication of accounts.  The section states that the accounts should be presented to the Minister who shall lay copies of them before each House of the Oireachtas.  This is a process that those of us who have an interest in these particular areas would welcome because it would give us an opportunity, limited through it might be, to have a discussion on the performance of the company.  Concern has been expressed that there is a looseness about when annual reports can be presented. May I take it that report will be produced annually?  On my interpretation of the section it would not be necessary to publish and present a report on an annual basis.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether in fact a report will be presented each year to each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

The original proposal was not to specify a particular date but rather for the report to be presented as soon as possible.  In this section we are making it completely clear that we expect a report to be made available within six months of the end of each accounting year.  As I understand it, the Companies Act provides for the kind of situation the Senator has outlined and I think we are going as far as we possibly can to make sure that all of the information which should be made available will not only be made available but will be made available within a specified period.</P>

      <P>The reason I put down this amendment is that I find the section does not deal comprehensively enough with the financial aspects of the company.  By including the line &ldquo;the cost per hectare of planting, of forestry management and of harvesting&rdquo; into the section I feel we will have a better understanding of how the company is developing, what its potential is and that it would also deal with the matter in a more comprehensive way rather than if we just referred to the financial targets of the company.</P>

In my discussions with the company I will try to ensure that that kind of information is made available but, as the Senator will appreciate, in the context of a Bill such as this, it is not necessary to go into such precise detail.  Once you start to go down that road, you will end up with 53 sections, each a mile wide, each trying to cover every possible eventuality. I can assure the Senator that in my discussions with the company I will try to ensure that that information will be made available but it is not necessary to include such a requirement in this kind of legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This section relates to the disclosure by directors of certain interests.  This matter has been the source of some considerable controversy for some time.  It is important that confidential information is not disclosed by those who might have a vested interest. I am aware that worker directors have been asked to leave meetings when the director of the company considered that the worker directors had a vested interest in what was being discussed.  This section deals with directors, some of whom we hope will be appointed worker directors if the Minister is as generous as he promised he will be today, but we are anxious to ensure that there will not be a disclosure of information which would be prejudicial to the company.</P>
      <P>As we understand it, publication of information would amount to disclosure. If, say, and this is why we have put an amendment down on the next section, a director did not publicly disclose the information but used it for his own personal benefit, in my opinion he should have declared his interest, be bound by that declaration of interest and not use privileged information for his own personal benefit if involved with a business allied with the business of the company. In other words, what we are trying to do is strengthen the section so as to ensure that it would be made absolutely clear what the Minister requires in so far as confidentiality and the non disclosure of information is concerned and that the person responsible for disclosing privileged information be liable to the payment of a fine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we will have to refer to sections 32 and 33 together but the point the Senator has raised is one which has been raised on previous occasions.  The advice I have received from the Attorney General is that the amendment would have the effect of restricting the disclosure of information <Col N="2319" /> only where it would be used for someone's own benefit, it is the intention to prevent disclosure without qualification. In other words, it is intended to cover every conceivable eventuality.  In relation to the case the Senator referred to where it was alleged that a director, who had an allied business, was using information for his own personal benefit, as I understand the law, it would not be possible to do so without actually disclosing in some shape or form the information you hold.  The provision contained in this Bill, which is also contained in other legislation, covers every conceivable eventuality.  As I have said, it is intended to prevent disclosure without qualification.</P>

      <P>I had a major row with the Minister for Communications and Energy because he allowed this section to appear in the non-amended form.  I want to compliment the Minister, his advisers, and the parliamentary draftsman that the section is appropriately worded and takes account of the special position of Members of this House who are nominated by outside bodies to contest the election.  They are not excluded under this section.  I compliment the Minister for continuing the precedent set by his predecessors.  Last week, we were in a dilemma because we could not amend a section, as the other House were not sitting and we had to accept it.  However, the Minister admitted that our point of view was valid.  I wish to put on record that this section is drafted correctly, and I welcome it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (2), line 26, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and Board of Directors.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment deals with the provisions for the chief executive.  If we were unfortunate enough to find that the chief executive appointed was not performing properly, I feel that the board of directors <Col N="2321" /> should also have a say in whether he should be removed.  I think that if only the Minister has a say in removing the chief executive, it would leave it open to political influence.  By inserting provision for the board of directors, I think it would take the onus off the Minister to have to remove a chief executive officer.  While the Minister should have a say, I think the board of directors should also be involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed that the Minister will make the initial appointment of the chief executive because it is necessary to have him in place at the same time as the board is appointed. Both have urgent tasks to perform and it is in everybody's interest to have the company up and running as soon as possible. Recruitment to such a senior and important position as chief executive of Coillte Teoranta will, as in all positions of this type, take time.  To leave it to the board of the company which cannot be appointed until the legislation is passed and the company registered would conflict with the need for urgency.  That is why the Minister is initiating the recruitment process now and making the first appointment of the chief executive following a public competition.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that in the future, the board of directors will determine who their chief executive will be.  Therefore, the initial appointment by the Minister of chief executive is for a set period of three years only.  After that, the choice of chief executive will rest with the board. While I appreciate the reasoning which underlies this amendment, I do not accept it for the above reasons.  It would be very unlikely that the Minister would take any action to remove a chief executive without proper consultation with the board.  I think the Minister would follow the normal processes in such matters and the Senator should have not great fears.</P>

      <P>In page 18, subsection (1), lines 8 and 9, to delete &ldquo;(other than land designated by the Minister)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;(other than land designated by the Oireachtas).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party were anxious that the Houses of the Oireachtas should be consulted when land is being transferred.  This section allows for the transfer of land by the Minister to the new body on vesting day.  We feel the Oireachtas should have this power as a follow through of the democratic process.  If the Minister is excluding some designated lands, then we should know what lands are designated not for sale of transfer.  There is no record of this anywhere.  I would have expected that the Minister would identify the land he is excluding in the Schedule.  If the power was to rest in the Oireachtas as opposed to the Minister, I would not have a problem with the section, because we would know and we could discuss the position.  However, at present I do not know which land the <Col N="2323" /> Minister is going to keep or sell.  Therefore, I feel that the amendment is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In the nature of things, discussions will take place between my Department and the new company on the transfer of land.  Perhaps both parties will accept the necessity for the State to retain small parcels of land for particular purposes. At this stage, however, it would not be possible to specify what land will be retained.  In any event, I think it is entirely inappropriate for the Oireachtas to become involved in the designation of land.  That is a function proper to be discharged by the Minister in consultation with the company.  I do not propose therefore to accept this amendment, although when the matter is resolved, I would be prepared to provide information to the House on the specific land, if any, being retained.</P>
      <P>May I say, however, that it is not certain that the Minister will be retaining any land.  While we are talking about a transaction involving a transfer of a million acres of land, it could well be necessary for different reasons to retain certain parcels.  As soon as we have worked out those in consultation with the company, I would be prepared to provide that information to the House.  However, there is no definite knowledge at the moment in regard to what lands, if any, might be retained.</P>

Of course they will; they would be very foolish if they did not.</P>

After all, this is our land and we have given the Minister responsibility for it under the Constitution, for the time being.  I hope he does not run away with it.  We want to know what he intends doing with it.  The Minister's response to my questions has been welcome and I will not press my amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In my amendment I am seeking to ensure that there will be a balance of knowledge on the board.  It is my view that very knowledgeable people work in the forests and it is appropriate that they should be included in the membership of the board. The Minister may tell me that non-industrial or industrial civil servants will remain on the staff of the Department of Energy because, technically, they will be considered to be staff but there is a classification of staff in the Department.  The <Col N="2325" /> worker in the forest, while he is on the staff payroll, may not be considered to be a member of the staff.  The related amendments refer to the same terminology about staff members in the Department.  I hope the Minister will respond to my appeal in regard to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who is designated to join the staff of the company by the Minister will receive all the benefits accruing to the remainder of the staff. The amendments relate to the same general theme.  The provisions in the Bill in relation to the transfer of staff are the same as those in the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983. They reflect the fact that in this case the company will be staffed by people currently employed in the Department of Energy and that the Minister for Energy can only transfer staff from his own Department to the company and so the guarantees will only relate to such staff.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the case of the postal and telecommunications bodies a small number of staff transferred to them after vesting day from other Departments as a result of competitions.  In that instance they followed the conditions of the competition.  I am sure that in similar circumstances Coillte Teoranta will do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amazing that the Minister quotes the 1983 Act when it suits him but ignores sections of it when it does not suit him.  If we were to follow the principle of that Act the Bill before us would be framed in a different way.  The Minister has made fundamental changes from the provisions of the 1983 Act.  He did not adopt the provision in regard to shares, and the disposal of them, and stated that it would be inappropriate to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the 1983 Act in this context because it incorporated a number of very satisfactory provisions as far as staff were concerned.  The results in these companies indicate the soundness of the line adopted at that time.  The <Col N="2326" /> Senator accused me of using provisions of that Act when it suited me but I must point out to him that I have not used them any more than he, and his colleagues, did when trying to prove their point.  It is important to point out that the forestry company will have its own distinctive features. It is not my intention to blindly copy any provision in previous legislation. I want to have the best legislation possible for the services I am responsible for.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 5, after &ldquo;Finance&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and on foot of an order made under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is my view that this technical amendment is needed.  There is a technical defect in the subsection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained on Committee Stage, section 9 (3) is an enabling provision designed to give the company flexibility in regard to its future development while at the same time allowing the Minister for Energy, and the Minister for Finance, in view of their shareholding in the company and their responsibilities to it, a necessary input into this development. The subsection, therefore, embraces the twin concepts of flexibility and, as I described it on Committee Stage, a safeguard in that it is only reasonable that the two major shareholders in the company would have an important say in its general development.  The safeguard to which I have referred is thus not intended to prevent anything in particular from happening but rather to ensure that the Ministers in question have adequate powers to discharge this role.  A decision to become a public limited company is a major one affecting the development of Coillte Teoranta and should not be left to the company alone.  It may be asked why it is necessary to include this subsection in the Bill.  It is included because section 21 (2) allows the Minister for <Col N="2328" /> Finance to sell his shares in the company. In essence it is, as I have said, a technical enabling provision, no more and no less, to cater for this possibility, with the additional advantage of providing for the consent of the two Ministers before the company could become a public limited one.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that section 9 (3) is designed to facilitate the privatisation of the company.  With respect, such a view can only be based on a misreading of section 21 (2).  When we discussed the earlier amendment on the latter subsection I made it clear that it was not intended as a means to privatise the company and that it would be unreasonable to put an absolute prohibition, contrary to the generality of State-sponsored body enactments, on the sale of shares by the Minister for Finance.  Since section 21 (2) is not designed to privatise the company, it follows that this subsection, which as I have said is a technical enabling provision flowing from the existence of section 21 (2), has no similar intent.  I would have to say, therefore, that having accepted the general thrust of the Bill in relation to the future development of the company and the role of the State in regard to it, it would be a regressive step to provide for the involvement of the Oireachtas in what is essentially a technical matter of detail, the possible reregistration of the company.  In my view, the State's interest is fully protected in requiring the consent of two Ministers to such an eventuality.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that when we discussed this matter on Second Stage and Committee Stage we recognised that this additional subsection to section 9 was an additional provision which is not included in the now famous Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983.  We were aware that that Act, in the Minister's own words, proved to be deficient in that under company law the Oireachtas or the Minister could not prevent a company set up under this procedure from privatisation and the company would not be required to consult with anybody.  This <Col N="2329" /> additional provision states: &ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall prevent the company from availing of any provisions of the Companies Acts enabling a private company to re-register as a public limited company, but such provisions may be availed of only with the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  At least the approval of the Minister with responsibility for forestry and the Minister for Finance will now be needed.  This was not the case previously because this additional provision was not included and that was negligent.</P>
      <P>The Minister has assured me that this is a positive inclusion.  It is now the Minister's prerogative to have this application made to him by the company and he and the Minister for Finance to insert this additional provision so that that would be done on foot of an order made under the Act.  If the Minister makes an order it comes before the Houses of the Oireachtas and that gives us a say in the matter.  Although I know that the Minister has offered forestries for sale without getting buyers for them &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he cannot convince me that he does not have some idea in the back of his mind that perhaps it would be in the best interests of the forestry if it was all sold off.  I hope that some element of control is maintained.  The Minister has confirmed that control will be maintained and that approval will not be given lightly and I accept that commitment from him.  This is an additional safeguard which provides that it must be borne by order and that would give us an opportunity to debate it in the House.  If the Minister does not accept this amendment I will have to formally request that my dissent be recorded because the Minister will not accept the amendment on the principle of democracy and consultation with the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Joe O'Toole that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need to establish a pilot scheme for Teilifís na Gaeltachta because £0.5 million has been set aside from the National Lottery by the Government since November last for this scheme.</P>

      <P>Is deacair i gcónaí moladh den sórt seo a chur faoi bhráid an tSeanaid nó aon áit eile, mar tá andeighilt, ceapaim féin, idir mhuintir na Galltachta agus muintir na Gaeltachta, agus ní gá go mbeadh.  Ach an moladh atá idir lámha againn anséo um thráthnóna, níl sé chun aon rud speisialta a fháil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Ní aon sórt &ldquo;stróic&rdquo; é.  Ní aon phribhléid atá á hiarraidh agam, agus ní aon ró-fhábhar é.  Níl mé ach ag iarraidh go mbeidh cothrom na Féinne ag muintir na Gaeltachta. Tríd na blianta tá go leor ráite againn agus seanráite againn, ar athbheochan na teanga.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leis na blianta anois, táimid sásta an jab a fhágáil ag na scoileanna.  Ceapaim féin go bhfuil an lá sin thart agus go bhfuil sé de chúram anois orainn fuinneamh éigin, fuinneamh nua, a instealladh i bhfeachtas na teanga.  Tá an chontúirt ann i gcónaí nach mbeidh Gaeilge ag an nglúin óg nua.  Caitheann leanaí óga níos mó ama ag féachaint ar theilifís faoi láthair ná riamh cheana.  Ní amháin RTÉ, anois, ach na satailítí chomh maith, agus tá siadsan ag craobhscaoileadh isteach sna tithe ar fud na tíre, Galltacht agus Gaeltacht.  Tá sé de dhualgas orainn anois seirbhís theilifíse a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta chun go mbeidh cosaint agus tacaíocht ann don Ghaeltacht agus don teanga.  Gan amhras, is polasaí é ag an EC cosaint a thabhairt do na mionlaigh chiníocha, agus le teilifís Ghaeltachta bheadh an teanga ar fáil sa chomhthéacs céahna leis an mBéarla.  Bheadh sí mar chuid de ghnáthshaol an tí, bheadh sí <Col N="2333" /> mar ghríosú don gnáthdhuine an teanga a úsáid go nádúrtha.  Níl mé, mar a dúirt mé, ag iarraidh aon ró-phribhléid do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Chuir mé an t-ábhar seo ar an athló mar, suas le sé mhí ó shin is dócha, bhí roinnt áirithe airgid ón gcrannchur náisiúnta curtha i leataobh ag an Rialtas. Cuireadh ar leataobh é chun é a úsáid mar fheachtas teilifíse.  Idir an dá linn dúirt an Taoiseach, uair éigin in áit éigin, ní cuimhin liom an comhthéacs i gceart, gur chóir an t-airgead sin a úsáid chun seirbhís Ghaeltachta a chur ar fáil.  A Chathaoirligh, caithfidh mé a rá ag an bpointe seo nach bhfuil an t-ábhar mar a léadh amach é cruinn ceart.  Ní dúradh gur cuireadh an t-airgead ar fáil do fheachtas teilifíse, agus dúirt an Taoiseach é féin gur mhaith an rud é a úsáid do scéim phíolóta do Theilifís na Gaeltachta a chur ar bun.  Agus sin atá i gceist agamsa tráthnóna.</P>
    <P>Níl sé mar aidhm agamsa go mbrúfaí an Ghaeilge siar sa scornach ar dhaoine nach bhfuil aon taithí nó nach bhfuil aon ghrá acu don teanga.  Níl mé ag rá anseo ach go mbeidh seirbhís theilifíse chomh maith ag na daoíse sin a bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu mar theanga labhartha.  Sin an méid atá á rá agam.</P>
    <P>From the foundation of the State we have dutifully and faithfully had as an objective the restoration, use and support of the Irish language.  The responsibility for achieving this objective over the years has been vested in the education service and, in particular, in the teaching profession. In a sense we have been happy to leave it that way.  But nobody can be happy waiting 50 or 60 years for the Irish language to come into everyday usage.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have tended to refer the restoration of the language to our schools in an almost &ldquo;file it and forget it&rdquo; attitude.  If the language is to have any hope of surviving it must be used, and seen to be used, in a natural, everyday context.  Television constitutes the most powerful educative force in our homes today &mdash; there is no doubt about that &mdash; there is nothing to match it in terms of power and influence.  Therefore, it constitutes an essential tool in the <Col N="2334" /> object of increasing the use of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>The Gaeltachtaí themselves, being the source of the language, must develop naturally, progressively and without discrimination. Because television is part of everybody's life nowadays it must also be part of theirs.  It should be remembered that the people of the Gaeltacht deserve as good a lifestyle and quality of life as anybody else.  They deserve the option of having television in their language.  If we are to develop and encourage a new generation of Irish speakers it is critical that the media be available to them in their language.  It is important to understand that very often people in the Gaeltacht experience difficulty in the use of the language.  There are various views on it, some people believing it a hindrance to them, others believing it to be a source of support for them.  If we are committed to our culture and language then we need to give the language every support by greater use of it.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I do not believe that the Irish language is so weak as to be deserving of protection.  Indeed we can be over-protective of it.  The reason I am proposing a television service for the Gaeltacht here today is that it is my belief that if we are to retain our culture and language, they must be allowed intermingle with modern technology, media and current lifestyles.  I contend the language will withstand that test and can only develop therefrom.  Nothing kills a language quicker than isolation; it must move apace with technology and progress.</P>
    <P>The case for a pilot scheme to establish Teilifís na Gaeltachta is accepted, people generally regarding it as a worthy project. The State must now support the people of the Gaeltacht, with Teilifís na Gaeltachta comprising an essential component of that support.  We must give the people of the Gaeltacht their due.</P>
    <P>The new pilot scheme I am seeking will not create a new demand on the Exchequer in the sense that £0.5 million have been set aside for the project. Indeed the Taoiseach himself has indicated that, in his view, the most worthwhile <Col N="2335" /> project would be the establishment of a Teilifís na Gaeltachta service.  Therefore I recommend that the nettle be grasped and that that service be provided.</P>
    <P>Mar i ndáiríre, an méid atá ar siúl againn anois ná cosaint a thabhairt don teanga.  I mo thuairimse tá an seans deireanach anois againn chun tacaíocht a thabhairt don teanga.  Ceapaimse go bhfuil an ghlúin dheireanach ag teacht, an ghlúin dheireanach a mbeidh aon seans againn Gaeilge a thabhairt agus a choimeád mar theanga choitianta i measc na ndaoine.  Mar an ghlúin óg seo, tá siad ag feachaint ar theilifís Bhéarla.  Is Béarlachas atá timpeall orthu.  Níl mé ag rá go bhfuil aon rud mícheart leis an mBéarla mar theanga, ach más rud é go bhfuil sé mar aidhm againne an Ghaeilge a chothú, tá sé de dhualgas orainn anois an tacaíocht seo a thabhairt chun go mbeidh an ghlúin óg atá ag fás aníos in ann féachaint ar theilifís á craoladh trí Ghaeilge agus go mbeidh siad in ann an teanga a úsáid go nádúrtha.</P>
    <P>Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeimís réidh chun rud mar seo a thosnú agus a chur ar bun.  Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh na gnáthsheirbhísí atá ag muintir eile na tíre ag muintir na Gaeltachta chomh maith.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that what is allowed and available to the people on the east coast should similarly be available to people on the west coast.  The fact that they speak the native language of the country should not disimprove the quality of their lives but it should be a reason for us to discriminate positively in favour of muintir na Gaeltachta.  We have a very serious role to play in this matter.  I am not asking for very much here.  A pilot project allows the Government to do very intense monitoring and surveying of the effect of such a television service.  They can judge the demand.  There has been a group working on Teilifís na Gaeltachta examining and researching in that general area for two years and they have certainly assessed that there is a demand for a television service for people living in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh sé le rá agam go raibh an Seanad in ann tacaíocht <Col N="2336" /> a thabhairt don tseirbhís seo do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus go raibh an tseirbhís sin ar fáil.  Ar deireadh, ba mhaith liom go mbeadh sé mar pholasaí ag an EC, mar shampla, go mbeadh gach tacaíocht tugha do na mionlaigh chiníocha san Eoraip agus, mar sin, gur chóir dúinne an tacaíocht chéanna a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>Tá an chosúlacht ar an scéal, ón rud atá curtha síos ag an Seanadóir O'Toole, agus ón gcaint atá cloiste againn, go bhfuil míthuiscint ann maidir leis an gcuspóir atá leagtha amach don airgead atá á chur ar fáil ón gcrannchur. Ní miste a rá go soiléir, ar ndóigh, nach bhfuilim ag lochtú an tSeanadóra de bharr na míthuisceana seo, os rud é gur eol dom go bhfuil an mhíthuiscint chéanna léirithe go minic sna meáin chumarsáide ó fógraíodh an soláthar atá i gceist.</P>
      <P>Is maith liom, mar sin, mar chéad rud, a shoiléiriú don Teach seo gur fógraíodh £0.5 milliún ó fháltas an chrannchuir náisiúnta do scéim phíolóta do theilifís Ghaeilge.  I bhfianaise air sin tá dualgas orainn ceist iomlán na teilifíse trí Ghaeilge a mheas, ceist Theilifís na Gaeltachta san áireamh, ionas go dtiocfar ar an mbealach is éifeachtaí chun an t-airgead a chaitheamh lena chinntiú go dtiocfaidh an tairbhe is mó as an soláthar speisialta seo don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht i gcoitinne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Táid ann a déarfadh gurb é an cúram is tábhachtaí a d'fhéadfaí a chur i gcrích leis an airgead seo ná seirbhís phíolóta don Ghaeltacht, agus is é an tuairim sin atá taobh thiar den rún anseo anocht. B'fhéidir go bhfuil an ceart acu.  Ach ní mór a chur san áireamh cad é a gheofaí leis an £0.5 mhilliún dá gcaithfí é ar an mbealach sin.  De réir moltaí atá feicthe agam, bheadh sé beartaithe leath den airgead a chaitheamh ar chostais chaipitil &mdash;&ldquo;hardware&rdquo; mar a deirtear i bhfoclaíocht an lae inniu &mdash; agus bheadh na cláracha a dhéanfaí le scaipeadh thar réimse 40 míle, i.e. chlúdófaí na teorainneacha thoir agus thiar de Ghaeltacht Chonamara. B'fhéidir go sásódh sé seo muintir <Col N="2337" /> Chonamara.  Ach cad mar gheall ar mhuintir na nGaeltachtaí eile?  An bhfuil siadsan le fágaint ar an ngannchuid?  Nó an bhfuil córais chraolta dá gcuid féin le cur ar fáil dóibh sin freisin?</P>
    <P>Bhí Meitheal Oibre ar Chraolachán Teilifíse trí Ghaeilge i mbun oibre anuraidh agus chuir siad tuarascáil chuimsitheach ar fáil i mí Bealtaine 1987. Meitheal oibre ab ea í a bhunaigh Aire na Gaeltachta agus Aire Cumarsáide na linne, ar a raibh ionadaithe ó Roinn na Gaeltachta, an Roinn Cumarsáide, Bord na Gaeilge agus Radio Telefís Éireann. Cé nach raibh aon trácht ann ag an am do sholáthar ar leith ón gcrannchur náisiúnta, scrúdaigh an mheitheal oibre an cheist seo maidir le scéim phíolóta do Theilifís na Gaeltachta os rud é gur ceist í atá á lua le roinnt mhaith ama anuas.</P>
    <P>Ní miste a lua gur bheartaigh an mheitheal oibre, tar éis an cheist go léir a mheas, nach mbeadh feidhm fhónta ag scéim phíolótach dá shórt.  Mheas sí gurb é an t-easnamh is mó a bhaineann le teilifís do lucht na Gaeilge, bíodh siad laistigh nó lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht, ná cláracha fiúntacha ardchaighdeáin, agus b'é a dtuairim mheáite go mb'fhearrde ar fad aon airgead a bheadh ar fáil a chaitheamh ar chláracha dá leithéid a dhéanamh lena chraoladh ar an líonra mar atá d'fhonn ábhar an phrógramaithe a chur ar fáil don tír uile seachas do réigiún píolótach amháin.  D'aithnigh an mheitheal, ar ndóigh, go bhféadfadh seirbhís phíolótach spéis áirithe a mhúscailt ina tús ach gurb í fírinne an scéil ná go mbeadh leá chúr na habhann ar an spéis chéanna mura mbeadh na cláir ar aon chaighdeán go seasta lena mbíonn le feiceáil ag breathnóirí teilifíse ár linne.</P>
    <P>Is léir, mar sin, go bhfuil tuairimí anéagsúla ann maidir le conas ab fhearr tabhairt faoi cheist na teilifíse trí Ghaeilge &mdash; bíodh sé do dhaoine ar spéis leo an teanga laistigh nó lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Dá bharr sin tá gá le comhráite cuimsitheacha le saineolaithe éagsúla agus na tuairimí uile a mheas go hiomlán d'fhonn a chinntiú go rachaidh cibé cinneadh a dhéanfar faoi dháileadh an £0.5 mhilliún ón gcrannchur náisiúnta chun leasa na Gaeilge ar an mbealach is <Col N="2338" /> éifeachtaí is féidir.  Is é sin an toradh atá ag teastáil uainn go léir agus féadfar talamh slán a dhéanamh de go ndéanfar an cinneadh sin agus go bhfógrófar é a luaithe is féidir.</P>
    <P>A sum of £500,000 was provided from the proceeds of the national lottery for the development of the Irish language TV programmes on a pilot basis and not as many have thought specifically for a Gaeltacht television service.  The matter is a complex one and has been examined in detail by the working group on broadcasting in Irish whose report was published some time ago.  The Taoiseach said that the question of the Gaeltacht TV service was one worthy of consideration and this is being done in the context of the wider question of Irish language TV programmes on a national basis.  Discussions have taken place with RTE, the Department of Communications and other interested parties.  The matter is complex but I would be hopeful that a final decision on the best way in which the £500,000 can be used will be made in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Taoiseach's words have been fairly widely broadcast and understood, or may be misunderstood. The clear understanding that people had was that the Taoiseach was supportive of the setting up of this project for Teilifís na Gaeltachta.  Having given that commitment to people, in one way or another, I call on the Taoiseach to deliver on that commitment at a very small price.  Nothing the Minister said contradicts what I said.  What he has been saying is that he is putting it into a broader context.  I am asking the Minister if the Taoiseach can deliver in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Le ceist a chur, a Chathaoirligh, an dtuigeann sé go raibh feachtas ar bun le bliain anuas anois, go raibh cúig mheitheal i mbun oibre le bliain anuas agus go raibh said ag caint le muintir Ghaeltachtaí Chorca Dhuibhne, Dhún na nGall, Mhaigh Eo agus áiteanna eile?  Agus cé gur thuig daoine go maith nach mbeadh an réimse craobhscaoileadh pioc níos forleithne ná Conamara, is dócha, mar sin féin go bhfuil tacaíocht don scéim seo <Col N="2339" /> agus don tionscnamh seo ó mhuintir Ráth Chairn, Chorca Dhuibhne, ó mhuintir na Rinne i bPort Láirge, Mhaigh Eo agus Dhún na nGall.  Má thuigeann an tAire é sin.</P>
    <P>Knowing there is widespread support in other Gaeltachtaí for the idea of a pilot television service to be set up, even if it can be done in only one for the moment, could the Minister take on board that because people in the Gaeltacht would want this to be done, therefore it should be done?  Do the Government understand that cláracha fiúntacha ardchaighdeáin are important.</P>
