      <P>I have notice from Senator Padraic McCormack that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to comment on the job losses in the industrial sector as a result of the laying off of staff in Thermo King and if he will take action to alleviate the situation and ensure the maintenance and expansion of the workforce there.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>We want clarification about the fine.  I asked the Minister was it a once-off fine of £500, and whether it could not be increased for a second offence because of the endorsement.  Am I right in saying that, if there is a third endorsement, a transfer is allowed in respect of this special restaurant licence, rather than the ordinary liquor licence? In other words, this licence could not be transferred from one person to another without clarification or without agreement with Bord Fáilte and the Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>As well as a fine the mandatory provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Act will apply to any conviction for the contravention under the terms of a special restaurant licence.  Under the mandatory endorsement system, the first conviction so recorded on a licence continues so recorded for a period of two years; the second conviction so recorded continues for four years from date of conviction; and in the case of a third and every subsequent conviction so recorded on such licence, it continues so recorded for a period of six years from the date of conviction. Three live endorsements mean that the licence is automatically forfeited.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of whether or not that can be transferred to another person, the Intoxicating Liquor Act provides that on a bona fide sale of a liquor licence in the premises to which is attached, the court should direct that any existing endorsement shall cease to be recorded on the licence.  Where a licence is transferred otherwise than on a bona fide sale, the first conviction of the new licence holder is not endorsed on the licence.  The reliefs are available where a licence held by a nominee of a company is transferred by the company to another nominee.  These aspects of the law relating to endorsement of licences are complex and could not be adequately dealt with within the scope of the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that special licences were non-transferable, and that you would not be allowed sell off the licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>They are transferable. There is no special provision in the Bill about the non-transferability of a licence. If the Senator has a restaurant and decides to sell his restaurant, he sells it as a going concern and the licence is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>To transfer this special restaurant licence from one person to another there must be agreement.  Bord Fáilte and the courts must not object.  Is that correct?  In other words the person could not just transfer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That point arises when the licence comes up for renewal in the following September.  The sale and transfer could take place in between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>We did say with these licences that for the first year we could be talking about 100 or 120 premises throughout the country.  The Minister said there are speciality areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could a person who had a specialist licence, or a special restaurant licence, sell off this licence to a person who was not a specialist in the business that he was going into?  This could create a situation where a premises was being sold to a person who would not have the same facilities or the same knowledge as the person who already had the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I readily accept the concern of the Senator.  I can see that he is making a very valid point.  That danger is there.  It is unlikely that somebody who knows nothing about a particular business would invest heavily in a business where the initial licence fee of £3,000 would only be a very small percentage of the total cost of the whole operation.  It is very unlikely that somebody would go into a business unless he had a qualified person to run that business for him.  Even if that were so, that licence would come up for renewal the following September. The Bord Fáilte certificate would then be <Col N="248" /> required.  The conditions as laid down in the regulations would have to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting point raised by Senator Cregan.  My interpretation of it is that the special restaurant licence is attached to the premises, whereas a pub licence is granted to the individual.  Perhaps the Minister would correct me?  This issue is fundamental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is right in the sense that a licence is attached both to the premises and to the person; it is part and parcel.  There is a question of the suitability of the person and the suitability of the premises.  The licence covers both.  This is one of the most complicated areas that we have been dealing with in a long, long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister answered my question when answering Senator McGowan.  The licence is not like a full public house licence where you can transfer it and sell the licence to any other part of the city.  It is attached to the premises and cannot be transferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that there are very few liquor licences now being transferred to any other premises except in places subject to a CPO or being knocked down and the licence goes for sale elsewhere.  It goes for ordinary sale and one gets a particular price for it. It depends on what area it is in.  The licence stays with the premises.  The vast majority of licences are always with the one premises.  Let us be realistic about that.  There is a point where you can transfer, I do not deny that, but this you cannot transfer.  That is where I got confused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>You could have a restaurant that would cost in the region of £40,000 including the equipment.  There is £3,000 for the licence.  This person, <Col N="249" /> after a period of nine months, cannot say &ldquo;I wish to sell to another person for £40,000,&rdquo; He has a licence for £3,000. You could say: &ldquo;I bought my premises as a publican and the most important part of that premises is the licence that was in that premises in that area at that time&rdquo;. That is the point I want to make.  I want to be fair to everybody here.  After nine months this person can sell it to Michael Murphy, which he does.  Now Michael Murphy has a premises which cost £40,000.  We will say he gave Jimmy McCarthy £60,000 for it, so Jimmy makes £20,000.  Michael now has a licence which cost £60,000 in a particular area but the pub around the corner will cost £200,000. All I want is to be fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I try to explain the position to the Senator?  I am Michael Murphy in this sense and you are Senator Cregan and you have a beautiful restaurant at your figure of £30,000.  You provided a first-class high quality establishment which qualifies for the special liquor licence which you get for the additional sum of £3,000 which was 10 per cent or 5 per cent of the total cost.  I would say the percentage would be even less than that by the time you had a site bought, the building prepared and everything paid for, the kitchen, and so on.  If you want to sell that, and if you find somebody like me prepared to give you 50 per cent on top of what you provided for, I think you are exceptionally lucky.  I could do exactly as you have done for the same amount of money and have the same facility, probably better designed because my taste might be somewhat better than yours, for the same amount of money and therefore, you would have no problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he would be very strict.  Now he is saying quite the opposite.  He is saying he can do better than I can do because he might have a better idea than mine.  He is admitting that it will be quite loose, quite easy. I am not saying that it should not be, but I do not want to discourage anybody else <Col N="250" /> who may put so much into their businesses. Many people have put hundreds of thousands of pounds into their businesses. Now a person around the corner can set up for £50,000 or £60,000.  We want to be quite careful about.  Can we get clarification?  Is there agreement between all of us that Bord Fáilte should be very strict?  That is the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed because the Minister and Senator Cregan are now buying and selling from one another.  Has the Minister forgotten about the restaurant he gave me yesterday?  He is now buying Senator Cregan's one.  Could I just revert back to a previous section? We are giving the guidelines to Bord Fáilte.  We set the terms which will be the absolute minimum they can adhere to.  If they have less than that, they will not get a licence.  If and when anybody gets this special licence and if they want to sell the premises in the meantime, if there is a complaint they will be subject to their licence being revoked even before it is due for renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is how I read it.  It is not a permanent thing.  It can be revoked at any time.  The power of cancellation of this special licence is there if the standards drop, no matter what the premises are.  Even if a person is selling out for economic reasons, the purchaser will know that he has to achieve the same standard as before.  If the standards have dropped he is likely to lose the licence. That is my reading of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my reading of it, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  My restaurant is still on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Cregan has a pub in the main street, and Larry Murphy has a restaurant in Canal Stret or Baggot Street, there is no way that he can transfer the restaurant licence to the premises next door in the main street? <Col N="251" /> That is actually the difference, if I am interpreting it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no way that can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>That bears out the point I am trying to make in another way.  A person can set up a restaurant, provided Bord Fáilte say it is OK, for £3,000, plus what he has to pay to set up the restaurant, no matter where the pub is.  In other words, if there is a pub in Baggot Street and the person next door decides to set up a restaurant, he can do so provided he puts the necessary equipment into it.  He can be in competition then with the pub.  That is the point.  In actual fact, a person can say: &ldquo;I am in the Educational Building Society and it is not going too well so I am going to open up a restaurant&rdquo;.  He can do that for £3,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I will try to help the Senator.  The licence is only obtainable when the restaurant is in existence and when that restaurant meets the standard regulations laid down by this House.  It is only then that he can apply for the licence.  Our regulations, which we will give Bord Fáilte, will be so strict and so watertight &mdash; and that is up to each one of us here &mdash; that we will not have a mushroom growth overnight of restaurants of the type Senator Cregan envisages and wants to avoid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>How long has a restaurant to be trading before it can get a restaurant licence?  If a person opens a restaurant who has never been in the restaurant business before, how long does it take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If a restaurant premises opens today and if its primary purpose is to supply food of such a quality as will meet the standards laid down by Bord Fáilte in the regulations which we now are going to give them to comply with, the owners will apply for a certificate to Bord Fáilte.  On receipt of same they will go to the court and be given their licence for a 12 month period.  At the end of that <Col N="252" /> period, they will be inspected to see that they have complied, and are complying, with those regulations in relation to the question of renewal of the licence for the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If a restaurant opens up for a year and is not complying with the regulations, nothing could happen until the end of that year.  Bord Fáilte would not have had any experience of this restaurant previously because it had not been trading as a restaurant&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>When the application is made by the restaurateur Bord Fáilte will send their competent staff to see what the position is on the ground.  Having had that inspection carried out, they will then decide whether or not the premises comply with the requirements.  If they do so, they will issue the licence to sell drink with meals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>They can carry on the restaurant business in the meantime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>They can carry on the restaurant as a restaurant serving food.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 16.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 16 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a requirement that the restaurant shall not contain a bar. Could the Minister give a definition of what a &ldquo;bar&rdquo; is?  The normal definition is a place where you can go up and sit at the counter and look for a pint and have a drink.  I can see nothing wrong with an actual counter in a restaurant to which the waiter goes, gets a drink and brings it back to the table.  I do not know what a &ldquo;bar&rdquo; is.  Could I have a definition of a &ldquo;bar&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In an effort to help I will read from the definition of a &ldquo;bar&rdquo; as in Part I of the Bill:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" />&ldquo;bar&rdquo; means any open bar or any part of a licensed premises exclusively or mainly used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor and shall include any counter or barrier across which drink is or can be served to the public.</P>
    <P>That is the legal definition of a bar.  We have already dealt with a waiting area in an earlier section.  I had to strive very carefully &mdash; and God knows it was not easy &mdash; to see to it that a waiting area is not a bar.  A waiting area is exactly a waiting area where drinks may be partaken of while persons who are legitimately waiting for a meal may sit in company with their friends and have a couple of drinks.  It will not be a bar as such.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Ferris' concern here.  In Northrn Ireland they brought in legislation like that and in a very short time the whole concept &mdash; the concept we are trying to introduce here &mdash; was totally exploited.  There was a colossal growth of a new type of bar overnight and it was out of control in the shortest possible time.  Instead of having licensed vintners selling drink in the normal public house style, they had restaurants selling drink in the normal public house style. They had a free-for-all which went out of control up there.  That is the experience from which we tried to learn in an effort to give what we call special restaurant licences, the primary purpose of which is to allow ordinary people to have ordinary drinks with their meal when they are out for a night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Minister's worry.  Anybody who says to me that you can set up in the drink trade today is not allowing for the way you have to serve it under regulations from the breweries.  Facilities have to be provided to ensure that the drink is served at the proper temperature.  That happens today although many people may be unaware of it.  It is a fact of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Senator ever hear of having a half and a half?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="254" />
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way you can give a half and a half now is to heat the glass.  I do not see Bord Fáilte getting on top of it if a similar situation to that which occurred in Northern Ireland were to arise here.  The Minister has put a lot of thought into and emphasis on the fact that these are special restaurant licences &mdash; specialist areas.  In theory that is excellent, but when this becomes law a person who is not a specialist can use this in his own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator help me, please, by telling me what he is saying?  Is he suggesting that there will be full bar facilities in the waiting area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who tells me that there will not be is suffering from delusions, with all respect to the Minister. I serve a lot of drink.  You have to have bar facilities to serve drink today. You have to be able to pull from a tap. If I want a pint of our local product, Murphy's, or a pint of some other product, the taps have to be there.  You must have the facility.  If the person who is drinking does not see the tap he wants to know what he is getting.  You, I and everyone will want to know if we are getting the right drink, because we are paying enough for it.  It is liquid gold now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>You must have some facility in front of the person.  You must have equipment there.  You must have taps.  There are many lagers now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Let me assure the Senator that there is no intention whatsoever to provide bar facilities in the waiting area.  If we are talking about a reputable restaurant &mdash; which is the only type of restaurant that will qualify for the special licence &mdash; we must accept and assume that we are getting what we are paying for, and probably paying well over the odds for.  Otherwise, <Col N="255" /> we can take our custom somewhere else on the next occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister is saying, but the fact is that the breweries will insist on special facilities being provided to serve the drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The breweries may be in a position to dictate to the vintners, but the breweries cannot ever dictate to the Houses of the Oireachtas in the enactment of legislation.  I am not being smart when I say that.  Senator Cregan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I could help Senator Cregan here.  It is not necessary to have a bar in a waiting area.  Most restaurants at present &mdash; and I use quite a few restaurants &mdash; are selling drink and have been for a number of years.  They have what would be called a backroom, or an area away from the waiting area and the restaurant where I imagine they would instal those taps.  They do not necessarily have to be out front.  I hope this is what this Bill is all about.  You might as well hand out full liquor licences to every restaurant if you were to allow a bar in a waiting area.  It certainly is not necessary.  I do not see that the brewers will be in a position to dictate to the restaurant owners as to where they can put anything.  They may do so to some extent with public houses, but I could not see it happening in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand now the Minister's predictions about the number of special licences and why they will be so low.  Some of the best restaurants in the country at the moment have a bar in their waiting area.</P>

      <P>If they have a full licence they will not want these licences at all. There has to be a clear distinction between what we call the &ldquo;full licence&rdquo; and the special licence.  The easiest thing in the world would be for all of us to destroy totally the monopoly which is held by the vintners' trade if we were reckless and had no regard whatsoever for the investment they made.  We could say: &ldquo;Let us wipe the slate clean; let us do away with the monopoly; let us do away with everything; let there be a pub at every crossroads.&rdquo;  That would be the easiest way to do it.  We are not doing that.</P>

      <P>I am speaking now not from any personal interest but because I come from an area which has a number of problems.  These are brought about because the Border counties, especially Donegal, depend largely on tourism.  We have a hotel training college in Killybegs. We have a major investment in the tourism industry and depend largely on it. The tourists who come to County Donegal come from jurisdictions where there are more liberal laws.  Clubs are the inthing at the moment in the North.  I have a difficulty and I am asking the Minister for guidance and help on how we can satisfy those who have a major investment in the industry in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from an area very close to the Border.  I know people who have major investments in the industry, whether it be in the entertainment industry, the hotel industry, a new restaurant, or a simple pub?  On Saturday and Sunday evening they are forced to close down in the hours of daylight when young people are ready to sit down and have a drink in the evening. When every pub, hotel and club in County Donegal must close, if they are <Col N="260" /> not to break the law, you can drive across the Border and have an open door to a club quite close to the Border, run by the Church, which actually has a very strong voice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and survived. There are recreational centres and clubs. The laws on licensing hours are not being enforced in the North at all.  That is a problem for people who have invested heavily in the entertainment business, the hotel business and the promotion of the tourism industry in County Donegal.  The drinking hours just across the Border are lax.  There are no restrictions, that I can see, imposed by the law.  Therefore, young people are being encouraged to cross the Border and do their late drinking there.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the Minister has adopted a helpful attitude.  The most helpful aspect of the Minister's approach is where he says that he will hold a watching brief, that he will review it, if necessary, in 12 months.  I would dearly love to bring in a simple law that would wipe the slate clean and have equitable hours for everybody.  That would have been very acceptable.</P>
      <P>There is a special problem in the Border areas and in County Donegal, where we depend upon tourism as a major employer of young people.  We depend largely on visitors from Scotland, the UK and the North, where the same restrictions on drinking hours do not apply.  On Saturday and Sunday evenings centres of entertainment will be hard-pressed to conform to the laws across the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>My questions are related. I agree with what Senator McGowan has said.  There are many changes taking place in society.  If we address the problem of under-age drinking, we can have a reasonable approach to what ordinary civilised people are entitled to.  Indeed, people who have made a major investment into the sale of drink &mdash; there are some legitimate people involved in this trade &mdash; are concerned about the hours that are being mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to under-age drinking later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to paraphrase what I have said.  We cannot make the laws a little more liberal without addressing that problem, and it is a problem.  The Minister has gone a long way towards addressing the problem and I agree with his suggestion of optional identification. That is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>In regard to the closing hours, there is a problem in the Border areas which Senator McGowan has talked about, but there are people in non-Border areas who have made major investments in their pubs and have facilities for dancing and parties.  They have even built large extensions for GAA clubs to have their dinner dances, and so on.  They comply with the existing law and with the regulations on closing the bar and re-opening it later. This is a crazy arrangement.  Suggestions have been made that, with the changing pattern of Mass going &mdash; there are still a lot of believers who go to Mass, thank God&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>These hours are relevant to Mass goers because people now go to Mass on Saturday afternoon.  There were reservations from the major Churches about people drinking into the early hours of Sunday morning and on Sundays at particular times, and that was related to their obligation to go to Mass and Communion.  It is now being suggested by responsible people in the trade, who are also Mass goers, that Saturday night drinking hours could easily be extended to 1 o'clock on Sunday mornings, without doing any harm, because most people have been to Mass and they are out for the evening having worked hard all week. They suggest that is possible without infringing on anyones beliefs, and that 12.30 a.m. should be the absolute maximum on Sunday nights.  Otherwise there would be interference with people's ability to go to work on Monday.  Those representations have been made by responsible people.  Perhaps the Minister would reply to this suggestion.  The amendments deal with the opening hours and people who have made a major investment in this industry are worried about them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to concur with the remarks made by Senator McGowan and Senator Ferris on this section and, in particular, the social change that has taken place over the past ten years.  People go out at weekends.  So far as entertainment is concerned, the only nights that are of any benefit to <Col N="263" /> people running functions are Saturday night and Sunday night.  For various reasons Saturday night is the big night for running socials or functions and, as the previous speakers said, premises must close at 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. and the functions must stop.</P>
      <P>To solve the various problems that exist in the liquor trade at present we should allow a Saturday night extension up to 1 a.m.  From my experience, people running these functions have to supply drink up to 1 a.m. and 1.30 a.m.  The Minister's remarks yesterday on the duties of the Garda Síochána in dealing with serious crime were aired extensively in the media and were received very well. I had three telephone calls last night and one this morning about his reference to the duties of the Garda in the future, which went down very well.  We do not want to have the Garda Síochána, as he said, running in and checking these premises, 99 per cent of which are properly run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the social change, a high percentage of people now go to Church on Saturday night and have a rest on Sunday morning.  I would make a strong case for a Saturday night extension.  I agree with Seantor Ferris about taking the bar extension back to 12.30 a.m. on Sunday night on condition that the person who has a licence for an extension could run their functions through from, say, 9 p.m. to 12.30 a.m.  As proposed in this legislation, you can only have an extension from 12 o'clock to 1 o'clock.  On Sunday night a premises must close down at 11 o'clock.  There is a half hour drinking up time and then there is half an hour in which the premises must be emptied or, if not, the glasses must be taken off the table.  We then expect them all to come back at 12 o'clock to continue with the function.  That is unreasonable and unrealistic. It is not enforceable and it is not practical.  I agree with Senator Ferris that 12.30 a.m. is late enough on a Sunday night, if a premises could remain open <Col N="264" /> from, say, 8.30 p.m. or 9 o'clock until 1 o'clock.  I do not want to be longwinded.</P>

      <P>I welcome the change in the closing hours of pubs and places which sell liquor.  Since the Bill was drafted I have had several discussions with publicans and with customers in my area and it has been well accepted throughout the country that closing time on Sunday night will now be 11 o'clock, whether it be summertime or wintertime. This has been requested for a number of years and I welcome it.  Also, it is important that there should be 30 minutes drinking up time.  Ten minutes drinking up time was a little out-dated.  That will also give sufficient time to publicans to have their premises cleared.  Closing time at weekdays, especially in the summertime, of 11.30 p.m. with a half an hour drinking up time, which means 12 o'clock closing, has been very well accepted.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on making a tremendous effort to meet all sections of the community and on having had discussions with them about this Bill.  In so far as my county is concerned, which is a tourist county, the closing hours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When they accept it in Kerry, a tourist area, I think it is pretty well accepted all over the whole country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel I should say again, and say with all the solemnity that I can command, that nobody here should be under any illusion whatsoever about this law being enforced right across the board. I am saying that because of one or two remarks that were made earlier.  Let that be clearly understood and let that be the message that will go from both Houses of the Oireachtas by the time this Bill is enacted in the legislation.</P>
      <P>I will come back now to the important points raised by Senator McGowan.  I appreciate the difficulties the traders have in the border regions.  I understand that.  I understand what unfair competition is all about in any walk of life. It is very difficult to survive even with normal competition but, when it is unfair, it is practically impossible to survive and naturally then it leads to very serious problems.</P>
      <P>I understand, as of now, that the normal licensing laws in Northern Ireland are perhaps even more restrictive than ours but I appreciate that there is a very serious problem in Northern Ireland with the colossal growth in clubs, many of them illegal that has taken place in recent times.  I presume the Church club is a legal one, but there are many illegal clubs there.  It is no secret that many of these clubs are used as sources of income for subversive organisations.</P>
      <P>Uniformity in legislation, particularly in legislation of this type, is of prime importance.  I will do what I can with those whom I meet within Northern Ireland on a very regular basis, through the Anglo-Irish Conference, to discuss this problem with regard to clubs and club hours.  I do not think it is in anybody's interest to have young people driving helter-skelter at 12 o'clock, 1 a.m., 2 a.m., or 3 a.m. crossing the Border for additional booze.  I do not think it is in anybody's interest in the Border areas, in particular, where there are many problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGowan suggests that we should consider making special provision tor Border areas.  That would be one way certainly of doing it &mdash; that some provision should be made for the Border <Col N="266" /> counties and that they should be given something to compensate for the unequal or unfair competition on the other side. As soon as you do that for Counties Donegal, Sligo, Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim, you are bringing the liquor border further south.  Eventually we will find ourselves down in Cork, and they will be stuck, which would be unfair and wrong and then we would be in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there is a problem there.  It is interfering with tourism, although I am convinced that European tourists, &mdash; Senator Ferris and I had a very slight but most gentlemanly difference on this yesterday &mdash; and most tourists who visit south west Kerry in the summertime are not late night drinkers. They like their good quality meal, and surprisingly enough, from what I know, many of them go to the little B and B's where the fisherman has brought the fresh lobster from the sea, the bit of crayfish or the bit of flat fish, or if he has the licence, a bit of salmon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Has he a licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>You can catch salmon if you are properly licensed to do that.  I have had occasion to holiday in Donegal and observe the tourists there.  The tradition is different.  It is a late night affair that goes right through practically to breakfast time.  They do not pay for beds. They just have their breakfast.  They do not need beds; it is a different thing altogether. There is the problem there.</P>
      <P>I want to be helpful and to try to meet public demand &mdash; bearing in mind the overall good.  For God's sake do not let anybody ever think I want to legislate for morality; I do not.  I hope nobody thinks that because nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to what Senator Cassidy said about those who wish to have a drink, the very great majority of people who go out to have a drink on a Sunday night, I have been assured by the licensed vintners, both city and rural, that an 11 o'clock closing time plus half an hour to drink up and vacate the premises is more <Col N="267" /> than adequate to meet the demands of their customers.  I had a certain amount of difficulty with one organisation I met at least a half dozen times because they changed their tune every time I met them.  We would agree on something and the next day one of their lobbyists, on a professional basis, would have statements issued turning everything on its heels.  It came to a stage in the end where I had to say: &ldquo;I am now satisfied that this is the position&rdquo;.  In summertime on a Sunday night people will be able to have their last drink, and at 11.25 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. they are away.</P>
    <P>We must worry about absenteeism which is a serious problem.  Let nobody here think it is not a serious problem.  I am now putting on my hat as an employer and I am putting on my other hats that I wore in different Ministries over the years.  It is a damnably serious problem that is costing the taxpayers a great deal of money and something we genuinely never faced up to.  I say that deliberately. We have never genuinely faced up to it. I do not care what statistics are put up by vested interest groups.  I reject their accuracy because I am talking from practical experience.  Absenteeism is costing the genuine taxpayer of this country a lot of money.  The highest rate of absenteeism is on Monday morning.  That is a fact.  I believe the Sunday night drinking is late enough as it is.</P>

      <P>The Senator is too helpful to me at this stage.  There are young people who want to enjoy themselves, as we all did, and who want to go dancing. Now the pattern has changed, as patterns do over time, and it is almost impossible, it appears &mdash; and I do not accept this either &mdash; that you cannot enjoy yourself dancing on a Sunday night unless you are steamed to the gills with alcohol that should be readily available at highly inflated prices until 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock in the morning.  I do not accept that.  I think it is totally unnecessary.  It is very <Col N="268" /> wrong that that should be the case.  We have struck a fair balance here.  If public houses must be vacated at 11.30 p.m. on Sunday night, there is one hour available from 12 o'clock to 1 o'clock for younger people who want to go disc-oing.  If that is not sufficient, there is something very radically wrong.</P>

      <P>About two hours.  Could I make a point with regard to the new hours?  I have been involved all my life in the drinks trade.  Senator Cassidy has made a very good point and I would have to agree as a person who never drank. The Minister answered in a very fair way when he said that there is a concern that there is too much drink in areas where we do not need it.  We are given the impression that you cannot go anywhere without drink.  It is sad that people who are very dedicated to the music business cannot create an atmosphere where there is happiness between a boy and a girl &mdash; a very good and natural thing &mdash; without making sure that there is a licence. People will not come unless drink is served.  Perhaps dances should start earlier and finish at the same time as the pub is closing, or an hour later.  Then people would not be going to the premises for drink.  I never went for a drink before dancing.  I am glad of that because I think I would be a lunatic altogether if I were drinking.  In the vast majority of places throughout the country the accepted way of enjoying oneself is with live music and dancing.  I do not think we should be selling something else to the disco scene. Discos are good also.  I like a disco even though I am getting on but, at the same time, we must recognise what Senator Cassidy said.  I have seven children, from 25 years down to ten years and I listen to what they want to say.  I listen to the trend of today.  The idea of going to a live dancehall and being content without drink is not &ldquo;on&rdquo;.  It is a packed area with excessive prices, £6, £7, £8 to get in, particularly on long weekends and holdays. This is unfair.  If a fire officer inspected the premises there would be total havoc.  Can the Minister in some way provide in the next Bill from the Minister for Tourism &mdash; if he has a right to do that &mdash; that people should get the facility they require and make sure that it can be there without having excessive drinking?  The Minister made a point about absenteeism on Monday morning. <Col N="270" /> The Minister was not wrong.  I do not deny it.</P>

      <P>I want to be helpful to the Minister and I want to narrow the debate down to two points which he did not refer to in his reply.  On Sunday night the time of 11 o'clock is a fair time. All are in agreement with the Minister, publicans included, that 11 o'clock on a Sunday night is the correct time in the summer.  It is the problem of the hotel trade and the trade that has a special exemption on Sunday night that I want to put to him.  Closing for half an hour, when everything has to be off the table for half an hour for a dinner dance or function, from 11.30 p.m. to 12 o'clock is not workable.  It cannot be enforced. It is not possible to put everyone out of the premises and drink cannot be cleared off all the tables and then come back and open the bar in a half an hour.  Can the Minister let them run the function from 8.30 p.m. to 1 a.m. on a Sunday night?</P>
      <P>The other point is with regard to Saturday night.  Eighty-five per cent of the dancing premises in the Twenty-six Counties are open on Saturday nights until 1 a.m. and the majority of them are open until 1.30 a.m. serving alcohol.</P>

I hope to start the examination for that review at the fall of the year.  The points raised by the Senator in relation to unfair competition in the areas he has mentioned &mdash; and this applies to Senator Cassidy also &mdash; will have to be looked at in great detail.  It is 25 to 60 years since we have had a proper, worth-while look at licensing laws.  Seeing the way life patterns have changed that should never again be allowed to happen.

      <P>(b)  in fact sells or exposes for sale any intoxicating liquor or who opens or keeps open any premises for the sale of intoxicating liquor in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable upon summary conviction thereof, in the case of a first offence to a fine not exceeding £400 or in the case of a second or any subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding £800.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> This is a questionable area.  The Minister was fair when he said he allowed the situation to change in the other House. The definition of roles in this part of this section is very awkward.  I am not saying that a person who serves drink after hours should not be fined.  I am not saying that a person who wants to keep people on the premises after hours should not be subject to a substantial fine.  The definitions of &ldquo;a person on the premises&rdquo; and &ldquo;a person serving drink after hours on the premises&rdquo; are different.  The definition of the person on the premises after hours and the definition of the person selling drink on the premises after hours are totally different.  Take a Saturday night when say the gardaí walk in at 12.05 a.m. and 50 people are in the lounge who should have been out of the premises at 12 o'clock because there is half an hour of drinking up time.  The person who is most put out is the publican, whether we like it or not, even though the person on the premises will be fined up to £50.  The publican must make a case to the local sergeant or garda who will ask why the premises were not cleared.  A reasonable argument can be made.  I am one person who is not quiet about clearing my premises. The vast majority of publicans lose more friends in the last half hour in clearing their premises than they do all day. There is no doubt about that.  How does one protect in this Bill the person who is doing the best he can to clear a premises? It is not easy to do this.  The Minister is saying that he should be fined £400.  I am not saying that he should not be fined £400 if he sells drink after hours.</P>

      <P>The situation up to recently is that anybody in breach of the licensing laws had a mandatory endorsement. At the time the thinking was that mandatory endorsements were far too severe a penalty because they eventually affected the livelihood of the publican who continued to break the law and that mandatory endorsements should be removed.  I was told by people in the trade like the Senator that £2,000 or £5,000 does not matter.  Now we have the mandatory endorsement removed and there is a maximum fine of up to £400 at the discretion of the judge for a first offence.</P>

      <P>What law?  For serving drinks after hours or for having people on the premises after hours?  That is the point.  I have no objection to fining somebody the maximum amount.  There was not a mandatory endorsement.  There may have been an endorsement but it was <Col N="274" /> not mandatory.  You may get an endorsement. On a point of clarification, it does not necessarily mean that every person who was fined for serving drink after hours in a public house got an endorsement. He may have gotten an endorsement but if he got a second one it could not be removed and that is what we got removed in the Courts Bill in 1986.  The point I want to make is that when there is a person on the premises it does not necessarily mean that the publican who owns the premises wants him on the premises, but he cannot remove him. Physically, he cannot remove him.  Why should the publican be fined £400 if he does not want the person on the premises even though he has served drink up to 11.30 p.m. and has given him six pints at 11.30 p.m. as he must do because the law says so.</P>

      <P>Up to 11.30 p.m. on a Saturday night during summertime I must give a person a drink that he asks for because the law says so, provided that I do not think he is drunk.  I must give him four pints or three half-ones if he wants them and he is entitled to sit down for half an hour and finish them.  This is why the question of half-an-hour drinking up time is of vital importance.  Anybody who thinks that the half-an-hour drinking up time is going to be easy is wrong.  It will make it harder on people who have to implement the law.  It will be harder on the licensee.  I want clarification on this.  I have no objection to saying that if a person serves drinks after hours he should be fined.  If I fill a drink at 11.40 p.m. and the person who is on the premises at 12.10 a.m. is caught by the law and tells the garda: &ldquo;He gave me a drink at 11.40 p.m.&rdquo; then I am liable to a fine. If I give that drink at 11.30 p.m. or before 11.30 p.m., I should not be fined for doing so if the person wants to sit in the premises after 12 midnight.  I want clarification on this.</P>

      <P>Senator Cregan has a very good point here.  The proposed legislation does not say what the minimum fine is.  I know a village very close to me where 57 people were in court last week because they were all drinking one and a half hours after time.  The four publicans were fined £10 each and the people on the premises were fined £3 each.  This is making a laughing-stock of the law and of the gardaí who are trying to enforce it.  While the Bill states what the maximum fine is, it does not state what the minimum fine should be.  There should be a minimum fine of £50 per person caught on the premises after hours because, as Senator Cregan says, it is practically impossible to clear a premises. What back-up have the licensees got from the law for this work?  As the Minister said &mdash; and I repeat it again &mdash; the gardaí should not be the people who will try to clear premises for publicans.  If there is a minimum fine of £50, it will not be too long until people generally will get the message and then there will not be any trouble in enforcing the law.  Unless the law is enforceable, unless the law as fear in it, people will not abide by it.</P>

      <P>I mentioned this point on Second Stage of the Bill.  It is very important. Now that the drinking up time has been extended from ten minutes to 30 minutes, people will be inclined to have a large amount of drink in front of them after last drinks are served at 11.30 p.m. and they might insist that they wish to stay on the premises until 12.30 a.m. to consume what they legitimately bought. Here the barman is in a very difficult situation as they are his customers.  They brought the drink but they have to be out by 12 midnight.  The legal obligation should now be on the customer to leave the premises by 12 midnight.</P>

      <P>There is a lot of validity in Senator Cregan's suggestion. I said at an earlier stage in this debate that we must use the change in the licensing laws as a new beginning for publicans. I say that as a publican myself.  Having said that, I have no doubt in my mind that publicans will still be serving drink at 11.50 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating the reality, and I hope this is what debate in the House is all about, realism.  On the basis that publicans would accept the new legislation as a new beginning, we should be prepared as legislators also to make it somewhat easier for them in relation to their efforts to run a reasonably good operation.  In recognition of the fact that publicans may not sell alcohol after 11.30 p.m. now there is an onus on customers to leave within the restricted time.  There is always the danger that if you go to some licensed premises &mdash; particularly at weekends &mdash; you will see six or eight people with two or three pints in front of each of them.  This is going to create difficulty.  I would certainly subscribe to the view that the customer will have to take his share of responsibility in this case.  The principle is being conceded here but the emphasis will have to be shifted to the customer at this juncture and I think we should accept the amendment on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose of all the items in the Bill these particular sections have <Col N="277" /> created most controversy in the countryside because of the experience of everybody in the trade in trying to live within the law.  As Senator Cregan said, we made changes previously which removed the danger of a licence holder losing his living in spite of his best efforts to try to get people off the premises.  Short of physically assaulting people it is quite difficult at times to get them off the premises. The extension of drinking up time will assist provided, as Sentor O'Callaghan said, the emphasis is put on the customer.  This is essential and it has been asserted by all the publicans here that none of them wants to break the law or condone people who break the law and would insist on maximum fines for those who are found breaking the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the other end of the spectrum, there are the people who within the law were sold a drink up to the end of serving time and gave the rest of the drinking up time to doing that, but who were still on the premises discussing the match, the winner of the next dog race, or whatever, with no drink.  Those people could be fined and the publican could be summonsed. We must address these problems that are arising on the ground.  If we are not conscious of them happening, we are not living in reality as legislators.  Let us be fair with one another and fair in regard to what we want the publican to do and what we want the customer to do. There must be an area in between where responsibility should not necessarily rest with the publican who had made every effort and that the customer who has complied with the regulations on drinking but who is still on the premises.  It is extraordinary that being on the premises is an offence although they might be discussing something legitimate without even drinking or they could be drinking Ballygowan.  They could be talking with a cumann member about the intricacies of what was happening in your constituency ten minutes after drinking up time with no drink.  The publican could be fined for having people on the premises. He would not lose his licence now. This is happening and we should try to <Col N="278" /> address the problem.  The Minister has admitted that this is a very difficult area.</P>

      <P>There is a lot of merit in this amendment but at the same time, in regard to the £400 maximum fine, it is provided that if a case is made to a District Justice by a publican the justice will not impose the maximum fine when the publican has difficulty getting people off the premises.  We all realise from being in pubs after hours sometimes, maybe five minutes after hours, the difficulty some publicans experience in clearing the premises.  If the publican made a case to the District Justice, I feel the maximum fine would not be imposed.</P>
      <P>During my 20 years in politics I have heard criticisms from all the publicans in my constituency and, indeed, the hoteliers regarding the problem they had about endorsements.  I discussed this Bill for the past four or five weeks with many of the publicans in my constituency.  All of them are delighted that the endorsement has gone.  There was not much criticism about the £400 fine.  Most of them admitted that they would have to be more vigilant in the future to ensure that the house is cleared at the proper time.</P>

      <P>I agree with the argument so eloquently put forward by Senator Cregan.  The problem of people being found on premises is a bone of contention with practically every publican.  I suggested to the Minister the other day that he should look at the system in operation in the UK where they cover the taps with a towel or a cloth.  Whatever drink has been purchased prior to that may be finished at leisure and customers may leave the premises almost in their own time. As Senator Cregan said, you cannot physically remove people from the premises. In the old days they could be taken by the scruff of the neck and tossed out onto the street.  The position at the moment is that, if you lay a hand on anybody, you are sued for assault.  It makes it practically impossible to clear the premises at times.  I ask the Minister to look at the system operated in the UK to see if we could bring it into operation here.  At <Col N="279" /> closing time a towel or cloth is placed over the taps and, if anybody is caught serving a drink after that time, they should be fined and fined heavily.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister about a publican who has to provide entertainment as nearly every publican in Donegal does.  Few pubs will do business if entertainment is not provided for the custonmers.  If one pub has entertainment the next must have it.  This is an area of major difficulty.  I ask the Minister to explain how the publican who priovides entertainment should cope with the situation where a large crowd is on the premises.  Does this imply that everybody has to leave once the entertainment is over and that the responsibility lies with the publican?</P>

      <P>One of the points made by Senator Bohan which perhaps the Minister might consider is that in the past 20 years we have become a more litigious society.  I know from my own experience that you cannot literally look crooked at people now.  There was a time, as Senator Bohan said, when you could take a person by the scruff of the neck and put him out the door.  You cannot even think of doing such a thing now.  It has created an extra problem in relation to clearing the premises.  In the context of what has been said here, I know that the Minister has made the point time and time again that this Bill is a watershed, that he is coming back to it.  I think, without dragging out the argument &mdash; we have exhausted it, as I am sure he will agree &mdash; the Minister might in his reply give an indication of his thinking so that when he does come back to review the legislation he might look at this particular element of it.</P>

The entertainment should finish when the bar closes at 11.30 p.m.  Then they have a half-hour drinking up time to clear the premises.  If the fine is severe enough on <Col N="280" /> the customer there should not be any problem in clearing the premises.</P>

      <P>We seem to forget a few basics here.  We are getting ourselves slightly confused.  This amendment is tying up two different sections of the Bill. It is tying up section 29 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act of 1962 which has to do with permitting persons to be on licensed premises during prohibited hours.  The amendment is aimed at the substitution for £20 of £300 and the substitution for £40 of £60.  That is going back 26 or 27 or 28 years.  I could not tell Senators what the price of the pint was at that time.  We are also dealing with subsection (2) of section 25 of the Bill which states:</P>
      <P>Every person who shall sell or expose for sale any intoxicating liquor or open or keep open any premises for the sale of intoxicating liquor or permit any intoxicating liquor to be consumed on licensed premises in contravention on this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof, in the case of a first offence, to a fine not exceeding £400...</P>
      <P>These are two different sections.  I am not saying anything to Senator Cregan or anybody else for getting the two sections mixed up because the same thing happened in the Dáil.</P>

The publican who decides at 11.30 at night he is not going to break the law by selling drink may do as Senator Bohan suggests, put his towel on his taps and stop serving. Part of the responsibility of the licence <Col N="281" /> holder is to ensure that stockpiling should not be allowed to accumulate to such a degree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When I was trying to listen to them in delegations they broke my heart because they changed their minds every time they came near me with what they wanted and what they did not want.  I am telling the Senator what we must do.  We are enacting legislation that will be in vogue and, if after 12 months, it needs to be reviewed, we will have a look at it and we will see how best we can try to put it right.  It is the type of legislation that needs to be looked at on a continuing basis.  The publican may not sell drink after 11 o'clock on a Sunday night or 11 o'clock any night of the week during the winter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Please give me a chance. Let me try to make my case as best I can. The publican may not sell drink after the permitted hours winter or summer. There is a half hour there by which time the publican must have his premises vacated.  Up to now the publican had little or no clout in getting the customer out because all the onus was on the publican to put the customer out.  There was a fine of £2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in a paper in the South of Ireland published in the city of Cork about 104 people who were found in a public house on Christmas Day and each person was fined £2 and the publican was fined £40. That is some respect being created for the law.  Let us be reasonable about it.  I say the situation must be like this.  I go back to what Sentor O'Callaghan tried to say.  There has to be a genuine effort by <Col N="282" /> the publican to ensure that the customer has in the drinking up time &mdash; he might not want a half hour drinking up time; five minutes might be good enough for him &mdash; enough time to finish his drink in comfort and then vacate the premises in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants to hear the old guys we knew going around in the pubs in Dublin with the coins in the glasses, rattling them and driving everyone half mad, off lights, on lights, opening doors, letting in the cold air and doing everything to freeze people out into the street.  None of that should be necessary.  If the publican is sensible, if he is reasonable, if he is well-intentioned and running a good house, he will not give the young man who comes up to him at five minutes or two minutes to 11 o'clock six pints on a tray.  He should know his business, know that man is down there, that he has two or three people in his company.  That is his responsibility as the licence holder.</P>
    <P>We will be going into further responsibilities of the licence holder when we get to the under-age drinking problem.  The onus there, too, is on the person who is privileged to have that licence, a privilege to be a part of the monopoly which many resent exists to have that licence.  There are conditions to fulfil which must be fulfilled if he wants to hold on to the licence; otherwise we would have a free-for-all. I will not accept for a second that any publican can stand up here or anywhere else and say he is going to serve booze illegally at 11.50 p.m.  He will suffer the full might of the law if he does that and he will be looking for a mandatory endorsement on his licence. Nobody will have any sympathy for him; I do not care who he is.  That is as it should be.</P>
    <P>There will be practical problems.  I give in to Senator Cregan on this.  I accept all the weaknesses of custom and competition. How can you refuse a friend at 11.10 p.m. or 11.15 p.m. &mdash; give me one more and I will be gone.  That is your responsibility and you have the right to refuse at that time if you want to run your house as it should be run within the law.</P>
    <P>I believe that the fines we are talking <Col N="283" /> about are minimum fines.  The customer now will be fined up to £50 if he is found on the premises.  Up to now he was fined £2.  That will make the customer think that he too must vacate the premises.  If Senator Cregan or anybody else runs a pub and decides: &ldquo;I will not sell drink after 11.30 on a Saturday night; I will close down; my barmen will get out from behind the bar as and from closing time&rdquo;, that is one way of doing it.  I worked in a bar.  You get out from behind the counter. You are not there to fill the glass. There is nobody there.  I do not know whether the towel over the taps will stop people from filling their own.  It did not years ago but perhaps it might now.  If you are not behind the counter you are not tempted.  If you are out from behind the counter helping people, you get people out of the way.  I believe that very much.</P>
    <P>In the event of the gardaí coming in and the house is not vacated when it should be vacated, they will note that there is nobody behind the bar.  They will note that drink is not being served and that, in the event of a prosecution, will be conveyed to the judge who will say: &ldquo;Right.  Mr. Murphy was making every effort to clear his bar&rdquo;.  The judge then has authority to decide if he will fine you £1, £5 or £6, but he cannot go any higher than £400.  If the customers are there and the gardaí take their names, these customers can be fined up to £50 for not vacating the premises when they too have a responsibility to go.  There is no other way to do it.  If Senators find me another way I will give them a guarantee that in 12 months time I will be back here with improved methods of doing it.</P>

I do not knock them in any way because in Cork there are excellent club facilities outside the drinking facilities which provide great pastimes for our youth and, indeed, for their <Col N="286" /> parents as well.

You were handed a bowl of soup, beef strogonoff spelled backwards, the leg of a chicken and a few chips in a plastic container, and that was sufficient to flout the law for the purpose of selling drink at a discotheque.  That was totally wrong and we have to try to devise ways and means by regulation rather than by legislation to tie that down. I said in the other House that I am thinking of a price in the region of £5 for a meal.  There are people who will say they do not eat soup with a meal or that they do not eat dessert for health reasons.  We are trying to work out something there. I want to stop the cowboys from abusing this system.</P>

      <P>I am not holding the Minister up.  I have not spoken on this at all.  I only speak when I have some relevant point to make and I will not keep the Minister.  In the context of the £5, could I just make the point that in relation to the live band industry where there are increasing overheads as distinct from a disco, the admission price incorporates the cost of the substantial meal as defined in the existing legislation.  If the Minister proceeds as he has proposed with a £5 charge there will be an additional price added onto the admission in order to pay <Col N="290" /> for the overheads caused by the provision of live entertainment, as against a disco, or where you have a man with a couple of records under his arm who only asks a fee of a few bob from the owner of the licensed establishment.  In the context of live bands, the price at the moment is roughly of the order of £4 to £5 which incorporates the substantial meal content. In the context of what the Minister is talking about &mdash; I know it is by ministerial order &mdash; will he keep in mind the live bands end of things?  If he includes the £5 with an admission price of about £7 or maybe £8&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to what Senator McGowan said about the difficulties facing cross-Border and Border county establishments I did not come in on it earlier because I felt the point was being laboured.  Could I just make one small point?  In a large variety of cases &mdash; like Senator McGowan, I come from a <Col N="291" /> Border county &mdash; it is not just the liberalisation of the law in Northern Ireland that has motivated people to cross the Border.  It is the difference in the price structure between North and South.  That is the main reason people go across the Border.  There are many successful establishments in the Border counties that are existing very successfully.  I suggest at this juncture that perhaps the licensed establishments providing live and disco entertainment in the Border counties might consider upgrading and refurbishing their premises in order to compete more effectively with many of the establishments Senator McGowan referred to in the cross-Border area.</P>

      <P>This is the section on which we talked about those possible special exemptions that might be applicable to places that have made tremendous changes in facilities and have club dances, live entertainment, a meal, the bar having to close down and then open up again.  This specifically says that there will be no special exemption granted at any time on a Sunday or at any time between 1 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. on Monday morning.  We are suggesting that, if a licence is applied for for a special function, there should not be this necessity to close down and open up again because it is inoperable on the ground.  There are special reasons on a Saturday night for an extra hour or on Sunday night for the extra half an hour which should be allowed when registered, licensed people have a special function. We should not have this sily arrangement of opening and closing because of ordinary bar hours.  There is a complication there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 14, Part III, before section 30, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;30.  As and from the next annual renewal of a licence to which section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927 applies any early closing condition attached to that licence shall be abolished.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a particular licence that applies to some people who have licences to sell drink until a certain time.  I am asking the Minister to consider giving these people the same benefits and condition as any ordinary licence holder, in other words, their type of licence should be abolished and they should be entitled to an ordinary licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am slightly confused because this has not got to do with section <Col N="293" /> 30 as it stands in my Bill.  It appears to be a new section 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, the conversion of restricted licences, including early closing licences, to full seven-day licences was facilitated.  Under this provision an early closing licence can be converted to a full licence by extinguishing one other restricted licence or a full licence.  This is a much lighter requirement than the normal requirement for obtaining a full licence.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be that early closing licences would be automatically converted to full licences, without any provision for the making of a payment to the Revenue Commissioners, as was provided in 1960.  This raises very complex issues, detailed examination of which would be required before a final decision could be made.  It would be difficult to justify special arrangements for early closing licences if they were not also granted for other restricted licences, such as the six-day licences.  Full information would have to be obtained as to the location of these restricted licences throughout the country.  Existing holders of full licences in the areas affected would have a legitimate interest in any provision which would increase the number of full licences locally.</P>
      <P>If a fee were to be charged for conversion, as was done in 1960, the amount then fixed would have to be substantially increased.  The 1960 Act made provision for the establishment of a restricted licences conversion fund, into which sums obtained on the conversion of licences were paid.  Further consideration would have to be given to the question of whether a similar fund should now be established.  This, of course, would require consultation with other interested Departments, such as the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave this information very briefly to point out to Senator Cregan that it is an exceptionally complex question and that further study and consultation with <Col N="294" /> interested parties is essential before a property informed decision could be taken in relation to it.  This matter was only raised informally on Report Stage by Deputy Carey from County Clare.  He accepted my argument that we did not have time, that we would need a long period of study, consultation and examination to see what we could do.  I do not see any way to include in this Bill a provision as proposed.  I told Deputy Carey that it is something I will examine as early as possible when we are talking about bringing in new legislation or other legislation at the end of the year.</P>

There is a facility available to make application for a special exemption from 12 midnight until 1 a.m.  No change is envisaged, as of now.  I appreciate the Senator's concern.

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am worried that 70 per cent of the hotel industry is relying totally on one function per week, whether it is on a Saturday night or a Sunday night. Most of us in the entertainment business know that if you have a good Saturday night your neighbour, who is about 15 or 20 miles away, will have the Sunday night business.  The Minister says he has made no provision for changing the legislation on a Sunday night, but he has actually done that.  He has extended the public house opening hours from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Sunday night.  He has taken the hotel hours back from a 2 o'clock extension on Sunday night, which I agree with, to 1 o'clock on Sunday night.  Therefore, he has started the business of rearranging 50 per cent of the business of people who are dependent for their living on entertainment, whether it is running a hotel or live entertainment, supplying music by bands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment a person goes into court and looks for a bar extension on a Sunday night for one hour because after 1 o'clock you have to finish your music and close your premises or you are breaking the law regarding a bar extension.  A bar extension for one hour, in a union house, is not practicable; it is not possible. It cannot be paid for.  If you have a barman pulling pints for one hour, it is not possible to pay him a union rate on <Col N="296" /> the profit you will make.  The Minister is totally eliminating legitimately run bar extensions on a Sunday night.  The only option a person has in order to survive is to run illegitimate business on a Sunday night.  I am not saying that what he has done is wrong.  I agree with fixing the time at 1 o'clock.  I am asking him to give the extra half hour, from 11.30 p.m. to 12 midnight, where the function can be run earlier.  You can bring people in at 8 p.m. or 8.30 p.m. and have the function completely finished at 1 o'clock.</P>
    <P>In fact, I was prepared to say here that we could have the function finishing at 12.30 p.m., with drinking up time for this extension until 1 o'clock.  It is not an unreasonable request.  As a matter of fact, it involves the survival of many people in small family-run hotels.  The family-run hotels are the backbone of the tourism industry.  The family-run hotels in the final analysis, will have the repeat family business.  The family-run hotels do not flout the law; they are the responsible people who are the backbone of society.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an amendment down in the name of Senator McGowan that was not moved and the effect of that amendment would have been to enable special exemption orders to be granted in respect of the period between 11 p.m. on Sunday and 1 a.m. on Monday.  Under the law as it stands, licensed premises generally can supply drink any time between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Sunday. Now we have changed that to 11 p.m. and the 30 minutes drinking up and getting out time brings that to 11.30 p.m. Under this amendment licensed hotels and licensed restaurants would have been able, not merely to supply drink from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Sundays, but where they obtained special exemption orders to continue to supply drink up to 1 a.m. on Monday morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would mean that Sunday evenings would be the same as other week evenings, including Saturday evenings, and <Col N="298" /> could create a tenancy for continuous drinking throughout Sunday afternoon into Monday morning.  This would be regarded as a highly retrograde step, bearing in mind the problem of absenteeism that we were talking about.  It is regarded as essential that the present break between evening closing time on Sunday and the commencement of a special exemption on Monday morning, which is a half an hour, be continued as an incentive to many people to encourage them to go home.  I add that I have the highest regard for Deputy Cassidy but, during the course of my discussions with the Hotels Federation, they made no representations whatsoever with regard to the Sunday night extension for half an hour.  I found them the most capable people to deal with.  They were most helpful. That is the arrangement as it stands. If it can be proved to me within the 12-month period when I propose to review certain aspects of the liquor legislation that there is a genuine need for it, then I will certainly do something about it.</P>
    <P>Also in reply to Senator Cassidy, if bands are engaged to supply music for dancers on Sunday nights and Monday mornings, the bands do not have to stop playing when the booze stops flowing.  I danced many a Sunday night in my younger days, and hope to continue to do so, without any booze.</P>

I represent people who earn their living by playing live music and they are down to two nights on which to do this.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a point about the registered clubs.  One wonders whether the club regulations were in actual fact implemented to suit people from another country.  That is how the clubs have the benefit today of using that type of facility.  We are a little bit more broad-minded in many areas than these people, but that is for another day. Entrance to a club by a Garda or anybody wearing a uniform was not allowed unless he had an inspector or a superintendent with him.  This points out the type of regulations that were implemented to suit these clubs.  We have people who are inclined to say that they should not recognise or play a sport which comes from another country while, at the same time, they are quite prepared to say we should implement their laws and avail of them in clubs, but people outside those clubs do not get the same facility, that is changing and I am delighted that the Minister recognises that problem.</P>
      <P>When will we have a situation within these clubs that like another country where the clubs are so strict that there is a person at all times at the door making sure that the people entering are members, perhaps accompanied by friends or guests?  There is a difference between a friend an a guest but the definition is questionable.  Is there now to be an emphasis on making sure that a person signs as a member and gets documentation accordingly?  Are we providing that some documentation will be handed to that person to say that he is legally a member of the club and has a number accordingly?  The Minister admitted yesterday that massive amounts of State money have been pumped into these areas.</P>

      <P>The one person who will make sure that a person does not get too much drink is the local publican.  It is very sad that 5 per cent or 6 per cent of our people cannot drink alcohol.  That is why I am so serious about this Bill.  I have seen my own people die from drink and I do not like it.  We must be very strong-minded in saying that all our people will be protected, particularly from these registered clubs who have the facilities to serve drink at particular times when a person cannot get it elsewhere.  The publican is paying taxes, trying to keep people employed.  Nobody has had any right to question these clubs or stop them. Not even a garda had a right to question <Col N="305" /> them.  It was most unfair and it must not be allowed to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation has a certain amount of urgency, having regard to what we are trying to do about restaurants. First I must compliment Deputy Seán Barrett in the other House who brought in a Bill dealing with under-age drinking.  We had a very worthwhile discussion on it which has made this a better piece of legislation.  I have accepted amendments everywhere along the line. That will be seen in the records of the other House.</P>
      <P>There were a number of things glaringly wrong with the clubs due to the privilege which they enjoyed.  I went to the trouble of reading the 1958 Dáil and Seanad reports of the debates of the time and there were strong arguments made against the gardaí visiting clubs and checking up on these gentlemen.  Ladies were not there too often at that time; they had their port and their sherry in more refined places.  That was the thinking of the time.  We have come a long way but we have a long way to go yet. Now we have clubs opened for inspection by ordinary gardaí as they should have been all along to see to it that the law is observed.  When this is over I will see if there are other ways and means that I may take upon myself to ensure that other special privileges by way of membership of boards of management will not be a deterrent to proper inspection being carried out at the appropriate time.  That I will do, as well as everything else.</P>
      <P>With regard to penalties for clubs, there is a section in the Bill dealing rather effectively with them. When I get a chance as a taxpayer, I will see to it that people who invest money and spend their own money will obey the law.  Up to now, people were not in a position to object to the renewal of that club licence if they lived outside the immediate area.  That has been taken from them.  That other pressure is there.  We will have fair play right across the board and no unfair competition.</P>

      <P>The Minister's approach to this legislation is positive and it is in the interest of society.  The abuse of alcohol is well known to all of us.  Like many of my colleagues, I devoted a great deal of time on Second Stage to pointing out the various statistics which are horrific.</P>
      <P>Section 42 (1) (k) states:</P>
      <P>That no person under the age of eighteen years shall be admitted as a member of the club unless the club is one primarily devoted to some athletic purpose...</P>
      <P>That seems to suggest to me &mdash; and I would welcome the Minister's clarification &mdash; that a registered sporting club can allow not only access to people under 18 years of age but that, once inside the club, there is every possibility that they will be served with intoxicating liquor.  I am echoing the fears of many people about under-age drinking.  If there was a drug available which regularly caused road accidents, damaged health and family life and reduced industrial productivity, this Government, or any Government, would be taking the lead and publicising those dangers.  That, in a sense, is what the abuse of alcohol is.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point earlier that he was not legislating for morality. None of us is, but all of us, led by the Minister, have got a responsibility to the people we represent in this House.  I am concerned that we may be going down a road where we are talking about the commercial impact of this legislation and about the fact of some business closing. While all of that is very serious, the most serious aspect of this legislation is on the question of under-age drinking.  The Minister has made a good start.  I am curious about that section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 24, before section 48, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;Section 12 of the Act of 1927 is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(1)  Where on the occasion of any application for a certificate for a new on-licence or a certificate for the <Col N="308" /> transfer or renewal of an on-licence, the applicant requests the Court to certify that the premises in respect of which the certificate is sought are a restaurant for the purposes of this Act, the Court, if satisfied after hearing the Officer in charge of the Garda Síochána for the licensing area that such premises are capable for use and bona fide and partly used as a restaurant, refreshment house or other place for supplying substantial meals to the public, shall grant to such applicant a certificate (in this section referred to as a restaurant certificate) certifying that such premises are a restaurant for the purposes of this Act&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These two amendments are of a fairly substantial nature.  I would like to take a few minutes explaining the thinking behind them.  One of the objects of the Bill is to assist and encourage tourism by providing for the sale and supply of liquor in certain restaurants.  Provision has been made for that.  The Bill is deficient in that it fails to assist and develop tourism by encouraging the provision of substantial meals in public houses.  There is an increasing demand by both tourists and the general community for the provision of meals in public houses at reasonable prices and in surroundings of conviviality. This has a special attraction for tourists.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as it is at present, contains no provision whereby a publican who is serving substantial meals as part of his business is also entitled to apply for and obtain a special restaurant licence.  In this regard the Bill fails to address the situation whereby publicans can be encouraged to provide substantial meals to the public by giving them the entitlement to have the same trading hours as the holder of a special restaurant licence.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is no provision under the Intoxicating Liquor Acts whereby the holder of a publican's on-licence is entitled to obtain a special exemption order for a function being held on his premises.  In recent years, there has been a great increase in the number <Col N="309" /> of functions being held in hotels and restaurants which also hold restaurant certificates, and which are entitled to obtain special exemption orders, and whose trade detracts substantially from those of the publicans.  It is the reverse of the coin which was addressed by Senator Cassidy. Club authorisations can be granted for 15 occasions in each year to a club, and in many cases one clubhouse can be used by a number of clubs which can each, in turn, apply for the 15 authorisations.  This also has taken greatly from the publicans' trade which is a point made by Senator Cregan over and over again.</P>
    <P>The object of these two amendments is to encourage publicans to provide substantial meals to the public, to encourage them to provide facilities for functions, all of which can be contained in the public house, and to encourage them to upgrade and improve their premises.  The amendments introduce a new opportunity for a publican to obtain a restaurant certificate which will enable the holder of a publican's seven-day on-licence to have extra trading hours, whereby he can trade on equal terms with the holder of a special restaurant licence and be entitled to apply for special exemption orders, under which he can trade on equal terms with hotels and the holders of restaurant certificates.</P>
    <P>In considering the amendments, reference has been made to the requirements in relation to a special restaurant licence under the Bill.  Reference has also bee made to the provisions of the English Licensing Act of 1971, section 29, which provides for a special licence to be obtained in respect of a public house which provides food at functions, whereby the holder of a licence is entitled to apply for an extension licence.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to amend section 12 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, which provides that a restaurant certificate can only be granted where the court is satisfied that the premises in question are structurally adapted for use and bona fide and mainly used as a restaurant, refreshment house, or other place for supplying substantial meals to the public. The existing provision of section 12 of the <Col N="310" /> 1927 are inappropriate in relation to the average public house in that the entire premises must be structurally adapted and mainly used as a restaurant.</P>
    <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Acts also contain provisions for the granting of a limited restaurant certificate which can be obtained where portion of a premises only is structurally adapted for use and bona fide and mainly used as a restaurant for supplying substantial meals to the public.</P>
    <P>The requirements to obtain a limited restaurant certificate are inappropriate for the average public house as a radical alteration of a premises would be required, and the limited restaurant certificate applies only to a separate room in the premises and this room cannot have a public bar and must have independent access.  The holder of a limited restaurant certificate is not entitled to obtain special exemption orders for functions.  Accordingly, it will be noted that the provisions under the existing Intoxicating Liquor Acts for the granting of a restaurant certificate or a limited restaurant certificate and the provisions contained in the Bill for a special restaurant licence are wholly inappropriate and unsuitable for the holder of a publican's seven-day on-licence.</P>
    <P>That is the reason this proposed amendment is necessary to meet the present day requirements which publicans feel are due to tourist and public demand and to fill a gap in the existing legislation.  If accepted, these amendments will encourage publicans to improve their premises and to provide substantial meals.  Under this amendment, before the court grants a restaurant certificate to the holder of a publican's seven-day on-licence, the court must be satisfied by the officer in charge of the Garda Síochána that the premises are suitable to be used for supplying substantial meals to the public ancillary and subsidiary to the principal business of selling intoxicating liquor.  There are other reasons why these amendments would meet a gap in the present law.  They would restore the balance between the publicans and the restaurateurs and also would be seen <Col N="311" /> to put both groups on a level playing pitch.  I would urge the Minister to consider these amendments as favourably as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain amount of misunderstanding, with respect to Senator Manning.  Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 refer to the provisions in the 1927 Act whereby unlicensed premises can obtain restaurant certificates.  These are of two kinds: a full restaurant certificate and a limited restaurant certificate.  Both types of certificate enable drink to be supplied with substantial meals up to 12.30 a.m. on weekdays.  Any one of the two will allow you to do that.  They can do that as they are, and they are very easily acquired.</P>
      <P>Under section 12 of the 1927 Act a full restaurant certificate can be obtained for any unlicensed premises bona fide and mainly used as a restaurant, or refreshment house, or other place supplying substantial meals to the public.  Where a licensed premises holds a full restaurant certificate it is entitled to obtain special exemptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, provides for the grant of a limited restaurant certificate in respect of a portion of a licensed premises.  A limited restaurant certificate does not entitle the holder to obtain special exemptions. I believe that Senator Manning's amendments would, in effect, combine these two provisions so that licensed premises which are only partly used as a restaurant could obtain a full restaurant licence. This would apply, for example, in the case of a public house, a small portion of which was used to supply meals to the public and, indeed, might apply where substantial meals were only occasionally <Col N="312" /> supplied.  The effect of these amendments would be that any such premises could get a full restaurant certificate, could supply drink with meals up to 12.30 a.m., and could get special exemptions.</P>
    <P>Apart from other kinds of on-licence, there are up to 10,000 public house licences in this country and the effect of these amendments would be that drink could be supplied up to 12.30 a.m. in such premises and that special exemptions could be obtained even though the premises were only partly used &mdash; and &ldquo;partly&rdquo; is important there &mdash; to supply substantial meals to the public.  This would be a distortion of the relevant provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts and would result in a vast increase in the number of special exemptions being issued.</P>
    <P>Special exemptions have been issued at the rate of 46,000 plus a year.  I do not think any of us would want a further wholesale increase in such exemptions. Because of that, I hope the Senator will understand that it is not possible for me to accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>If the part of the amendment dealing with special exemptions were withdrawn, would the Minister be prepared to think again?  I accept that this is a very substantial amendment.  It is appearing rather late in the life of the Bill.  The points made probably deserve more detailed discussion than is possible at this time in the Bill.  Would the Minister undertake that, when he is reviewing the operation of the legislation later in the year he would&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>We raised this on Second Stage.  The amendments brought forward by Senator Manning are valid in particular areas.  The Minister has admitted that publicans have put an awful lot of money into upgrading their premises and <Col N="313" /> making them into quite fine places.  There are tourist towns where a lot of public houses have changed over and have become pubs-cum-restaurants&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The publicans take pride in their premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>They do; they have to. You do not do business anymore unless you upgrade your premises and if your premises are not looking well, it costs you.  There is no question but that you will lose business.  For the people who put so much emphasis on doing this, it is unfair to bring about a situation where you are readily admitting that you should be more liberal.  The Minister is quite prepared to say that we must be more flexible in the licensing laws.  When the Minister is discussing this further &mdash; and he appears to be saying that he will consider this within a 12 month period &mdash; serious consideration should be given to the fact that it is unfair to say that the person with the special restaurant licence &mdash; and the Minister is putting a strong emphasis on this and the Bill is building up around it a lot &mdash; cannot serve drink at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They should not be trying to sell drink, and I am not denying that.  They are now able to do that until 12.30 a.m.  The person around the corner who has probably put a lot more into the premises is there a lot more and is serving drink legitimately.  He is very fair and he is the licensee, but he does not have the same facility as the other person.  The Minister is saying to me that he can apply for a special license.  He can apply for a special restaurant licence.  All this is part of the red tape and bureaucracy which do not have to be there.  There is no reason why we cannot say that the same person should have the same facility even though he probably put £100,000 more into the business.  Yet if the man around the corner pays out £3,000&mdash;I am not saying he should not and I know he puts £60,000 or £70,000 into his business and builds up a lovely restaurant business &mdash; he is now allowed to open until 12.30 a.m.  A person <Col N="314" /> has spent a lot more and he does not have the same facility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of one particular case where somebody built a great, big huge pub &mdash; a barn of a place &mdash; and was running weekend functions, music functions and live entertainment.  He decided that he would go for a restaurant certificate.  He built a little restaurant that would not be bigger than the inquiry office where we collect our mail.  We want to stop that.  No matter what we do here there are many people out there who see it as a licence to print their own money by evading their responsibilities.  I would say to Senator Cregan, Senator Bohan and others who are involved in the trade that I have nothing but the highest respect and regard for 99.9 per cent of the people involved in the licensed vintners' trade. They want to run decent, honest business. I do not think any of them wish to break the law.  I do not think that any of them wish to offend families of customers by keeping people on drinking.  I certainly believe they do not want to give drink to people who have more than enough drink taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that at times we get 1 per cent or 2 per cent who are reckless and ruthless, and get the headlines when things go wrong.  I, too, see what is going on for myself and I recognise that many publicans are playing a good part.  I hope that, when this Bill is eventually enacted, it will be seen as something of an effort on all our parts &mdash; totally non-political &mdash; to try to improve the situation which has been left hanging for the past 20 or 30 odd years and that, if it needs to be revamped and re-looked at, we will do that in the same way as we are doing it now. We should ensure that &mdash; and on this I have had to be very careful and I have taken a certain amount of abuse for it &mdash;<Col N="315" /> sectional interests in the trade do not swipe from others for whatever reason. We do not want to have one grabbing or grasping from the others.  We must be fair down the middle with them.</P>
    <P>I will have a look at the points raised by Senator Manning.  I will have them examined in full.  In the meantime, there is the restaurant certificate there that should get us over this.  There is a little red tape.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of red tape in life that we have to deal with every day but, in the meantime, we can live with that until we have a chance to have another look at it.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 25, before section 50, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>50.&mdash;Section 4 of the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1986, is hereby amended by the insertion after &lsquo;required&rsquo; in the definition of &lsquo;licence&rsquo; of &lsquo;and includes a licence granted under section 13 of the Refreshment Houses (Ireland) Act, 1860&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is intended to bring the procedure for the renewal of wine on-licences into line with the renewal procedure for other liquor licences.  Under the existing law, a District Court certificate must be obtained at the end of September each year, before a liquor licence is renewed by the Revenue Commissioners.  However, in the <Col N="316" /> case of wine on-licences, the Revenue Commissioners renew the licence without any court certificate and the ordinary objection procedure does not apply. Section 17 of the Refreshment Houses (Ireland) Act, 1860, provides a procedure for objecting to the renewal of wine on-licences.  This procedure is so cumbersome that it is hardly ever involved in practice.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is that, as and from the date of coming into operation of section 4 of the Courts (No. 2) Act of 1986, it will be possible for anyone to object in the District Court to the renewal of a wine on-licence in the same way as an objection can be made to the renewal of the other liquor licences. Wine on-licences are used by a variety of premises, including unregistered clubs which use them as a basis for obtaining special exemptions, and also by supermarkets which use them for the purpose of selling wine for consumption off the premises.  This amendment will facilitate the gardaí in enforcing the law in relation to all such premises by making it easier for them to object in appropriate cases at the annual licensing court.  Let those who run establishments that now refuse the gardaí admission for inspection purposes be on their guard.</P>

It is bringing into the framework of the legislative process people who have unscrupously flouted the law over the past number of years to their own benefit.  I am particularly pleased that, apart from the Leeson Street establishments and similar such establishments around the county, the Minister is incorporatiing supermarkets and other outlets into the law.  That is the area, as I pointed out earlier in relation to under-age abuse, where a substantial number of young people are buying drink in non-pub outlets.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 7, to delete &ldquo;or expose&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ferris and myself understand it, it would now be unlawful under the new law for a restaurant after the time for the sale of liquor, 12.30 a.m., to have liquor on display or exposed for sale, even though it will not be sold.  For example, under this it would be unlawful for a restaurant to have a display of whiskey or brandy bottles with the containers under them.  It would be unlawful for a restaurant which has its wine laid out on a sideboard which is in public view to behave in this way.  It might even be unlawful later in the evening if somebody is having a dessert cooked in <i>creme de menthe</i> to have that displayed on a trolley. The whole purpose of this amendment is to say that, if this phrase stays in the Bill, the law will not be enforced.  The gardaí are not going to go around raiding pubs where drink is exposed.  If the Minister accepted this amendment it would make for greater clarity and would mean that an unnecessary phrase would not be there.</P>

      <P>One has to be careful in matters such as this. <Col N="318" /> Under section 14 as it stands, it would be an offence to expose intoxicating liquor for sale in a special licensed restaurant during the prohibited hours.  That is what we are talking about in this legislation. On week days that would be from 12.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.  It would not be an offence to expose drink for sale on the premises during the permitted hours.  The effect of the amendment would be that it would not be an offence to expose intoxicating liquor for sale in such a premises at any time.  If this was accepted it would mean the special licensed premises would be distinguished from all other types of licensed premises &mdash; here is where my problem is &mdash; including restaurants licensed under existing legislation. It has been an offence to expose intoxicating liquor for sale in licensed premises during prohibited hours since at least the middle of the last century.  I cannot take it now but I will deal with it at the first opportunity.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Section 7 of the Act of 1962 shall apply to any premises to which a special restaurant licence applies as if the reference to a premises in that section included a restaurant in respect of which a special licence has been granted with the substitution of &lsquo;fifteen minutes&rsquo; for &lsquo;thirty minutes&rsquo; (inserted by this Act) and the Act of 1962 shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment gave rise to considerable discussion yesterday.  It arises from the fact that under the new law at 12.30 a.m. it will be unlawful for a person to consume an alcoholic beverage with a meal.  That is the problem which arises as I see it.  It stands to reason that restaurants will sell drink and serve drink up to 12.30 a.m.  After 12.30 a.m. &mdash; the drink having been served at 12.29 &mdash; it is unlawful to actually drink it.  I regard <Col N="319" /> this as virtually unenforceable and it is something which could bring the law into disrepute.  Some sort of provision such as a drinking up time should apply.  I have not asked for the half hour which is part of the other legislation.  A concession by the Minister of 15 minutes to allow people to drink up legally would meet the objections. It would still be illegal to serve drink after 12.30 a.m. but at least it takes on board recognition of the fact that, if a drink is served up to 12.30 a.m., the person is not expected to gulp it down. Even the Minister, when he was in the SRC, would need more than one minute to drink a pint.  This amendment is designed to prevent the law from being brought into disrepute.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I can understand the commonsense and validity of the argument the Senator is making but the same provision also applies with regard to the sale of drink in licensed hotels and restaurants and registered clubs that serve meals. The whole thing would have to be taken into context there.  It is something I will look at.  I could honestly say that I accept your argument, I accept the principles of your argument, and if I could tie in the other things when I am having a wider review of drink legislation, I will try to do something about it.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, on that point raised by Senator Mooney.  I want to commend Senator Bohan for raising the question of education as far as drink is concerned.  I did not get a chance to say anything about it.  It is something we would all wish to see.  I do not mind who is responsible.  It is the Government's responsibility in some instances.  It is primarily a matter for the Department of Health.  But let us not forget that it is our responsibility as legislators to do our bit. Above and beyond all that, it is the responsibility of parents.  We cannot do the work of parents.  We can only go a certain distance.  Unless parents play their part, all the legislation we can enact and put on our statute books will be of no avail.  There is little point in trying to <Col N="321" /> protect 14 and 15 year olds from the very odd or rare unscrupulous off-licence holder, or the very odd or rare unscrupulous vintner, who might not be in good health himself, giving drink to 15-year-olds when the parents do not even know where their children are.  There are grave responsibilities in parenthood.  I am not going to lecture anybody on them. Schools have a lot to do with what is going on.  Teachers play their part also. What we can only do is a small section. I think we are doing our part well.  I am very grateful to the Members of this House, Members of all parties.  At times I was not all that grateful to Senator Cregan, because he was turning me upside down every so often.  But I very much appreciate the effort he put into the Bill.  I mean that very sincerely.  I would suggest to Senator Cregan that, if he were looking &mdash; I hope the press will not comment on it &mdash; for a position of professional lobbyist, he would be worth about ten times any of the lobbyists that have come into me on behalf of the association.  I mean that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are doing is only a start.  There is a lot more to be done.  First of all, we must be guided by the interest of fair play for those who are involved in the profession, but the overall interest must be the overriding factor.  The interests of our community, and in particular of the young people, are paramount.  One particular evening I was walking in a country town during a holiday period and I saw youngsters coming out of pubs between 10.30 and 11 o'clock.  Out of one particular pub came young girls of 15 or 16 years of age.  They were being loaded like cattle on to a bus and being brought 20 or 30 miles to a disco.  It made me wonder what life is all about, and what life was like for us in different times and in different places.  What chance have those young people of surviving in this day and age?  We have a serious obligation right across the divide.  We have had nothing but wonderful co-operation from all parties in the Dáil.  I am particularly thankful to the Fine Gael Party, to Deputy Sean Barrett and his colleagues, and to the <Col N="322" /> other parties, to the Progessive Democrats and to all who helped in every way to give us what, I think, is a reasonable start and a good piece of legislation.  It will not be perfect.</P>
    <P>To you, a Cathaoirligh, many thanks for your guidance, your help, your calming effect on us, your strength in maintaining decorum on the one or two occasions when it was required and in helping us get our business done properly, as it should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are turning now to Part IV of this Bill which deals with the regulation of insurance intermediaries.  Before dealing with the specific amendments to Part IV, with your permission, a Chathaoirligh, and with the permission of the House, I would like to make a few general remarks which will explain the approach we are adopting.</P>
      <P>First, the whole area of insurance intermediary regulation is new in the Irish context and Senators will appreciate that legislation for a new area, particularly a new area as complex as this one, is a very difficult task.  Secondly, an adequate and decent standard of protection and advice had to be extended to those who use intermediaries.  Thirdly, I had to bear in mind the constraints on Exchequer spending and the necessity to avoid an over-complex and costly system of regulation. Lastly, I was anxious not to upset or to interfere with existing good market practice.  I wish to make it clear that the introduction of legislation in no way casts a bad light on the vast majority of intermediaries; rather, however, that the public have to be protected from the unscrupulousness of a very few.  I trust Senators will find that the amendments I am proposing meet all of these very important objectives which we have set ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be proposing to make it clearer that insurers' responsibilities for their intermediaries extend both to ensuring <Col N="324" /> that intermediaries comply with the Bill as well as in regard to sums of money paid over by a client to an intermediary. As for intermediaries, apart from the comprehensive bonding and other financial protection measures that will be put in place for their clients, the amendments also propose to ensure that the public are made very much aware of the precise category of insurance intermediary with whom they do business.  While the Bill will not enforce a concept of strict polarisation in law, this is nevertheless a process which will probably evolve over time of its own accord.  With increased consumer awareness in this area, the public will rely less and less on limited part time operators and will turn increasingly to full time independent professional advisers. The net effect of the changes will be to enhance the protection and level of service given to clients by intermediaries, while allowing time where necessary for the market to adjust smoothly to the scheme of regulation.  These are just some general comments.</P>
    <P>The three new sections proposed to be introduced by Government amendments Nos. 75, 78 and 79 in effect replace the regulatory structure envisaged under the text of sections 37 and 38 in the published Bill.  The fundamental differences between the old text of section 37 dealing with brokers' qualifications and the new text that I am proposing in Government amendments Nos. 75 and 78 are as follows. First, the Minister will be empowered to formally recognise broker representative bodies which require compliance by their members with the provisions of this Act.  This is a major step forward.  Second, there will be no ministerial recognition of brokers on an individual basis.  Insurance companies, whether individually or collectively, will ensure compliance by such non-affiliated individuals with the legal requirements before granting agency appointments or paying commission.  Third, before he can act as a broker in either life or non-life insurance, a broker will have to hold at least five written agencies from either five life insurers or five life non-insurers. Power is also being taken to provide that <Col N="325" /> the Minister may, by regulation, require insurance brokers to take out and hold professional indemnity insurance.  This requirement was also included in the Third Schedule to the published Bill.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 79 proposes a new section which deals with the criteria to be applied by insurers in appointing insurance intermediaries and paying them commission.  The new section is an expanded version of section 45 in the published Bill.  It differs from the existing section 45 in that it allows an insurer to appoint a member of a recognised representative body of brokers as an intermediary, to pay him commission and to rely on such membership as evidence that the broker complies in all respects with the statutory requirements of the legislation.  In all other cases the insurer will have to make reasonable inquiries on an on-going basis or cause reasonable inquiries to be made on his behalf, that a person complies with the statutory requirements before appointing him as an intermediary or paying him commission.  The new section also differs from the old section 45 in another very important respect.  While it continues to reinforce the prohibition in regard to commission payments to unauthorised intermediaries, it nevertheless preserves the long-established and widespread practice of insurance intermediaries sharing commission with legitimate introductory sources of business.</P>
    <P>The reason behind the change is as follows.  The regulatory scheme envisaged under the old sections 37 and 38 with direct ministerial hands-on type supervision and responsibility for insurance intermediaries would have been very impractical, very costly, very bureaucratic and overly legalistic.  The benefit of the new sections is that they place the primary responsibility for regulation where it properly belongs and can more effectively be carried out, that is, in the marketplace between the intermediaries and the companies themselves. The compliance costs on the market will. therefore, be much less while affording similar levels of protection to the public at the same time.  This, therefore, is a <Col N="326" /> sensible solution to a difficult problem. This new approach will put the onus on insurers, whether individually or collectively, to make reasonable inquiries regarding the people to whom they pay commission.</P>
    <P>The insurers and the broker bodies may, if they wish, act together to set up a centralised clearing house arrangement for members of broker bodies, that is, number of agencies held, type, professional indemnity, bonding, separate bank account and so on.  A similar structure can also be put in place by the companies for their insurance agents, thereby eliminating costly and unnecessary duplication of checking procedures at the level of the individual company.  The market will be free to introduce whatever procedures it deems most cost-effective and practical to verify compliance with the legal requirements.  In my view the new arrangements represent the best of both worlds, that is, self-regulation underpinned by statute.</P>
    <P>As to the number of agencies to be held by brokers, the Government amendment provides that brokers may not act as such unless they hold five life agencies or five non-life agencies.  Under the present wording of the Bill, an individual could hold five agencies, four of them with life companies and one agency with a non-life company.  This individual could still represent himself as a broker in respect of non-life business.  A separate threshold for life and non-life business of five agencies is reasonable and necessary, as brokers portray themselves as being independent and in a position to offer real consumer choice.  This is as it should be and a minimum level of five agencies will guarantee the necessary measure of independence in this respect in both life and non-life business.</P>
    <P>The question of including a provision making it compulsory for brokers to hold a policy of professional indemnity insurance was considered at length, given problems in the recent past relating to the cost and availability of such insurance in Ireland.  Accordingly, I now propose to proceed by taking the power to provide that the Minister may, by regulation, <Col N="327" /> require that such insurance be held by insurance brokers.  Senators will see this as a substantial step forward.  Senators should note that it is my intention that a mandatory professional indemnity requirement will not come into force for two years, following commencement, so as to allow the market time to develop and adjust.  This will coincide with the limit on the number of agencies which may be held by insurance agents after that period as proposed by amendment No. 97 to section 41.  Officials of my Department have already been in contact with the insurers' representative body seeking assurances and proposing arrangements about availability of professional indemnity insurance for brokers. I can assure the House that no statutory requirement will be imposed if there are grounds for believing that the cover required by law will not be generally available.</P>
    <P>Senators will also note that the most important consumer elements of the Third Schedule are now proposed to be incorporated into the main body of the Bill proper.  I refer, of course, to aspects such as professional indemnity insurance cover for insurance brokers and solvency verification upon which the availability of bonds will obviously depend.  In addition, I should mention the placing of business which will be regulated by the number of agencies held, the wide definition of the tied agency concept in section 43 and the provisions of section 48 which will give the Minister power to draw up codes of conduct for intermediaries.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards commission sharing by insurance intermediaries with introductory sources, it has been pointed out to me by sectors of the insurance industry that to cut across such arrangements would not be in the best interest of consumer intermediaries or, indeed, of the market generally.  Accordingly, it is proposed to allow on an exceptional basis the sharing of commission by an authorised intermediary where such sharing is based on an insurance policy placed with an insurer through the said intermediary's agent.  It should be noted that this will not <Col N="328" /> result in either a diminution of consumer protection, in that the client will have all the necessary legal protection afforded by the Bill by having his policy taken out <i>vis-a-vis</i> legitimate insurance broker or agent or in an increase in commission payment levels.  Insurers will still only be able to pay the maximum level laid down by the category of insurance in question and it will be a matter for the insurance intermediary and the introductory source involved to agree on commission sharing.</P>
    <P>The wording of the new sections is fairly clear, but if Senators require a detailed explanation I have no great difficulty with that.  This is just a broad explantion of it.  If Senators wish to go through the individual sections, we certainly can do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to express my disappointment that the suggested changes we looked for on Second Stage are not in this Bill.  What the Minister has now proposed in amendment No. 75 does not meet with my approval or with the approval of the insurance industry generally. It is very difficult for people, perhaps, to live in the real world if they are caught up in theory.  The very nature of the amendments being proposed shows that there was very little thought put into the practical implementation of this legislation on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we accept the fact that brokers have made a very definite commitment, financially and otherwise, to establishing the appropriate offices, to improving their standards to such an extent that they enjoy the goodwill of the community and that they give a very good and efficient service to the consumer and we are trying to ensure that the consumer will benefit in the final analysis by the enactment of this legislation, we will have to recognise that there are definite deficiencies in the direction the Minister is seeking to go in implementing a Bill of this nature to regulate intermediaries.  I would go so far as to say that, if the present wording goes through, in particular amendment No. 75 (1) (b) dealing with the number of agencies an agent can hold or that a broker can hold, it will certainly make <Col N="329" /> the entire implementation of the Bill a farce.</P>
    <P>Anybody in the insurance business or anybody who has listened carefully to the arguments put forward by people interested in the welfare of the insurance industry and in the welfare of the consumer and policyholder will tell you that, if you define an agent as somebody who has in the case of non-life five undertakings and in the case of life assurance four undertakings &mdash; I think it is four and four that the Minister is presuming&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Four agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Four agencies for each section of insurance and after that anyone with five or more agencies will be defined as brokers.  It is not possible to police that arrangement to the extent necessary to protect the consumer and policyholder. Many brokers will reduce the number of agencies they have at present to such an extent that they will then become agents and they will extricate themselves from the improvement of standards and qualifications the Minister is seeking to have implemented in this Bill.  I understand perfectly that there must be a contiguous relationship between agent and broker. There is no reason why the vast majority of business in this country cannot be carried on with four agencies in life and non-life insurance.  Surveys available to the Minister's Department would indicate that if they had as few as three agencies, they could carry on 65 per cent of the business in life and non-life insurance. That is what we must address here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have numerous people who will extricate themselves from consumer bonding &mdash; and this will not be to the benefit of the consumer &mdash; and from professional indemnity which is what the Minister is seeking to implement through legislation rather than by regulations under the Third Schedule.  The Minister is creating a loophole which will be to the detriment of the policyholder if something goes wrong in relation to a claim, whether it be in the life or the non-life area.  He is reducing the standard of independent and professional advice, which <Col N="330" /> is essential to the protection of the policyholder.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we establish clearly that an agent is a part time operator assisting a consumer on a part time basis, while a broker is a full time independent professional person who has devoted considerable resources towards establishing a very efficient operation.  The broker must go to considerable lengths to ensure that he is fully up to date and <i>au fait</i> with every detail of the different policies in the life and the non-life area in the interests of the consumer.  I humbly suggest that this is not the case, by definition of the work of an agent.  An agent does not carry out the same analysis of detail, The same examination and investigation which are essential in this very technical area of insurance.</P>
    <P>Insurance is becoming more technical due to the fact that it is becoming more difficult to get.  It is becoming more technical because of the changes in the industrial development and the changes in the types of risk which are being brought forward for quotation from insurance companies.  The pressure on insurance brokers to deliver appropriate quotations cheaply and competitively, while at the same time giving the appropriate level of cover, was never as great as it is today. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider between now and Report Stage reducing the number of undertakings an agent can have.</P>
    <P>In fact, the Minister said, in the course of an address in Cork, that he was in favour of defining an agent as somebody with no more than four agencies in total. The Minister's Department will probably say that he meant four life insurance agencies and four non-life insurance agencies.  I know, and the Minister knows, that during his discussions with various people in the political area and during his discussions with individual insurance brokers he was quite sure of what he meant when he said the total number of agencies an agent could have was four.  Perhaps the Minister has changed his mind since then.  I understand that this amendment will render <Col N="331" /> completely useless the detail of the legislation we have been discussing up to now. The Minister is seeking theoretically to implement a policy which will be impractical in the day-to-day operation of the insurance business and in the regulations of insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider it and to submit another amendment on Report Stage to get some degree of sanity in relation to this development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout the discussion on Second Stage the contributors took some time and trouble to investigate the implications of the Bill.  They gave a fairly detailed response on that basis.  It might be said that some of my colleagues would be acting in the interests of the broker.  That would be unfair.  During the course of the Bill and the amendments on different occasions I have supported one side or the other.  I supported the Government side very forcibly last week &mdash; on one occasion against the proposal of the Opposition.  On this occasion I endorse completely and absolutely the proposal made by Senator Hogan.</P>
      <P>I looked back today on the Minister's Second Stage speech.  When referring to Part IV of the Bill he said: &ldquo;I will now turn to this part of the Bill, the most innovative part of the Bill.&rdquo;  He talked about the provisions etc. and presented them as an exciting development.  Similarly, in the explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill it says that Part IV deals with the new requirements in relation to statutory provisions etc.  We had discussion on it and people had varying responses to it but everyone agreed that this was certainly the direction of movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been very careful to take the side of the consumer, the person at the end of the line buying insurance.  I am very interested in the area of consumer protection.  It is my honest opinion that the proposal the Minister has put before us today substantially weakens the Bill. In fact, it reduces the effectiveness of the Bill to nothing.  Cases have been made here on various points and various <Col N="332" /> amendments.  I know nobody who supports that amendment.</P>
    <P>As late as yesterday I was talking to a friend of mine, an insurance broker in the town of Dingle, who said that taking these sections out of the Bill will weaken it tremendously, and reduce consumer protection.  We will, no doubt, have people using the legislation, trying to bypass the legislation by changing their status from broker to agent, exactly as outlined by Senator Hogan.</P>
    <P>I have taken a fairly indepth briefing from different groups on this Bill.  I have discussed this proposal before us with these groups.  I agree with Senator Hogan that what is happening here will take away the consumer protection.  It just means that a broker by reducing the number of undertakings can change from being a broker to an agent.  This weakens consumer protection and it also weakens what the Minister had in mind at an earlier stage when we discussed this before. Is it possible not to take a vote on this amendment today, to discuss it a little further and to leave the final decision on this section to Report Stage?  I honestly believe that what we are doing here will worsen and weaken the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister not to put this amendment today, to let this matter stand over until Report Stage and to deal with it at that time.  I urge the Minister to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I share my colleague's concern about these amendments.  Senator Hogan had no choice but to move from amendment No. 75 and to include in his remarks amendment No. 97, which deals with the agent.  I think that is what Senator O'Toole is also talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have to highlight, as Senator Hogan did, what an agent is, what he should be, what the industry expects him to be and what a broker is.  A broker, apart from being a member of a representative body and so on and having professional indemnity, is a person who holds himself out to be an expert in placing insurance, insurance generally.  He has a staff, an office; he has a telephone <Col N="333" /> bill, a lighting bill and he is giving employment; if he has growth in turnover his staff grows accordingly.  He is putting something back into the business life and the whole economic life of the area where he resides and he has a stake in the whole insurance industry.  Many brokers are well trained and come from brokers' offices or from companies.  Many of them have ACII and FCII examinations completed and they have full academic qualifications. They are people with a love for the industry they are involved in.  The obvious reason they are there is because their whole life is their job.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, an agent is a person who could be a teacher, a garage owner, a bank manager, somebody very temporary in the business who could not profess to have the same interest or the same degree of love for the business and is, therefore, of a very temporary nature, without a staff or any of the other expenses of a broker.  I believed that the whole thrust of this Bill would be to make a clear differentiation between an agent and a broker, to establish once and for all a clear difference in the outlook of agents and brokers.  The Bill, with these new amendments, and in particular amendment No. 97, is doing nothing to convince me that we are doing something positive.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands is disappointing and, like the other speakers, I appeal to the Minister on Report Stage to reconsider all of section 37 and the amendments to it, plus amendment No. 97 and not to take any firm decisions on it today. The industry at large is of the opinion that we are talking about an agent having no more than four agencies.  The Bill indicates, and still is, subject to these amendments, that a broker can have a minimum of five agencies.  It does not specify life or non-life insurance.  What is wrong with, even at this late hour &mdash; although it is not late, it is still early days in this debate &mdash; leaving it as it is in the Bill?  If a broker is in a position to arrange insurance with at least five insurers that to me was sufficient.  If it was left like that, in normal simple logic it would follow that agents would have a maximum of four. <Col N="334" /> But in these two sections we are putting an agent, who is by definition a very temporary person, on a pedestal.  It is an agents' Bill.  The Minister may argue as he likes but I believe that it is an agents' Bill.  The unfortunate broker who has put so much into his offices and his business and who has such a good knowledge of his business, is not getting a fair crack of the whip in this Bill or in the amendments that have been put down.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has problems, which clearly appears to be the case, he should stall on both of those sections, to examine the Bill in greater detail and come back on Report Stage with amendments that will be acceptable to the industry, to the brokers' organisations and to people generally who have an interest in this Bill.  I made some telephone calls this morning around the country about it, explaining what was happening and nobody is happy with the way it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to proceed with these two amendments, amendment No. 75 and amendment No. 97, until Report Stage, that he examines the Bill in greater detail and comes back to us at that Stage, hopefully, with a new position so that we can all say that while it may not be exactly what we wanted it is coming a long way to meet us.  Certainly, as it stands, I am very unhappy with it.</P>

      <P>We are at a turning point in this debate.  I reject completely that this is an agents' Bill and I would have to do that in the strongest possible terms.  I would remind Senator Hogan, particularly, that when this Bill was published there was no limit at all on the number of agents and that was published by the previous Government.  That is on the record and indisputable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to demands from a number of Senators I have actually limited the number of agencies an agent can hold. We have corralled the agents and Senators are now complaining that we have not corralled them enough.  It is a matter for debate how much one corrals them and how much one keeps them out of the hair of the brokers.  That could be debated quite strongly.  First, the original <Col N="335" /> Bill, published by the previous Government, did not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;deal with this question in any way.  Secondly, since this Bill came into this House I have brought in sections proposing to limit the operation of agents.  That was a principle that was not in the Bill before and it is progress, perhaps not the kind of progress that Senators might want, but it certainly is progress.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator O'Toole's worry about consumer protection, this Bill has changed that area significantly.  We have professional indemnity, we have bonding, we have separate client accounts, we have made the companies responsible for the agents and we have imposed bonding across the board.  More important &mdash; and this is the kernel of this section &mdash; by insisting that anybody in the business who wants to be a broker has five of both, we are saying to them that if they have anything less than that &mdash; which Senators are arguing for here &mdash; then they are not going to have a spread of business to offer the public.  Whether they are in the life business or the general business if they do not have at least five on either side, how can they go to the public and offer them a complete spread across the market?</P>

      <P>The point I am making is in relation to consumer protection, and I am addressing it to Senator O'Toole in particular, because I would argue very strongly that the Senators are asking me, in the first instance, not to proceed with amendment No. 75 which says that to be a broker you must have five agencies on the non-life side and five on the life side.  That would mean less consumer protection.  By insisting on having at least five on both sides I am insisting that they offer the public a wide range of companies and to remove this amendment would be less consumer protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I did not proceed with this, a broker could have less than five in some areas.  This is a practical problem I have and if Senators can help me solve it I will certainly look at it again. Section 37 at present says that one should have at least five insurers.  If a person has five, they could have four life companies and one non-life company.  To call oneself a broker with one non-life company is not a broker.  One is tied to a particular company.  That is clearly nonsense and the broking bodies have not addressed that problem sufficiently.  There will be no consumer protection unless I make this amendment because what would remain would be that you would have to have five overall, which means that you could have four life and one non-life. How can you protect the consumer when in fact if the consumer turns up at the door of a broker under the old wording he is only offered one company.  That is not consumer protection: that is quite the opposite.  What I am doing here is opening it up and giving consumer protection.</P>
      <P>Those who argue that it should remain at five here in this section of the Bill have the onus on them to find out what happens if that five turns out to be four and one.  I have not heard a satisfactory response to that question yet.  Senators will get their chance, no doubt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I would like to give the Minister the actual information and that is that the same people perhaps were advising the previous Minister as were advising the present Minister. Whether it was the situation or not, I can assure him that I would be taking a similar stand to that which I am taking today in relation to this matter.  That certainly, is merely an aside in relation to the kernel of the problem we are talking about here.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a problem that might arise in relation to a total number of insurers being fixed at five.  I agree with the Minister and I would not like to see that happening.  I have given the Minister a solution in the form of an amendment to section 41, in which I suggested that there must be an equal number of undertakings given to an agent on the non-life side and on the life side. I certainly realise that there must be a contiguous relationship between the definition of an agent and the definition of a broker.  The Minister has been misinformed from this point of view that he feels that if he does not give a sufficient number of agencies to a particular person, such persons will not be able to give the necessary choice to the consumer in order to provide a very wide choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solution to that is very clear in that you reduce the number of agencies that you give on the life and the non-life side to two life or two non-life and with less than that you call them agents.  If they are two life or two non-life or less than that, call them agents, because, due to their very part-time and temporary nature, they will not be able to give the necessary wide choice as an agent to the consumer.  Therefore, how can the Minister say that the agent is going to protect the consumer in the limitation of advice that they are able to give in the first place? The broker on the other hand is a person who will have a lot more than five agencies. If they are going to have all the qualifications talked about, professional indemnity &mdash; and the Minister has not addressed the cost of that yet &mdash; consumer bonding and all the various financial inputs that a broker must provide in <Col N="339" /> setting up his office and setting up the staff and the appropriate services that are needed in order to serve the consumer properly, then it is in the broker's interest to have 25 agencies on the life side and 25 agencies on the non-life, if he can get them.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the Minister should be putting up an excuse here today for reducing the number of agencies on the non-life side and on the life side for an agent if the Minister is interested in consumer choice.  The broker will then be even in a better position to give the professional and independent service and the type of service that the consumer wants in order to ensure that the proper policy is given in the interest of the policyholder.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is going to call this Bill an agent's Bill, which Senator Fallon rightly calls it if the Minister implements this particular amendment, then the Minister is going to limit consumer choice because he is making it attractive enough for a number of brokers at the moment, smaller brokers, to go from the definition of broker under the Bill to the definition of agent and remove them altogether from consumer protection and from consumer choice by reducing the number of agencies they will have.  It completely defeats the type of argument the Minister is putting up in relation to consumer choice.</P>
    <P>By reducing the number of agencies on the non-life and the life side under the definition of agent and calling anybody over that particular level a broker, the Minister is immediately improving consumer protection and given a great scope of agencies available to the general public in order to make their choice and to get the proper advice from the widest possible range of companies under the broker definition.</P>
    <P>The Minister should listen and he should not be totally stone-walling the situation today by saying that it is not an argument that we are putting up, that our argument is hollow.  We are here in a non-political way trying to do the best we can in order to meet the needs of the <Col N="340" /> Minister, the needs of the industry and above all the needs of the policy holder and to ensure that the consumer gets the widest possible choice and the best advice possible.  We do not want people who have no experience, who are not qualified, who have no training, going out and knocking on the door and flogging a policy indiscriminately under the definition of agent, and there are people who are tied to a particular company.  There are tied agents but there are people with one or two agencies that we all know are going around doing the very same thing. What the Minister is trying to do is bring more people out of the definition of broker into that category that I am talking about, in order to give a limited consumer choice to the policyholder.  That is something that I would be totally against.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with the Minister's point about having the existing provisions of the Bill with the words &ldquo;at least five insurers&rdquo; included.  In responding to my argument about the lack of consumer protection, the Minister said that a broker could have five insurers to offer but four life and one non-life, and that the customer going in looking for non-life was deprived of choice.  I accept the initial point the Minister made but I do not believe that consumer choice equates with consumer protection. Choice is an aspect of protection but you would also have somebody with the best choice in the world &mdash; forget about insurers &mdash; say white electrical goods &mdash; offering seven different kinds of washing machine that were no good whatever and you might have a shop next door offering one market leader.  The fact that there is a choice does not immediately mean that there is consumer protection.  We will have to agree with each other on that point.  However, choice is important; I accept the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has raised a point where he says that restricting it to five means that there is a lack of choice.  What is necessary here is to insist that there be a choice.  In other words, to insist that at least two of the five be either life or non-life. Maybe that is the amendment that <Col N="341" /> would be necessary to cover that, even though it would still be a more restricted choice than five and five.  I accept that point but, speaking about consumer protection, I went to the trouble &mdash; I have no connection of any description with either insurance agents or brokers and am not speaking for them &mdash; of talking to a number of them.  I asked one broker a straight question: &ldquo;Tell me, as of now, what your protection is?  If I come in to you to purchase insurance, what kind of cover have you got?&rdquo;  He told me what he was paying for personal insurance, compensation bond and his annual membership fee to the NIBA of which he was a member.  I was astonished and I was delighted to see that kind of protection is there.  I think brokers are to be complimented. The Minister said that and we do not disagree on this point.</P>
    <P>On all sides of the House there is opposition to this amendment.  The Minister is unhappy with the present wording of the Bill.  On that basis, surely it is not wise for us to go ahead and push through this amendment today.  Could I appeal to the Minister, as somebody who has no involvement with the brokerage business, the agency business, or the insurance business, and say that I would be worried if we took a decision today in the light of this discussion?  Could I appeal to the Minister to leave it until Report Stage to make a final decision?  It does not delay the Bill as it can be dealt with at that time.  I suggest that we should not take a vote on this amendment today and I ask the Minister to take the case that was put and take the points raised, his own points, the consumer choice, my points and the points of other Senators on the question of consumer protection and find some synthesis of the different points of view in a few amendment, if that is what is necessary.  I appeal to the Minister not to take this amendment today but to take it back and talk to us on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that Senators are trying to be helpful.  Senator Hogan said he was approaching it in a non-political spirit and I accept that and I do not wish to inject a political note <Col N="342" /> into it.  There are practical difficulties and we are getting to the stage where decisions have to be made and implemented.  We cannot have a lengthy discussion beyond what we have already had.  This Bill has been around for a long time.  We had discussed it up and down, in and out with all the bodies in NIBA, those not in NIBA, IIF and all the various bodies.  There is one fundamental principle that is not up for negotiation, that is, that we will have to offer more consumer protection and choice.  I note the difference Senator O'Toole makes.</P>
      <P>I have sought in this Bill, and still do, to elevate the status of the insurance brokers as an independent professional body.  I was very taken with the arguments made by Senator Fallon throughout the Bill that the broker has overheads and tries to run a very professional organisation. Because of those arguments we went back and we put a cap on the agents. There was no cap on the agents at all until we put it in this Bill recently.  That is a very strong point to make.  What we are arguing about today is how low that fence should go.  I wonder whether the general broking community, having got a whiff of the fact that agents were going to be contained, felt they could push that a bit further and further down to a stage where an agent would be a person who has got one each and is put off the map. That is not practical, given the nature of the industry at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The othe point I want to make is that at some point there has got to be a fence below which people are not seen as independent bodies.  Senator Hogan's amendment would I understand pin agents to one and one and then have no minimum figure for brokers &mdash; a broker could start at any figure above that.  That would not mean that a person who calls himself a broker could have a very small number of agencies on both sides.  They could arguably have three on each side.  That would be a very small proportion of the total market and would not deserve the title of full independent professional broker and, therefore, the figure five was in the last Bill and is in this Bill and has not been disputed by anybody as being a <Col N="343" /> sensible figure below which you cannot be seen to be a professional independent brokerage offering independent advice. There was general agreement that above that figure you offered such a choice of market that you could be seen to be a broker.  If the argument is accepted that five is a sensible figure, then you cannot leave a hiatus.  If the figure five is agreed and you say, below that you cannot be seen as an independent professional adviser, above that you can.  That has been generally agreed.</P>
    <P>You then must face the next decision which is: does that mean that any one below that is something else and the inescapable logic of that is yes?  That leaves only one final discussion and that is whether it is five and five and four and four.  In addressing that problem Senators have got to ask one simple question: is it the same business or are they two separate businesses?  Are the life business and the general business all just insurance business?  Or, are these two separate businesses where you should have similar rules applying?  If you conclude that they are separate businesses &mdash; many Senators have advised me in this debate not to confuse them, that these are separate businesses with their own difficulties, problems and ratios and degree of skill required &mdash; you have to apply the same rules to both.  If I walk into a company looking for life insurance, if they can offer me more than five companies, they are independent professional brokers.  If they can offer me less than that, they are agents.  That seems to me to be eminently sensible.</P>
    <P>If I want non-life business and they say they have five, that satisfies me that they are independent.  You cannot agree on five and then argue with four.  If the argument here today is about the figure five, then we are opening up a whole new discussion about whether a person below five can be seen as an independent broker.  That would spoil what I am trying to do in this Bill, which is to put the broker on the map.  That is one of the key things I am trying to do, to ensure that they have got at least five on either <Col N="344" /> side.  They can offer a full range of business and that builds up their professional standing in the community and anybody below that is seen as more part time and not exactly in the same business.</P>
    <P>I want to make sure that, when people go to an agent or broker, they know whom they are dealing with.  They know that if they are offering less than five, they are dealing with agents.  Section 41 of the Bill makes it clear that nobody shall hold himself out to be an agent unless he holds an appointment in writing from the insurer, states on his letter heading and business forms the name or names of each insurer for which he is an agent and he must inform, under the Bill, any proposer of an insurance contract of the names of the insurers for which he is an agent.  I ask Senators to address the kernel of this because a promise to come back on Report Stage will only push the problem down a few more days or weeks. It will not change the basis nature of the problem.</P>
    <P>I understand Senator Hogan to be saying to me: &ldquo;Do not put a minimum number on the number of agencies a broker should have before he can hold himself out as a broker&rdquo;.  I would have to reject that completely because the whole thrust of the Bill is to ensure that, before somebody holds himself out as a broker, he can say to the public: &ldquo;I have enough agencies to be able to offer you a big spread in the industry.&rdquo;  We have all agreed I think that five is a sensible figure. If we are fighting about five we are back into a new debate and that would be a pity.  If we agree on five, then we cannot turn around and argue about four, three or two because five means we must step down to the next number.  The real argument is whether it is five and five and four and four.  The difficulty with leaving it just five and four on one side, or in total, is that you can get a situation where someone breaks down their five into four and one and that leaves us with a difficulty where that one does not add up completely for us.</P>
    <P>The other point I wanted to make, and it is a pity to let it go, is that I have put <Col N="345" /> into Bill a form of recognition for brokers that they did not have.  We have done everything possible to build a professional image of brokers.  We are putting into this Bill that the Minister will recognise the representative bodies or recognise any brokers who, under the vouching of the insurance company, fulfil all the requirements.  We are strongly recognising the insurance broker.  We are keeping the agents off his back substantially and we are bringing in professional indemnity and a whole range of protection for the public that gives the broker a great head start.  It does not wipe out competition from agents.  That is not what I intend to do.  I want to ensure that if there are agents people know they are agents and they have to say so on their headbill.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 97 states that he must state on his letter headings and business forms that he is an insurance agent.  That strengthens the Bill.  I do not think Senators have been entirely fair about the great step forward this is for the insurance broker in putting him on a professional standing, recognising his formal existence and pinning the agents to a situation where they must say in their letter headings the companies they are acting for and can act for no more than four.  If Senator Hogan is telling me that these are all the same businesses, that they are not, in fact, totally separate businesses, then I have obviously grounds to rethink, but if these are separate businesses and he accepts that five is the minimum figure, then four is the inescapable logic.</P>
    <P>I do not want to ignore Senators' appeals to think again but, in fairness, I do not see any point in thinking again if we are not going to get clear solutions to this question.  There are inescapable logics.  If Seantor Hogan is saying to me: &ldquo;Forget about five&rdquo;&mdash; that is what I think the Senator is saying to me &mdash; that is not on because it means that someone who does not have at least five companies can be a broker.  That is not consumer protection.  That, in effect, is being the company's man.  I want to ensure that, <Col N="346" /> before someone puts up his plate as a broker, he can offer at least five companies, which is a large share of the market.  If the Senator accepts that that is not negotiable, the rest of it falls apart, but if he wants to negotiate that, we are into a different game altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has failed to recognise one thing, that is, that if you have four non-life and four life agencies you can do most of the business on the insurance market at the moment adequately.  That is what, in fact, the Minister is doing.  He is giving the agent the right to do 70 per cent of the business on the life and non-life side which is done each year by four life or four non-life companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I give some information on that because it might help our discussion?  If a person has four agencies, the maximum slice of the business he could offer on the non-life side would be 39 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a theoretical piece of information which I have no doubt bears no resemblance to the actual picture of today in the insurance market.  As somebody who is dealing with it every day that I am not involved in legislation in this House, I can assure the Minister that if I had four agencies on the non-life side and four agencies on the life side I would certainly be in a great position to do 70 per cent of the business I would want to do.  I can tell the Minister this from my own experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with them. Maybe the situation has changed since 1986.  I can assure the Minister that there is adequate business to be done by an insurance agent with four life and four non-life agencies at the moment.  The Minister is legislating for the fact that he is going to bring about a situation where the smaller brokers in this country will evade their responsibilities by becoming <Col N="347" /> even more professional, by taking out professional indemnity, by upping their standards, qualifications and experience, by becoming agents rather than brokers. That is effectively what the Minister is going to do.  Nobody brought up the argument about having four life and one non-life agency or four non-life and one life agency except the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a real argument. We agree with the Minister that in legislation there must be an equal number of agencies on the life and the non-life sides. I totally agree with the Minister but I do not accept that the number of agencies he is seeking to define as a broker or an agent at the moment is in keeping with the practical implementation of this legislation on the ground.  There is no way the Minister cannot adequately cope with most of the insurance quotations in the market today by just having four non-life and four life agencies.  That is the kernal of the practical implementation of the policy.  I fail to see why the Minister does not recognise that if a broker &mdash; let us say we agree on two life and two non-life as the definition of an agent &mdash; with all the overheads that he now has he will have more overheads as a result of this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to make sure that we tie down the situation to such an extent that we clearly define what is an agent and what is a broker.  A broker will go out of his or her way in order to get as many agencies as possible on the life and non-life side if they are going to be dealing with the type of overheads and <Col N="348" /> the type of establishment they will need in order to compete effectively with other insurance brokers or intermediaries in the market place.  That surely is in the best interests of the consumer and the policyholder.</P>
      <P>The reason we are concerned about the number of life agencies an agent can have is to ensure that the best possible choice and protection are given under the legislation by making sure that most of the people are conforming to the broker requirements put forward in this Bill.  If agents are allowed to have up to four non-life agencies and four life agencies, they will not bother getting more than that in order to give a better consumer choice because they will than have to set up appropriate standards and they will have to take out professional indemnity.</P>
      <P>What will happen?  The company are taking up the cudgels in relation to a policyholder if something goes wrong in relation to a claim in the life or the non-life side at the moment from the definition of agent.  I can see the day when companies will be loth to give out agencies to people who will not have the prescribed qualifications, the experience, the necessary professional indemnity, or necessary qualifications to carry out business properly.  That is clearly the direction in which the Minister and I would like to see the industry developing, where people's standards are improved, where the consumer will get more protection and more choice and where we can ensure that the legislation the Minister is proposing can be implemented in the work-place and in the marketplace, rather than just theoretically talking about having four agencies in the life and non-life side on letter headings.  It will be very difficult to monitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal again to the Minister to look at this.  It will not make any difference if we leave this matter until Report Stage. To coin a phrase in the insurance industry, a cooling off period is necessary.  We should have self-regulation in the implementation of this legislation as well as in the insurance industry.  I hope the Minister will consider self-regulation and a cooling off period in relation to this <Col N="349" /> matter also.  He could leave it for two weeks because I would like to have the opportunity to discuss it more fully and be given new evidence of what we are talking about in the market-place.  We are at one in trying to ensure that there are no loopholes in the legislation and we can make sure that it is possible to implement it practically on the ground rattier than just some theoretical thing we are trying to implement at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The danger is that if it is five and five and four and four many brokers may opt to step down to the status of agent.  This would obviously not be good for the policyholder.  Is there any middle ground whereby if we accept five and five and four and four for the agent the Minister could put in another condition that if an agent stepped above two and two he would then have to have professional indemnity but that he would not have to join an association?  Could that be explored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The last point made by Senator Mulroy is valid.  The question of brokers who &mdash; I am talking about many rural brokers with turnovers of £0.5 million to £1 million who make up the bulk of the NIBA membership.  Many of them will be tempted very strongly to revert back to agent status.  The Minister has indicated to us that four non-life agencies equals 39 per cent of business.  Senator Hogan disputes that figure.  I too, was staggered by the figure of 39 per cent.  If the Minister checks on the brokers he will find possibly six companies emerging as the companies where most of the business is done.  The smaller companies are getting a minimal amount of business.  If you take six companies I guarantee that the majority of those have by far the bulk of the business.  Therefore, it is logical to assume that the broker or the agent having four of the top companies transacting non-life business can well push that figure up to 75 per cent or 80 per cent.  I had discussions with country brokers and they have said the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think Senator Hogan is very worried about section 75 as it stands.  He <Col N="350" /> will almost certainly agree to it.  His main concern and my concern is amendment No. 97.  Perhaps there may be movement or compromise by the Minister; he may say he will agree on five insurers as distinct from five life and five non-life or he may come down to four and maybe an agent of three.  Both are related.  You cannot move one without having consequences for the other.  We will have a debate on Report Stage.  These amendments are the most contentious in the Bill.  It might be better to allow further investigation and to put it off until Report Stage in two or three weeks time.  The Minister will have to defer section 75 and, consequently, section 97.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the agent status of having four and four.  I am quite certain that many small brokers throughout the country with £0.5 million turnover will decide they can do most of their business with the four top companies in the non-life business, they will go as an agent and let the insurance company carry the professional indemnity for them and will not have to spend £5,000 to £10,000 taking out a professional indemnity bond. When the insurer has responsibility for the agent, what happens if an agent absconds with a single premium of £50,000?  The logical thing would be if you could prove that he had an agency with company X you would go to them and say &ldquo;well, he has an agency with you, the money was clearly intended for you&rdquo;. Or if he had two agencies you could say: &ldquo;this money was meant for both of your companies, he is your agent, you look after the consumer, you pay back the £50,000&rdquo;.  If it is four you could say: &ldquo;the four of you split it four ways&rdquo;.  Surely one of them would say &ldquo;Well, he gave us less business&rdquo;.  As far as life assurance is concerned, the fewer agencies an agent has the greater control you have on him. Therefore, there is less likelihood of this happening because the company would be doing their business and if it happened the company would have to take responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>I suggest as a compromise five insurers or four life and four non-life for the broker and reduce the agent to three life <Col N="351" /> and three non-life.  This would limit the whole area of concern.  If you give an open country to agents with four agents on both life and non-life they can do practically what they like.  I am in favour of a further curtailment of agencies.  As a compromise I ask the Minister to leave over sections 75 and 97 for Report Stage for further investigation.  These sections are the only real contentious sections in the Bill and it would be worthwhile having a cooling off period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment agents have complete open country.  I am trying to pin them down and we are doing that in a logical way.  I listened carefully to Senators and I have tried to listen to the practical suggestions.  One suggestion is to reduce the figure five to four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Senator is now saying that somebody can become broker with four agencies on both sides. Obviously this is separate business so what goes for life must go for non-life.  I did not hear any Senators dispute that.  I listened carefully to pick up that trend. These are separate businesses so what applies to one has to apply to the other. If any Senator disputes that I would like to hear about it soon.  I am treating them as separate businesses applying the same rules to both sides.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion put forward by Senator Fallon, of taking it down to four, that would mean that someone could become a broker offering, at a maximum, less than half the market or about half the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the figures in the blue booklet I am working on indicate that you could then become a broker at a very low stage &mdash; you could then become a broker offering less than half of the market.  I could not put into a Bill that the State would recognise a <Col N="352" /> broker who offers less than half the market.  That is my problem with four which brings us back to the reason five was picked and agreed by most people in the past.  As Senator Fallon said &mdash; he is accepting the logic of it &mdash; if you accept five then you cannot dodge four.  I have not heard from Senator Hogan clearly enough his dispute with the figure five. He is still saying that you can be a broker at anything above one and one.  I have to reject that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will re-phrase that. The Senator is saying there should not be a minimum number above which one becomes a broker.  If that is what he is saying I could not accept that because that would spoil the whole principle of the Bill which is that to be a broker you must have a certain number.  If that is the situation then I am in difficulty.  The thing about cooling off is that the Bill has been published since 1986 so I do not know how much longer we can cool off on this. I know that we have moved substantially along the road to showing people that we are trying to build up the broking bodies as professional organisations.</P>
      <P>I will respond crisply to Senator Fallon's question about an agent who absconds with £50,000 and who do you chase.  Under this Bill it should be acknowledged that we are laying the bonding requirement on agents.  First of all, an agent will be bonded on 25 per cent of turnover.  That will go some way to protecting the £50,000.  Secondly, if that does not catch him on the £50,000, section 44 of the Bill will.  It says: &ldquo;Where a premium is paid to an insurance agent in respect of a renewal of a policy which has been invited by the insurer&rdquo;&mdash; you would know the specific company &mdash;&ldquo;or in respect of an accepted proposal&rdquo;&mdash; you would know the company &mdash;&ldquo;the premium shall be treated as having been paid to the insurer&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the large single premium the bonding will cover that area or 25 per cent of turnover.  We can always look at the figures if we want to look at them.  The principle is that 25 per cent of turnover could cover it.  That is a separate debate about the level of bonding.  The fact is there is bonding; there is a figure on it and if it is renewed you know the company, so there is that protection.</P>
      <P>Senators have to address the basic question as to whether there should be a figure of five before anyone can be a broker or whether there should not be a figure of five for someone to be a broker. We must settle that question.  Everything else is consequential to it.  If we do not accept it, the whole debate is open on various areas.  If we accept it then the figure of four is inescapable.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Fallon I have little difficulty in accepting the definition of &ldquo;broker&rdquo; under amendment No. 75 but, as he points out, there is a problem in relation to what is the definition of an agent.  The Minister and his Department fail to recognise what is an inescapable fact in the day to day operation of the insurance business.  A considerable amount of business can be done by four agencies on the life side and four agencies on the non-life side.  That is something the Minister has not addressed.  He can give me all the figures he likes in relation to the Blue Book which might indicate 39 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Minister is speaking on the life side is he telling me that with four agencies an agent will not be able to conjure up and corral most of the business he would come up against in quotations he might have to submit, that he would not get up to 70 per cent or 75 per cent of the business he would quote for by those four leading companies?  In the non-life side as well because you have a large number of companies who are not <Col N="354" /> quoting at all for certain risks at present you will find the four leading non-life companies garner a significant proportion of that business as well if you quote for it.</P>
      <P>The evidence of that is in the renewal of a person's policy.  If a person takes out a policy in 1987 with Hibernian and if he wants to renew that policy in 1988 he will not leave the insurance broker's office for the sake of £2, £3 or a very small margin. By and large the leading four non-life companies in the Irish insurance business will garner in a significant proportion of that business in the fire, motor and household business in this country.</P>
      <P>The problem we have is not so much in what we perceive as the minimum number of agencies a broker should have, because that would be in the broker's interest with the levels of overheads and expenses that they would have.  A broker could not sustain himself or herself as a broker by the imposition in relation to standards, professional indemnity, bonding etc, by just having a mere four or five agencies.  A broker could not do that but an agent can because he will not have that expense and the overheads the broker would have.  He will not need professional indemnity.</P>
      <P>That is a significant cost and the Minister's Department are well aware of that. We will be addressing that in the next section.  When all those costs incurred by a broker are taken into account it is in the broker's interest to get as many agencies as he or she can in order to give the best possible consumer choice and the best possible service to the consumer market, to pay for the establishment he must maintain from day to day and week to week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that amendments Nos. 75 and 97 are inter-linked.  I again appeal for a cooling off period to consider it maturely. I do not want to put this to a vote.  If I have no other option and if I am not given any re-consideration, if it does not appear that the Minister is prepared to do that today, I have no option but to put it to a vote.  I do not like dividing the House on an issue which I am extremely concerned about and when I know in my heart and <Col N="355" /> soul that I am speaking for the practical implementation of this Bill on the ground.  It is for that reason that I would not like to see an amendment like this going through without a division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the House, the figure of 39 per cent is being disputed on the non-life side.  If the Senator has a pencil he can help me do the calculation.  The figure should be carefully checked.  The total premium income on the non-life side is £637 million. The four largest companies, the Hibernian, Guardian Royal Exchange, ICI and Sun Alliance are the four largest companies on the non-life side, report total premium income of £251 million. That figure as a percentage of £637 million is 39 per cent.  They are the declared premium income figures of the companies and of the industry.  In fairness to the Senators I want to stress that the PMPA are outside the figure because they are not a broker company as such.</P>
      <P>I can only operate on the basis of those kind of figures.  If they are being disputed I cannot really operate on hunches in this business.  I have to operate on the basis of statistics available to me.  The figure on the life side is obviously larger, but again it depends on whether you include one large company or not.  On the life side, for example, if you had four agencies you could go up to well over 60 per cent of the market but five would catapult you up to 75 per cent of the market.  If you take out Irish life, just to show how important that is, you are down to 31 per cent of the market.  If Irish Life is not one of the four on the life side you are down to 31 per cent of the market-place.  On the non-life side, I am assuming one would get the agencies from the four largest companies and that would give 39 per cent of the market.  If the broker figure changes from five to four I am in a position where I am not guaranteed that brokers offer a majority of the market.</P>

      <P>I see the point that brokers probably will have more but if we are introducing an Insurance Bill, and I am being asked to define &ldquo;broker&rdquo; and officially to recognise brokers and lay all sorts of conditions on them, then we have to make some attempt to say what the minimum figure for a broker should be. I keep coming back to that.  If we dodge that central question and leave it to the market-place to find its own level, then I cannot be certain that brokers will have at least five and five and therefore I cannot assure the public that the people they are dealing with as brokers have a minimum number.  Should the broker minimum figure be higher than five if Senator Fallon's point is taken that in the market-place they all have more than five?  Then why do we not make it seven, eight or nine?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be enormous pressure financially on a broker to take out as many agencies as he or she can possibly get in order to get as wide an amount of business as possible into that particular brokerage in order to survive. That is the reality of the day-to-day operation of brokerages, with commissions cut in half over the last year and a half in order to justify reductions in premiums; yet following the reduction of the commissions the premiums went up.  That is the way the brokerage industry and the intermediaries who call themselves brokers have suffered over the past two years.  That has to be recognised.  That is the reason I called a vote on an amendment on the last occasion we discussed this Bill to allow the Minister to increase commissions if they are insufficient.</P>
      <P>That is the next stage of development in the insurance industry that could be lurking around the corner if we put on brokers all those conditions in this Bill. They will have to be seen to be getting a fair crack of the whip <i>vis-á-vis</i> agents.  We cannot have people operating from sitting rooms in their houses offering policies with the same companies as people who have fully established offices in the centre of town, paying dearly either in rental purchase or rent and having to staff their offices and meet all the requirements laid down for brokers in this Bill.  The financial overheads involved in running a business are enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> Those financial pressures will not come to bear on agents because there is no particular reason why they should establish themselves in an office.  Their only cost will be bonding.  They do not have to have an office, any overheads of that nature or any professional indemnity. That is a huge outlay that will be essential for a broker.  The Minister is failing to recognise that it will be in the interest of the broker to get as many agencies as he possibly can in order to give the required service to the consumer and the policyholder and make more money for himself at the end of the day.  That is the reality of the world today in the brokerage business. We are talking around the issue by talking about a figure of five in relation to brokers.  It should be a figure of 15 at least from the point of view of the brokers because they will need that in order to survive.  The problem is with the agent. We are talking about four and the Minister admitted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Senators who have spoken with regard to the agents and the number of companies they will have.  It is great that we have this Bill.  It has been a long time coming and I know there has been a great deal of canvassing and lobbying to get this Bill into the Oireachtas.  For a long time there has been evidence that it is necessary to regulate brokers and to recognise their professional standing and the important job they do.  We are very fortunate to have in the Seanad such an excellent <Col N="359" /> debate, with very fair, balanced contributions being made by people who are involved in the industry.  This is always a very important feature of Committee Stage debate.</P>
      <P>What Senators Hogan and Fallon are saying is absolutely right.  I have some experience and information about the role of the broker.  We must in this legislation have a bias towards the brokers because in recent years they have had a very tough time.  It has been extremely difficult for brokers to survive.  I am not asking for disproportionate or unfair advantage for them, but they have to bear the expense of a bond, to pay a staff and to maintain more and more sophisticated and expensive offices. These are not required of insurance agents, many of whom have other sources of income.  The insurance brokers do a very important and worth-while job. Very often they save money and they save time.  There is a need for brokers and we have to ensure the continuation of the brokerage industry.  I do not think that will be done with the kind of balance the Minister has in mind.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to go back to Government on this if necessary.  I am sure that is not necessary and the Bill has a long way to go from this House.  It has to go to th Dáil yet.  The strength of feeling and the very reasonable requests that are being made by NIBA and others in the brokerage industry are fair and I appeal to the Minister to have second thoughts about it and give a commitment that will, if possible, make life easier for brokers in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make life easier for brokers in the future and that is why for the first time we have put into this Bill a limit on agents.  That is why we have tried to take the agencies out of the back seat of the car, as was said earlier, and bring them to a place where they can be seen.  We have to be very clear about this question of agents not having any overheads or anything like that.  The company takes full responsibility for the professional indemnity insurance in the case <Col N="360" /> of tied agents and in the case of agents. The bonding applies to both and that can be reasonably expensive too.  The separate client account applies to both. The disclosure requirements on an agent with regard to billheads and informing the client officially etc. lay some additional expense and restriction on the agent.  He now has to state publicly on his billhead and to the client that he is limited to a certain number of companies.</P>
      <P>There is an impression being created that agents will somehow be happy with this legislation.  They are far more unhappy than any brokers.  Certainly any agents I have talked to are not at all happy with this.  I would not expect that they would be, nor is it my job to ensure that any sector is happy.  Rather it is my job to make sure that a person dealing with an insurance intermediary who is a broker can be offered a wide range of choice, certainly more than half the market.  An agent is somebody who has a very limited choice, says so in his billhead, has bonding and is holding himself out not to be an independent person but a person with a very limited choice.</P>
      <P>I do not see brokers stepping down to agents, as has been said by many Senators.  I predict here that the trend will be the other way.  Agents will now have these bonding requirements, they will have to keep separate accounts and they will now have to be much more satisfactory to the companies in question because, it is the companies' money they will be risking in terms of the companies' support for them.  When they have to say publicly that they are limited to a smaller share of the market than brokers, I will be very surprised if most agents wanting to do the business seriously do not attempt to go the other way and move up to the status of broker, which now has official recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are seeking to build the broking bodies into good, strong, professional institutions, which is one of my main aims.  It is natural when for the first time we make a distinction that those on either side of the line will be upset and worried. I ask Senators to concentrate on the positive aspects here.  This is the first time we <Col N="361" /> have made a distinction.  We are corralling agents; we are keeping them in a position where they are much more limited, but we are not wiping them off the map.  I do not think Senators are asking for that but it could be tantamount to that if we go as far as some Senators want.  That is not the way to do our business here.  We have to recognise the realities in the marketplace and give the industry time to adjust to them.</P>
    <P>I would like Senators to concentrate on the positive aspects.  We are doing something brand new here.  We are bringing in bonding, separate client accounts, professional indemnity.  We are separating agents from brokers.  We are formally recognising the status of broker and giving brokers a position where we can help them to build their professional institutions over the years.  We are taking a substantial step forward here and I ask Senators to think clearly whether they are not asking me to go too far by saying that I should take the additional step and dump them altogether.  Let us consider whether that is a reasonable suggestion. Senators should have a long look at the list of major steps forward in this legislation which put the broker on the map, give consumer choice, give protection to the public and put the agents in a position which is clearly inferior to that of the professional broker.</P>
    <P>If Senators accept the balance in the legislation, I appeal to them accept the logic that we are doing what we can, given a very difficult situation.  There will be other days when one can go further. This is not necessarily the final item in all of this.  It is not necessary to do it all in one swoop.  We have put into legislation for the first time ever a clear distinction between brokers and agents and that is a big step forward.  It is a major victory for those who wanted that distinction.  It is also a major victory for those who wanted agents to be pinned down, perhaps not with nails in all four corners but nevertheless pinned.  I ask Senators, particularly those who know the industry, to accept that this is realistic considering the difficulties we face.</P>
    <P>The best I can say to Senators in regard <Col N="362" /> to their various representations is to reiterate what Senator Fennell has said about this Bill having a long way to go. It has to go to the Dáil and it will probably have to come back here if there are amendments in the Dáil.  We will have plenty of time to see whether some additional modifications are required when the Bill is in the Dáil.  As I sit here today the inescapable logic is still there. The best I can offer Senators today is to undertake to discuss with them and with Deputies whether any further modifications or amendments are required.  If the Government are convinced that they are required, I will introduce those modifications or amendments.  In the meantime I would ask Senators to adopt the Government amendments.  I can assure Senators that I will continue to think about the Bill between now and Report Stage.  We have yet to have Report Stage in this House and all Stages in the Dáil. It is important that we adopt the Government amendments.</P>
    <P>We have not come up with a logical solution today to a very knotty problem. I would ask Senators to consider the long list of positive elements, the major changes, the increased stature of brokers and to set that off against their disappointment that we did not find it possible to go a little further.  We are arguing here about one agency.  If you balance that one agency against all the positive measures in this Bill, you will see that it is not a bad day's work initially.  There is plenty of time to go further if we need to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In non-life insurance bonding of intermediaries are not required to any great extent to protect consumers, as the effective position is that intermediaries are acting as agents of insurance companies for the purpose of collecting non-life premiums, which they hold in trust on behalf of the companies concerned.  In other words, payment of a premium to an intermediary in respect of non-life insurance is accepted in nearly all cases as payment to the insurer.  This position is proposed to be copperfastened in statute by section 44 of this Bill, account being taken of the proposed Government amendments Nos. 108 and 112.  With most forms of life assurance, once a proposal has been accepted, premiums are invariably paid direct to the insurer and brokers are not involved.  Nevertheless, there are some gaps in financial protection for the consumer in the case of some areas of life <Col N="366" /> assurance, for example, where money is entrusted to an intermediary before a proposal is accepted by an insurer.  This is where the bonding requirement will improve matters.  This arises mainly in relation to single premium investments for the purpose of life assurance business. It is clear from the foregoing that the bond level of £100,000 envisaged under the original section 39 may be either too much or too little.  Representations from brokers and others since Second Stage debate in the Seanad in October last have said as much.  This has resulted in a proposed differential approach to life and non-life bonding, which is the basis of the changes to section 39.</P>
      <P>The main thrusts of these changes are, first, the level of bond required will be directly related to the intermediary's defined turnover, that is the amount of client moneys retained by an intermediary before he passes them on to an insurance company or, in certain circumstances, to the client.  This means that the bond level will be more directly related to actual potential exposure for client's money.  Second, with the exception of tied agency business, all insurance brokers and insurance agents with an annual defined turnover of £25,000 passing through the new and obligatory separate client bank account will be required to hold a bond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of the amendment is, I hope, self-explanatory.  It relates to the first year of operation of the bonding scheme.  The new subsection (2) requires non-life intermediaries to hold a flat bond of £25,000, provided defined turnover is in excess of £25,000 per annum.  It also requires life intermediaries to hold a bond of £25,000 or 25 per cent of turnover, whichever is the greater.  The new subsection (3) requires that composite intermediaries &mdash; persons acting in relation to both life and non-life business &mdash; hold a bond of £25,000 or 25 per cent of defined life turnover, whichever is the greater.  The new subsection (4) exempts intermediaries with an annual turnover of less than £25,000 from having to hold a bond.  This minimum threshold approach is to cater for agents in business <Col N="367" /> in a very small, part-time way, typically those acting on behalf of extended families or friends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has reduced the amount from £100,000 to £25,000.  But again he fails to see the theory being put into practice in so far as there is no such thing as life assurance turnover.  The practical implementation of that measure is rendered useless due to the fact that most of the commissions which are paid to life assurance people are paid net.  Reference was made to 25 per cent of turnover in relation to life assurance.  That is ridiculous in the extreme.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) deals with the insurance intermediary where turnover does not exceed £25,000.  Those are the very people we have been talking about and which the Minister is defining as agents. It shows the inability of those people to give the necessary consumer choice. They lack the essential wherewithal to deal with people who are totally committed to the business of giving a wide choice and having proper standards, experience and qualifications to deal with people.  The Minister should seek to amend, on Report Stage, the 25 per cent of turnover in relation to life assurance. It does not have any practical significance in relation to the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of life assurance turnover means the aggregate of all moneys required to be paid by an intermediary into the separate bank account provided for under section 40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hogan raised the problem which this definition and the whole section in regard to the bonding of life assurance brokers can create.  For example, the whole thinking behind the bond is to protect the consumer against fraud.  If a life insurance broker wishes to pocket the money he has got from his client he can do it in many ways &mdash; he can put it in his own personal account. The idea of having a separate bank <Col N="368" /> account would not prevent such a situation occurring.  You must remember too, that when you talk about life premiums, you are talking about most of the business being transacted through a banker's order, through staff schemes or possibly a cheque made payable direct to the company.  In fact the majority of the money of life brokers will not actually be handled by him.  That in itself will create many problems.  There are many very large group pension schemes, which are not handled by the broker.  They are organised by banker's order direct to the company.  It will be very difficult to administer this whole scheme.  The 25 per cent turnover requirement appears to be quite onerous.  We will need clearer definitions and clearer examples of how this section will operate because I can see that it may, in the years ahead, present problems.  It is as well to tackle those problems now if we can, rather than at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I take the spirit of the points made.  The bonding provisions are there for very good reasons.  We started off with a figure of £100,000 but representations were made that this figure was too crude &mdash; for small companies it is too much, for big companies it is not enough.  That is logical and I took account of it.  I decided to try to get a sliding scale on this, so that the bigger you are, the more exposure the public have, the greater the bond.  That made more sense than the rather crude £100,000 approach. Both Senators were very helpful in pointing that out to us and we took it on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the specific question that both Senators put to me about life assurance turnover, with respect, it is not a misunderstanding on my part.  The Senators are saying that the money in effect does not go to the client's account but that it goes directly.  If it goes directly then it does not go into the account, and if it does not go into the account then there is no need for the 25 per cent bond, because the 25 per cent bond is on the account.  In fact, that is encouraging the <Col N="369" /> money to go direct.  If it goes into the account, then we will put on the 25 per cent; if it does not, then we do not put on the 25 per cent.  The 25 per cent goes on to what goes through the client's account.  In many ways this encourages the money to be sent directly and, therefore, it gives greater protection.</P>
    <P>The bonding provisions cannot prevent fraud.  We can only mitigate the consequences of it, but I take the Senator's point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fallon raised a point earlier in the debate in relation to a £50,000 single premium bond that one might want to invest.  The Minister answered that, but I did not take him up on it.  It is more appropriate to the bonding we are talking about now.  The £25,000 the Minister speaks about, in the context of an example given by Senator Fallon of a £50,000 single premium bond, if the insurance intermediary gets that £50,000 and goes off to back a horse, or whatever way they want to dispose of it, without signing any proposal form or without getting into direct contact with any insurance company, the £25,000 bond will not cover the unfortunate quasi-proposer in that situation.  How does the Minister propose to tackle that?</P>
      <P>Regarding the 25 per cent turnover the Minister introduced in relation to life assurance savings, is there a reason why there was no turnover figure mentioned for the non-life area?  I would be interested to know the Minister's thinking on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the £50,000 example Senator Fallon quite rightly raised, the only reaction I can give to that is that there is a bond in place for 25 per cent of turnover and it should cover it. It is 25 per cent on the previous year's turnover and it should cover it unless somebody is starting with that kind of business and that would be unusual.  He would need to have been making quantum leaps in business, such as having growth rates of substantial percentages, to get left behind.  The 25 per cent rate <Col N="370" /> should cover it, but there may be cases where it will not cover it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, it does not matter what stage a person is at in business, a person could get a bond of £100,000.  There are people in society still, the Minister will be glad to know, who have significant amounts of money on which they want to get a decent return. They go to brokers in order to seek advice on it rather than agents, as we are in a good position to advise them properly, or rather than go to the bank managers, who often have difficulties in releasing moneys in order to introduce it to insurance companies, for obvious reasons from the bank managers' point of view and from the building societies managers' point of view.  If the insurance bond does not cover the amount of claim, an amount that would be embezzled in that situation, who picks up the remainder of the claim, or does the proposer have to suffer the loss?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>You have to pick a figure: that is the only answer to that. When there is a blank sheet in front of you, you have to pick a figure, and the figure of 25 per cent turnover seems to be a reasonable figure if based on the exposure or the cash flow drag at any one time.  One should have 75 per cent of one's turnover turning over in cash at any one time, leaving 25 per cent of it hanging around.  I understood Senators original worry was that the figure might be too high and, therefore, too expensive and if the loss turns out to be greater who carries it?  The answer is obvious; it is not carried, but we pick a figure that is sensible and 25 per cent of one's turnover should be the most that one should be exposed for.  We will not cover all cases. We may have to come back in years to come and up that figure substantially.</P>

      <P>As the Minister and his officials know, the NIBA organisation have over the past 12 months approximately been asking their members to contribute a figure every month to prepare a recognised compensation fund in the same way as travel agents, auctioneers and others so that they would have a fund.  The figures are available and they are growing monthly.  By the time this Bill becomes law they will have increased further, obviously.  What is the Ministers view on this?  The fact that from a very early day the NIBA organisation decided they should anticipate and know what was in the Bill, and work on it immediately, is a tribute to them.  I would like the Minister to respond positively and to recognise their efforts in going to the bother of contributing monthly so that they can have what they would regard as a proper consumer bond fund.</P>

      <P>In relation to the section, I am glad that the Minister has reduced the amount of bonding from £100,000 to £25,000.  On subsection (4) of the new section, amendment No. 80, I am concerned about the fact that we will have now intermediaries with a turnover of less than £25,000 who will have no bonding whatsoever.  We are trying to devise and enact legislation in which we are praising ourselves from the viewpoint of protecting the consumer.  Here we are, in the life area in particular, whereby the turnover will be invisible in so far as the net payments will be made.  The Minister has explained there what he means by encouraging people to pay direct.  If the Minister is encouraging people to pay direct and the proposal forms are filled up and some mistakes are made by an intermediary or if bonds are lodged with an insurance company and claims arise, <Col N="374" /> and if there is fraudulent dealing and the bonds do not cover it, then we are not protecting the consumer in the life assurance area.  By having a turnover of £25,000 or less, we are effectively saying that the consumer has no protection in this area by the bonding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I would like to refer to.  First, Senator Fallon's point: the Bill will say that the Minister may by regulation provide that arrangements in relation to the bond shall be entered into only by persons of a class specified.  We are providing here for a situation where, for example, neither would have a scheme or an arrangement made.  Providing that complies with all the Insurance Acts we can then recognise it under legislation and make the subsequent changes in the scheme, and that is covered.</P>
      <P>On Senator Hogan's point, I do not think it is sensible to be getting into figures below £25,000 turnover for a business. I know that they need protection at every level, but this is a business where the sums can be quite large.  We selected that figure because it is more policeable. It will cover the vast majority of the business, leaving out of it some very small element of the business.  I think it is practical. We do not want to chase every little corner of the business because it would just tie us all down.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 95:</P>
      <P>In page 22, before section 40, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; .&mdash;(1)  An insurance intermediary shall keep a separate bank account for each of the following classes of business&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  an account in connection with premiums payable to insurers under contracts of non-life insurance, or money paid or payable to policyholders by undertakings authorised under the Regulations of 1976;</P>
      <P>(b)  an account in connection with premiums payable to insurers under contracts of life assurance, or money paid or payable to policyholders by undertakings authorised under the Regulations of 1984, and</P>
      <P>(i)  all moneys, other than commission payments and service charges, received by him in connection with either such class of business shall be paid into the appropriate account, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  neither the State nor any person shall have or obtain any recourse or right against money <Col N="376" /> standing to the credit of such account or accounts in respect of a claim or right against an insurance intermediary until all proper claims against these moneys have been satisfied.</P>
    <P>(2)  The account to be kept&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  under subsection (1) (a) shall be designated in all financial records maintained by the intermediary as &lsquo;section 40&mdash;Non-life insurance account&rsquo;,</P>
    <P>(b)  under subsection (1) (b) shall be designated in all financial records maintained by the intermediary as &lsquo;section 40&mdash;Life Assurance account&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>(3)  This section shall not apply as respect a tied insurance agent in so far as moneys received by him in connection with premiums payable to undertakings under contracts of insurance or moneys payable to policyholders by undertakings, relate to a tied agency agreement or arrangement entered into by the tied insurance agent.</P>
    <P>(4)  For the purposes of this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;service charge&rsquo; means an amount payable, or payable in certain circumstances, by a client to an intermediary in respect of his services in relation to contracts of insurance but does not include any premium or part thereof payable to an undertaking;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;tied agency agreement or arrangement&rsquo; has the meaning assigned to it in section 43;</P>

      <P>The difference between this new section 40 and that published in the Bill is that, except for tied agency business, all intermediaries, and not just brokers, will have to keep clearly identifiable separate client bank accounts for life and non-life business, <Col N="377" /> and that all moneys received by an intermediary in connection with either class of business will have to be paid into the appropriate account.  Commission payments and service charges are, however, excluded for self-evident reasons.</P>
      <P>The amount passing through the client account is, therefore, the defined turnover reckonable for bonding purpose, which I referred to earlier.  Commission and service charges are proposed to be excluded from the client accounts, so as not to unfairly inflate turnover commission and service charges which are the remuneration of insurance intermediaries rather than exposed clients' money and need not, therefore, be bonded.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the new section avoids the use of the word &ldquo;claims&rdquo;.  The insurance industry represented that insurance companies do not, under any circumstances, make claims cheques payable to intermediaries.  Consequently there should be no circumstances in which an intermediary would be in a position to lodge a claim cheque in the separate bank account.  The word &ldquo;moneys&rdquo; is broad enough in any event to cover all eventualities in this particular respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The significant differences between section 41 of the published Bill dealing with insurance agent's qualifications and the text of the new section are, first, two years after the coming into force of the section, the maximum number of agencies which can be held by an agent will be limited to four life agencies and four non-life agencies. Tied agents will be subject to the same status disclosure rules as agents, and tied agents will be limited to one agency in the category, life or non-life insurance, in which they hold a tied agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have decided to try to reflect in the Bill the public's need to be very clear about whom they are dealing with &mdash; tied agent, agent or broker &mdash; when they seek advice about insurance.  There was a place in the marketing mix for individual insurance companies selling their product directly to the public, for agents who represent one or, perhaps, a small number of those companies, and for independent brokers who advise clients on a wider spectrum of products available. From initial reactions to the Bill on its introduction it is abundantly clear that the public have a need to distinguish between these different types of selling operations.  The amendments, therefore, aim to highlight that distinction rather than to blur it.  For instance, treating all intermediaries as if they were offering <Col N="380" /> the same service &mdash; I think we have bitten that particular bullet.  I would like to emphasise that it is not necessarily the purpose of the Bill to favour one or the other, but to create conditions under which members of the public will be in no doubt as to what kind of service they are getting.  With this in mind the section sets a statutory ceiling on the number of agencies that an individual can hold.  The ceiling, as you can see from the amendment is being set at four in each category of business, life and non-life.</P>
    <P>I realise that this new statutory demarcation between agent and brokers may result in some rethinking by agents and brokers as to what business they want to be in.  That is an important part of sorting out the business in a general sense and putting the broker bodies on to an even more professional footing than they are on at the moment.</P>
    <P>I have undertaken &mdash; and do formally undertake &mdash; to enter into discussions with both Senators and Deputies, and to have a think about all the comments made in this debate today between now and Report Stage, and between now and the time the Bill comes to the Dáil, remembering particularly that it will probably, although I cannot pre-empt it, have to come back to the Seanad after the Dáil.  The views of the Dáil at that time I would value greatly because, in fairness the Seanad has made a very good input into this Bill.  Senators have been working very hard at it, which I appreciate. They have put forward very strong arguments in relation to this controversial section of the Bill.  It would be no harm if we adopted it, and then went on to hear the reports and the views of Deputies on the logic which we can follow in implementing it.  As of now, the only logic I have available to me is this as I have drafted it.  I ask Senators for their agreement to adopt it at this stage with my commitment that some thought and work will go into it between now and Report Stage and that we will have another opportunity to discuss it in the Dáil, and to come back from the Dáil and discuss it further.  With those assurances I would <Col N="381" /> hope the Seanad could permit this section to go through today.</P>

      <P>I will be opposing the insertion of this amendment.  I see no reason why the Minister, if he is prepared to consider the various arguments we have been putting forward under amendment No. 75 and now amendment No. 97, cannot take the initiative and postpone the implementation of this amendment to Report Stage in the Seanad.  We have to do a job here in the Seanad.  We cannot depend on Deputies to do a job for us, as the Minister can.  We have to enact the legislation as we see fit in this House.  If Deputies have more wisdom in the matter and want to propose amendments or changes, we will be glad to discuss them again when they return to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Taking this amendment, the argument has been well put and I will not go over the same ground again.  I do not agree that agents should be treated as liberally as the Minister is treating them in the Bill. He is giving them tremendous latitude to take up a significant proportion of the market without any regulation with the exception of bonding, with no recognition of the contribution which brokers have to make in terms of financial overheads, the number of agencies essential for them to survive in the business.  I cannot see why we should be treating agents in the liberal way we have been doing in this Bill, in the interests of consumer choice and protection and increasing the levels of standards and expertise that are so essential in the advice that is given to the policyholder.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go over the ground that was covered.  We discussed amendment No. 75 which is the brokers definition and amendment No. 97 at length from 2 o'clock until 3.30.  I am pleased that the Minister will look at it on Report Stage or, if not at Report Stage, then in the other House, and <Col N="382" /> change it at that stage.  He knows my views on the section dealing with the appointment of agents and the number of agencies each of them should hold, that is, four life and four non-life.  I would prefer a lesser figure, but I have to acknowledge that this has come a long way from the original Bill which was unlimited in the number of agencies an agent might hold.  While this Bill limits it to four, there is the extra stipulation that an agent has to have a separate client's account.  There is also the bonding arrangement for him.  It is an improvement. I would prefer a lowering of the fence.</P>
      <P>I would like to move onto the other aspect of this section and make one or two observations about the tied agents.  I am very strongly of the view that tied agents are cowboys.  We all know what that word means.  If there are cowboys in the industry, this is the area in which the cowboy can operate.  What the Minister has in the present setup with tied agents, as I understand and as the industry understand, is a situation whereby a tied agent agrees to tie himself to a particular insurance company.  He then can seek part-time temporary staff to go out and sell the product the company have to offer.  I have made the point that the insurance industry has a very proud tradition. Many people are striving for higher values and higher principles in the industry.  This is what this Bill is about. We have it from the companies and the brokers' organisation.  The area of the tied agent and the people he employs, and the training of the sub-agents, could be addressed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know what happens at present.  I have examples of where a tied agency appoints a housewife, an Army man, anyone who will sell a life policy.  They are given an agency, and told, &ldquo;That is the product&rdquo;. There is a short crash course of maybe two hours per day for two or three days, or two hours per week for two or three weeks.  They have to sell endowment assurances, single premiums and take in unit linked policies.  They knock on doors at all hours of the night.  They call on their relatives and they must do business <Col N="383" /> with them.  What happens eventually is that there is a break-off because they do not last the pace.  A lot of angry people are left behind.  This is the record in towns in this country.  There are many solicitors' letters floating around from people who thought they were onto a good thing and found that it was not as good as they thought.</P>
    <P>If the industry is to be serious about the tied agency, it has to examine it and the type of training given to the sub-agents of these tied agents.  I consider that insurance people in this country are members of ACII and FCII and are top class insurance people.  Some of them are out selling in the highways and byways. They are pitted against the individual who has a two hour crash programme.  It is crazy that we are allowing this.  It is known within the industry that, if a person loses his job or is made redundant, or is unfortunate in some way, you are told he has got another job and that he is selling life assurance.  It is the thing to do when you lose your job.  That could well be a reflection on the life assurance companies who have been far too liberal in the past in accepting the kind of people who have got agencies.  If you could sell a case at all you were given an agency, or with the prospect of one or two policies you would be granted an agency.  I hope this Bill will stop that.</P>
    <P>It comes back to the tied agent.  The sub-agent of the tied agent has to be closely examined.  There has to be a proper training course, not like the crash course for the eight or nine people taken on.  It must be more than that.  I would welcome a tightening up and some input into the training of the sub-agents.  If it is to continue &mdash; I hope it will not &mdash; better training facilities, longer training facilities and a greater knowledge of what the industry is about are necessary.  In my opinion better and longer training facilities lead to a greater knowledge of what the industry is about and will create an interest in and love of the industry. Insurance is not about telling barefaced lies, non disclosures and all that goes with it.  This is what the cowboys in the <Col N="384" /> industry are doing.  Tightening up would be very appropriate and I ask the Minister to investigate this and to respond positively to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally agree with what Senator Fallon has said about tied agents. It has been the experience of people in the industry that cowboys operating indiscriminately around the country, selling insurance without any experience or training, and with very little knowledge apart from being instructed to go and sell the product have brought the insurance industry into total disrepute.  This has called into question the bona fides of most people in the insurance industry.  Of all industries, the reputation of the insurance industry has been tarnished most by people who operate in this indiscriminate and inexperienced manner, selling a product whether it is good, bad or indifferent to the consumer.</P>
      <P>By and large the public know very little about insurance.  Many of the public would readily admit that they are lacking in knowledge of insurance.  That is probably the reason they go more often to insurance brokers than directly to companies in order to seek independent advice on the best cover they can get at the right price.  It calls into question the development of our insurance industry if we cannot tackle this cancer that is eating away at the development of the industry and the development of the insurance intermediaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree totally with Senator Fallon's suggestion about a proper training course which is essential for sub-agents.  They must be able to display to the general public and consumers their qualifications from the insurance course they have undertaken.  It is noticeable that in all the provincial papers, in particular, a week does not pass without various advertisements by tied agents seeking to employ people to sell their products.  It has gone to such an extreme now that urgent action is needed by the Minister to ensure that the goodwill that should be part and parcel of insurance intermediaries and the insurance companies does not continue to deteriorate further <Col N="385" /> and turn off the general public from service which can be so important to them. It is essential for the consumer in many cases.  There is a distaste now for insurance intermediaries, developed and compounded by the cowboy tactics of some tied agents at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Senator's viewpoint about the cowboy element in the business.  Unfortunately, you will get that in any business.  This Bill goes a long way towards tying down that situation.  The Bill makes the company much more responsible for the actions of their agents.  Before this Bill, one perhaps had a case in law, under the insurance legislation you could not formally pin the company to the agent, and we are now doing that in this Bill.  I say here today to any insurance company that they will have to look even more closely at whom they appoint as tied agents.  They will then have to be sure that those tied agents conduct themselves because the companies will be held responsible under this legislation.  It is a major step forward because now the companies are specifically held responsible for the performance of those tied agents.  That was not the case before this legislation was introduced and, therefore, it is a big step forward and should in some ease Senators' minds about that kind of performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest there is any worry about it, I would say to the insurance companies that they should be extremely careful about the agents and the tied agents they appoint because they are responsible for them.  I would be amazed if the insurance companies did not supervise more stringently the actions of their tied agents. That is my first point.  I say publicly to insurance companies that they should be extremely careful in the appointment of tied agents.  That is as far as any sensible person can go to ensure that those agents conduct themselves as they should.  We must be very careful not to cast any doubt on genuine people.  There are very good tied agents and, in fairness to them, we must acknowledge that.  Again I would <Col N="386" /> say to the companies: &ldquo;Be careful of whom you appoint as your agents&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 48 of the Bill, the section dealing with codes of conduct, allows selling practices to be regulated among other things.  It states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order prescribe codes of conduct to be observed by insurance brokers or insurance agents in the State.  Any such order may, in particular, specify the practices to be followed by brokers or agents in their dealings with their clients or the holders of authorisations or with other persons.</P>
    <P>Together with the fact that companies now have a more clear responsibility for agents that means that whole situation should be tightened up considerably.  I thank Senators for raising it with me.  I know it is a genuine worry and I would say in response that these two items in the Bill will go a long way towards dealing with the situation which they want dealt with.  I know the Irish Insurance Federation have moved voluntarily to improve matters in the area of selling practices with the 15 day cooling off period for consumers to cancel policies taken out by them.  This is another step in that direction.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Fallon, in particular, for his understanding with regard to the number of agents.  I formally put on the record that I fully understand what Senator Fallon has pointed out to me very forcibly, indeed, both privately and publicly today.  He would prefer a lesser figure than the ones I am proposing.  I wish also to thank him for accepting my assurance that I will discuss this with Senators and with Deputies and I will see where that takes us.  I appreciate his understanding and acknowledge that he has very strong personal views on this matter.  He has expressed these both publicly and privately and I am pleased that he is in a position to accept my assurances that I will not lose sight of his arguments as we proceed with this Bill.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 100:</P>
      <P>In page 22, lines 21 to 23, to delete subsection (1), and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  An insurance agent shall be deemed to be acting as the agent of the undertaking to whom a proposal for insurance is being made when, for the purpose of the formation of the insurance contract, he completes in his own hand or helps the proposer of an insurance policy to complete a proposal for insurance.  In such circumstances only, the insurer shall be responsible for any errors or omissions in the completed proposal form.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 43 (1) is being amended to clarify the company's responsibility for agents helping policyholders complete proposal forms.  The insurers had maintained that the existing wording was legally imprecise and cast doubt on the extent of an insurer's responsibility in this area.  The intention here is to cover errors and omissions by agents in relation to the completion of proposal forms.  This is achieved, I trust, under the new wording.  The substitution of the word &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;insurer&rdquo; is to maintain consistency in the text of the section with the rest of Part IV.  There is no substantive difference between &ldquo;insurer&rdquo; and &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo;. This is purely in the nature of a tidying up amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 101, the amendment proposed by Senator Hogan, while I accept that the section as it stands <Col N="389" /> overturns the current common law position on agents <i>vis-á-vis</i> clients in completing proposal forms, I do not consider it appropriate to do this in the case of brokers also.  It is imperative that a broker be clearly seen to be representing his client's interests when completing proposals.  Brokers offer themselves as independent advisers acting for a client. It follows therefore that they must have independent sources of protection.  This is provided by professional indemnity insurance.  To agree to the Senator's amendment would undermine the status of the broker as an independent professional intermediary.</P>
    <P>In amendments Nos. 102 to 107, inclusive, the substitution of the word &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;insurer&rdquo; is to maintain consistency in the text of the section with the rest of Part IV.  There is no difference between both phrases and it is important to tidy them up.</P>

      <P>The scope of section 44 of the published Bill is being broadened to provide that where premiums are paid to insurance intermediaries, agents and brokers, in respect of a renewal of a policy or an accepted proposal, that the premium shall be treated as having been paid to the insurer except where the policyholder is notified in writing by the insurer in advance that the intermediary has no authority to collect the premium on the insurer's behalf.

      <P>No. Agents and brokers. In regard to amendment No. 109 I <Col N="391" /> have set out the Government amendments which I am proposing to this section.  I am affectively accepting amendment No. 109 proposed by Senator Hogan by providing that where a premium is paid in respect of an accepted proposal or a renewal of a policy which has been agreed by an insurance company, whether to an agent or a broker, payment will be deemed to have been paid to the insurer.  With regard to amendment No. 113, I do not think the inclusion of the proviso suggested by the Senator concerning time limits and conditions would be fair on the consumer. After all intermediaries may not have brought such conditions to the attention of the insurer or more importantly may fail themselves to pay the client's premium within such time limits and conditions specified.</P>
      <P>The related Government amendment No. 114 exempts the insurer from liability where the insurer informs the policyholder in writing in reasonable time that an intermediary has no authority to collect premiums on their behalf.  This is fair and an important protection for both the insurers and the clients.  It is as far as one should go in this area.  Insurers always have the option to notify a policyholder directly in the event of nonpayment of a premium, within the time limit specified, that they are no longer on cover in relation to the particular risk involved.  The section does nothing to alter this state of affairs.  Matters are, in my view best left as they are and for this reason I do not propose to accept amendment No. 113 as proposed by Senator Hogan.</P>

      <P>No statute of limitations applies to the disqualification criteria in this section of the Bill as published.  For example, paragraph (e) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> he is or was a director of any company involved in insurance which has been compulsorily wound-up,.</P>
    <P>A person could have been a director of a company five or ten years prior to winding up and have acted entirely properly and innocently but he would nevertheless be disqualified from even acting as an insurance broker or an insurance agent as the section is presently drafted.  With a view to improving its overall balance, I am inserting here the proviso &ldquo;without the permission of the court&rdquo;.  The amendment qualifying this whole section gives discretion to the court to decide each individual case on its merits.  This will avoid any injustice arising while at the same time preserving a general prohibition on the unworthy.  The substitution of the word &ldquo;intermediary&rdquo; for &ldquo;broker&rdquo; in subsection (c) is self-explanatory. Subsection (e) is being amended so as to include not only insurance businesses wound up compulsorily by the court, but also creditors voluntarily winding-up. This is necessary because it is possible that clients could suffer losses in creditors voluntarily winding up also.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan has proposed amendment No. 121.  I take it that the Senator's concern is that paragraph (e) involved an element of retrospection.  However, this is not strictly correct.  What is involved here is the application of the necessary basic standard to be met by insurance intermediaries.  Furthermore, as I have already explained, Government amendment No. 119, qualifying this whole section, gives discretion to the court to decide each individual case on its merits. This will avoid any injustice arising while, at the same time, preserving a general prohibition on the unworthy and on discouraging spurious attempts to get around the restrictions on certain persons regarded as unsuitable to act in a fiduciary capacity as insurance brokers or agents. That is covered by amendments Nos. 119 to 122.</P>

Forgive my ignorance in relation to this situation, but I thought it would be more appropriate in that area.  Perhaps there is merit in putting it into the Bill itself as part of the Bill.  The codes of conduct are extremely important in view of the discussions we have had on another section on tied agents and indiscriminate operations around the country.  If we do not establish appropriate standards and proper codes of conduct, then the entire industry will deteriorate into disrepute, which will be irrevocable.

To respond to the question, the code of conduct to be laid down by the Minister can cover brokers and agents for example, selling practices, <Col N="397" /> information disclosure, cooling off periods, exercise of undue influence, handling and passing on to insurers of premiums and so on are the kind of things it can cover.</P>
      <P>The code of conduct can also cover the giving of advice only on matters in which the person is competent, or dealing with what an introducer may do in regard to soliciting life assurance business outside the terms of the agency appointment, or attempts to influence the prospective policyholder with regard to the completion of the proposal form, and those type of areas.  The code of conduct would seek to lay down codes in those areas where there is potential abuse.</P>

      <P>I am sure that most insurance companies and those practitioners in insurance, in particular, life assurance, will welcome this.  I think it is a very good move.  Insurance, a financial service, is very complex and technical.  It is not anything like as straightforward as it was, say, 20 years ago when you either bought a life assurance policy that was saving or whole of life.  It underlines &mdash; a point that was stressed in this debate &mdash; the importance of having trained ethical people selling the range of products.  I do not believe it is possible that people who have been trained for two hours each week for two weeks in life assurance or insurance as it is at present being practised are adequately trained or that it suffices to equip them to meet the needs of consumers.  Perhaps there should be some centre that people could check out any proposals that are made to them by a salesman or an agent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that in many instances consumers are sold the wrong product for their needs and that is very often governed by the fact that there is a larger commission for the agent than for something that would suit.  In many instances the consumer would not be aware of the long-term implications.  It is too late when the insured person is dead and the widow discovers that the policy does not suit at all.  I welcome this.  I think any reputable insurance company or anyone involved <Col N="398" /> in insurance will welcome this and will not be afraid of it.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 124:</P>
    <P>In page 23, before section 49, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;.&mdash;(1)  This Part shall not apply to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  contracts of reinsurance or to insurance intermediaries engaged solely in relation to the business of effecting contracts of reinsurance;</P>

    <P>(2)  In this section &lsquo;travel agent&rsquo;, &lsquo;tour operator&rsquo; and &lsquo;overseas travel contract&rsquo; have the meanings assigned to them respectively under section 2 (1) of the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The significant difference between this new section and section 49 of the published Bill is that it exempts travel agents and tour operators from the requirements of Part IV applying to insurance agents in respect of their overseas travel insurance and touring assistance business.  The reason for this is that tour operators and travel agents are already tightly controlled by the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  They are also required to hold indemnity bonds which encompass such travel insurance.  It is simply to avoid needless duplication in terms of administration, bonding and costs that I have exempted them from the <Col N="399" /> scope of Part IV.  I am satisfied that the consumers' interest will not be adversely affected.</P>

      <P>Section 1(a) of the 1936 Insurance Act creates a class of continuing offence capable of being committed by an insurance company or by an officer or employee of such company. <Col N="402" /> There is a danger that in imposing a continuing fine under this section a court could eventually exercise its jurisdiction. This provision is to be deleted under the Bill as published.  It is now proposed to repeal section 109(3) also.  The subsection provides that, if an assurance company is convicted of a continuing offence, this shall constitute a ground for the winding up of the company if the offence has continued for three months or more.  As the class of continuing offence contained in subsection (1) of section 109 is being abolished, the provisions of section 109(3) will accordingly be spent and it is thus proposed to repeal section 109(3) in its entirity purely as a tidying up exercise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in some way or other within the Bill, I am asking the Minister for a recognition of the Chartered Insurance Institute.  For hundreds of years they have rightly been accepted as being the organisation dealing with the educational and other aspects of the insurance industry and this has been proved correct over the years.  In my opinion, any person with a diploma of the Chartered Insurance Institute has something to be proud of.  It is a qualification which has world-wide recognition and it is a recognition that is sought after very actively by personnel of insurance companies and personnel of insurance brokers' staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always felt that academic qualifications were important in the insurance industry.  I have spelled that out many times on Second Stage and during this debate on Committee Stage.  The academic qualifications possessed by a diploma holder of the Chartered Insurance Institute should be recognised in a Bill which we now accept to be the most important insurance Bill for over 50 years.  I know that there are other areas where insurance is studied.  You have the technical colleges, the RTCs and the NIHEs and institutions like that who take insurance as part of an overall course but not as a specific course in itself in the same way as the Chartered Insurance Institute do.  As I said, any person with an ACII or an FCII after his name today, or a diploma holder of the Chartered <Col N="404" /> Institute, is recognised generally to be an expert on insurance.  For that reason I would like in this important Bill formal recognition to be granted somewhere along the line to this very important organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the spirit of what Senator Fallon has said. The Chartered Insurance Institute qualifications are indeed fully recognised by insurance companies and they have the full respect of all others.  There is no need in this Bill to actually put in something like that in terms of qualifications of individuals. The reality in the marketplace is that the insurance companies fully recognise and support the qualifications and that the various bodies recognised by the Minister will have to be professionally organised bodies.  One would assume that they, in turn, would recognise qualifications like this.  I fully support the spirit of what the Senator is saying but I do not think it is necessary to write it in because it is the situation in the marketplace.  A very high degree of respect and recognition is there for the qualifications of the Chartered Insurance Institute and there is a very high degree of acceptance for their graduates.  There is no evidence to the contrary and therefore it would be only stating the obvious to put it in the Bill and there is no place that it would fit neatly.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator McCormack that on the Motion for the Adjournment he proposes to raise the following matter: &ldquo;The need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to comment on job losses in the industrial sector as a result of the laying-off of staff in Thermo King and if he will take action to alleviate the situation and ensure the maintenance of expansion of the workforce there.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for giving me an opportunity to raise this very vital matter.  It is a matter that is causing grave concern in Galway that any factory should be laying off workers. There is a total workforce of 620 people in the Galway plant and the people of Galway city and county appreciate and are very thankful that Thermo King Europe came to Galway to establish their base in October 1976, just over eleven and a half years ago.  They have given very valuable employment in Galway and have been part and parcel of the development of our industrial base in Galway city and I want to go on record as thanking the company for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the situation now needs clarification.  The situation at Thermo King at the moment is that on 3 June 19 workers were laid off, 30 more are on one week's contract to expire tomorrow, 10 June, and from what I understand, about 54 more are on a seven-week contract. This is a desperate situation for those people and their families.  They now <Col N="406" /> face unemployment or in some cases even emigration like many more people in Galway and other areas.  They are people who have entered into house mortgages and other commitments as regards their families and now they find themselves in this very sad situation.  They formed a vital part of our community and their loss to Galway and the spending power they generated in the area will be greatly felt. I sympathise with those people on the loss of their jobs.</P>
    <P>Thermo King Europe officially opened in Galway eleven and a half years ago and they have played a very vital and essential role in the industrial development of our city.  I am confident that they have and will continue to play a vital role in the future of Galway.  A job in Thermo King Europe, Galway was a much sought after and prized possession.  To acquire a job there was considered as security for life.  The present lay-offs and future threatened lay-offs have caused great concern among the staff of Thermo King and their families and in the community in general.  About two years ago, approximately, 104 workers were taken on in a temporary capacity, as is now the norm in such situations.</P>
    <P>Everything seemed to be going well in Galway and there was great confidence in the future expansion of the Thermo King plant in Galway.  People entered into commitments on the natural expectation of the continuation of their employment.  About a year ago also &mdash; and this may be relevant, as I will try to establish later &mdash; a new departure for Thermo King took place when they took over the Hyster factory in Blanchardstown in County Dublin where they now employ about 60 people.  Before Thermo King took over in Dublin the managing director gave assurances that this factory would have no bearing on the situation in Galway.  While I cannot conclusively prove that the opening of the Blanchardstown factory is causing the lay-offs in Galway I have enough evidence in what I see to cause me grave concern in this matter.  I am concerned that there may be a link between the two events.</P>
    <P>Before Blanchardstown opened, the facts are that staff were being taken on in the Galway plant and, now that Blanchardstown <Col N="407" /> is in production, staff are being laid off in Galway.  When I contacted Thermo King Europe in Galway, personnel did acknowledge to me that the company plant does supply parts to Dublin for further work.  As we know, Thermo King make and assemble fridge units.  I know that over the past year two units which were made in the Galway factory are now being made in Blanchardstown. The making of the MD unit and the KD unit has been discontinued in Galway.  These are now being made in Dublin, from the information I have.</P>
    <P>Despite all the assurances I have been given by personnel in Galway I am not convinced that this transfer of work has no bearing on the employment situation in Galway.  Can anybody explain to me how you can transfer work from one place to another without affecting the people working in the place from where the work is being transferred?  It just does not add up.  I know it is causing tension and anxiety amont the staff in Galway.  Even when I contacted the Galway factory I detected a reluctance on behalf of anybody to speak on the matter.  I was seeking to speak to the manager.  I had been seeking to contact him since Tuesday but he was not available then nor was he available today.  I was put from one person to another and back again and I was even referred to a public relations firm in Dublin for information.  The referral of a public representative to a public relations firm did not help to allay my fears in the matter.  However, I must acknowledge that I finally got a call back from the personnel department who were most helpful to me in my inquiries.</P>
    <P>The question I now pose to the Minister is this: Thermo King Europe in Galway is now over 11 years in existence and Thermo King Blanchardstown are about a year in existence.  Has the Dublin plant tax concessions and incentives which make it more attractive to operate there than in Galway?  Has the Galway operation now lost the ten-year incentive? Does the Dublin plant qualify for this?</P>
    <P>When this present Fianna Fáil Government succeeded in having Thermo King acquire the Hyster plant there was great jubilation and a lot of political capital <Col N="408" /> was made out of it.  I remember quite well at the time that the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is a representative for that area in west County Dublin blowing a trumpet about succeeding in getting Thermo King to acquire this Hyster factory. I will not stand for the building up of a factory in Dublin at the expense of the running down of a factory in Galway. I will not stand for the loss of jobs in Galway if there is a better incentive available through the efforts of the Government in getting Thermo King into Blanchardstown than there is in Galway.</P>
    <P>The silence of the Fianna Fáil Ministers of State on this matter in the West Galway constituency &mdash; where I come from &mdash; is very strange.  We had a highly publicised case recently where the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, stayed up for 24 hours talking about the threatened closure of a factory in his constituency of Longford.  I do not see any action like that from the Ministers in Galway concerning this very serious matter which is affecting the lives of people in Galway.  It is strange that not one voice has been raised in defence of the protection of jobs in Galway.  I will not be silenced in my call on the Minister to take the necessary steps to protect the jobs in Galway, especially <i>vis-á-vis</i> the difference which now may be in the Dublin plant <i>versus</i> the Galway plant.  I would welcome the Minister's comments on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to respond to this debate in order to outline to the House some of the progress made by the Government in improving our economic fortunes, more particularly in restoring business confidence to this country.  The action which we have taken as a Government has led already to an improved environment for business and the restoration of some competitiveness. One cannot deny that.  I believe this is the way to create new jobs and to stem the incidence of job losses experienced in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me point to some of the concrete achievements which have been made. Interest rates are down by about 6 per <Col N="409" /> cent; inflation had come to less than 2 per cent by mid-February moving Ireland into the low-band inflation countries within the EC, and investment in machinery, equipment, exports and manufacturing output have all increased substantially in real terms.  As a result of all these measures overall growth in 1987 was over 4 per cent.  If you cast your mind back to 1986 there was a 1½ per cent decline.  Despite earlier pessimistic predictions by economists, current estimates indicate positive growth again in 1988. That is major progress.</P>
    <P>In each of the past six months the live register has been lower than the total in the corresponding month a year earlier. A pattern of decline has not occurred since the late seventies.  Confidence in economic management and a stable economic environment are essential ingredients for an increase in investment, in growth, in output and employment, but development measures are also necessary. In that regard, I want to say that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, negotiated with the social partners and published last October, sets out a comprehensive programme to regenerate all sectors of the economy.  Very specific and very demanding targets are being set and are being met.</P>
    <P>In the area for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has direct responsibility, manufacturing and international services, the objective of policy involves creating approximately 20,000 extra jobs on average per year over the next ten years, the actual provision accelerating as the programme policies take effect.  So far as job losses are concerned, the programme says very clearly that the offsetting trend in job losses cannot be foreseen accurately.  It would be unreasonable to do that but the more competitive economic climate and the greater attention given to the development of the indigenous sector will make existing jobs more secure.</P>
    <P>In a joint Government-ICTU statement on developments under the programme released on 27 May, details of the actual progress in 1988 in realising the objectives of that programme for extra jobs and the major strategy developments were all set out.  As regards manufacturing and international services, <Col N="410" /> the principal State industrial promotion agencies are satisfied, on the basis of sample surveys conducted by them, that a total of over 4,000 new jobs were created during the first quarter of 1988. The agencies tell me they are confident that the overall job targets for the programme can be met for the year.  Some 240 project start-ups have been recorded across the overseas and indigenous small industry sectors during the first quarter of 1988.  There was a strong build-up in the overseas companies pipeline in the latter part of 1987 and this momentum has been maintained into 1988.  The State agencies have targeted a 20 per cent increase in new job creations by overseas firms over the period of that programme.</P>
    <P>Senators will know that the Minister, Deputy Reynolds announced earlier this year important policy changes as regards the activities of the State industrial agencies and our industrial incentive programme, to bring them into line with the overall strategy set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  These changes will act in a very positive way to safeguard employment in existing industry.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of those; greater attention to the development of the indigenous sector, greater emphasis on State aid to upgrade marketing, management and technological expertise and a positive enterprise-based approach to developing small business, the establishment in my own area of trading houses to promote exports by Irish industry and the preparation of sectoral strategies for specific industrial sectors.  That is not to say that job losses will not occur from time to time within industries as part of the normal industrial process.  If such changes did not take place industry would not survive so it is important to see them in context.</P>
    <P>Thermo King is a case in point.  It is in the process of laying off up to 50 temporary employees at its Galway facility. It is a fact of commercial life that most high technological companies have to cope with fluctuations in their business. The only cost-effective way to do this is to utilise temporary employees to handle peaks in demand.</P>
    <P>Thermo King Corporation has an excellent track record and has become a leader in its industry.  Its Irish operations <Col N="411" /> have played a strong role in this success. This led to the company's decision in 1987 to further expand its presence in Ireland. I am informed that this expansion involves the long-term development of Thermo King, Galway, as well as the establishment of a second plant in Dublin and that the company remains committed to those plans.  The Galway operation, which is operating at close to capacity levels, now employs something like 560 permanent staff.  The original target was to achieve some 560 jobs in Galway and this has been achieved.  The present lay-offs in Galway consist of 50 temporary employees.  One has to take account of the peaks and valleys any company of that size would naturally have.  I understand that there is no question of retrenchment or retreat by Thermo King from Galway.  They are fully and totally committed to Galway and to the whole region.  Their track record in Galway is absolutely impeccable.  I visited the plant and I have seen at first hand the very professional approach to industry and management in that plant.  I understand that there is no question of retrenchment. These are normal peaks and valleys one has in employment and the company is as committed to Galway as it ever was.</P>
    <P>It would be unrealistic and unfair to any company to insist that it can only operate in any one particular region. Commercial common sense indicates that companies have to have freedom to spread their operations, depending on operational pressures which they may have.  I should point out strongly that Thermo King will invest over £4 million in the Galway plant this year and approximately the same again over the next three years.  I can rightly claim, as a Minister, to have an interest in the views of both the people of Dublin and the people of Galway.</P>
    <P>In relation to the maintenance and expansion of the workforce in particular companies, this is a matter for the day-to-day administration of the industrial development agencies, an area in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has no function.  This reflects the rationale behind the establishment of such <Col N="412" /> bodies, that is, to give them a greater degree of flexibility and freedom than is normally available in the Civil Service and to free Ministers from responsibility for the decisions which the boards and staff of these bodies take in the day-to-day administration of their responsibilities. In this regard the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, in answer to a Dáil question last year, indicated that he is answerable for the overall policy, including the legislation under which the bodies operate and also for the Exchequer allocations provided to them.</P>
    <P>Finally, it may be as well to emphasise here that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has no function in relation to the commercial affairs of individual companies in respect of his industrial policy role.</P>

      <P>A brief question, Senator McCormack.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased with the commitment from Thermo King and I wish to acknowledge the £4 million to be invested in Galway this year and another £4 million to be invested over the next number of years.  I would also like to put on record that I got an assurance, not from Thermo King but from a public relations firm on behalf of Thermo King that the 50 people laid off would likely be taken back again.  The Minister did not refer to the situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the disadvantages of a factory that has now passed its ten years tax incentive scheme and the advantages of a factory that has set up in Blanchardstown which will be in the 10 per cent manufacturing incentive scheme from 1981 to the year 1990.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <P>The Senator is a little confused because the taxation arrangement is a company arrangement.  It is not a matter of location.  It is not given to a factory in one town as opposed to a factory in another town.  It is given to a company wherever it is located.  That is the corporate taxation arrangement.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 14 June 1988.</P>
