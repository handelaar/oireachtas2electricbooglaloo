      <P>I wish to inform Members that the visit to the Seanad Chamber site has been arranged between the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Office of Public Works for tomorrow morning at 11 a.m.  Any Senator who wishes to see what is happening is more than welcome to do so.  If there are two groups we could visit it in relays.  As I promised Senator Norris, I will accompany both groups.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Seán Fallon that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to prepare public awareness programmes in the area of donor organ transplantation.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Donie Cassidy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to sanction the sewerage treatment works at Castlepollard as a matter of urgency due to the pollution dangers to Lough Dereveragh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
    <P>In view of the disappointing outcome of recent attempts to change US Immigration Law and the non-preference 5 Visa Programme, the need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to provide funds to emigration reform and welfare groups working among and for the illegal Irish emigrant community in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Seamus Cullimore of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Government to impress upon the public the desirability of purchasing Irish goods especially at this time of the year.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Fallon, Cassidy, Connor and Cullimore as suitable for discussion.  I have selected Senator Fallon's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Cassidy, Connor and Cullimore may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I welcome your initiative in arranging for a visit to the Seanad Chamber.  We are all very pleased with that.  Perhaps we might have an indication at some stage as to the timescale by which we will be able to move into the renewed Chamber.  One other thing I would like to mention on the Order of Business arises on Item No. 5, the European Communities motion.  I hope it may be taken today and, if not, that time will be made available for it before the session ends.  I had intended to have an item on today's Order Paper but I just phoned it in and did not get round to signing it.  It is important and perhaps the Leader of the House will bear this in mind.  It is the question of the ratification of the European Convention on Patents which has not yet been done. That is rather worrying.  I raised it about a year ago in the House.  The Leader of the House then said that he would make some inquiries about it.  I have had some communications from some industrial firms who are very concerned in this area.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Leader of the House to consider at some stage in the not too distant future allocating time to discuss the extraordinary change that has taken place in Palestine in the Middle East in the past number of months.  I know where his views and sympathies lie and I would be grateful if he would facilitate the House by allowing at least a brief discussion on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business, Item No. 46 is a motion about accessibility to public buildings for handicapped people.  I raise it under this item because I want to request the Chair's protection and some action on this matter.  On the issue of <Col N="1348" /> handicapped people I had reason to publish a report about handicapped people, which I do not want to go into today.  I was refused permission to hold a press conference in Leinster House.  I was told that it was not an appropriate matter for a press conference by a Member of the Oireachtas within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would like to ask a special meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to look at this matter and to rule as to whether I was dealt with properly or improperly.</P>

I understood the Leader of the House to make some reference to taking Item No. 5 if time permits. I am not quite clear what is meant by that.  I am still not clear on what basis we are to have a break when such a break is not specified on the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>As regards an early resumption of the House, if the Whips get together we can arrange our business. On the question of patents, Senator Norris said he has had communications from commercial firms.  I am sure everybody in the House has had the same communications.  I will talk to the relevant Minister about that matter and I will come back to Senator Norris as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I agree that we should have a debate on the question of Palestine and the problems of the Palestinians.  Without going into too much details, I will talk to the Minister for Foreign Affairs so that we can have an early debate on that whole issue.  We all agree that accessibility to public buildings for every citizen should be a priority and, again, we can talk to the relevant Minister about that.  The matter relating to press conferences is not within my ambit.  It is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Superintendent of the House.</P>
      <P>I said if time permits because I am not too sure exactly what way the various items will develop today.  The only thing that is definite is that we will take from 6.30 to 8 p.m. for the remaining part of the motion.  We will take items Nos. 2, 3 and 4 together.  When I said &ldquo;If time permits&rdquo; I meant that we will continue until 6.30 p.m.  There will be no break. We will take item No. 5 when items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 are dealt with, if they are dealt with within the time limit between now and 6.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>As the Seanad is aware, the Minister for Justice is attending a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference today and unfortunately is not available to be here this afternoon.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to enable the position of Mr. Seamus Noel Mahon of the District Court bench to be regularised, and to validate his court decisions.</P>
      <P>The normal retirement age of a district justice is 65 years under section 30 (1) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, but the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1949, provides a procedure under which a district justice may be continued in office year by year up to age 70.  The power to grant an extension is exercised by a committee, comprising the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General. Where a justice satisfies the committee that he is not suffering from any disability which would render him unfit to continue to discharge efficiently the duties of his office, the committee may, if they so think proper after consultation with the Minister for Justice, make a continuation warrant.  A warrant is required for each extension year and must be made before the year commences.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for seeking an extension of service in good time rests with each district justice although the standard practice is for the Department of Justice to advise a District Justice about nine months in advance of his 65th birthday of the need to apply to the committee for a formal extension of service under the 1949 Act if he wishes to be continued in office beyond that date.  The request for an extension of service is made to the committee by the justice. The committee normally consults the Minister for Justice by formal correspondence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill the committee which I mentioned would be empowered to make a warrant retrospective in a case where through error or oversight a warrant was not made in due course.  The following are the circumstances in which the oversight occurred in Mr. Mahon's case.  He was <Col N="1351" /> appointed as a temporary justice of the District Court in October 1976 and as a permanent justice in May 1977 and reached the normal retirement age of 65 years in January 1984.  He should before that date, have applied for a continuation warrant but did not do so and a warrant was not made.  As I have already indicated, normal practice is for the Department to remind a district justice well in advance of the need to apply for a warrant. A reminder was not given in this case, however, because of a mistake in departmental records.</P>
    <P>Mr. Mahon first applied for appointment in April 1973 and in his application form he gave his year of birth as 1920. This was recorded in departmental records.  In January 1977 Mr. Mahon submitted a birth certificate which showed his year of birth as 1919 but the discrepancy was not noticed and the incorrect year of birth remained in departmental records.  Warrants were, in fact, made for subsequent years but I am advised that these have no effect because of the critical absence of a warrant to cover the first year after Mr. Mahon reached his 65th birthday.  The mistake was not discovered until about the middle of 1988.</P>
    <P>I am advised that in the absence of a valid continuation warrant for each year after his 65th birthday Mr. Mahon has not been duly appointed district justice since he reached his 65th birthday. Consequently, his decisions in court since then are invalid and his service since then cannot count for pay, superannuation or other service benefits.  I am also advised that, under the law as it stands, the committee I mentioned have no power to issue a certificate retrospectively and hence the provisions proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the period since January 1984 Mr. Mahon has dealt with some 8,000 criminal cases, 74,000 Road Traffic Act cases, 1,100 family law cases, 11,000 liquor licensing cases and 17,500 other civil cases.  Penalties he imposed included approximately 40,000 fines, imprisonment-detention in relation to some 1,250 offences, and disqualifications or <Col N="1352" /> endorsements for some 3,700 Road Traffic Act offences.  Clearly the public interest would be served best by enacting legislation to allow for validation of such a wide range of cases.  There may be questions about the wisdom of doing this for criminal cases.  I am satisfied, however, that it would not be in the public interest to make an exception.  The convictions in criminal cases must be presumed to have been decided in good faith on the evidence presented and, since the normal appeal mechanism was available to any person dissatified with the decision, there can be no valid argument as to the merits of any convictions which were not appealed or, if appealed, upheld on appeal.</P>
    <P>Apart from criminal cases, there is a range of decisions made in civil cases, including family law cases.  It is clearly in the public interest that decisions made in such cases should stand on the basis that they were made in good faith on the evidence presented.  Otherwise serious hardship could result.  There is, however, in the Bill a specific saver for the possible infringement of a constitutional right. This is similar to a provision in the Garda Síochána Act, 1979, which was also in the nature of validating legislation.  The effect of the provision is to emphasise that it is not the intention of the Bill to deprive anyone of a constitutional right.</P>
    <P>The Bill, if enacted, would enable the committee to make retrospective warrants in relation to Mr. Mahon.  The procedure in the Bill would preserve the concept that all extensions of service of district justices should be considered and granted, if appropriate, by the committee set up under the 1949 Act.  The principle that a committee should be empowered to grant extensions of service even though the original appointment was made by the President is already established in the 1949 Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill as drafted would enable errors made in the future to be corrected without the need for new legislation.  It is impossible to guarantee that no error or oversight of any kind will be made in the future at any stage of the proceedings, <Col N="1353" /> whether by a district justice, the Department, the committee or any other body and it is to provide against that eventuality that I consider this Bill should be adopted.  So far as the Department are concerned I have directed that certain steps be taken to ensure that the kind of mistake which occurred in this case will not recur.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a provision under which Mr. Mahon's service since January 1984 can be validated for pay, superannuation and other service benefits.  He has sat as a district justice for more than four years and performed all the duties required of him and, in the circumstances, it seems only fair that he should be given credit for this service for pay, superannuation and other purposes.</P>
    <P>In case there should be any doubt in the matter I should like to emphasise that the approach being adopted in this Bill has the endorsement of the Attorney General.  A general question arises here about the extent to which the Oireachtas should have regard to the possibility of a successful constitutional challenge.  Of course, the Oireachtas should not knowingly enact legislation which is clearly unconstitutional but, by the same token, I believe it should not hold back from taking reasonable action just because it may be argued that there is a remote possibility of a successful constitutional challenge.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the provisions in this Bill ought to stand up to challenge and, as Senators will appreciate, the Bill itself, by the inclusion of section 1(3), gives a clear signal that it is not the intention to deprive anyone of a constitutional right. There are numerous examples of validating legislation of this kind so that, while we may regret the circumstances which have given rise to the need for this measure, we can at least acknowledge that it is not altogether unique.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there are convicing reasons, both public interest and humanitarian, for adopting this measure and I, therefore, commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill <Col N="1354" /> is to enable the committee set up under the Courts of Justice Act, 1949, to make a warrant retrospectively in a case where such a warrant was not made through error or oversight as the Minister has indicated.  Section 2 of the 1949 Act provides a mechanism whereby a district justice, on reaching the normal retiring age of 65 years may be continued in office on a year to year basis until the age of 70 years.  This power to grant an annual extension is exercised by this committee, set up under the 1949 Act comprising the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>This committee, if they think proper, may after consultation with the Minister for Justice make a continuation warrant. The district justice must satisfy the committee that he is not suffering from any disability which would render him unfit to continue to discharge effectively and efficiently the duties of his office.</P>
      <P>What happened in the District Justice Mahon case was that no warrant was made when the district justice reached 65 years of age in 1984.  Warrants were made for subsequent years but it now transpires, as the Minister has indicated, that these warrants have no effect because of the absence of a warrant to cover the first year after Mr. Mahon had reached his 65th birthday.  Because Mr. Mahon had not been duly appointed a district justice since he reached his 65th birthday, and the committee have no power to issue a certificate retrospectively the Government in this Bill are proposing to enable the committee to make a warrant retrospectively and to validate a wide range of cases both criminal and civil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the unauthorised period since 1984, Mr. Mahon has dealt with a staggering 111,500 cases comprising 74,000 Road Traffic Act cases, 1,100 family law cases, 11,000 liquor licensing cases and 17,500 other civil cases.  Penalties he imposed included some 40,000 fines, imprisonment and detention in relation to some 1,250 offences and disqualifications or endorsements for some 3,700 Road Traffic Act offences.  It appears that clearly a major mistake has been made in the Department of Justice in relation <Col N="1355" /> to this matter.  Every effort must be made to have it rectified.</P>
    <P>However, there must be serious doubts about the wisdom of using retrospective validation, in particular as the Minister has indicated for criminal cases, and using two judges of our superior courts for this process thereby, it can be argued, breaching one of the fundamental tenets of our Constitution, namely, the doctrine of separation of powers which provides for the tripartite division of the powers of government into legislative, executive and judicial.</P>
    <P>There are serious doubts about the constitutionality of this Bill.  The Minister more or less conceded in his speech here and in the other House that there is a constitutional doubt when he stated that it would be open to any person who considered that the Bill did conflict with a constitutional right to seek redress in the courts.  Because a constitutional question mark hangs over this Bill I believe that the Government should indicate to the President that they would have no objection to him referring this Bill to the courts under the Article 26 procedure in order to test its constitutionality.  It may well be that the courts would decide that these decisions were <i>ultra vires</i>&mdash; the Minister used the word &ldquo;invalid&rdquo; but <i>ultra vires</i> is perhaps stronger &mdash; unauthorised by law, outside jurisdiction, null and void from the outset and consequently of no legal effect, and that such nullities or voidness cannot be retrospectively validated.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it may well be that the courts will apply the well known and long established maxim, <i>communis error facit ius</i> and that they will accept, as was decided in De Burca and Anderson <i>v.</i> the Attorney General in 1971, that there can be no refunnelling up the river of the water which had flowed down and passed under the bridge.  There is, of course, a limit to the extent to which that can be done in an orderly society.  There can be no umbrella absolution for illegality and every irregularity that can be imputed to the State.  Indeed, in the words of Professor John Kelly, TD, recently:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> People must be in principle entitled to redress but when their entitlement to redress to be relieved from an irregularity or illegality has not occurred to them before, so to speak, and only emerges as a possibility in consequence of a development which involves not only them but countless other people in numbers so large that were they all to get justice in the technical sense of the word &mdash; because they may, in fact have had substantial justice &mdash; could the structure of the State sustain it and could ordered society sustain it?</P>
    <P>In spite of that commonsense approach by Deputy Kelly, it seems to me that it is the sheer weight of the cases, 111,500, which were determined by Mr. Mahon which prompted the Government to enact this legislation to allow for the validation of these decisions and cases. Otherwise, why was no legislation enacted to validate decisions made by Mr. Murphy?  In a case which is mentioned, the State (Walsh) <i>v.</i> Murphy and the Attorney General, reported in the <i>Irish Reports,</i> 1981, at page 275, the prosecutor as defendant was convicted in the District Court by the first respondent Mr. Murphy.  The High Court per Finlay P. Gannon, J. and Hamilton J. held <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    <P>(1)  The validity of the conviction of the prosecutor by the first respondent depended upon the validity of the respondent's appointment.</P>
    <P>(2)  That once it had been challenged, the appointment of the first respondent could be and must be reviewed by the court.</P>
    <P>(3)  That at the date of his appointment as a temporary District Justice, the first respondent had not been eligible for appointment to that office because:</P>
    <P>(a)  he had not practised as a barrister for an aggregate period of ten years and;</P>
    <P>(b)  because he had not been a practising barrister at the time of his appointment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> That finding by the High Court operated to disclose that his appointment was invalid from the beginning, or void <i>ab initio.</i> The apparent Mr. Murphy was not there of course for very long to build up the staggering and titanic score of 111,500 cases which were built up by Mr. Mahon. As soon as these proceedings involving his status were initiated, he was more or less put in abeyance, so to speak.  There then appeared on the scene Mr. Murphy, No. 2, the real Mr. Murphy, whom the Department of Justice, I understand, have alleged should have been appointed in the first instance.  I raise this point today because I think there is a similarity here.  Indeed, it is only the sheer weight of the cases which were determined by Justice Mahon which has prompted the Government to take this decision, and no such decision was taken in the Murphy case.  We could indeed flesh out quite a number of other cases which point to the slipshod approach in procedure adopted by the Department of Justice in such matters.</P>
    <P>I do not like to detain the House too long today but I believe that it would be most unjust, given the background to this case, to deprive Mr. Mahon of his right to pay, superannuation and so on.  A person sat on the District Court bench for more than four years and performed all the duties required to be performed by him as a district justice.  I think this is a separate issue.  I do not think it is beyond the wit of the Government or their advisers to have produced the appropriate regulations or, indeed, legislation to have dealt with the personal service and indeed the personal remuneration which is due to Mr. Mahon.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am sorry to say I believe that there has been a major mistake once again made by the Department of Justice &mdash; a major cock-up may I say? Unfortunately, this Bill opens up what has been described in the other House as a fascinating range of legal problems. However, I hope the Minister for Justice has got the formula right and that the public interest will be served best by the enactment of this legislation.  This side of <Col N="1358" /> the House will not be tabling any amendments and will not be opposing the Government on this matter because we believe it is in the public interest.  I hope the Bill, however, will be referred to the President so that its constitutionality can be tested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to rectify a problem brought about by a district justice.  A district justice has to retire at the age of 65 but on application can be kept on until he is 70 years of age.  The power to grant an extension is exercised by a committee comprised of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General.  He has to satisfy the committee that he is not suffering from any disability which would render him unfit to carry out his duties efficiently.  The committee may consult with the Minister for Justice <i>re</i> the appointment.  A warrant is required for each year of extension for which the district justice applies.  It is the responsibility of the district justice to notify the Department of Justice nine months beforehand if he is seeking an extension. Indeed, in some cases the Department of Justice advise the district justice that if he needs an extension he should apply.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the committee to make a warrant retrospectively. One district justice who had been appointed did not apply for an extension of service when he reached the age of 65 years and no warrant was made. The Bill is designed to remedy that by providing a means of having a warrant made now.  The district justice in question was appointed as a temporary district justice for 12 months and was appointed a permanent district Justice in 1977.  He was 65 years of age in January 1984.  The district justice should have applied for a continuation of a warrant which is normal practice and the district justice is normally notified by the Department of Justice as well.</P>

    <P>When the district justice applied for the position at first he gave on his application the information that he was born in 1920 when, in fact, he was born in 1919. He did submit a birth certificate giving <Col N="1359" /> his correct age eventually.  The district justice had not a valid continuation warrant since his 65th birthday.  I believe that, under the law as it stands, the committee had no power to issue a certificate retrospectively and this is necessary.  The district justice handled a big number of cases in the period from 1984.  He dealt with 8,000 criminal cases, 74,000 Road Traffic Act cases, 1,100 family law cases, 11,000 liquor licensing cases and 17,500 other civil cases.</P>
    <P>Penalties he imposed included approximately 40,000 fines, imprisonment &mdash; detention in relation to some 1,250 offences and disqualifications or endorsements for 3,700 Road Traffic Act offences.  Therefore, this Bill is necessary. The public interest would be served best by enacting legislation to allow for validation of all the cases he heard since his 65th birthday.  I hold that this Bill is necessary to ensure that all the cases he heard during his four year term are valid.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the Bill, the whole purpose of which is to regularise the problem that arose in connection with District Justice Séamus Noel Mahon.  The Government and the Minister are handling the matter correctly.  I do not wish to go into it in detail.  The Minister has covered the history of the event.  He went in great detail into the number of cases the district justice has dealt with and so did the previous speaker.  I support the view that decisions made by him should stand.  I am sure they were made in good faith and in the public interest they should certainly stand.  It is an extraordinary case and at the end of the day if we learn from the mistakes that were made we should be satisfied.  The Minister mentioned that corrective action has been taken.</P>
      <P>The question of constitutionality has been raised.  That is something we have to be careful of but the Attorney General and the advisers to the Government consider that it is not unconstitutional.  I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="1360" /> would like to thank Senators Kennedy, McEllistrim and Fallon who contributed to the debate on this Bill.  As I said in my opening remarks, this Bill attempts to meet the practical problem of what to do when a routine mistake is made in the procedures for extending the appointment of a justice after he reaches his 65th birthday.  Of course the mistake should not have occurred but, in the nature of things, mistakes will happen despite the best efforts to avoid them.  I think we should recognise that fact and provide the means to deal with the consequences.</P>
      <P>Changes have been made in administrative practice in the Department which should at least avoid the kind of mistake which occurred in this case and which contributed to the difficulty we are dealing with in this Bill.  In future it will be necessary for a candidate to have submitted two items before he is considered for appointment &mdash; a birth certificate and a statement from the Bar Council or Law Society, as appropriate, verifying that the candidate has the necessary statutory practice experience, that is, ten years practice as a barrister or solicitor.  There remains, of course, the possibility of other mistakes including mistakes on the part of justices or even the committee, and hence the need to provide the means to deal with them on a continuing basis.</P>
      <P>Senator Kennedy raised the issue of the constitutionality of the provisions of the Bill.  It is fair to say that many Bills can have their likely constitutionality questioned.  It is right that the Oireachtas should be conscious of the need to do so. In this instance the Bill has the endorsement of the Attorney General and my advice is that it ought to stand up to constitutional challenge.  I have no hesitation, therefore, in recommending the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the inclusion of a specific constitutional right saver in the Bill.  I accept that there are arguments for and against this.  The point can be made that it is unnecessary since Article 15.4 of the Constitution provides that the Oireachtas shall not enact any law which is in any respect repugnant to the Constitution. It also provides that any such <Col N="1361" /> law shall, to the extent of such repugnancy, be invalid.  The argument goes that there is no need, therefore, to except from legislation what would be unconstitutional since the Constitution already does that.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it can be argued that without a saver a person who had a legitimate cause of action might be deprived of that right by legislation validating a justice's actions.  By including a saver the Oireachtas is indicating clearly that this is not the intention.  Furthermore, by including the saver the Oireachtas is indicating its concern not to legislate across constitutional boundaries but, on the contrary, it is recognising its responsibility under Article 40.3 not only to respect but to defend and vindicate the personal rights of citizens.  The Minister accepts as he did in the case of the Garda Síochána Act, 1979, that the balance of the argument is in favour of including the saver.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the case of Michael K. Murphy where no retrospective validing legislation was introduced. The circumstances of that case were, however, different.  Mr. Murphy was appointed a temporary district justice in April 1981.  In June 1981 <i>a certiorari</i> proceedings were commenced in the High Court by a defendant alleging <i>inter alia</i> that Mr. Murphy, when appointed, did not have the necessary statutory qualifications for appointment. Mr. Murphy ceased immediately to sit on the Bench.  The High Court decided in December 1981 in favour of the defendant and Mr. Murphy's appointment was ceased with effect from the date of the judgment.</P>
    <P>To be eligible for appointment a person must be a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years standing.  The court held that while Mr. Murphy had practised at the Bar for the necessary qualifying period of ten years, he was not at the time of appointment a practising barrister, being at the time employed as an examiner of title in the Land Commission. His appointment was, therefore, <Col N="1362" /> null and void.  To have introduced legislation to validate Mr. Murphy's appointment retrospectively would have meant making a change in the statutory qualification requirements for appointment. This would have been a far more radical step than that proposed for Mr. Mahon in the Courts Bill, 1988.  An alternative would have been to confine the validation of Mr. Murphy's court decisions.  Since Mr. Murphy had sat on the Bench for only a short period the number of cases he disposed of was small and manageable. There was not the same need as in the Mahon case, therefore, to validate his decisions.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether or not this Bill should be confined to the Mahon case, there are good reasons for taking the broader approach suggested in the Bill It is desirable first to abide by the mechanism established under the 1949 Act for any retrospective extensions of service.  By doing this we will be avoiding any suggestion of undue interference with the independent nature of the proceedings under which extensions may be granted.  Thus on the enactment of this Bill the committee established under the 1949 Act would be required to consider the making of the necessary extension warrant in Mr. Mahon's case.  Under the Bill any future remissions to make extension warrants because of error or oversight could be dealt with in the same way.</P>
    <P>While every reasonable step must be taken to avoid mistakes in the future, we have to accept that in the nature of things it is not possible to guarantee that no mistakes will ever be made again.  The prudent course would seem to be to acknowledge that fact and make provision accordingly.  Again I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the draft Order applying Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965 to Australia, entitled Extradition Act, 1965 (Part II) (No. 24) Order, 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The three motions before the House today concern extradition.  Their common purpose is to facilitate extradition under Part II of the Extradition Act 1965, and so enable Ireland to act in accordance with its international obligations.  Consequently, I propose to deal with the motions together.  However I will, of course, address each draft order and the relevant international instrument in turn.</P>
      <P>I wish to turn first to deal with the European Convention on Extradition. Extradition in Ireland is governed by the Extradition Act, 1965.  This Act is divided into a number of Parts.  The purpose of the draft order is to apply Part II of the Act to the other contracting parties.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Act governs extradition to those countries which are parties to the convention under consideration.  That is to say that Part II concerns extradition to all places other than Northern Ireland, England and Wales, Scotland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands which, as Senators will be aware, come within Part III of the 1965 Act and do not concern us here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Convention on Extradition was concluded in Paris in 1957 having been drawn up under the auspices of the Council of Europe.  Al of the 21 member states of the Council of Europe are entitled to become parties to this multilateral convention.  The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe <Col N="1364" /> may also invite any other State to become a party.</P>
    <P>Ireland signed and ratified the convention on 2 May 1966 and it entered into force on 31 July 1966.  To date 16 other member states of the Council of Europe and two non-members, Finland and Israel, have become parties to the convention. Britain is not a party to the convention.  The only other European Community member States not parties to the Convention are Portugal and Belgium.  I understand that Portugal is well advanced in its procedures in preparation for ratification.</P>
    <P>In order to give effect to Ireland's ratification and consequent obligations under the convention, the Government made a number of orders under section 8 (1) of the Extradition Act, 1965, applying Part II of that Act to the other countries parties to the Convention, thus enabling extradition to take place between Ireland and those countries.</P>
    <P>Since that ratification the Government have honoured their obligations under the convention.  Requests for fugitive offenders received here were duly processed in accordance with the procedures and safeguards provided for in the convention and the 1965 Extradition Act. Those requests by Ireland also followed the procedures laid down in the convention.</P>
    <P>However, a recent legal development casts doubts on Ireland's 1966 ratification and the consequent implementing orders. Based on the possibility that the orders could be defective and to allow the State to fulfil its international obligations, it was necessary to take appropriate measures to rectify the matter.</P>
    <P>The background to this difficulty lies in a decision of the Supreme Court in the Gilliland case.  The Court held in that case that the particular treaty, the subject of the litigation, imposed a charge on public funds within the meaning of Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution and consequently its terms ought to have been approved by Dáil Eireann.  This decision had the effect of clarifying the interpretation to be given to Article 29.5.2.</P>
    <P>As the European Convention on <Col N="1365" /> Extradition was not regarded prior to that decision as imposing a charge on public funds within the ambit of Article 29.5.2, at the time of ratification in 1966, no motion of approval was passed by Dáil Eireann at that stage.  The Attorney General has since advised that a charge on public funds within the meaning of Article 29 would also arise in every case of the State being requested under the European Convention on Extradition to extradite the person sought.</P>
    <P>In order to rectify this situation and to allow Ireland to comply with the international obligations it has already covenanted to undertake by its earlier ratification four steps were required.  It was necessary first to get the approval of Dáil Eireann to the terms of the convention. Dáil Eireann approved the convention on 29 July 1988.  Secondly, it was necessary to deposit a new instrument of ratification.  This was done on 12 July 1988.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it is now necessary to have a new order made applying Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, to the contracting parties to the convention.  Section 4 of the Extradition Act, 1965, as amended by section 7 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, requires the Government to seek the approval of both the Dáil and Seanad to the draft order.  Dáil Eireann approved the draft order on 7 December 1988.  This House is now being asked similarly to give its approval to the text.  The final step will be the making of an order by the Government once each House has passed the required motions. The draft order before the House today revokes the existing orders and re-applies Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, to the contracting parties.  The draft order is, therefore, really of a technical nature, merely rectifying a legal difficulty.</P>
    <P>However, I would also like to take this opportunity to refer to the convention itself.  Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, is based very closely on this convention. Indeed, the side-notes in the Act refer to specific provisions of the convention.  Consequently, one could say that the terms of the convention have <Col N="1366" /> already been very closely examined by both Houses of the Oireachtas, albeit indirectly.</P>
    <P>The objective of the convention is to increase co-operation between the contracting parites in the fight against crime, by facilitating the contracting parties efforts to bring alleged criminals to justice. The convention sets down the circumstances in which extradition may take place between the contracting parties including the procedures and safeguards which must be followed before a requested State hands over any person sought to the requesting State.</P>
    <P>I do not propose here to go through the various articles in the convention, which are reflected in the Extradition Act.  I would stress that this is a well-balanced instrument in that it affords States the opportunity to pursue fugitives from justice while providing considerable safeguards for the individual.</P>
    <P>I think it is important to stress that extradition is not just a process which involves two States.  The rights of the individual sought must also be protected. This is one of the principles on which the European Convention on Extradition is based and is also to be found in Part II of the 1965 Act which refers specifically to the convention in the side-notes.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn briefly to the convention itself.  First, there are three discernable categories among the provisions of the Convention: Those that place duties on the requesting State; those that place duties on the requested State; other provisions which are solely for the protection of the individual sought.  Article 1 of the convention lays down a general extradition obligation on the contracting parties. The obligation is subject to the provision and conditions in the convention itself.  In other words, no extradition may take place until the terms of the Convention have been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>I would like, therefore, to reiterate to the House the purpose of the motion before it today.  It is part of a number of measures necessary to remedy a possible legal defect in Ireland's previous ratification in 1966.  It merely revokes the existing orders and re-applies Part II of <Col N="1367" /> the Extradition Act, 1965, to the other contracting parties.  In essence, therefore, the draft order before the House repeats the previous orders and will enable Ireland to comply with and fulfil those international legal obligations it undertook on ratification.  I commend the draft Order to the House.</P>
    <P>The second draft order which is before the House today concerns the Treaty on Extradition between Ireland and Australia. This draft order will apply Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, to Australia so as to enable extradition to take place between Ireland and Australia in accordance with the terms of the Treaty and the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>The treaty was signed in Dublin on 2 September 1985 and will come into force once each party has notified the other that they have completed all their necessary domestic requirements.  The object of the treaty is to facilitate and make more effective co-operation between Ireland and Australia in the suppression of crime.  It sets down, in a clear and precise manner, the procedures which must be followed, the documents to be supplied and various other matters which must be taken into account.  In other words, the treaty provides a comprehensive set of provisions which lay down the circumstances in which extradition can take place as well as the internationally accepted safeguards for the protection of the individual.</P>
    <P>The treaty represents the commitment of both Governments to continue in their fight against crime.  As I am sure the House will agree, both Governments wish to ensure that their territories are not used as a safe haven within which criminals may evade justice.  This treaty provides such a procedure while also seeking to protect the rights of the individual sought.  The terms of the treaty were negotiated in accordance with the internationally accepted rules between civilised nations which are also embodied in the 1965 Extradition Act.  I commend the draft order to the House.</P>
    <P>I now propose to deal with the motion relating to the Hague and Montreal <Col N="1368" /> Hijacking Conventions.  Ireland acceded to the Hague Convention on 24 November 1975 and to the Montreal Convention on 12 October 1976.  To date there are 137 other States also parties to both conventions.</P>
    <P>These conventions were both concluded after lengthy international conferences on air law which were held at the beginning of the seventies in an attempt to deal with the growing terrorist threat to the safety of aviation.  The occurrence of such terrorist acts leading to potential or actual loss of life was seen as a threat to the safety of civil aviation causing great concern throughout the world at that time.  The object of the conferences and these conventions was to provide an international regime to deal with such unlawful acts no matter where they occur, and particularly to provide appropriate international measures for the punishment of offenders.  These conventions are still of great relevance today in the protection of civil aviation.</P>
    <P>The 1973 and 1975 Air Navigation and Transport Acts give effect to these conventions in Irish law.  The offences created in these conventions are, therefore, extraditable offences under Irish law. The international legal regime created by these conventions is, therefore, incorporated into Irish domestic law.  These conventions may, therefore, be used as extradition treaties for the purposes of such offences if no other extradition treaty exists between the parties.</P>
    <P>In other words, since no other extradition treaty exists between Ireland and the vast majority of the other parties to these conventions, the conventions themselves function as extradition treaties in this regard.  Ireland must be in a position to comply with the international extradition obligations which they impose. Consequently, it is necessary to apply Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, to those States, parties to the Hague and Montreal Hijacking Conventions, with whom we have no other extradition treaties.</P>
    <P>The draft, in effect, consolidates into one order both conventions and all the existing parties to them.  In view of the importance of these conventions and to <Col N="1369" /> enable Ireland to comply fully with its obligations, I commend this draft order to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief on this matter.  I believe that it is rather unusual on motions like this, which are somewhat technical, to have what would almost amount to a Second Stage ministerial speech.  However, if it is unusual I certainly welcome it and I thank the Minister for the very full information he has put before us on this matter today. I hope that in future on matters which appear to be largely technical and formal we will get the information to the same extent as the Minister has given us today.</P>
      <P>I have no problems whatsoever with any of the motions before the House. They are matters to which we can give our full support.  I would like, however, to take the opportunity to mention very briefly one or two aspects of the subject of extradition which has so completely dominated the news headlines in the past week.  The Minister, not once but on a number of occasions, referred to the fact that, while 16 Member States of the Council of Europe have ratified the Convention on Extradition, Britain is not amongst these States.  Given the reaction of so many people who should have known better in Britain in the past week to our legal difficulties and problems in this regard, I wonder to a certain extent if Britain is not the State which is more out of step than the other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that in the light of some of the points which were mentioned here last week, and mentioned by the Minister for Justice after his meeting in Athens, we are on the way to seeing some sort of uniform procedures right across Europe on the question of extradition because no country in Europe, no single Government has any reason to be ambiguous or equivocal on the question of terrorism, be it national or international.  All countries have a strong vested interest in seeing that those who would subvert the State and, in the process of subverting the State, bring about carnage, death and destruction on a great scale, are brought to book fully for their offences.  I urge the <Col N="1370" /> Government to pursue that international objective with the greatest resolution and speed.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is in all our interests that the whole question of extradition should be depoliticised.  There is no place in politics for a question like that.  It is a question of law.  It is a question of ensuring that there are arrangements between countries which are clear and certain in their operation and of ensuring that extradition is operated within the law and within the safeguarding of the constitutional rights of the individual and also of ensuring that extradition does not become a tool which can be used by less than scrupulous Governments against people to whom they are politically opposed.  On the other hand, it must be ensured that extradition does not allow people against whom there is a case to answer to escape from answering that case preferably, if possible, in the country in which the alleged crime was committed.</P>
    <P>I believe that if there was the system of extradition that we require &mdash; a certain, sure system of extradition &mdash; that in itself would not greatly diminish the amount of terrorism.  It is very easy for people to see extradition as a be-all and an end in itself and as an answer to the problem of terrorism.  Frequently, when police forces and Governments are under pressure to produce results, it is easy to have recourse to the cry for extradition and to claim that there are people wandering safely in some other country who should be brought to book.  Getting the evidence which will convict these people is often a much more difficult task.  I mentioned this point last week in particular with reference to some of the charges made against this country.  It is too easy to make this claim in mitigation of, perhaps, less than effective policing.</P>
    <P>Finally, in a week in which extradition has dominated the headlines, it is important that the overall situation should be defused.  It would be most regrettable in the national interest if the row over extradition were in any way to hamper the work of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, or if the question of extradition were to <Col N="1371" /> become a major stumbling block between our two countries.  Clearly, from opinion polls taken this week, the Anglo-Irish Agreement commands the confidence and the support of a very large number of people in this country, people who may not be altogether hopeful that it will result in peace, stability and harmony in this country in the short-term.</P>
    <P>Many people believe that it is a somewhat fragile process.  Nonetheless, it is seen as providing the only framework within which the two countries and the two parts of this island, and possibly the two communities in Northern Ireland, can begin to talk to each other and get us back to a situation somewhat approaching normality in politics.  For that reason I hope that the question of extradition will be dealt with fairly and squarely at the ministerial conference today and that our two countries will be able to put it to one side and see if they can find some way of making the process work so that every occasion does not become a <i>cause célèbre</i> and provide an opportunity for those whose only interest is in the destabilising of this State and the overthrow of the State in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>For that reason also, I hope the British Government will accept the advice of our Taoiseach, the advice that they should use the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1976, to prosecute the case which is in the headlines at present.  Clearly, from what the Attorney General said yesterday there is a case to answer.  Clearly the Irish authorities will give full co-operation if that case is pressed by the British Government and clearly also, it would be highly undesirable if this dubious person who is being sought were to be elevated to some sort of hero status.  Many people who should know better are glorying in the notoriety of this person at present. It is in the interest of all parts of this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall conclude by reiterating my passing reference which you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, say is in order, to the case of the past week and simply hope that the British Government will follow the advice of the Taoiseach and that it will be seen that there is confidence and that there can be confidence between our countries in the operation of this mechanism of justice.  I again thank the Minister for his very full statement to the House and I welcome the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House very long but I believe that we should refer to the fact that these orders do strengthen the Government's hand in the fight against international crime. Whereas the first motion is of a purely technical nature, to bring back what the Government had already signed into a formal legality, there is in these motions a strengthening of the Government's hand. Suggestions have been made that this Government are soft on terrorism but there is absolutely no doubt that we have fought internationally at all stages against international terrorism and that we have ratified the conventions that were necessary to be ratified to bring us into line with most of the other countries in the world.  Again, it must be stressed, as Senator Manning said, that Britain has not signed the particular orders mentioned.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that we should be here today, 200 years after the formation of the State of Australia, bringing in extradition orders.  I presume that there was a time when quite a number of people were &ldquo;extradited&rdquo; without having the conventions applied to them and 200 years later here we are signing a convention which would allow for extradition to that country in a legal manner.  It is necessary that the conventions of The Hague and Montreal on the unlawful seizure of aircraft should be ratified by this country since there are a number of countries with which we do not have, up to now, extradition treaties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> There is no doubt that we have seen over the past number of years a number of hijackings of civil aircraft which have caused great distress throughout the world.  It is appropriate that we in this country should reflect international opinion in this area.  It is an area in which there has been a lessening of that type of seizure.  Nevertheless at all times we must be on our guard and we must be able, if need be, to extradite people who may come to this State and who have been involved in acts against civil aviation.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the orders are welcome. They show the willingness of the Government to fight international crime.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the Government, under the Taoiseach, will continue this fight and will bring appropriate legislation or appropriate orders before this House and the other House at all times when necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by the other speakers. Without at all dwelling on a matter which is not directly relevant to what is before us, nonetheless, it has to be said that the fact that our Government have not found it possible to grant extradition in this particular controversial case at the moment does not mean that they are soft on terrorism.  Indeed, it is insupportable that such accusations should be made in view of our painful experience over the whole history of the State with terrorism. It is also important to encourage the responsible authorities here that in order to establish that they are not soft on terrorism, in order to establish that when there are difficulties in working extradition in a particular case, they should not hesitate where serious charges exist &mdash; to use the Attorney General's phrase &mdash; to use their own initiative to implement as far as possible the course of justice under the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act.  I hope that will be done without fear or favour and without being intimidated by threats of martyrdom.  We have had enough of that nonsense in modern Irish history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the very term <Col N="1374" />&ldquo;extradition&rdquo;, the very concept of extradition should now be somewhat suspect in the public mind as a result of recent events and as a result, I may say, of the very dubious activities of so-called anti-extradition groups.  There is no doubt that antagonism to extradition in itself is encouraged by those who have vested interests in thwarting the course of justice. Unfortunately, as Senator Manning has said, this agitation is also sometimes supported by public representatives who should know better.  Therefore, in the context of these motions it is important to stress that extradition, far from being suspect, has long been a desirable procedure for dealing with fugitives from justice in the international sphere &mdash; with appropriate safeguards, of course.  It is an international procedure which we all depend upon for survival in this terrorism-charged atmosphere of the late 20th century.</P>
    <P>Some kind of international or at least European tribunal may be the forum of the future for dealing with fugitives of this kind.  That suggestion has been made inside these Houses and by distinguished jurists in recent weeks as a solution to the problems attending extradition in these islands.  However that may be, the important principle that these motions remind us all of is that fulfilling our extradition obligations is really a test of our credentials for responsible and mature membership of the family of nations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak briefly on these motions and to support the Government.  I must express great satisfaction that at last we have got around to ratifying these conventions.  I believe that it is very important &mdash; I share the views expressed by my colleagues &mdash; that we should have an international treaty and a uniform policy and system for dealing especially with terrorism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Motion No.4 deals with Acts against the safety of civil aviation.  When it became universally popular in the early seventies to hijack planes, were it not for the fact that the international community moved very fast to get a common agreement, an understanding on that, it would <Col N="1375" /> indeed have been very popular for various terrorist organisations to continue dominating the headlines of the international papers with horrendous hijackings. Of course, as we all know, hijacking causes tremendous psychological and physical upset, pressure and hardship on the innocent victims.  It is important that countries throughout the world should take a very firm stand to defeat that kind of activity.</P>
    <P>The order before the House has played a very significant role in diminishing greatly the number of hijackings these days, mainly because the people who engage in these crimes do not get away with their acts of terrorism.  Even in the very last instance of the one from the Soviet Union to Israel, from the point of view of the hijackers it was not a success since they were sent back right away. That is the way it should be.  I welcome the statement by the Belgian Prime Minister, M. Martens when he recently called for uniform procedures across the Community of the Twelve to deal with extradition. If by 1992 we are to have a united Europe or a more united Europe where we will not have barriers or frontiers as we now know them, it is important that each of the 12 countries should have an understanding, an agreement, and very definite legal procedures laid down to combat acts of terrorism or lawlessness and to militate against groups who would wish to hold one of these countries to ransom.</P>
    <P>It is important that, as we grow closer in Europe, we should work together in the common interest to defeat the people who are not prepared to live by the normal rules of law.  The only way we can do that is, in times of relative peace and harmony, to work together to legislate in this fashion, to agree on conventions and procedures which will be followed automatically through the courts and which will take this vexed question completely out of the political arena.  It is extremely important that these things should set in train almost automatic procedures so that justice will not only be seen to be done <Col N="1376" /> but will be done right across the 12 states of Europe.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand why it takes so very long, a lapse of almost ten years, for this country to formally ratify these conventions. We still have quite a number of conventions which we were talking about many years ago but which have not yet been officially ratified by this country.  We need to have that kind of protection.  We need to give the other States, whether in Europe or across the world in the United Nations, the assurance and guarantee that we will stand by the undertakings our Government give on behalf of the people of Ireland in these international conventions.  That is very important.  We have nothing to lose one way or the other; nevertheless we are in a position to give a very definite lead. When the difficult cases come up we will have to deal with them resolutely and honestly and endeavour to stand by the aspirations we all have for peace and harmony and, indeed, goodwill.</P>
    <P>The Hague Convention has been ratified by practically all of the countries in the United Nations.  It is very appropriate that the name of Ireland should be added to that very long list both in Part I and Part II of the Schedule.  That is important and it gives an indication of our determination to stand by the obligations or decisions taken by the contracting parties at The Hague.  I would hope that as a result we would have some peace of mind in that the ordinary life in the country would not have to be upset or the temperature raised every time these situations arise.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister of State on the very full explanation he has given to the House this evening. It makes it very easy for Members when we are attempting to assess the merits of the cases before the House.  It is a little unfortunate that these three motions came before the House this week.  Had they come a month ago it would have been much easier to speak on them fully and perhaps to have had a wider ranging debate, which is the norm for the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Motion No.2, dealing with extradition <Col N="1377" /> and extending the 1965 Act to Australia, represents indeed an extraordinary quirk of fate and history.  I had the honour to represent this House at the inaugural meeting in the Australian new parliament buildings some weeks ago.  Australia has been looked upon in our history books as one of the new frontiers.  Those of us there had a very heavy schedule.  We had an opportunity to look at the archives of Australian history over the past 200 years and in regard to a lot of their foundation stock &ldquo;extradition&rdquo; was hardly the &ldquo;in&rdquo; word at the time.  However, it is an ironic twist of fate to find ourselves in this year agreeing to and signing that Extradition Act with that country.</P>
    <P>I wish the Australian federation every success.  Australia is a vast country.  In this phase of our development in Europe we have a very big population.  Nevertheless the new federation of Australia is a very open society able to maintain a very high standard of civilisation and order.  Perhaps it might not go amiss if we were to look closely at their legal situation, which has drawn much on the experience of Europe.</P>
    <P>May I again compliment the Minister on expediting the enactment of these conventions? I hope they will ensure that there will be additional peace and harmony in this country as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, may I thank very sincerely all the Senators who contributed to the debate here today?  I reiterate that the draft orders before the House are of a technical nature and their purpose is to allow Ireland to comply fully with its international obligations on extradition under a number of international conventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Manning, Lanigan and Murphy quite rightly emphasised, extradition is one of the methods essential to the international community in its fight against crime and in particular the bringing of fugitives to justice.  Its object is to ensure that states have an international legal framework within which they may tackle crime, particularly international <Col N="1378" /> crime such as drug trafficking.  Domestically all states need the machinery to be able to undertake such an international role and the draft orders before the House, when enacted, will enable Ireland to act in accordance with its international obligations in relation to extradition.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning mentioned that I had said that Britain is not a party to the European Convention on Extradition. However, Senators will have seen newspaper reports of Secretary of State Hurd's statement that Britain hopes to become a party to the convention in the future. Senator Manning also raised the question of safeguards for the individual.  Could I say that the convention contains provisions which are solely there for the protection of the individual sought?  Senator McDonald also spoke about protecting the rights of the individual.  I can reassure him that these draft documents do that. The case which Senator Murphy raised and, indeed, which is probably at the back of most Senator's minds is not at issue here today.  That concerns Part III of the 1965 Act and extradition to Britain.  As I said earlier, we are dealing with Part II of the Act.  The Taoiseach's statement in the Dáil yesterday on that issue explained the decision fully.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald spoke about the reason it took so long.  It did not take long.  It was just that 11 orders will be revoked under the draft order relating to the European Convention on Extradition. These will be replaced by the present draft order which will apply Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, to all the parties to the convention.  Consequently, this draft order is more of a technical nature since it reapplies Part II of the Extradition Act to the parties to the convention in order to rectify a possible legal difficulty.  The draft order relating to The Hague and Montreal hi-jacking conventions revokes and replaces six previous orders.  It also applies Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, to 46 States who recently became parties to the convention. That is why the draft order is before us and it is not just being introduced now.  The draft order relating to <Col N="1379" /> Australia revokes only one order in full, that is, the order which gave effect to reciprocal bilateral arrangements on extradition between Ireland and Australia which the treaty will replace.</P>
    <P>The draft orders concern four international instruments each with its own specific purpose.  The European Convention on Extradition provides a comprehensive but simplified framework for extradition between 19 European nations.  Ireland's ratification in 1966 may possibly be defective and a new order is necessary to clarify that position.  The treaty on extradition between Ireland and Australia was signed in Dublin on 2 September 1985 and, as Senators Lanigan and McDonald remarked, it is indeed an extraordinary quirk of fate that 200 years afterwards we are signing an extradition treaty with Australia when so many of our people had no option but to be deported there.  The draft order relating to it will give the treaty effect in Irish domestic law, allowing Ireland to proceed to ratification of the treaty.  I think it is further evidence of the common opposition to criminal activity.</P>
    <P>Senators Lanigan and McDonald raised the question of the Montreal and Hague hi-jacking conventions.  Yes, they are a very necessary and successful international response to the need to protect civil aviation.  To date 137 countries are party to these conventions, a fact which underlies their importance.  The three draft orders before the House will enable Ireland to comply with its international obligations under these important instruments. I recommend the draft orders to the House.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Lanigan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion, which was quite some time ago, I was beginning my contribution with the reflection that although in the past, over ten or 11 years' intermittent membership of Seanad Éireann, I had not made any great contribution to these debates, these periodical reviews of the European Communities, because of my lack of commitment to the whole idea of the European Community, and even though I am still very far from being a Community enthusiast, I have changed my position to the extent that I accept our membership as a fact of life.  To that extent, therefore, I am motivated to contribute to these debates more than in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the point in beginning my contribution the last day that 1992 in many respects is a more important and a more unknown step than our initial membership in 1972-73 and that none of us has any real vision of what may develop from 1992.  People like Senator Robinson <Col N="1381" /> warned us about deficiencies in the legal sphere and almost every day we are lectured on economic and commercial aspects of 1992.  What I propose to do today is to dwell on the broader issues and to do so from the cautious standpoint of one who, although accepting the Community as a fact of life, will continue to be very criticial of the ongoing implications of our membership, keeping a very close, vigilant eye on Ireland's interest in the Community.</P>
    <P>When we last considered this matter on 2 November the Minister made the usual bland and conformist contribution to these debates &mdash; and I do not mean any reflection on whoever wrote the speech.  I would like to take up some of the Minister's points.  For example, reference was made to the European Political Co-operation process and, while I intend to say something more about foreign policy later on, let me at this point once again make the observation that if all of us, especially public representatives, are to take an informed interest in the EPC process, obviously we must have the machinery and the mechanisms for being informed.  Once again this draws attention to the absence of an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign policy.  As the Minister knows, some of us have attempted to make good that omission by setting up our own joint committee. Clearly, that is not satisfactory.  I propose at every hand's turn in this House to raise the matter of the glaring absence of any joint committee on foreign policy and the stubborn refusal of the Government to approve such a committee.</P>
    <P>With regard to foreign policy and security, the Minister later on makes the point that the super powers hold by far the greatest numbers of nuclear weapons. We all welcome the IMF Treaty and welcome even more the spectacular announcement by Mr. Gorbachev at the United Nations on arms reduction.  Nonetheless this is the place where I should comment that the possession of nuclear weapons is not a super power monopoly and that two of our European partners have these disastrous notions of grandeur because the possession of a nuclear <Col N="1382" /> weapon is in the worst sense a <i>folie de grandeur</i>, because the idea that you can control your foreign policy by the possession of a nuclear weapon is a kind of madness and it is a madness that we should not entertain.  I am coming to believe that Ireland in the Community, far from absenting itself virtuously from discussions on security, should contribute vigorously and contribute with a view to talking sense to its nuclear-obsessed partners.  But I have very little hope that that will be done because as far as I can see the main mentality dominating our approach to the EPC is one of conformism and acceptance.</P>
    <P>Later on the Minister refers to the Iran-Iraq ceasefire, which was welcomed by the Community.  Might I point out that perhaps a little noticed echo of that ceasefire was a statement &mdash; I am very sorry I do not have the newspaper reference but there was a definite statement &mdash; by a leading Iraqi spokesman which expressed great appreciation of the fact of Ireland's neutrality in this conflict.  I think the experts in the field will be able to track down the reference.  What I am drawing attention to here is that, in a disastrous conflict that seemed to have little reference to Ireland, it did not escape unnoticed that we do have this image of being impartial and neutral in the world at large, an image which we should be at pains to preserve and expand.</P>
    <P>Finally, I endorse in the Minister's speech his reference to the highly appropriate award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces.  Since that speech was delivered the prize has been awarded and it was very good to see one of our own soldiers as part of the contingent symbolising the peace-keeping role of the United Nations, something which again is further evidence of the particular image which we have in the international sphere and which we should be at pains to maintain and develop instead of considering abandoning it in the name of some bland common Community policy.</P>
    <P>Moving on from the Minister's speech, I would like to refer in the context of developments since January 1988, which <Col N="1383" /> are the terms of reference under which we are speaking, to the matter of regionalisation and regional policy.  There is a lot of public discontent about our whole approach to the development of a regional policy with a view to availing of the Structural Funds.  There is a lot of public disenchantment about this, and I think rightly so.  There is a suspicion that the Government have little real interest in developing a real regional policy and there is widespread rejection of what would seem to be a phoney regional policy without any real regard to the needs of communities and regions.  Yet, a proper regional development is vital for the future of the Community.</P>
    <P>Again, much as we condemned the British Prime Minister in another context in recent weeks, I think we are grateful to her for reminding us of the danger of a Europe of centralisation, a Europe of bureaucracy, though it is somewhat ironic that the warning should come from the prime minister of a state which is itself highly bureaucratic.  Nevertheless, the future, it would seem to me, would either be a centralised bureaucratic Community or a Community where there is healthy and evenly balanced regional development.  Therefore, an authentic regional policy is vital for us in more senses than one.  It is obviously vital for us from the point of view of the economy. I would draw the attention of Members of the House to a letter written to <i>The Irish Times</i> on 8 September by no mean expert in the subject, T.J. Barrington, on this topic of regional development. He reminds us that, and I quote from the letter:</P>
    <P>....in no western European country, not even the UK, is local democracy treated with such contempt as in this country.  To match this, in few countries is the central bureaucracy so arrogant or so incompetent as ours.</P>
    <P>That is the theme of the letter.  He draws the contrast, which sounds very impressive, between the respective budgetary or fiscal positions of Denmark and Ireland. Starting from a 1981 base both countries <Col N="1384" /> had a large budgetary deficit.  In 1981 the deficit of both countries was more than 7 per cent of GNP, but by 1986 Denmark had reached a surplus of 3 per cent where we increased our deficit to 8.6 per cent and it will still be around 6 per cent this year.  There has been some but not enough examination of the comparative performance of both countries.  I think we should study much more what Denmark has achieved.  Certainly much of its achievement has been due to more effective financial management, but much of it has been due to keeping national government in its own place, in reserving the role of national government for national affairs and putting the maximum emphasis on local autonomy and regional control.  We would do well to look at that particular model.</P>
    <P>Denmark has another interest for us in the Community and it is this.  The Danes send a number of MEPs to the European Parliament who are highly critical of Denmark's role in the Community.  That is to say they keep the same kind of vigilant eye on Community affairs that I would myself approve of.  In Denmark it is not, apparently, regarded as objectionable or evidence of eccentricity that one should be highly critical of the Community. We should develop the same kind of mentality here.  From our very first time of membership in the Community there prevailed an atmosphere among what I might call the political establishment that to criticise the EC was seen somehow as slightly odd and disreputable. That consensus among 80 per cent of our politicians still obtains so that the genuine critical attitude to the Community is not appreciated as it should be appreciated, as a mark of genuine doubt as to Ireland's place in the world, but is stigmatised as somewhat insular, backward looking and reactionary.  That is not the case in Denmark and that should not be the case here.</P>
    <P>In passing I want to refer to the fact that in the forthcoming European elections in the Munster constituency there will be a candidate who will run on Danish MEP lines, that is to say, he will run and if elected keep a watchdog eye <Col N="1385" /> on the proceedings in Europe, a watchdog eye on Ireland's behalf, keeping the national interest in mind.  He certainly will have my full support in his campaign.</P>
    <P>Therefore, regionalisation is obviously a vital aspect of Community development, and not alone for the economy. If we did have genuine regions up and running in Ireland based on the natural needs of particular areas &mdash; and let us remind ourselves of the paradox whereby we have inherited the most centralised systems from the UK &mdash; there is no country so naturally rich in regions as Ireland. For its size it is a remarkably diversified country and lends a tremendous richness, if you like, to our potential for tourism and so on.  Historians in the great revolution of discovery that has been exciting historians for the last generation emphasise the importance of understanding a region in detail in order to understand any particular phenomenon of social, political or economic history.  If we could develop regions in accordance with genuine local and regional imperatives it would not alone benefit the economy, not alone restore public confidence, but it might well make a more than minor contribution to our greatest national problem &mdash; North-South relations.  If we could really develop the country along regional lines many aspects of the ancient quarrel might well become irrelevant or at least show the combatants, if you like, how much they really have in common.</P>
    <P>In many respects what is going to happen now is more exciting than what has happened since our entry 15 years ago.  Earlier I mentioned the need to look more closely at Denmark but we should look at all regions of the European Community for the lessons it may provide us with in our economic and other policies. Part of our retarded development as a nation is our servile imitation of English models which we adhered to, not alone since the foundation of the State, but which were foisted upon us under the Union.  In other words, in the regions of public health and the economy generally we were presented with only one model, the English model, in many respects totally unsuitable for our circumstances.  We <Col N="1386" /> could have looked to whole areas of Europe for lessons in agricultural policy and so on.  Instead, our horizons were contained by the Anglo-Irish prison in which we were bound.  Now we have a more pluralistic opportunity to look at models elsewhere.  I hope this will enrich us in all the areas of our national life.</P>
    <P>Part of the residual servility we have inherited as a result of the long Anglo-Irish relationship is that we have not really thought positively enough of what we can contribute to the Community in its new phase.  There is much talk about a rich diversity of cultures, but do we ever really consider seriously this concept that our culture for example, our language, our literary heritage and many other aspects of our culture are unknown in continental Europe?  The year 1992, among other things should mean that we should show off what we have and should put it forward for entertainment and cultural satisfaction as part of pluralistic Europe.  In offering them our cultural richness, we would rediscover ourselves in turn.</P>
    <P>That richness, of course, includes as its brightest jewel, the Irish language and its associated culture.  Much has been said about 1992 and the need to learn continental languages.  We will all take that as read.  There are problems in making a virtually monoglot people acquainted with the idea of other languages.  In our own university, for example, we are suddently faced with an influx of first year students who want to learn French, German or Italian.  That is welcome but it presents the greatest of problems to small and understaffed departments who are now being asked to act as a kind of Berlitz or cram school of languages, instead of teaching languages in a proper way at university level.  That is a problem we have to overcome.</P>
    <P>One of the things that is being wrongly said in this new emphasis on the need for us to learn continental languages is that somehow the Irish language must suffer and must make room for the European languages.  An entirely false antithesis is being posed between the position of the Irish language and the need for us to <Col N="1387" /> acquire European languages.  Of course we agree on the importance of European languages.</P>
    <P>Do thuigeamar i gcónaí go raibh tábhacht ag baint le na teangacha Eorpacha, agus aontaímid ar fad go mba chóir go mbeimís in ann labhairt le daoine as pobail eile in a dteangacha féin.  Ach ní hionann san agus a rá go gcaithfimid ár dteanga féin a thréigint.  Ba chóir gur féidir linn na teangacha seo a fhoghlaim de bhreis ar ár dteanga féin, ní in áit ár dteanga féin.  Níor chóir go mbeidh orainn roghnú a dhéanamh idir ár dteanga féin agus pé teanga Eorpach a bheadh i gceist againn.  Níl aon chúis nach mbeadh gá le ceann nó trí nó ceithre cinn de theangacha Eorpacha a bheith againn mar atá ag go leor de mhuintir na MórRoinne.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, tá sé tábhachtach athrú a chur ar an mbéim sin atá á cur faoi láthair agus a rá arís nach aon bhac é ar fhoghlaim aon teanga eile foghlaim na Gaeilge.  Ar an dul céanna, ba chóir go mbeadh na háiseanna go léir atá agus a bheidh ar fáil do lucht foghlamtha na dteangacha Eorpacha ar fáil chomh maith do lucht na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>It is important that in agreeing with the need to learn European languages, because we cannot understand our new Community unless we are able to talk in one or more of the languages of that Community, we should emphasise that this does not mean the abandonment of Irish.  The Community has committed itself to safeguarding and expanding the role of lesser used languages, as they are called.  It should be a leading task of our MEPs and others who are involved full time in the Community to press for the real application of this resolution stressing the importance of the lesser used languages which was moved by the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Though it has not anything directly to do with the motion on the European Communities, it seems that there is in other ways, great hope at the moment for the Irish language despite the rapid destruction of the Gaeltacht areas.  I have believed for a long time now that Irish <Col N="1388" /> will not survive in the Gaeltacht areas and that the Gaeltacht areas are doomed. Irish will survive outside the Gaeltacht regions and will become a very important flavour of life outside of the Gaeltacht areas.  The enthusiasm for Gael-Scoileanna and other expressions of enthusiasm for Irish gives some support to my views.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely vital that those who believe in the Irish language should stress that it should have nothing to do with extreme nationalism or terrorism.  Some day, in a happier Ireland, the Irish language and its rich culture should be on offer to the Unionists of the North who might see it as something that presents no threat to their own way of life but will be an additional enrichment of their life and perhaps will even recall some of their past history when Presbyterian Ulster was quite involved with the Irish language.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we should uphold the language, as against those who would see it only as part of their cultural armoury, as a kind of a supportive blood-stained cultural attribute of provo-ism.  The friends of the language need to stand up and be counted in that respect also.  I repeat that there is not any real antagonism between the imperatives of European languages and the importance of safeguarding and expanding our own language.</P>
    <P>Culturally and educationally, one is glad to note the developments in the Erasmus programmes and the Comet programmes.  Those of us involved in third level education find that virtually every day there is some communication to do with the Erasmus programme. More and more of our students are caught up in European university life.  Even if one did not believe in the Community and its political goals, obviously one welcomes this European dimension of third level education.</P>
    <P>In relation to foreign policy and the general political vision of Europe, I am fearful of 1992 in many respects.  Much of the economic optimism about 1992 is on very flimsy ground.  I see no reason why in a market which is going to be <Col N="1389" /> unified and where there will be a free flow of capital and labour, that free flow should benefit a peripheral part of the Community.  The notion that Ireland stands to gain from 1992, without being shown some good reason why, runs counter to the whole general philosophy of the single market.  I am fearful of the effects on employment and emigration, and so on.  That is why, among other reasons, I favour the candidature of Members of the European Parliament who are not just lackeys and yes men but who will represent the national interest in Strasbourg or Brussels and who will protect the national interest in Strasbourg and Brussels.</P>
    <P>I am always surprised that the kind of Irish politician who gets very upset and narky if one suggests relinquishing Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution, because it would be an unacceptable abdication of our sovereignty &mdash; though the sovereignty is purely a paper sovereignty, a theoretical sovereignty &mdash; frequently has no reluctance in cheerfully surrendering what remains of our State sovereignty to the common pool of the European Community.  That is why I am in favour of Danish type Members of Parliament to protect our national interests.</P>
    <P>I very much support the idea of looking beyond the Single Market &mdash; not on the Single Market alone will Europeans live &mdash; to the wider vision of the best kind of European Community.  I commend, for all of us who are contributing to similar debates in the future, a series of four articles by Richard Kearney, who is seen as one of our leading philosophers, published in <i>The Irish Times</i> in late October. This series taken from a new book he is editing, <i>Across the Frontiers</i>&mdash;<i>Ireland in the 1990s</i>, examines the implications of Ireland's role in the 1990s in Europe.  Many of Kearney's ideas have been disputed.  I would not agree with all of them myself, but he tries to evoke a vision of a self-respecting Ireland in a diversified Europe in a series of articles which command our attention.  In a later debate in this House, on a motion put down in my name and in the names of many Senators, I hope to discuss the <Col N="1390" /> implications for our position of nonmembership in any military alliance and the implications of 1992 and after for our neutrality, a word that is shortly, if somewhat unsatisfactorily, descriptive.</P>
    <P>The other day I came across a speech that I made on 22 May 1987 in a debate in UCC in the course of the Single European Act campaign.  I was struck by one sentence of what I said as being prophetic. I do not wish to be vain but I said on the Friday before the referendum: &ldquo;If we say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; on Tuesday, we can be sure that our own politicians will be persuading us in five or ten years time that we cannot expect to enjoy the economic and political benefits of European union while continuing to shirk our defence obligations.&rdquo;  I said &ldquo;in five or ten years time&rdquo;.  That was the only flaw in my prediction because it is happening already. Over the last year there has been a flurry of statements from continental politicians and from our own politicians which give us to understand that our non-membership of a military pact is unsatisfactory and fundamentally incompatible with the future of the Community.  I do not wish to list a catalogue of names in that regard but Fine Gael Deputies, in particular, have been flying this kind of kite.  In Cork, the kite was flown both by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and by the Lord Mayor.  I challenged them both publicly to explain what they meant by this rather obscure talk that we could not continue as we were and so far they have failed to answer my challenge. There is a tocsin being sounded that we must play our proper role in some vague and unspecified European defence.  I am concerned to dispute that.  European politicians, wise and all as they are supposed to be and reverentially as names such as Delors and Tindemans and so on are sounded here, do not understand anything about our neutrality.  Tindemans is on record as saying that he understands our neutrality is not a real neutrality, that it is really an expression of anti-Britishness.  It may have been in some respects a long time ago.  If he is not aware of all the factors that have contributed to our particular outlook on <Col N="1391" /> the world over the past 20 or 30 years, someone needs to tell him.  I wonder if Commissioner Sutherland and others have been positively telling him about us, rather than passively advocating what they are telling us to do.</P>
    <P>Much of the rhetoric we hear from those who talk about us joining a European defence league is really stale cold war rhetoric.  I wonder if the people who say these things have really thought deeply about what they are saying.  I refer, in particular, to a speech made by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, in Cork on Friday, 2 December 1988, speaking at the Schumann lecture in UCC which laid it on the line that full membership means a defence union.  Is he talking about a common militarisation across the board?  Is he talking about shedding our blood for Europe, or rather shedding European blood against other Europeans?  That is the implication of European defence pact.</P>
    <P>Such a defence organisation would have one target only and that would be the Soviet Union.  It is obscene that a Europe of vision, a Europe of the future from the Atlantic to the Urals should be thinking in these outmoded cold war terms &mdash; especially outmoded now after the dramatic developments of recent months and of the past two years under the most remarkable Russian leader of the century.  The idea that the Soviet Union presents the same kind of threat to Western Europe &mdash; if it ever did present a threat &mdash; as it did in the forties is to ignore the most exciting developments that are taking place.</P>
    <P>Much of the thinking in these circles about the implications of 1992 for our foreign policy is not really thinking at all. It is simply rehashing cold war ideas in what is a mistaken belief that it will somehow make us more acceptable to our European partners.  That is why I was glad to see that only last week ex-Commissioner Sutherland said something which I took to be rather different.  Obviously, nobody can challenge his credentials as a European.  He said that whatever place we had in the world we <Col N="1392" /> would have it as a member of the European Community.  That is something with which I do not agree as we have a standing in the world entirely independent of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, I found it interesting that he said that, instead of isolating ourselves in a &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; way from the various discussions on security which take place, we should be wholeheartedly involved in them, that the real reason we would be seen as being at odds with the Community would be if we said more or less that security was none of our business. He said that we should get in there and contribute.  He did not say that that meant becoming a member of a military pact.  He did not say that it meant becoming a member of the Western European Union.  He said that we should make our own contribution to the meaningful discussions on security within the Community. I would agree with that but by that I would mean things which, perhaps, he might not approve of, for example, that we would be in there telling our partners to stop their cynical arms trafficking, to stop their mad obsession with nuclear weapons and so on, and that we would be there as a force for peace and not as some piddling little contingent of a new communal military policy. However, I hope to return to these ideas later on when we are discussing fully the neutrality motion.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, I repeat that not through the Single Market alone will Europeans live which is why I recommend the Kearney articles and the whole idea of reflecting on what Europe will mean in cultural terms.  Up to now at least, the European Community has not inspired the people of Ireland.  It has inspired certain people who have a vested interest in Europe and I do not mean anything sinister by that. It has inspired the Eurocrats, and so on but the whole European Community idea has left the ordinary people of Ireland cold.  It will be my hope that the implications of 1992, transcending the mere economic and commercial implications, will have something to say that will appeal to the imagination and attract the loyalty <Col N="1393" /> of the people in Ireland to the European Community of the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is taking place towards the end of a year in which there have been many changes in the European Parliament and in the European Community which have had a bearing on what has happened to us in the past 12 months and will inevitably play a major part in the development of this island, particularly after 1 January 1993. We are debating this motion at a time when our own economic trends are good. Our manufacturing capacity and output have increased.  There has been a slight drop in unemployment.  Retail sales are up, even though a brake has been put on the retail sector over the past number of years.  Our exports have increased in real terms and, for the first time in many years, our exchange rate is very favourable in comparison to that of Great Britain.</P>
      <P>It is a sort of economic miracle that the interest rates in Ireland have been sustained at such a low level when interest rates in Great Britain have been rising. Of course, one of the reasons for the rise in interest rates in Great Britain is the enormous amount of consumer spending which meant that imports into Britain increased at an enormous rate and their exports are not as good as they should be.  The atmosphere created for industry and for employment in manufacturing in Ireland has been created by economic factors, not based on Europe but based on the plans of the Government.  The implementation of these plans has brought economic success in 1988.  Hopefully, the success will continue into 1989 and further and as a result our two main problems, emigration and unemployment, will be resolved to as great a degree as is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout Europe over the past number of months there has been a debate on the Single European Act and on 1992.  There is no doubt that concern has been expressed in many places as to what will happen here as a result of the coming together of the European States under the Single European Act.  The <Col N="1394" /> problems associated with it are many. Nevertheless, it is invitable that European union will come about.  This will have a major effect on this country and on other countries in Europe.  There will be savings as a result of the breaking down of barriers in terms of tax rates and documentation presently used in exporting between States inside the Community. This will reduce prices within the Community and, hopefully, as a result people will spend more on European goods and there will be a higher level of employment than there is now within the states of Europe.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems associated with the advent of the single European union have been expressed by speakers before. Nevertheless, the problems associated with our educational system could not be too strongly stressed.  In the past, one of our major problems has been the lack of language teaching from a practical, commercial point of view.  Some of the major barriers to our efforts to export have been our lack of language ability in trade and our apparent lack of interest in learning other languages.  Although within Europe English has taken over as the premier language, there are people in Germany for instance who, even though they have a fantastic facility with English, prefer to use their own language and prefer people to take the trouble to speak to them in their language.  The same applies to other countries throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>We have not been as strong in our marketing efforts in the past as we should have been.  Too much emphasis was put on selling rather than on marketing and there is a big difference between selling and marketing.  Until we get our marketing orientation properly in place again we will have trouble.</P>
    <P>We have seen changes in Europe because of the Single European Act over the past couple of months. The European Parliament now plays a much stronger part in the affairs of Europe than heretofore. Within the European Parliament the decisions of the Council of Ministers can be overruled by majority vote.  This <Col N="1395" /> means that the European Parliament is now a much stronger entity.  It has a certain amount of power now and we saw throughout the year that the Parliament is willing and able to flex its muscles and go against decisions made elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is important that the European elections next year are taken seriously.  I do not agree with the comments made by Senator Murphy regarding gombeen politicians who are out there.  Our politicians work extremely hard there for a better Ireland.  They have been highly successful in their efforts to improve things for Ireland.  It is essential that people of the highest calibre should go to Europe.  I am sure that my party will put forward candidates who will be quite well able to deal with the many problems that will be associated with the change-over from today's politics to 1993 politics.</P>
    <P>It is heartening that we have a very strong commissioner from Ireland in Deputy Ray MacSharry.  His efforts on behalf of this country throughout the past couple of years as Minister for Finance have shown that he has the strength to conclude whatever he decides to do.  He goes forward in the national interest even though at times he is criticised for doing so.  He does not take the easy option and for that reason we are extemely lucky to have a commissioner of that calibre.</P>
    <P>In the past couple of years we have seen many changes in Europe, particularly in air travel.  Many thousands of people are travelling throughout Europea and getting to know it better.  I hope that, in the future, countries such as Ireland will have freedom of movement so that they will not be hampered as they are at present by lack of fifth freedom flights.</P>
    <P>Tourism in Europe has been much improved because of rationalisation which has taken place in the travel industry. I hope this will continue.  Over the past number of months we have had relative price stability in the industry and in the elements which go to make it up.  It looks as if this will continue for some time.  The Government should point out to the motor trade the implications of <Col N="1396" /> changes that will take place in 1993, or prior to it, as a result of the harmonisation of taxation.  If we do not rationalise the industry it could mean the virtual breakdown of the motor trade particularly towards the end of 1990 and definitely from 1991 and 1992 onwards unless taxation elements are laid before the people well in advance of 1992 or 1993.</P>
    <P>There have been problems associated with marketing.  There have been curbs placed on the production of dairy products and it is virtually impossible for us now to look for new markets in the dairy area because stocks of dairy products are at an all time low.  When markets open up it is not always possible for us to sell into them.  I hope there will be some change in the intervention system in the quota system over the next number of years. There is a fear that in 1993 continental farmers will buy up the quotas that will be available in Ireland and milk production will be centred in mainland Europe.</P>
    <P>The European elections will be more important than they were in the past and we must prepare for them.  The people should realise that the changes that have taken place have made it important to send politicians of a very high calibre to the European Parliament.  The number of international events which took place over the past 12 months have played a part in lessening tension throughout the world and Europe has been fighting for this for quite some time.  There is no doubt that within Russia there has been a change in attitude &mdash; glasnost.  The various changes taking place in that subcontinent have to be praised.</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 months we have seen a certain stability in the Gulf area in the Middle East.  We have seen the ending of the Iran-Iraq war and because of that there is a possibility that energy prices will stabilise over the next number of years.  It is supposed that there will be a reasonable stabilisation of prices at a level which will allow Europe to develop and equally give a reasonable price to producer countries.</P>
    <P>It is not expected that there will be any major increase in oil prices until about <Col N="1397" /> 1993 or 1994 when certain oilfields outside the Middle East will start to run down.  There will be an increase in oil prices at that stage but the fact that there is the probability of a stabilisation of prices over the next number of years gives European industry the chance to get itself settled and to prepare itself for the next increase in energy prices.  The last time there was an increase in energy prices in the mid-seventies European economies were not prepared for it and it created unemployment problems with many factories closing down.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that with all the talk of changes in the Soviet Union there seems to be a slowing down in the suggested withdrawal from Afghanistan. There is a definite slowing down of Russian withdrawal and some land to land missiles have been brought into that country.  Again in the Middle East over the past 12 months we have seen violence on the West Bank and Gaza.  We have seen horific incidences of violence against the Palestinian people on the West Bank and Gaza by the illegal occupation forces of Israel.  While there seemed to be movement towards change in that area over the last number of months the Israelis do not seem to want it.  Changes are inevitable.  The former Israeli foreign minister, Abba Eban said recently that a Palestinian victory is inevitable.  Unless the Israelis come to their senses and realise that history is against them and start talking peace with the PLO, their position in world politics will be very insecure.  Abba Eban said that the Israeli vote against a land for peace was as futile as would be an Israeli vote against the law of gravity.  There is great sense in that.</P>
    <P>The European Community must continue to play a very high profile role in trying to eliminate the problems of the Palestinian people.  The European countries over the past number of years have played an enormous part in trying to resolve this horrific problem.  The Irish Government have played their part and have maintained a high profile support for the Palestinians.  I sincerely hope that over the next 12 months the Government <Col N="1398" /> will be as supportive as they have been in the past.  The setting up in Algiers recently by the Palestinian national council of the state of Palestine is something that has to be agreed with by anybody who has any sympathy for a downtrodden people.  Hopefully we will see some movement there over the next few months.  The United Nations is the place where the main movement can take place in allowing the Palestinians to set up their state even on the limited amount of land they have set aside and not on the total amount of land which they morally own. The Middle East is an area which can create numerous problems for us in Europe.  A peaceful Middle East means a peaceful Europe and it can also mean a very prosperous Europe.</P>
    <P>The EUROPEAN campaign which was launched by the Taoiseach in September is playing a major role in identifying the problem areas for us coming up to 1993. Not alone is it making people aware of the problem areas, but it is showing them how to resolve these problems.  The information service is excellent and I sincerely hope that it continues to be as good as it was in the opening few months since September.  There is hope that 1993 will bring changes which will not make us less Irish but more European and which will provide an economic unit which will be as viable and workable as the United States of America.  We are not talking about an area as big as the United States in terms of distances but when one realises that one can travel from California to New York without any let or hindrance and that one can carry goods backwards and forwards without let or hindrance, one sees what can be done in Europe.</P>
    <P>We will, of course, have problems. These are recognised in that Ireland is a No. 1 area for help under the new social funds.  The Government have set up numerous sub-regional committees which are looking at the problems and at the action that should be taken to increase our chances of succeeding in 1993.  The first of these meetings in my area took place in Kilkenny last Friday week.  It has been said that there is no <Col N="1399" /> contact between the sub-regional committees and local authority members but at our meeting last Monday the county manager gave the first of what will be a continuing series of discussions on the workings of the committee.  He asked for each of the councils in the area to respond in any way they think necessary to these committees.</P>
    <P>It was a year in which there were changes within Europe.  Up to now in these debates on the various reports from the EC there has been a terrible sense of despondency.  In the debates that have taken place in the Seanad people have not been as despondent as they were. There is a reality coming into the discussions. The reality is that we will share within the province of Europe and that doors can be opened up for us in 1993. However, we must be ready and we must make our preparations in a logical manner so as to ensure that in 1993 we are as prepared as the other countries in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Senators who contributed.  This motion has provided a welcome opportunity to have a wide-ranging discussion on issues which are of such importance to us in Ireland as a committed member of the European Community.  I would like to respond to a number of points made during the course of the debate.  In the context of the reform of the Structural Funds, a number of Senators touched on the question of the recently announced sub-regions for the preparation of operational programmes and the related administrative arrangements adopted by the Government for this purpose.  In responding to their points, I want to emphasise yet again that, under the EC regulations already finalised on the reform of the Structural Funds, the whole of the State is regarded as a priority region for development.  The Government's decision to divide the country into a number of sub-regions is intended to ensure that all areas are adequately and equally considered in the preparation of <Col N="1400" /> programmes and to allow for a local input to the planning process while maintaining the sub-regions at a manageable size and number.</P>
      <P>The Government gave careful consideration to the procedures for preparation of the sub-regional programmes. In the end we adopted an arrangement which will provide considerable scope for the input of local views while ensuring that the tight timetable which will govern the preparation of these programmes can be met.  I would like to point out in this context that the advisory groups will comprise a significant element of local representation in the persons of the chairmen of county councils, county borough corporations, borough corporations and urban district councils with a population in excess of 15,000.</P>
      <P>Other interested parties are also welcome to put their views in written submissions, for consideration by the advisory groups.  A notice will be inserted in the national newspapers in the near future advising interested parties how this can be done.  The presence of county managers in the working groups provides yet another avenue through which the viewpoint of local authorities can be brought to bear on the deliberations on the content of the sub-national programmes and on the drafting of the programmes.</P>
      <P>The working groups also include representatives of the Government Departments mainly concerned with development matters.  In many cases, these include representatives of agencies operating under the aegis of the Departments. Managers of vocational education committees, for example, participate in some of the working groups.  It is intended also that submissions should be sought from Government Departments and offices who do not have a major role in the development issues appropriate to structural funds but who may, nevertheless, have relevant development proposals to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of the sub-regional programmes being drafted in conditions of secrecy.  County managers <Col N="1401" /> are free to keep local authority councillors informed of progress in drafting the programmes if they are so requested. I am glad to see that this has already happened, as described by Senator Lanigan, in Kilkenny.  I urge all Senators who are members of local authorities and, indeed, all local representatives to insist that county managers have a series of meetings, special meetings if necessary, in relation to the programmes.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald made a number of valuable points about the integrated rural development programme.  He also asked a number of questions about it and I will answer them.  However, let me clarify for the House the basic idea behind the integrated rural development programme. The most important thing is that it is a Government initiative and not a Community initiative though it is fully in line with the emerging thinking at Community level in regard to integrated rural development.  Senators will appreciate, of course, that we are not talking about the integrated operations which have been undertaken by the Community in the past.</P>
    <P>The key point about this home-grown rural development programme, which was launched by the Minister for Agriculture and Food last May, is that it is designed to help rural communities to help themselves.  The programme will do this by generating new jobs in the 11 rural areas selected for the pilot phase.  The emphasis is on commercial self-sustaining enterprises and on community self-help. What we want to achieve is that people will not have to leave their localities in search of jobs because they will find them at home.  I want to confirm for the House, as requested by Senator McDonald, that this Government initiative is not limited to agriculture alone.  We expect that small industry projects, rural tourism and home-based small business ventures will also be involved.</P>
    <P>Of course, this Government initiative is not to be seen in isolation from developments at Community level, particularly the reform of the Structural Funds where there is increased emphasis on the programme approach for the <Col N="1402" /> future as opposed to the earlier fragmented approach based on individual projects.  The experience gained from this pilot venture in rural development will be of particular value to Ireland as the increased resources from the Community for structural purposes become available.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald also highlighted the need for a co-ordinated, integrated approach at Community level.  I agree with him.  There are three Structural Funds.  They must pull together.  Senators will be aware that one of the main objectives of the current reform is greater coordination and coherence in structural policy.  I am sure we will see the improvements which the Senator wants.  Ireland, as a major beneficiary of the funds, recognises the necessity and indeed the importance of these steps to increase their efficiency.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulroy pointed to the wider context in which the needs of the less developed and peripheral regions like Ireland must be viewed.  The Community recognised the importance of addressing these needs in a comprehensive and focused manner.  Accordingly, the European Council agreed that the funds should be concentrated on the areas most in need including the less developed or &ldquo;Objective No. 1&rdquo; regions as mentioned by Senator Lanigan.  Funds assistance for these regions will be doubled by 1992.  A particular extra effort is to be made for the least developed areas which include Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Community's commitment to reduce regional imbalances is further reflected in the Single European Act which provides that the cohesion objective should be taken into account in the implementation of the common policies and the internal market.  This will ensure that all Community policies, not only structural policies, must come under the microscope to assess their contribution to reducing regional disparities.  Senator Mulroy mentioned the opportunities for Ireland presented by the removal of trade barriers, the liberalisation of air transport and Community support for small and medium sized enterprises.  If these policies and other Community policies are <Col N="1403" /> formulated and implemented in the right way, if sensitivity to the needs of the less developed regions is, so to speak, written into them from the outset, the emergence of real European unity will be significantly closer.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the Structural Funds issue, I would like to refer to how the handicapped will fare under the new proposals for the Structural Funds.  This question was raised by Senator Farrell. He rightly pointed out the vital impact Community assistance for the handicapped has had in recent years.  I am happy to confirm for the Senator that Ireland has specifically obtained assurances from the Commission that the handicapped will remain fully eligible under the new rules for the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed at what is perceived to be a lack of preparedness for the 1992 deadline on the completion of the internal market.  I can assure Senators that the EUROPEAN 1992 campaign is an intensive and wide-ranging information campaign.  From the beginning of September, Ministers have organised a series of sectoral conferences over the length and breadth of the country. The aim of these conferences has been to target relevant interest groups with information on specific directives most directly affecting individual sectors of the economy.  There has been a very positive response to these conference and I have no doubt that the 1992 message is getting across to the social partners.  Indeed, most of the social partners have also held conferences, for example, the CII, FUE, Chambers of Commerce, the IFA and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>The Government have now also, through the EUROPEN Bureau, issued a series of detailed leaflets covering 14 key areas of the Single Market programme and there has been a huge response to the advertisements announcing their availability to the general public.  It is intended to keep up the momentum of the EUROPEN campaign and to ensure that the widest possible <Col N="1404" /> coverage is given to the implications of 1992.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson made specific reference to the Products Liability Directive which became operative at Community level in July this year.  She is correct in saying that this directive has not yet been implemented in Ireland but, as she pointed out, neither has it been implemented in a number of other member states.  Preparation of the necessary legislation for its implementation in Ireland is well in hand and it will be introduced to the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. The amount and pace of Community legislation in the run-up to 1992 is increasing and, of course, with limited resources it is difficult to keep pace with it but the Government will continue to ensure that Ireland plays its full part in the completion of the internal market by 1992.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up one point with regard to the incorporation of Community directives into domestic law. Senator Robinson commented that it was not appropriate to implement EC environmental policy by circular letter as such letters are not freely available to the public.  The Department of the Environment have chosen in the past to implement some EC directives by the issue of circular letters to local authorities. In the area of local government law, departmental circular letters are the accepted form of ensuring consistent implementation throughout the country of environmental protection measures. However, in deference to the views of the Commission of the European Communities and of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation, the Department of the Environment have decided that environmental protection directives will, in future, be translated into national law by means of statutory instruments.  The Department have also decided to make statutory instruments applying directives previously implemented by circular letter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question about why the Community Patent Convention has not already been implemented here, the fact is that there is not yet agreement <Col N="1405" /> among member states on a Community patent regime and the Community patent as such does not yet exist.  As Senator Robinson rightly mentioned, the Community Patent Convention poses a constitutional problem for Ireland.  This is because it will establish a Patents Appeal Court which will have jurisdiction outranking Irish courts on patents questions and because adherence to the convention is not adjudged to be an obligation of Community membership.  The Government are now looking actively at how this constitutional difficulty can best be overcome.</P>
    <P>A patents Bill is now in preparation which will significantly streamline and improve the issuing of patents in this country and which will enable Ireland to ratify the European Patent Convention and join the European Patent Office. This is a necessary preliminary to ratification of the Community Patent Convention and it demonstrates he Government's commitment to progress in this most important area of intellectual property.</P>
    <P>I agree with much of Senator Murphy's contribution.  I accept, as he does, that there is a need to look at the Community in a critical light and to scrutinise it. However, I must say, and I hope that I misunderstood him, I do not agree with his description of existing MEPs as lackeys and yes men.  They all, in their own way, have done a tremendous job for Ireland over the past number of years and have kept the Irish point of view in consideration in the various debates.</P>
    <P>He also spoke about the question of a joint committee on foreign policy.  We had a very wide-ranging debate on that not so long ago and I have very little to add to it, except that in another debate Senator Ross said that our foreign policy would appear to be that of the Twelve. That is not so but if the policy of the Twelve suits Ireland, is it not proper that we should use the Twelve to further our own foreign policy aims?</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy also spoke on the <Col N="1406" /> question of the regional policy which is vital for us.  I have dealt with that already. As one who comes from a western region. I believe that regional policy is vital particularly for our region.  I agree with many of the things the Senator said about the Irish language.  A point he mentioned is the number of students who are coming through Erasmus programmes.  I had the pleasure of meeting quite a number of them in UCG recently.  The question of languages has come up and the teaching of languages.  I sometimes wonder why businesses and companies who have a very big export market do not take it upon themselves, as part of their marketing policy, to make certain that a number of their sales people are fluent in the language of the country in which they are operating and not consistently blaming the Government, any Government, for the lack of language teaching.</P>
    <P>As Senator Murphy said, we have no need to be fearful of 1992.  We have no reason to be complacent either.  If we take the advice that is being offered and if the companies who are exporting take the steps necessary between now and the end of 1992 it just has to be important for us and it has to be to our benefit.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up one other point. The question of neutrality has been raised time after time.  It seems to me that Senator Murphy contradicted himself in that he has spoken quite often and, indeed, again today about the conformism that we seem to have in our foreign policy with that of our EC partners. He said he saw that somebody from Iran was talking about how Ireland was neutral during the recent conflict between themselves and Iraq.  He spoke about the image of neutrality that is abroad.  Why can we not recognise that ourselves, that we have this neutrality, that we are perceived as being neutral?</P>
    <P>The scope of EPC as set out in the Single European Act provides that as far as security is concerned co-ordination of positions among the Twelve is confined to its political and economic aspects.  The <Col N="1407" /> declaration made by the Government at the time of ratification of the Single European Act noted that the provisions on foreign policy co-ordination in title 3 did not affect Ireland's long-standing policy of military neutrality.  I could repeat that again and again.</P>
    <P>I hope I have succeeded in my opening speech and in my remarks today in imparting some additional information on significant areas of Community policy and developments from January 1988 to the present.  As I said in my opening speech, 1988 has been an important year in the history of the European Economic Community involving major achievements for the Community as a whole and for Ireland in particular.</P>

      <P>A development plan has been drawn up by the Department of Finance for submission to the European Commission as part of an application for funding from the substantially increased EC Structural Funds.  Up to now there have been three Structural Funds.  During 1987 the Structural Funds had a combined budget of £5,700 million.  That was increased by some £300 million during 1988.  In order to support the completion of the internal market the Structural Funds will be increased by about £1,000 million a year in each of the years from 1989 to 1992.  With a further increase of some £770 million allocated for 1993 the three Structural Funds should be disbursing about £10,800 million by that year.  In rough terms, there should be a doubling of the annual resources available from the Structural Funds between 1987 and 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of applying for these funds Ireland has been divided into seven regions.  Specific proposals for economic and infrastructural development will be presented to the Commission for each of these regions.  One of these regions and the region in which I am most interested is the greater Dublin region comprising the city and country.  A consultancy study has been commissioned by the Government. I understand a programme for development drawn up after the study was completed will be used as a model for the other regions.  We in Dublin Corporation have been consulted at just one meeting about this measure.  Even though I have been a member of the council for ten years and the leader of a group, the elected members had no responsibility whatsoever in drawing up the list of items under which Dublin Corporation are to seek funding.  I will refer briefly to these.  They are roads, sewers, pedestrianisation, the updating of the markets, secondary and tertiary sanitary treatment and the expanding up of water production at Ballymore Eustace.  It may come as a surprise to Senators, especially Senators from rural Ireland who have <Col N="1409" /> serious grievances in relation to roads and the maintenance of roads, to hear that there is a problem in Dublin.  There was far more consultation with the elected members for the estimates for the city than there was in the preparation of these items for funding from the EC Regional Fund.  I quote from the manager's report on the estimates:</P>
    <P>Again, the 1989 Government Estimate for Public Services include a special provision of £20 million for country roads.  It is equally important in my view that additional moneys be made available for renewal or urban roads and pathways many of which in Dublin require more expenditure than we have been able to allocate.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of &ldquo;sewers&rdquo; he had something to say which really caused us concern and I quote from his report:</P>
    <P>Some of these are at the point of collapse from the combined effects of age and heavy traffic.  We may no longer be in a position to avail of opportunities for sewer renewal where street reconstruction is in progress.  In the redeployment of men from sewer reconstruction, there will be a loss of the skills and expertise in this area which has been built up over the years. If the funding situation was otherwise than it is we would make more provision for work of this nature.</P>
    <P>Of course it is very important that we receive money from the Regional Fund for that purpose.</P>
    <P>One of the main issues in relation to the environment is the quality of water in Dublin Bay.  We have a primary treatment service but to make it better we would need a secondary and tertiary treatment service.  We are also seeking funding for these services.  These are issues which involve local elected members.  We all have a great interest in the issues I have mentioned but we have not been consulted in any way in relation to these issues beyond the manager, out <Col N="1410" /> of courtesy, informing us of the proposals he was putting to the consultancy commission. It is regrettable that this should happen, that local authority members, when an application for extra funding from the EC is being made, should be completely denied any opportunity to make their own representations.</P>
    <P>I understand that up to now there has been a system of a £1 for £1 &mdash; for every £1 we spend we are supplemented by £1 from the EC Regional Fund and the ratio will be 75-25 in the near future.  The EC seem to be interested only in supporting the capital expenditure of local authority and Government services.  If Governments are not prepared to put money into certain services the EC Regional Fund will not provide any funding.</P>
    <P>I was speaking today to the assistant manager who is responsible for drawing up this plan for the city of Dublin.  He informs me that they have included housing, even though they feel that housing will not be included under the EC regulations. It is a serious issue.  For the past two years the Government have not sanctioned any layout for housing, either for inner city housing or for senior citizen accommodation in Dublin.  The Department of the Environment inform us that there are no finances available.  We have now reached the stage where there are a number of sites in the city awaiting redevelopment.  These can become derelict very quickly.  Dublin Corporation have now endorsed a plan for the sale of these sites.  This is very tragic.</P>
    <P>I hope that the economic policies of the Government &mdash; we on this side of the House support the thrust of their main economic policies &mdash; will result in greater economic prosperity in our country and will ease the emigration situation.  We now have 30,000 people leaving our country each year.  There is a cycle in this, as I saw in the fifties and sixties.  The same number of people were leaving in the fifties and they came back to a more prosperous Ireland in the sixties.  If this happens &mdash; and I hope it will &mdash; we will <Col N="1411" /> find ourselves with a need for a housing programme.  In the meantime we will have sold the sites.  I know the EC consider that we are well housed as a nation. Indeed, they would say that we do better than most countries, and we have done very well.  I hope the Government will be able to divert into that area some of the finances they will get from EC funds for other purposes I have mentioned.  That is an essential area and it has been neglected up to now.  The officials are entering housing as one of their priorities. Nevertheless we do not feel we will be all that successful.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt the ability of consultants and country management teams but they do not have a monopoly on wisdom or insight into what is required.  I believe the base for this consultation should be considerably widened to include local authority nembers, members of the business sector and members of the farming community.  Indeed, in not involving local authority members the Government may have created serious risks for Ireland's ability to secure maximum benefits from the doubling of the Structural Funds.  The effectiveness of the regional development programme must involve the strengthening of the role of local authorities. It is no coincidence that Denmark, which currently has the second highest national output per head of population, after Luxembourg, has followed the pattern of administrative decentralisation. There are now 273 local authorities and 14 regional authorities in the country, with a population of over five million.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of giving local authorities a more independent role in relation to public revenue as well as public expenditure.  It is only with financial autonomy that local authorities, as distinct from the central Exchequer, can have a meaningful partnership with EC Structural Funds.  That is the problem we have to address.  It is a problem the Government have so far failed to <Col N="1412" /> address.  As a result, we will put at risk some of the benefits we can get from the EC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking to the terms of the motion I have to take issue with the content and tone of the opening sentence:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann deplores the Government's handling of the preparation of plans for submission to the enlarged EC Regional Fund.</P>
      <P>I beg to suggest that the activity of this Administration, particularly in the past six months, has been a far greater and wider operation than we saw in four and a half years of the previous Administration. Indeed, the advent of 1992 and the implications for this country were very clearly evident early in the decade.  In that context I could not agree with the content of the motion in that regard or, indeed, the reference in the latter part of the motion to the absence of effective local participation.</P>
      <P>At a recent foreign affairs council meeting common positions were finally agreed on the draft co-ordinating regulation and on the three draft implementing regulations for each of the Structural Funds.  Subject to consultation with the European Parliament the way is now clear for this new regime to come into effect on 1 January next.  The regional development plan for Ireland will have to be submitted by 31 March.  I understand that the Government's aim is to submit the operational programmes simultaneously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impressive to note the importance and, indeed, the priority attached to this area by the Government, contrary to the terms of the motion.  They are ensuring that we will maximise our entitlements from the doubling in the size of the Structural Funds which will be used to equip our economy to compete successfully in the internal market, providing badly <Col N="1413" /> needed jobs and contributing to narrowing the gap between our living standards and those in the more prosperous regions of the Community.  In that respect the Government are to be congratulated on the fact that they have battled long.  I also pay tribute to the previous Administration in that they have always looked after the interests of Ireland to the best of their ability.  The reality is that what is coming on-stream now is a result of intense and successful negotiations during the past 12 to 18 months.</P>
    <P>In regard to questions that have been raised about the geographical boundaries of the seven sub-national programme areas as well as on the composition and roles of the working groups and the advisory groups, it should be emphasised that decisions on these matters were taken by the Government only after the fullest consideration of all the issues involved as well as having secured the agreement of the social partners to these arrangements through the Central Review Committee on the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>Time is short.  The year 1992 is but three years away and the pressing need now is to make rapid progress in preparing high quality programmes to tackle the development needs of the various areas, none more than my own area. The Border counties, now designated as region six, are in pressing and urgent need of the implementation of the plans to be put forward to Europe.  The composition of the advisory groups reflects the need for balanced representation of various interests and areas.  It is the view of the Government that it is not possible to add to representation on the advisory groups without upsetting the delicate balance or making the membership, already reasonably large, so numerous as to make the groups too unwieldy to be effective.</P>
    <P>I am sure all sides of the House and public opinion in general would agree that this Government, or indeed any other administration, could be justifiably <Col N="1414" /> criticised if they were to set up yet another quango that was going to enlarge itself out of proportion to the point where decisions that are urgent and immediate would not be taken because of vacillation due to the large numbers involved on a committee.  That is not an anti-democratic stance; it is a practical point of view.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the boundaries is also similar in that it is not arbitrary. They were settled with a view to grouping together counties, or parts of counties, having regard to geography, population, previous administrative divisions, common concerns and economic structures.  No matter how the Government grouped areas it would not be possible to satisfy all parties.  The important thing now is to advance preparation of the programmes and arguments over boundaries will not promote this.  Here again there is a strange fatalistic attitude in Ireland in that, whenever ideas are put forward out of which should come benefit for our people, the first thing we do is to pick holes in them.  Within Europe we must be seen to be united in our approach towards maximising the amount of money which will come to this country from the Structural Funds.  While valid and constructive criticism is always welcome, in this instance on such an important issue there should be unanimity of approach and of purpose.</P>
    <P>At this stage the various sub-national areas defined are simply for the purposes of these operational programmes for submission to the Community Structural Funds.  They do not have any other administrative implication.  For example, they do not mean that Louth will cease to benefit from any special programme for Border areas.  Louth and Sligo have been exlcuded from section 6 which covers the Border counties.  Yet for cross-Border funding and for ongoing funding of Border areas, Louth would obviously be included and rightly so.  Longford is another case in point.  It will not cease to be regarded as a less-developed county <Col N="1415" /> for the purposes of schemes in which it has hitherto been included.  These matters are settled.  Subject to that, the views of locally elected representatives in the regions will be taken into account through their membership of the advisory groups.  That is a two-tier system, as most people now know, and there is no question that elected public representatives are being denied access.</P>
    <P>I understand that county managers, who are the main advisory group, are reporting back to their locally elected representatives on a regular monthly or bi-monthly basis, depending on the number of meetings being held.  If, for example, there are some county managers who are not reporting back to their local authorities, or if the information that is being discussed and decided at advisory group level is not percolating down to some local authorities, that is not the fault of the system.  Rather it is the fault of the officials involved.  In County Leitrim the county manager has been most meticulous in ensuring that the locally elected representatives on the council are kept fully informed of the developments in relation to the integrated programmes.</P>
    <P>Specific arrangements have been introduced to ensure effective working and liaison arrangements for this purpose between the advisory groups and the working groups so that the latter will take fully into account the ideas of the advisory groups which I now encourage all the groups to put forward as early as possible.  As I said at the outset, 31 March is the deadline here and obviously time is of the essence.  The advisory groups are also totally free to receive and consider submissions from all relevant sources within the regions and, after assessing them, to transmit those they consider worthy of priority to the working group with their own comments.  Indeed, they should be encouraged to engage in such a consultative process but it will have to be pressed forward rapidly in view of <Col N="1416" /> the time constraint set by Community regulations.</P>
    <P>Again, I have to refer to my own area here.  All of the Border counties have suffered badly on an economic level down through the years.  We see the proper and effective implementation of the working groups and the ongoing submissions to Europe and the subsequent funding from the Structural Funds as being imperative to the future viability of our county and the counties surrounding us.</P>
    <P>The suggestions that the views of elected representatives are either being ignored or are not adequately provided for are, in the context of what I have said up to now, totally without foundation. In that context I could not accept the wording of the motion:</P>
    <P>... the absence of effective local participation and the virtual exclusion of elected representatives from this process,</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no participation by local authority elected members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made the point that there is a two-tier system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mooney should be allowed to make his contribution without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what Senator Doyle is attempting to suggest but I suggest to him that it is untrue and totally without foundation.  I have tried to bring the Senator through the various component parts of this new operation and pointed out to him that there is a direct linkage between the locally elected representatives through the county manager on to the advisory group.  If some county managers are not getting the message or the message is not precolating down to the local representatives, that is hardly the fault of the system.  Surely the Senator is not suggesting that these advisory groups should be so top heavy and unwieldly that they are going to result <Col N="1417" /> in vacillation and time wasting.  Time is of the essence here and it is in that context that I made the point.</P>
      <P>A wide range of sectional interest groups are involved with development issues and are represented on the advisory groups.  Indeed, the Government have gone much further in this area than is necessary under EC regulations &mdash; and I make that point to Senator Doyle.  They have done it deliberately in line with the stance and consultations and involvement which they are pursuing at national level with a view to ensuring that local knowledge and experience are drawn on and utilised to the full.  Since September there has been a seminar on each working day somewhere in this country devoted to 1992, to the regional Structural Funds and to the implications for Ireland and for the various regions.  That hardly smacks of lack of preparation.</P>
      <P>Also, the awareness of the general public and, more important at this point, the business community, is highlighted by the fact that, as a result of the Government's advances in this area and their activities in this area to inform as wide a grouping as possible, a survey carried out by Stokes Kennedy Crowley earlier this year indicated that over 50 per cent of the business community was aware of 1992 and the implications for Irish business. That hardly smacks of unawareness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they are.  That is all I say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Senator that he should look at other statistics in this area of awareness.  Over 17,000 leaflets have been sent out by the secretariat in response to queries from the general public and from the business community.  That hardly smacks of a lack of awareness or preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the whole question of advisory groups and the whole process involved there will be no rigid directives laid down in Dublin with which the <Col N="1418" /> regions will have to comply.  Provision has been made for interaction between preparation of the national development plan and that of the sub-national operational programmes and also for input from the sub-national areas into those operational programmes which will be drawn up at national level such as that for the strategic roads network.  Again, I welcome this as one who comes from rural Ireland.  I can understand Senator Doyle's point of view because I know the roads are excellent in the area from which he comes in Dublin and there are no difficulties in that respect.  I have every confidence that the advisory groups and subsequently the Government and the coordinator of this European Structural Fund programme, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, will ensure that we get substantial and adequate funding for our roads network.  I am sure Senator Doyle can hardly criticise that.</P>
    <P>With the advisory groups getting down to work the arrangements are now in place for the preparation of our sub-national programmes. I would like to avail of this opportunity to wish those groups every success in their work.  I am confident that we can rely on them all to give of their best.  We encourage them to take a view transcending the individual counties.  I would be the first to concede that while I am very anxious that Leitrim should get perhaps more than any other county is getting, in the context of the motion we are addressing here and the whole question of EC structural funding, it is important to remember that, in the regional set-up that has now been put in place, there is real hope for counties that are economically disadvantaged and that they will now be part of an integrated regional operation rather than having to look for something in their own areas.  I have every confidence that, within the next few years, the roads and, in particular roads in the Border counties will benefit greatly from the implementation of the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>I would like to take issue with many of <Col N="1419" /> the points made in the motion.  I think I have attempted fairly and honestly to point out certain flaws in its approach and I am sure Senator Doyle and Senators on the other side of the House will join with the Government and with all of us to ensure that the very best deal is got for Ireland in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is very carefully worded.  If Senator Mooney had studied the wording of the motion &mdash; which he may have done &mdash; he would have noted that it says:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann deplores the Government's handling of the preparation of plans for submission to the enlarged EC Regional Fund and in particular the secrecy surrounding these preparations, the absence of effective local participation and the virtual exclusion of elected representatives from this process.</P>
      <P>That is what the motion is about.  Senator Mooney can rightly say that great work has been done in the past three months, and we recognise that.  Our contention, in putting down that motion, was that this work should have been going on for the past two years.  Time is of the essence now, as he says, but we are deploring the fact that valuable time was lost in preparing plans for submission for programmes to be included in this scheme. I will deal with that more thoroughly in my submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enlarged regional fund is the bringing together of the current FEOGA Guidance Fund, the Social Fund and the Regional Fund.  The income to Ireland from these three funds in the current year is about £300 million.  That amount is proposed to be doubled under this new proposed enlarged regional fund.  That is £600 million a year over a five-year planning period and that amounts to the spending of £3 billion.  I submit, as this motion declares, that the Government's handling of the proposed regional fund <Col N="1420" /> left a lot to be desired.  It should have been obvious to the Government that a new regional development plan would be necessary when the Single European Act became law early in 1987.  In fact, that was the first legislation passed by this Seanad.  I remember that clearly because we sat in the Dáil for the first time and I made my maiden speech on the Single European Act.  From the time that became law after it was passed by the Seanad, the Government should have been aware of the situation and should have set in motion more than a year and nine months ago what is in the motion now.</P>
    <P>The enlarged regional fund has been set up to give disadvantaged countries such as Portugal, Spain and Ireland a chance to catch up on the more developed countries before the open market in 1992 when we will have a united Europe.  The year 1992 will cause massive problems for Ireland when the barriers are removed, border tax is eliminated and common VAT rates will apply.  It is estimated that this could cost Ireland £430 million in the first year and about £350 million each year after that.  The danger that I see with the new enlarged regional fund is that some powers in the EC may try to tell us that our loss is being made up by the enlarged regional fund.  The Government should be alert to this and should not allow it to be part of the argument about what Ireland will get from the enlarged regional fund.</P>
    <P>In 1993, when the tunnel linking Britain to the Continent is completed, we will be the only island in the Community. This will place us at a serious disadvantage as against our European partners and we should and must ensure that we be compensated for this.  We will not be compensated without having viable programmes before the EC for the correct funds.  We cannot do this unless plans are ready and submitted by our Government. We should submit plans for our tourism and food processing industries. These are areas where Ireland can have <Col N="1421" /> a special advantage over our competitors in Europe.</P>
    <P>The potential market for our tourism industry is unlimited.  In fact, we are about the only country in Europe now where salmon and trout can still be fished in rivers and lakes.  Let us promote, encourage and sell these assets.  This debate here tonight is reminiscent of a debate which took place on the Adjournment of the Seanad before Christmas last year.  We had practically the same speakers then.  Senator Mooney and I spoke when the famous rod licence Bill was introduced.  I implore the Minister for the Marine to repeal this rod licence which has already cost our country and, in particular, Counties Galway and Mayo, as the Minister of State will be aware.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always willing to accept assistance from whatever quarter I get it.  To get back to the preparation <Col N="1422" /> of plans, I visited Brussels earlier this year and I was amazed to discover that Ireland is way behind all other member countries in having planned programmes submitted for consideration for the enlarged regional fund.  At that stage other member states had programmes already submitted.  We are now at the stage where the regional committees are drawing up programmes which have to be submitted to the Department of Finance and which will eventually have to be submitted before March.  Other countries have got a head start on us.  Despite the fact that March 1989 is the latest date for the submission of programmes for grants, it is astonishing that only now are the Government making real moves to establish suitable programmes.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been divided into seven regions and each of these regions have to agree and submit programmes which, in turn, will be sent to the Department of Finance for final sanction.  Our region in the west consists of Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon and it is only in the past month that a body has been set up to produce programmes.  They met in the last month for the first time.  We have had only one preliminary report back from our county manager, as the Minister of State here would know, at a recent council meeting.  It is only now that we have a chance to have any input into this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is all despite the fact that the Government were aware for two years that such a planned programme was necessary.  Mr. Jacques Delors, President of the EC Commission, has been urged to postpone consideration of Ireland's claim for aid because nobody has been given a proper opportunity to submit projects or make submissions in the inclusion of projects. By that I mean county councils, community councils, the general public and people involved in projects that might be submitted as part of the programmes. Our outgoing Irish Commissioner, Mr. Peter Sutherland, has tried to draw attention to the fact &mdash; that this is a very crucial point &mdash; that there <Col N="1423" /> will be no longer be national quotas of any kind for aid from the Structural Fund. Instead, it is the quality of the plans submitted to Brussels that will count in the end.  This is vital.</P>
    <P>We now have to have our plans on paper.  No longer can we go to Brussels with a sort of begging bowl attitude and say: &ldquo;Ireland must get this and that.&rdquo;  We must have submitted our plans in advance so that we can make up some ground on the countries that are ahead of us.  Do the Government think that a proper programme to spend £3 billion over five years can be prepared in a matter of months? What have we been doing for the past year and a half or so?</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the structure of the regional committees set up.  This is our biggest bone of contention as indicated in the motion, despite what Senator Mooney has said.  The committee in our region of Galway, Mayo and Roscommon consists of 17 people, three county managers, one from each county, about seven regional heads of Government agencies in our area and six senior people from the Department of Finance &mdash; probably all fine people in their own right.  I know a number of them but I am sure they have the interests of the region at heart and that they will submit proper and correct plans.</P>
    <P>What about the case for local democracy? None of those people is answerable to the electorate.  None of them has to be elected and, more important, none of them has to offer himself or herself for re-election &mdash; another indication of the Government's lack of commitment to local councils.  I am a local representative on two local authorities.  We have had no opportunity to have any say in the drawing up of the programmes.  I have to take this opportunity to put on the record, as Senator Mooney did, projects that I think should be included in the programmes for our region.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will be aware that there is a programme <Col N="1424" /> in which I have a deep interest.  I brought it to the attention of Galway County Council when I was first elected there in 1974.  This is a proposal for a bridge crossing of the Corrib at its narrowest point, Knockferry on the western side to Kilbeg on the eastern side, a crossing of approximately 350 yards which would save a round journey of 40 miles.  I am sure the Minister would be most willing to help in this matter.  Both sides of the Corrib at that location are in my county council electoral area.  That is not why I am bringing the matter up here.  A bridge crossing at that point, which would be the most suitable project for inclusion in an overall programme for the three counties, would open up entire new areas of county Galway, both east and west and Connemara, in particular, to the tourism industry.  It would open up east Galway from the point of view of agricultural and local tourism development also.  It would be an advantage to the marts on the eastern side of the Corrib and to the proposed new marts which we hope to build in Maam Cross.  It would open up a new area for that also.</P>
    <P>That is a project that is readymade. It would be of advantage to Galway.  It would also give an advantage to the other counties in the region &mdash; Mayo and Roscommon &mdash; because it would be no harm to bring down the Roscommon people to see Connemara as they go on to play golf.  I do not know whether my colleague, Senator Connor, plays golf but he will be welcome to cross that new bridge when we open it as a result of including it in a programme for the Structural Fund.</P>
    <P>We will include a couple more items which I believe should be included.  For example, schemes worth £75 million for sanitary services are ready and available in Galway County Council.  They could be submitted.  These are schemes like the Oranmore sewerage scheme &mdash; at an estimated cost of £3 million &mdash; a regional water supply scheme &mdash; at an estimated <Col N="1425" /> cost of £6 million &mdash; and the ClifdenTully-Letterfrack regional water scheme &mdash; at an estimated cost of £5 million. Plans and programmes are already waiting for those.  I am suggesting that they should be included in the submission.</P>
    <P>We have £10 million worth of schemes ready and planned for roads in County Galway, the completion of the Oranmore-Galway eastern approach road, an amount on regional road works in Connemara and strategic county roads in Connemara.  All these programmes are ready and are ideal projects for inclusion in an overall programme.  There should be a plan for tourism development in Connemara, development of our islands, a roll on &mdash; roll off ferry service to the Aran Islands at an estimated cost of £3 million.  We have plans ready for that also.  I was in communication with the Minister already about that scheme. There is the development of Inis Thiar &mdash; Kilmurvey pier badly needs development &mdash;and that could also be included.  In our region we must make the case that of the three counties concerned, we in Galway have the island with the largest population.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that another very important aspect in our region would be the protection of the environment. New problems are beginning to arise with the advancement of fish farming and aquaculture developments.  We want more research into that.  This would be an ideal project to submit for grant-aid under this scheme whereby we could set up testing locations and so on.</P>
    <P>All in all, it is a pity that we did not get a chance two years ago rather than in the past three months to now make our submissions.  This is the first real chance I have got to make any submission.  I am very glad that the Leas-Chathaoirleach has given me an opportunity to make submissions at this level, even though we will have to transfer them from here to the committee that is dealing with this matter in our region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to draw attention to the fact that, if we look back at regional policy and the history of regional policy in this country, it has been a disaster because all the wrong kind of thinking and very often the wrong kind of information went into making up these policies.  There was never real consultation with the people to whom regional policy was to be delivered or on whom it would have direct effects.  The Single European Act in many ways replaces and certainly complements the Treaty of Rome.  I found it interesting to listen to Senator Mooney talking about all the positive developments which have taken place in the past year and a half, coinciding with the coming into power of the present Government who went somewhat out of their way to decry what had been done by the previous Coalition Government.  I have to remind Senator Mooney &mdash; and he is not here now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pity that on such an important motion &mdash; to which I put down my name &mdash; I am speaking to empty benches.  Nevertheless I want to remind Senator Mooney that his party opposed the Single European Act for the most rubbishy of reasons, I would say. They trotted out all the old nonsense about sovereignty etc.  in the latter part of 1987 when the legislation giving effect to it here in Ireland was in both these Houses and his party opposed it.  Then we had to have a referendum on it, not related to Fianna Fáil opposition may I say, but related to action in one of our higher courts.  When one listens to the kind of argument he made people need to be reminded of their history and of their very recent history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I began to make was that the Single European Act strengthens the Treaty which binds all the member states <Col N="1427" /> together in a way that was not done in the original Treaty of Rome.  There is a very confirmed Common Market or European Market.  That, to me, certainly was badly needed and very beneficial and it will continue to be beneficial in the future.</P>
    <P>Under the title &ldquo;Economic and Social Cohesion&rdquo;, the Single European Act states:</P>
    <P>In order to promote its overall harmonious development, the Community shall develop and pursue its actions leading to the strengthening of its economic and social cohesion.  In particular, the Community shall aim at reducing disparities between the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions.</P>
    <P>One can see there, at the very outset, that the basic principle set down is to direct resources away from areas that are well favoured into areas that are relatively less well favoured.  That is the basic principle of what we adopted when this country became, with all our partners in Europe, a part of and a party to this new Treaty which we call the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>The Commission, in turn, makes five basic proposals to that aim set down and I will read them for the benefit of the House:</P>
    <P>(i)  Achieving growth and adaptation in structurally backward regional economies, so that they can be fully integrated into the Community.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Converting declining industrial regions by helping them to develop new activities.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Combating long term unemployment:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is very important in Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(iv)  Integrating young people into employment, especially first jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> (v)  Assisting the adjustment of agricultural structures and the development of rural areas.</P>
    <P>I submit to the House that there is no way that we can develop a policy to cover all of those five very worthy aims unless we involve the people in the regions whom they will affect directly.  Let us say that has not been the history.  That is the very first point I make.  My party would take some share of the blame for that too.  I am one of those who never believed that Ireland should have been taken as a single region for aid under the regional policy, so-called, as it commenced in about 1985.  The whole island of Ireland was taken as one region and we applied the policies here as if there were no disparity between the east and the west. Of course there is major disparity.  At every economic level of activity there is major disparity between the level of disposable income on the eastern side and the level of disposable income in all regions roughly west of the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>We are repeating the same mistake because whatever we say about these advisory groups, they are only talking shops.  There is no commitment that the Department of Finance would take on board and implement what they advise. There is a piece of tokenism, saying to them: &ldquo;Right, we will take you in; we will listen to what you have to say&rdquo;.  Many of the people, especially the people in the working party &mdash; that is the one dominated by the senior civil servants &mdash; lack the necessary background.  I have nothing against senior civil servants but by the very fact of their calling, their very attitudes &mdash; and they live here in Dublin&mdash; they have no perception of what is good for or what the difficulties and the major problems of economic backwardness are in the declining regions which we have in so many parts of this country.</P>
    <P>The only way in which there can be a meaningful input by these advisory committees is that when they advise their <Col N="1429" /> advice is taken.  Under the present set up and structure that cannot happen.  I suggest to the House that, given our history in these matters, it will not happen, because the mandarins in Merrion Street, across the road from here, will have the final say.  I say that from experience and nobody inside or outside this House will deny it.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at the history of the regional fund since its implementation going back to about 1975.  I referred to how we implemented policies here.  The principle behind the regional fund &mdash; not alone Community-wide but within the nations and countries &mdash; was to help areas that were not in a position to help themselves.  In other words, if resources are transferred from the European Commission to Ireland under the heading of regional development, they should, by and large, be spent in areas that need the greatest level of help.  That did not happen in Ireland purely and simply because we operated this one-region policy within our own borders.</P>
    <P>I read in a report compiled and prepared by the office of the European Commission here in Dublin that in the years 1976 to 1985 the amount of moneys under the ERDF spent in the region where I live &mdash; and I live in what would be called the midlands, which consists of the counties of Roscommon, Longford, Westmeath, Offaly and Laois &mdash; was 13.3 million ECUs which were spent under the heading of industrial development. Under the heading of infrastructure &mdash; that is roads, water, sewage, etc. &mdash; the amount of money spent was 24.15 million ECUs over that 12 years.  The average value of an ECU over those 12 years was about 77p at current values.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at what the Eastern region got.  I do not subscribe to an east-west divide in Ireland but I always make the point that there are areas relatively well off and areas very badly off in this country.  The east region consists of the counties of Meath, Kildare, Wicklow and Dublin and under the heading of <Col N="1430" /> industrial development they succeeded in getting 79.65 million ECUs in those 12 years and under the heading of infrastructural development they got 163.34 million ECUs.  That illustrates, very graphically I suggest to the House, the policy of not applying regional policy in the way it was meant to apply, certainly by the people who originally framed it in the early seventies.  Its real genesis was there in the Treaty of Rome but the major policy was the one on the Common Agricultural Policy and the policy governing coal and steel.</P>
    <P>I often wonder, too, how much thought goes into the structure and distribution of the population here on this island when we come to making these policies.  It is interesting to note that 46 per cent of the people of Ireland live in rural areas &mdash; the highest in Europe.  Only 22 per cent of our population live in towns and I mean by towns centres with 2,000 people or more.  Thirty-three per cent of our people live in cities; and I mean by cities centres of population with 100,000 people or more living there.  It is interesting to note that by that yardstick there are only two cities in Ireland, Dublin and Cork. Using that yardstick, there are about 35 cities in Italy, there are about 60 cities in Germany and I understand that there are about 48 cities in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>We have borrowed the application of regional policy.  The way we made up our minds about these things and the way we put them into final policy was very much taken from the thinking that went into the regional policy made for the British midlands, because that was a declining industrial area in the sense that it had been one of the major industrial areas in the last century and at the turn of this century.  The same was true of the Ruhr and the same would be true also of northern Italy.  The regional development policies that we evolved, not only evolved but indeed applied, had very much of the thinking behind the regional development policies that were tailored for those areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> Again at the end of the day it was a case of the mandarins who make these policies for us not listening to us, not listening to the people who really matter and who were going to be afected by these policies, but taking the easy option of looking at another example that had no relevance at all to our problems and applying broadly or roughly speaking the principles of what they saw elsewhere because that was the easiest way out of it.  That has been a disaster because we have all of these regional imbalances and they are worse in this country than in any other member state.  We cannot remind ourselves often enough of that fact.  Yet we come to this crucial time again &mdash; and I do not wish to be repetitive in the House &mdash; when as and from 1 January we will get an opportunity to change these policies in the sense that the aids we are to get will be doubled under three headings.</P>

They also foresee the problems, which is very important when you are making <Col N="1432" /> policy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The funds to be enlarged come under three headings &mdash; the European Farm Fund, as under the guidance section, the Regional Fund and the Social Fund.  It is interesting if you look back over the past 12 years.  Ireland was approved for grant assistance under the Regional Fund to the value of £825 million in 12 years.  Actually, we took up only £586 million purely and simply because Governments were not willing to put up the necessary finance to carry these programmes through a system of 50:50. Under the Social Fund, a major area of industrial training, we did very well over 12 years and especially over the last six years when that really became meaningful. An amount of over £1 billion was approved for this country and we took up over 90 per cent of that.  They estimate that around £962 million has been taken up over the past 12 years, and most of that over the past six years, especially in the area of industrial training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the guidance section of the FEOGA funds over 12 years we were approved for something like £557.2 million and it is estimated that we took up around 95 per cent of that.  If you make up the total of these programmes for <Col N="1433" /> 1987, which is the last year we have figures for, they came to nearly £300 million, and by 1992 they are supposed to be £300 million.  If we are approved for £300 million for this very badly needed development in 1992 we should be there to pick up every last cent of that £300 million and not be losing 10 per cent or 20 per cent of it as in the area of the Regional Fund where we are losing up to 20 per cent of it.</P>

      <P>I speak to the motion:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann deplores the Government's handling of the preparation of plans for submission to the enlarged EC Regional Fund and in particular the secrecy surrounding these preparations, the absence of effective local participation and the virtual exclusion of elected representatives from this process.</P>
      <P>At the outset of my very brief intervention I should like to point out clearly that this motion is not tabled in any way to appear controversial; it is certainly not vexatious and it is not being pressed.  We want to use this opportunity to highlight our fears as perceived from our vantage points in the different parts of this country. We hope the Minister and his Department will take these points on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleagues, speaking here tonight from different regions of the country, have highlighted the situation as they see it from the administrative areas in which they live.  The situation in the south midlands in my constituency does not appear to be any different.  As a former president of the regional policy committee of the European Communities and as one who during the establishment of the initial regional fund worked very closely with Commissioner Sir George Thompson, now Lord Thompson of Dundee, I can say that during the seventies I had the <Col N="1434" /> opportunity to visit every one of the classified regions in the Community of Nine.</P>
    <P>I accept that it is not possible to have a direct input from every one of the disadvantaged areas and from every one of the regions right across the Community of Twelve.  But I believe we should make the best of the opportunity there.  I have on many occasions and in many speeches in this House in recent years &mdash; and not just under the present Government, I hasten to add &mdash; expressed my unease at the power the Minister's Department gradually usurped to themselves, especially under this arrangement.  We who tabled this motion feel it is a pity that in ordering the priorities for the economic development of infrastructures in the various counties the views of the local representatives are not taken into account. Nobody will contest the fact that local representatives of all parties and of no party are very close to the reality on the ground and to deprive these representatives of a meaningful input, of an opportunity to order their own priorities for infrastructural development in their own counties is not the proper way to set about the development of our country and it is not the most advantageous way of utilising the funds, now that we are told they are going to be doubled and made more available.  That is a problem, and I lay the problem, fairly and squarely at the feet of the Department of Finance. Our Department of Finance, unlike any other Department in the EC, is all powerful; it is too strong and in most cases it is not answerable to anybody.  That is a pity. At this stage it should be split up into a budget Department, a Department to spend the money as well, so that there would be a distinct balance and check.</P>
    <P>If we had to give a Nobel Prize to the people who have managed to get very good value over the years from the European Community the Italians are the colleagues in Europe we should look at, because they know exactly how to extend <Col N="1435" /> the benefits of membership of the Community not only to every region but to every parish and corner of the Italian Republic.  It is very frustrating being a member of a local authority at present to say that a local councillor, irrespective of how many votes he gets or how many people stand behind him at election time, has not got the influence or the power even to fill a pothole.  I do not want to have a debate on potholes, but it has gone to such a pitch that the Government say now that because the local authorities are not able to control or raise their own finances they must always be dictated to from on high.</P>
    <P>That is going in the wrong direction from a democratic point of view.  I do not wish to be political when I say that, because the last Government promised to bring in local government reform and they spent four years and were not able to produce meaningful reform.  I hope that the same process is going on.  It needs to be done.  It is nonsense being a member of a local authority at present.  Local authorities should either be scrapped altogether or they should be given a role with an input.  There is not much point in looking at the situation on a county basis, having an input there and then finding that no matter what goes up for sanction it is decided by the Department of the Environment, whose finances are controlled by the Department of Finance. They just put the pen through developments they do not want, whether it is on a percentage basis or whatever.  If that continues we are not going to maximise the benefits available from the European Regional Development Fund.  We need to be able to maximise those benefits if we are to get this country in line to keep our place in the development after 1992.</P>
    <P>With those few comments I would just like to say that I hope the Minister and the Government will be able to take on board some of the views expressed in the debate last week and this afternoon and to see in what way we can bring a little <Col N="1436" /> more democracy into this great and most important development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a wide-ranging debate in the Seanad this evening and last Wednesday on the new arrangements applicable to EC Structural Funds. I would like to commend Senators for their contributions to the debate which reveal a worthy concern that Ireland should maximise the opportunities which the enlarged funds will present and also, if I may say so, a grasp of the details of the new arrangements and their implications which cuts across some of the accusations which are the substance of the motion before the Seanad.  Bearing this in mind, I shall confine my remarks on the actual arrangements to a very brief summary of the main features and then deal with the main points made in the debate.</P>
      <P>The EC regulations which will apply include a framework regulation adopted in June last and a set of four implementing regulations which have only been agreed at Council level in the last few weeks.  A new set of procedures for the operation of the Structural Funds is envisaged.  The use of the funds is to be planned on a multi-annual basis.  The first stage is for each region to draw up a development plan.  Since Ireland is one region for Structural Fund purposes, this development plan will be at national level and it is likely to cover the period 1989-1993. It will set out our priorities for expenditure in the areas which can be assisted by the Structural Fund resources. The EC Commission will consider this plan and determine the extent to which it is willing to provide assistance from the Structural Funds.  This will be set out in what is to be called the Community Support Framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final stage is the programmes which will set out in detail how the objectives set out in the plan will be implemented.  These will be submitted by the national authorities and will have to be approved by the Commission. <Col N="1437" /> The administrative arrangements which have been adopted for the preparation and co-ordination of the sub-regional programmes are as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  A committee of Minister and departmental secretaries, chaired by the Taoiseach, will have responsibility for overseeing the implementation of new Structural Fund arrangements.</P>
    <P>(2)  Seven working groups are preparing the operational programme for each of seven sub-regions designated by the Government.  These groups are representative of the relevant Government Departments, assisted as appropriate by the relevant State bodies, together with the management of all county councils and county borough corporations in the sub-region.  The EC Commission may also be involved but have not yet nominated their representatives. I might say that in drawing up these programmes the working groups are drawing upon and building upon the excellent work which has been carried out at local level over the years by local authorities, regional development organisations and other bodies.  They are also considering, where relevant, Border and cross-Border requirements of their areas in relation to the programmes.</P>
    <P>(3)  The working groups are being assisted in the task of preparing the operational programmes by advisory groups which comprise nominees of all the main representative bodies with an interest in development &mdash; CII, CIF, Chambers of Commerce, one to represent all in the sub-region, ICTU, FUE, IFA, ICMSA, ICOS and Macra na Feirme &mdash; as well as the county councils, county borough corporations, borough corporations and urban district councils over 15,000 population in the sub-region which are represented by the chairperson in each case.</P>
    <P>These advisory groups will have an opportunity to comment on the programmes as they are being prepared by the working groups.  They will also accept <Col N="1438" /> submissions from interested persons and groups and, on the basis of such submissions and their own thinking, will make recommendations to the working group on the content of the programmes. Any groups wishing to make submissions can send them to the Department of Finance, Merrion Street, for transmission to the appropriate group.  There will be scope for feedback from the sub-national programmes to the national development plan and the national programmes and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>The Government gave careful consideration to the composition of these groups in order to ensure the widest representation possible of local authority councillors and interest groups while maintaining the groups at a workable size.  Under the arrangements adopted the chairpersons of no fewer than 43 local authorities are directly represented on the advisory groups.  This figure includes a number who are also Senators.</P>
    <P>It will be evident from these arrangements that locally elected representatives can participate fully in the preparation of the programmes.  Apart from the direct involvement of council chairpersons in the advisory groups, other local representatives have an opportunity to influence the preparation of programmes by making their own submissions to the groups.  They are also in a position to influence their councils' submissions and to convey their views to the relevant city or county manager as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The operational programmes will have to be consistent with each other and also with the national plan.  To ensure this, final responsibility for the content of the plan and the various programmes will rest with the Government.  I would like to stress that the need to ensure consistency is the main reason why the Government have had to assume this role although, clearly, Government intervention would be necessary if programmes submitted were unrealistic or did not tackle the important issues.  Given the membership of the groups preparing the programmes, <Col N="1439" /> it is not envisged that such problems will arise.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have referred to deadlines for the preparation of the plan and programmes for the submission of proposals for consideration.  The 31 March 1989 is the date specified in the relvant EC regulation for submission of the plan.  Strictly speaking, the operational programmes do not have to be submitted at the same time as the plan. There are, however, compelling practical reasons for having the plan and programmes prepared and submitted simultaneously. These arise from the need for co-ordination already mentioned, but more particularly from the need to ensure that there is continuity in the receipt of Structural Funds assistance.  Ireland does not have an array of ongoing programmes receiving EC Structural Funds aid.  Continuity of funding would, therefore, be jeopardised if the Commission took the full six month period allowed to them for this purpose to agree the Community's support framework and there was also a delay in submitting programmes.</P>
    <P>The chairpersons and secretariat of the working group have been provided by the Department of Finance.  The advisory groups are also being provided with a secretary but they are to select their own chairpersons.  This process has been completed in all but one of them.  It was necessary to second some staff to the Department of Finance from other parts of the Civil Service to enable all the secretaries required to be provided.  This arose because spare staff resources were not otherwise available.  I might add that the main role of the secretaries is to provide a secretarial service to the groups, a task which is well within the competence of all of them.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised concerning the geographical boundaries of the seven sub-national programmes areas adopted. I should emphasise that decisions on these, and indeed the other arrangements adopted, were taken by the Government <Col N="1440" /> only after the fullest consideration of all the issues involved as well as having secured the agreement of the social partners to the arrangements through the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The boundaries are settled with a view to grouping together counties or parts of counties having regard to geography, population, previous administrative divisions, common concerns and economic structures.</P>
    <P>I should stress that these sub-national areas were defined simply for the purposes of preparing operational programmes for submission to the Community Structural Funds.  They do not have other administrative implications. Louth, for example, continues to be treated as a Border county and will benefit from any special programmes for Border areas while Longford will continue to be regarded as a less-developed county for the purposes of schemes in which it has hitherto been included.  Similarly, in the case of the Dublin sub-region the fear that is has been cut off from a large part of its hinterland is without foundation.  The co-ordination process mentioned will ensure that the programmes will fit with the objectives of the national plan and with each other.</P>
    <P>In reply to a number of specific questions posed during the debate, the position is as follows: The Government have responsibility for co-ordinating the preparation of the national development plan. The Department of Finance will handle the administrative aspects of this process. They will also be responsible for overseeing the utilisation of any EC funding provided.  The working groups will be considering the question of how the implementation of the sub-national operational programme will be supervised and monitored and will be including recommendations on this issue in their proposals.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to invitations issued to select bodies asking for their views.  I have not been able to trace the <Col N="1441" /> issue of invitations to any select bodies. The consultants engaged on the Dublin project did send a questionnaire to relevant Government Departments and State agencies but I think it would not be appropriate to refer to these bodies as select in the present context.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have sought clarification of the role of the Minister for the Environment in relation to the new Structural Funds arrangements.  In his speech in the Dáil on 24 November and in responding to parliamentary questions on 6 December, the Taoiseach indicated that he was giving the Minister for the Environment responsibility for planning and co-ordinating of the provision of physical infrastructure in the context of preparing the economy to compete in the more competitive circumstances of the Single Market.  The Minister will be expected to take an overview of the situation, ensure the comprehensive nature of our approach and identify and eliminate any duplication of facilities or the omission of basic requirements in particular areas.</P>
    <P>It will be his responsibility to see that the changes which are necessary take place without administrative delays as rapidly as possible and that developments in the different sectors are consistent with each other.  As indicated by the Taoiseach, the Minister's functions will relate to the physical infrastructure of the country which will occupy a very important and central part in our development effort.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance retains overall responsibility for the preparation of the national plan and the sub-national programmes.  This makes sense because European Community funds must be matched to the appropriate extent by expenditure from public funds here, though, of course, there will be a role for private funding as well.  The role of Minister of State for European Affairs remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>I would also like to comment on the suggestion that there has been excessive <Col N="1442" /> secrecy in relation to the new arrangements and the preparation of programmes. I find this suggestion difficult to understand.  The new arrangements which have been adopted governing the provision of EC Structural Funds assistance have been widely publicised by Ministers in addresses in different parts of the country over the past couple of months.  There have also been questions in the Dáil and an Adjournment debate there on the arrangements held on 1 December last.  As I have mentioned already, the quality of the debate on the matter here in the Seanad over the last two weeks and the knowledge shown by speakers of the arrangements adopted by the Government also suggest the proposition that there has been excessive secrecy is groundless.</P>
    <P>The administrative machinery set up, together with the opportunity being afforded for any interested party to make written submissions in connection with the preparation of operational programmes, will ensure very wide consultation with interested parties.  There are over 260 standing members of the working groups and the advisory groups who are directly involved in the process of preparing the programmes.  Among these are county managers who have indicated that they will be keeping members of their councils informed of developments.  I am sure reasonable people would agree that the overall effect of these arrangements must be to produce the most open approach to the preparation of these sub-national programmes which is practically possible.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed that Ireland will fail to maximise the opportunities presented by the enlarged Structural Funds. This has arisen because of doubts about our ability to meet the additionality requirement laid down in the EC regulations governing the funds due to the continuing requirement to cut back on public expenditure.  The level of EC assistance &mdash; called the intervention <Col N="1443" /> rate &mdash; which will be forthcoming for individual projects has also been mentioned in this context.  Again, however, there is no sound basis for these concerns.</P>
    <P>Additionality refers to the requirement that additional EC Structural Funds will result in at least corresponding additional national expenditure.  The text of the regulations as agreed requires that public expenditure on Structural Fund investment should at least be maintained, with the EC contribution being used to add to the overall volume.  From the point of view of the Public Capital Programme, we do not foresee any difficulties in meeting this requirement.  Allocations for the Public Capital Programme for 1989 and subsequent years will be set at a level sufficient to ensure that all the Structural Fund assistance available can be taken up.  In addition private sector, local and Community funds will, in certain circumstances, be eligible for matching funds from Brussels.  The Government also received commitments in the course of the negotiations on the new arrangements that aid from the Structural Funds for the least developed regions, among which all of Ireland is included, will be doubled by 1992.</P>
    <P>With regard to intervention rates, the maximum has been increased to 75 per cent with a minimum to 50 per cent except for revenue generating projects. Given the commitments that have been received in relation to the increased Structural Funds aid to be made available for Ireland as an Objective I region, it is evident that there will be a substantial increase in the rate of intervention.</P>
    <P>Suggestions that the allocation of funds to the various sub-regions will in the end be taken by the Government on the basis of political considerations reveals some misunderstanding as to how the process will operate.  The national plan and operational programmes prepared by the Government and the working groups will, as I have explained, set out the proposals for economic and social development throughout the country. <Col N="1444" /> The extent to which Structural Funds are to be provided by the Commission will be a matter for negotiation within the Community Support Framework.  These negotiations will determine types of development measures which the Community will support and the extent of that support.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have called for the introduction of a statutory entitlement for local authorities in relation to information on the content of programmes and for a statutory role in relation to implementation of the programmes.  The contemplation of such measures would be premature at this stage.  The whole process on which we are engaged is very much at an experimental stage both from the point of view of Brussels and in relation to the arrangements in this country. I am sure, however, that the practical steps which have been taken and are envisaged for keeping local authority members informed &mdash; I refer of course to the participation by councillors in the advisory groups and the involvement of county managers in the working groups &mdash; will ensure that all reasonable information needs will be met.</P>
    <P>I would not accept that there has been an inordinate delay in getting the machinery for preparing plans and programmes off the ground.  Much emphasis has been placed on the fact that the framework regulation was adopted in Brussels in June.  There has, however, been no mention that the implementing regulations which will govern the provision of Structural Funds have only just been cleared by the Council.  Recent discussions with the Commission indicate that they still have not worked out many of the details of how the new arrangements will operate. I am sure Senators will agree that the fact that the working groups and the advisory group have commenced their operations in a situation where all the requirements to be met have not been fully clarified is an indication of the urgency the Government attach to this task and a measure of the alacrity with <Col N="1445" /> which they have responded to the situation.</P>
    <P>It should be abundantly clear to any fair-minded person from this brief resumé of the facts that suggestions that the views of elected representatives are either being ignored or are not adequately provided for are totally without foundation.  The Government have gone much further in this area than is necessary under EC regulations.  They have done this deliberately, in line with the stance on consultations and involvement which they are pursuing at national level, with a view to ensuring that local knowledge and experience is drawn on and utilised to the full.  I have also rebutted the unfounded allegations of secrecy and in the process have sought to cast additional light on aspects of the new arrangements on which Senators required clarification.</P>
    <P>With the arrangements now fully in place for the preparation of our sub-national programmes, I hope that public representatives generally will suspend further criticism of them and give the new processes an opportunity to function.  I am sure that, in due course, they will be proved to be effective and that they will produce results which are commensurate with the high expectations the projected increase in Structural Funds has engendered.</P>
    <P>I hope that outlines the situation in detail and I take this opportunity to wish all Senators a very happy Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for <Col N="1446" /> attending here this evening.  I requested this debate in the hope of creating further public awareness of the problem of organ donation and transplantation.  Most people I am sure will be aware of some acquaintance who has a medical problem that can only be cured by transplantation. Indeed, in Athlone two friends of mine are on a dialysis machine, one of them is on a home dialysis machine and the other travels three times a week to Beaumont Hospital in Dublin for his dialysis. Another acquaintance who lives in south Roscommon, in the Minister's constituency, also travels with that person to Dublin three times a week.  What all of those people have in common is the aspiration for a new lease of life in the form of a kidney transplant.</P>
      <P>Over the past 30 years we have been fortunate to have developed a very fine transplantation programme for heart transplants, liver transplants and, best of all, for kidney transplants.  In addition to these more well-known types of transplants is the cornea transplant programme which has restored vision to many people.  The kidney transplant programme, which is the largest in the long-established programme in Ireland, brings new life and vigour to those who were previously living with the strain associated with renal dialysis.  Benefits also, of course, accrue to the family and friends of those who receive kidney transplants and, through restored health, to the country at large.  None of these benefits could possibly accrue without the generosity and spirit of unselfishness which the donors and their relatives domonstrate in a manner which is seldom excelled in the field of altruism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The abilities of our health services and the professional staff who work in the service to adapt and apply the benefits of the newest and proven technologies and therapies must also be valued and praised. The success of the transplant service is very much dependent on the availability of donated organs from those who die.  It must clearly be a demonstrated <Col N="1447" /> wish on the part of each of us to be an organ donor by carrying a kidney donor card or a multi-organ donor card.  I understand that 75 kidney transplants were carried out last year.  There are 180 persons awaiting kidney transplants and this number is growing each year through a growth in the population requiring dialysis and the lack of suitable organs available for those awaiting transplantation.</P>
    <P>The numbers who might benefit from heart transplants are quite small at present.  About 12 persons might benefit from such transplants.  A similar position pertains in the area of potential liver transplants.  Obviously smaller numbers do not in any way lessen the desirability of or the need for an enhanced number of suitable organs being available to meet these needs.</P>
    <P>The development of a cornea transplant bank in Dublin is a further example of how we are keeping to the forefront in adapting technology to our needs.  Such a programme is most welcome and will be of enormous benefit to those 250 persons who at the moment could benefit from such a transplant.  However, the number of corneas available for transplant is limited and even more donors are needed.</P>
    <P>Ireland is fortunate in having very active voluntary movements who do excellent work in publicising the benefits that can be derived from people carrying organ donor cards.  The success which they have achieved can be measured by the fact that there are 1.5 million carriers of those donor cards.  This achievement is remarkable by the standards of any country and is indicative of their ability to ensure that the benefits which can be given through transplantation are understood by the general public.  What is now happening is that people who had kidney donor cards in the past are now holders of multi-donor cards &mdash; a development which will, I am sure prove very helpful, particularly in the area of cornea transplants. The multi-donor cards were <Col N="1448" /> recently launched with tremendous publicity and great assistance from the Minister for Health and important people in the public domain.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the issue of organ donations there is great need to ensure that the most up-to-date information is readily available to the national transplantation centre.  I understand that while we have a transplant co-ordinator for the kidney transplant programme, we do not have any formal national co-ordinating arrangements for the transplantation of all organs.  This is something the Minister might consider reviewing with a view to realising the benefit which would be attainable by the establishment of a national service dealing with all organ transplantations.  I know that we have developed good links with our English counterparts.  These have proved to be of great benefit in that any organs available for transplant which may become available which are not fit for Irish recipients can be made available throughout England and <i>vice versa</i>.  The Minister might see whether we could expand the benefits from this inter-country operation on a wider basis throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>It is important that we encourage people to carry donor cards and, in particular, that we ensure that the relatives of those who have died are aware of the benefits that can be given to other ill persons, even at a time of great stress and great trauma.  One of the concerns which might be expressed about the scheme is that the wishes of the individual might not be carried out.  While a person may well wish to donate organs we depend on the relatives of such a person to ensure that their wishes are carried out.  It is in this context that it might be desirable for the Minister to consider the establishment of some centralised type of register on which everyone's wishes would be recorded.  Perhaps it is time to firm up this aspect of organ donation on a legislative basis.</P>
    <P>The question of organ donation must be kept before the public.  It is desirable <Col N="1449" /> that the benefits and the use that can be made of organs should be centrally publicised in order to ensure that everyone understands the opportunities which are offered to mankind by organ donation.  Indeed, it is absolutely essential that the programme which the Irish Kidney Association and the Fight for Sight Campaign have established should be supported fully and perhaps added to by the activities of the health promotion unit of the Department of Health.  We should continue to provide appropriate information to the members of the various professions involved in dealing with this issue and keep it updated on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might consider establishing a permanent campaign to promote the donation of organs and also look at the information type campaigns directed at the public.  In the short term, I suggest that the Minister might consider writing to each of the eight health boards and requesting them to discuss this problem. In that way there would be immediate debate with the members present at the meetings and in turn the press would take it up so that, in one swoop, every provincial newspaper would write about this problem, thus creating the type of awareness I am looking for and to which we all aspire.  This would have beneficial effects down the line because it would go from the health board staff to the nurses to the medical personnel of the various health boards.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the debt of gratitude we owe to all those who carry organ donor cards and to the families of those who give their consent for the use of organs at a difficult time for the betterment of mankind.  I hope this debate will encourage those who do not carry an organ donor card to do so from now on and so ensure that the supply of suitable organs is increased for those vital lifesaving transplants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my gratitude to Senator Fallon for affording me an <Col N="1450" /> opportunity to speak in this debate and to the Chair for accepting it for discussion. It is an issue that Senator Fallon and I have in common and we have discussed it on a number of occasions before.</P>
      <P>What is happening in the kidney transplant programme in many ways goes on without people being aware of it.  I would like to put a few statistics on the record. We have a thriving transplant operation going ahead in this country on an annual basis.  It compares favourably with other European countries in terms of the resources available to us.  It is important to recognise that 1.5 million people now carry kidney donor cards, or at least have kidney donor cards.  It is a huge percentage of the population and it is a reflection of the goodwill people have towards this programme.</P>
      <P>People see there is something to be gained, perhaps not solace for the family in the sense of replacement of the loss of a close friend.  There is some sense of solace in the feeling that a person's life is not completely wasted and that he or she can contribute to the quality of life of other people.  Unfortunately, it is not enough for people to apply, get and sign the kidney donor cards; they should also carry them with them.  We are failing in this area.  Very often they are left at home on the mantlepiece when they should be in people's wallets, or with their credit cards, or in their pockets.  That is the area where we must direct our education programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are now multi-donor cards which allow people to donate other organs of their body.  It goes to prove the point that public awareness works on this issue. People know it is a relatively easy thing to do; it is something which people feel they can give.  It appeals to the generosity in people's nature to give continuing life and a better quality of life to somebody whom they do not know.  It has taken nine years to build up the whole area of kidney donor cards and the transplant programme.  There has been an increase <Col N="1451" /> in the number of donors.  Nine years ago roughly 25 to 30 people per year donated kidneys.  One hundred people donated kidneys last year.  There has been a fourfold increase in eight years as direct result of public awareness programmes on the issue.</P>
    <P>Last year 75 kidney transplant operations were performed in this country. Some of these were multi-donational where heart, liver and, in some cases, eyes were donated.  Ninety per cent of these were as a result of people having donor cards.  This is the point I want to stress here.  People made the decision while they were alive and this was conveyed to their relatives.</P>
    <P>At the time of the death &mdash; a sudden death in particular &mdash; of a close member of the family other family members do not think of organ donation.  It is not something you think of at a very traumatic time.  I had a very traumatic experience recently when I was with somebody who is involved in the kidney transplant operation.  It is the last thing that would come into somebody's mind in a situation like that.  At present there are 180 people waiting for kidney transplants.  The Irish Kidney Association, who do trojan work in this area, would welcome any sort of encouragement in terms of creating public awareness.  I know the Minister feels the same way about this.  We are all at one in this area.  It is just a matter of making people more aware of it and of not letting it die.  Every year we have public awareness campaigns and every year there is some response to them.</P>
    <P>Kidney transplants are carried out in the national centre at Beaumont hospital. We are often quite quick to run down our country but people may not be aware of the fact that Ireland has one of the highest success rates in transplants in Europe, a 90 per cent success rate.  That needs to be put very definitely on the record: a 90 per cent success rate in kidney transplant. Where does it leave us in terms of cost? Preventative medicine and this kind of <Col N="1452" /> medicine must always be costed as well, just to satisfy the financial gurus.  It is simple.  It costs roughly £15,000 a year to keep one patient on a dialysis programme or dialysis machine, whereas a transplant operation costs £12,000.  You see an immediate saving from £15,000 a year to a once off payment of £12,000 and a much lower cost per year after that in terms of medication, etc.</P>
    <P>The quality of life is improved for people.  With 120 people on dialysis at any one time what does a transplant do? One person donating two kidneys means the kidneys go to separate people so there are two people whose quality of life is completely changed.  A person on dialysis has no life; it is like being in prison. They spend hour after hour each week in hospital, travelling to and from the hospital for a few days to repeat the process interminably.  People are at this for years and years.  People cannot be put on a priority list.  There must be a tissue type matching and blood type matching before-hand.</P>
    <P>Some people have rare blood types and tissue types and have to wait for years before they come off dialysis.  To get back to my example &mdash; one person gives two kidneys, the kidneys go to two other people who are now on dialysis and the quality of their life is improved.  Their whole lifestyle is improved.  They become productive people.  They are able to live normal lives or as near to normal as is possible.  Further to that, there are also two places available on dialysis machines which at the moment are very much overcrowded, so it has a knock on effect.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about is a major educational programme.  Death is a waste and it brings with it a waste of organs through lack of education and understanding. It is a waste of life.  It is a waste of opportunity.  We need a major public health education programme to create an awareness in people that they can give and that families can give.  We ask the Minister to take on board the idea of setting up such a programme so that <Col N="1453" /> people will see that it is not just enough to have a donor card, that they should carry it and make their family aware of it.  It is something that should not be discussed in any morbid fashion but in a responsible way with a sense of commitment to the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Fallon and O'Toole for their contributions to this Adjournment debate.  It gives me an opportunity, on behalf of the Department of Health, to explain how I am developing these services and the policy in this important area of organ transplantation.</P>
      <P>Recently the Minister has been considering the question of how to develop an effective public awareness campaign in this area with his European counterparts. Earlier this year, he attended a Council of Europe conference of Ministers for Health in Paris and they agreed to develop an information policy on organ donation.  He is currently considering how such a policy can best be implemented.</P>
      <P>In order to assist the Minister and the Department in this matter, we have asked the transplant liaison committee to give the issue some thought.  We formally established this committee earlier this year under the chairmanship of Professor Eoin O'Malley and the specialties of Medicine, Surgery, Anaesthetics, Neurology, Neurosurgery and Paediatrics are represented on it.  The committee has already shown how it can contribute to the development of expertise and knowledge in the whole area of transplantation through its recent publication of a very useful document on the definition of brain death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim, however, Senators will no doubt be aware that the need to increase and develop public awareness in the area of donor organ transplants is already very effectively addressed by voluntary organisations.  The Irish Kidney Association launched a uniform donor <Col N="1454" /> card in March this year as part of its annual donor awareness campaign.  This campaign has been very successful in encouraging people to make arrangements to donate organs and so give others the opportunity to once again enjoy a full life.  This uniform donor card is building on the remarkable success which the association has had over the past decade with the kidney donor card of which there are over a million in circulation at present.  I note the point made by Senator O'Toole about not just having the card but carrying it which is all important.  The Irish Kidney Association is of course also involved in a number of other areas.  For example, it helps patients financially and offers a counselling service; it funds research and provides capital moneys for equipment.  It also provides annual holidays for renal dialysis patients.</P>
    <P>The Irish Transplant Association is another voluntary organisation which assists in the promotion of awareness of the need for donor organs.  Earlier this year, we gave the Irish Transplant Association some financial assistance with the production costs of an educational video project to distribute to secondary and medical section and hospitals. While we are considering the question of whether our information policy on organ transplantation can be improved, we are satisfied that these voluntary organisations are doing excellent work in campaigning for donor organs and educating the general public.</P>
    <P>The great work which these voluntary organisations are doing is yet another example of how effectively voluntary organisations can co-operate with State agencies in the provision of health services. The enthusiasm, vision and commitment which organisations like these have shown in their contribution is one of the outstanding features of our health care system.  Their participation has always provided a strong dynamic force to the development of our services.</P>
    <P>Senators may be interested to know how the collection of organ transplants <Col N="1455" /> is organised.  There is a national organ transplant co-ordination centre based in Beaumont Hospital where the collection of all organ donations is co-ordinated. Since the resources required for transplantation in terms of staff, equipment and back-up facilities are considerable, the policy is to restrict transplant activity to designated centres.  Beaumont Hospital is the national renal transplant centre.  The Mater Hospital is the national centre for heart transplants.  St. Vincent's is the national centre for liver transplants and the national centre for bone marrow transplants is St. James's Hospital in association with our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin.</P>
    <P>We are currently considering the question of whether legislation is necessary to facilitate organ donation.  The emphasis to date has been firmly on the voluntary nature of the decision to become a donor, where the deceased has not expressed any view on the matter, the opinion of <Col N="1456" /> the next of kin has prevailed.  Even where the deceased has expressed a wish to donate organs, the views of the next-of-kin are sought and prevail.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators once again for giving me an opportunity to explain my policy and the policy of the Minister in this important area.  I assure Senators that, while a public awareness campaign for organ donation is already under way through the good offices of the Irish Kidney Association and the Irish Transplant Association, I am examining the whole question of our information policy in this area to see whether it can be improved.  The meeting of Ministers in Paris was a very useful development in this area.  We are now looking at legislation which many people feel may be necessary in future to facilitate an orderly arrangement for donors.</P>
