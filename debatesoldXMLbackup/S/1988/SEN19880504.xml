      <P>I have notice from Senator John A. Murphy that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The failure of the Department of Foreign Affairs to forward to the secretariat of the Inter-Governmental Conference a document submitted by the Campaign to Separate Church from State, alleging discrimination on religious grounds in the Republic, and directly relevant to the stated concern of the Anglo-Irish Agreement to bring about peace and reconciliation in all of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The proposed extension to the Patrician Academy Secondary School, Mallow, County Cork.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Murphy and Bradford as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Murphy's motion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded. Senator Bradford may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Can I suggest that the House puts on record its abhorrence at the murders committed by the IRA in Holland last Sunday?  The implications of the widening of the campaign are horrendous and do not require spelling out. Without detaining the House at all, I want to say that expressions of condemnation are frequently described as futile but silence is equally capable of being interpreted as fatalistic acceptance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If it is appropriate I would like to second the sentiments expressed by Senator Murphy particularly since those who were involved were not just English or British but really European troops, so it constitutes an attack on the European situation.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House if, in the light of the legislation being introduced by the Progressive Democrats and tabled in the Dáil, he will consider giving some prominence to Item No. 31 which deals with the serious situation in regard to planning compensation and which has been on the Order Paper for some considerable time, whether he will consider giving some degree of urgency to this, or whether he can give some indication of when the Government will introduce legislation covering the deficiencies in the planning law which, I understand, the Minister has suggested is already in the pipeline?</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would consider, <Col N="693" /> in the light of what has happened over the past five months, providing time in this House to debate what is happening in the Middle East.  I had the privilege of learning from the victims of racial oppression in the Middle East what is happening there.  I make no apologies to this House, or to anybody, for the manner in which I went there or the people I met.  I met people who have suffered the ignorance of the world for 40 years, the oppression of what can only be described as a fascist regime and who have suffered in silence and with remarkable bravery for those 40 years.  I would like the opportunity to raise the matter in detail and discuss the matter in detail in this House.  I offer no apologies to any Member of this House for the fact that I went there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome him back.  Nobody asked him to apologise for where he went.  He was asked to apologise for who was actually sponsoring it and the nature of the organisation sponsoring it.  I should like to ask Senator Lanigan to allow a debate on the Middle East because obviously there are very different opinions in this House about it. Senator Lanigan is associated with that particular issue and perhaps he will tell us when we can have a debate on that.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask Senator Lanigan if he is yet in a position to indicate when we may debate Item <Col N="694" /> No. 7 dealing with Anglo-Irish relations and Northern Ireland.  In conjunction with that I would like, of course, to express the Fine Gael view of total abhorrence at the actions which took place in the Netherlands and to express sympathy with those who have been bereaved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start with the request by Senator Bulbulia about Item No. 7.  The time of the Seanad for the next few weeks I will be taken up by Government business which has implications for everybody in the country.  We will finish the Companies (No. 2) Bill, the Insurance Bill and the Adoption (No. 2) Bill.  Once we get those Bills out of this House, plus certain other urgent small Bills that will come here in the next few weeks, we can discuss Item No. 7.</P>
      <P>A debate on the Middle East will take place in the House as soon as we can organise it with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I am not too sure where Senator Ross has been for the past number of years in relation to the Middle East.  With regard to the suffering Palestinians I agree totally with Senator Ryan's remarks.  I can guarantee that I will not allow anybody to be inhibited in their comments on what happens in the Middle East.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The real point behind my question was to try to elicit some information from the Leader of the House with regard to the Government's legislative proposals and if he has any news for the House on this because it has been very widely stated that the Government intend to introduce a measure that would affect this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, since I will be proposing that Part V of the Bill be significantly amended today, I wonder if I <Col N="696" /> might be allowed to make a brief statement at this point by way of general introduction to Part V of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, the thrust of Part V of the Bill, as it currently stands, is to make it &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; for an individual who has inside information in relation to a public limited company to deal in the securities of that company.  Part V also currently provides civil remedies to persons who can show that they have suffered loss as a result of such unlawful dealing.</P>
      <P>It might be no harm if I repeated briefly here the main reasons why this &ldquo;civil&rdquo; route was chosen.  In the first place, having looked at the experience in other countries which have legislated on this problem, there appear to have been significant problems in enforcing more elaborate systems of control.  Secondly, we were rather dismayed at the scale of State resources which might be required if the State were to have a central role in tackling the abuse concerned.</P>
      <P>However, while we explained these difficulties here on Second Stage, our concentration on the &ldquo;civil&rdquo; approach in the Bill has been almost universally criticised as not going far enough on Second Stage here as well as by most outside observers.  To put it simply, most commentators want the Bill to provide, at least, that insider dealing be made a criminal offence.</P>
      <P>We listened carefully to what was being said on this, and undertook to bring forward amendments on this Stage to strengthen this aspect of the Bill.  We have put a lot of thought into the problem in the meantime and we are now proposing a series of amendments which we are confident will greatly improve the effectiveness of Part V.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be for the benefit of the House if I were to say a word about the general thrust of the amendments we are proposing. First, we are now proposing to make &ldquo;unlawful dealing&rdquo;, in other words, <Col N="697" /> insider dealing, a criminal offence carrying heavy penalties.  Secondly, recognising the expertise that already exists in the Stock Exchange itself in this area, we propose to create a kind of &ldquo;enforcement role&rdquo; for the Stock Exchange, with backup powers of investigation for the Stock Exchange authorities.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, where a person is convicted of unlawful dealing, he will be prohibited from any further Stock Exchange dealings for the next 12 months.  Finally, we propose to create a new duty on those who are involved in share dealing as intermediaries not to deal on behalf of a client if they have reasonable cause to believe, or ought to conclude, that the deal involved would be unlawful.</P>
    <P>We can discuss the finer points of each of these amendments as we come to them but I thought I should take this opportunity to announce the decision to criminalise insider trading and to point to the very heavy penalties which we are proposing in the amendments, up to ten years imprisonment or a maximum fine of £200,000 on indictment.  Hopefully, they will meet with the agreement of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>This is a 189 section Bill.  It is a very complicated legislation.  I have taken the view, since I started this Committee Stage, and I will continue to take it today, that any assistance which Senators can give in regard to the honing of this Bill to make it good legislation will be listened to very carefully.  We want to get balanced legislation which, on the one hand, roots out obvious abuses which have been going on for too long in the companies area and which brings our legislation up to date and, on the other hand, makes sure that we do not damage a spirit of enterprise and a spirit of business activity and that we do not send out a message that Ireland is not a place in which to do good business.  I want to achieve that balance in this Bill.  I look forward to the help and support of Senators in doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call on Senator Bulbulia, the Senator can discuss <Col N="698" /> the points the Minister raised with the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to respond to the Minister's statement at the outset and to say how very much I welcome what he has had to say.  When I made my Second Stage speech I felt &mdash; and I think most speakers on both sides of the House felt &mdash; that it should not be a civil offence but that it should be a criminal offence. People were generally of the view that the Bill, as originally presented, did not go far enough.  It is very open and broad-minded and it certainly shows that having heard expressed in the debate the Minister had this change of mind.  It will strengthen the legislation and it will provide the checks which are necessary when this kind of abuse occurs.</P>
      <P>I welcome that kind of response to carefully argued points in the course of debate.  I would like to think that it will be an ongoing feature, not only in this legislation but in other areas and that, when carefully thought out good proposals are brought forward by the Opposition, the Government will respond to them with that tolerance, broad-mindedness and openness of approach which can only better legislation and the whole of Irish society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Bulbulia, I would like to welcome the statement made by the Minister in relation to insider dealings.  We have seen, over the past number of years, how insider dealings have damaged the credibility of major companies, one of which is a major employer here.  The loss of credibility in that company, because of insider dealings, has hurt the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask one question.  The Minister said that where a person is convicted of unlawful dealing, he will be prohibited from any further Stock Exchange dealings for the next 12 months.  Is the Minister speaking in terms of dealings as a dealer, or is he suggesting that he should be totally and deliberately stopped from buying or selling shares?  I would go along with the Minister's statement if he is suggesting that, if a person <Col N="699" /> is involved in insider dealing, he should not be allowed to take any part in Stock Exchange dealings.  The word &ldquo;dealing&rdquo; apparently has connotations.  I wonder what is the actual impetus here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I did not put forward those amendments yet.  With your kind permission I made a general statement announcing the Government's decision to make these major changes.  If you wish I can put those forward now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We will give Senator Ross the same chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to respond to the Minister's statement.  It is one of the most welcome things I have heard in this House for a very long time.  It is obviously a non-political and sensible response not to party political points but to points made by interested organisations and genuine people who have no interest in politics.  It is very mature and very sensible of the Government to take these suggestions on board and to amend the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister as a general point: while the amendments are very welcome in detail&mdash;I welcome the fact that two out of three are the ones I put down on criminalising insider dealing and they have really been taken on board by the Government&mdash;will he consider very seriously accepting amendments on Report Stage because we only got these amendments yesterday?  It is very short notice on a complicated Bill of this sort for us to learn exactly what the Government's intentions are.  Some of us have put down a few amendments but we have really been waiting for the Government amendments before putting more down. Will the Minister seriously consider taking on board on Report Stage issues which have not been touched such as <Col N="700" /> off-shore dealings and the prevention of insider dealings because of the short notice?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we can discuss Senator Lanigan's point better on the section.  It applies to both the principal and the agent.  It would not make sense to tackle one without the other.  I took very serious note of Senator Ross's amendments which I will debate when we get to them.  Every part of this Bill will certainly be open to amendment very much on Report Stage, right up to the line because I want to get this Bill right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 118, 119 and 120 are consequential on amendment No. 108 and may be discussed together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 108:</P>
      <P>In page 79, line 25, to delete paragraph (a), and substitute the following paragraph&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) a director, secretary or employee;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 90 contains a number of definitions for the purposes of Part V of the Bill.  The background to this first amendment is a little complicated but the basis for it is that we think the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in the Bill is incomplete and, therefore, defective. The defect, as we see it, arises mainly from the wording of subsection (6) of section 91.  That subsection provides, in effect, that a company must not deal in giving securities if any of their officers or themselves are precluded for dealing on the basis that they have inside information. The problem with this is that the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in section 90 does not take account of people who, while they might not actually be directors, would nevertheless be privy to inside information and be in a position to take advantage of that information.  For example, in the case of most investment institutions, such as banks, the person making the dealing decisions is not actually an officer at all but is a dealer who would normally be described as an ordinary employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> The prohibition in subsection (6) would not prevent the company dealing through its dealer employees rather than its officers.  This would obviously create an undesireable loophole.  The same reasoning applies to the exemptions to section 91 which currently appear in subsections (7) and (8) of section 91 and where the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; also has this narrow meaning at present.  We propose, therefore, that the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in section 90 should simply be redefined now to include employees for the general purposes of Part V.  This would remove what would be a rather unfortunate loophole in the Bill and is the basis for the first amendment, No. 108.</P>
    <P>There are consequential amendments to section 91.  Amendments Nos. 118, 119 and 120 are consequential to this.  These amendments relate to subsection (10) of section 91.  In that subsection, as it currently appears, the expression used is &ldquo;officer or employee&rdquo;.  However if we amend the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in section 90 to include &ldquo;employees&rdquo; as proposed in amendment No. 108, we will then have to delete the words &lsquo;or employee&rsquo; from section 91 (10).  That is what related amendments Nos. 118, 119 and 120 are seeking to do here.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 109, 110, 122 and 129 are related and may be discussed together.  We are on amendment No. 109 to section 90.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 109:</P>
      <P>In page 79, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;recognised stock exchange&rsquo; includes, in particular, any exchange prescribed by the Minister which provides facilities for the buying and selling of rights or obligations to acquire stock;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say of this group of related amendments, which generally set up the Stock Exchange supervision procedure, that amendments <Col N="702" /> Nos. 122 and 129 are by far the most significant since each of these would add a new section to the end of Part V. Amendment No. 109 is related to amendment No. 129, while amendment No. 110 is strictly consequential and therefore minor in nature.  Together with the separate amendment making insider dealing a criminal offence and which we will be discussing later, amendment No. 129 represents the real core of my proposed new approach to tackling the abuse of insider dealing.</P>
      <P>The proposed new section 98 recognises that the Stock Exchange already carries out extensive surveillance of share price movements and market dealings generally.  Section 98 will, in effect, build on this surveillance by requiring the Stock Exchange to report anything suspicious to the Director of Public Prosecutions and to co-operate with the director in any ensuing prosecution.  We are not proposing that the Stock Exchange should be under a continuing duty to monitor actual dealings.  On balance this would be an unreasonable imposition on a body which is still essentially a self-regulatory one.</P>
      <P>It is entirely reasonable to require the Stock Exchange now to report any suspected offence to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The duty on the exchange to report is to the DPP rather than the Minister.  This is mainly because the Minister can only prosecute summarily under the Bill, whereas the DPP can prosecute both summarily and on indictment. Having regard to the level of illicit profits which can accrue from insider dealings, it would seem pointless to prosecute such cases summarily since the maximum fine which can be imposed in such cases is £1,000, whereas the fine which I am now proposing today for conviction on indictment is a maximum of £200,000 which I think Senators will agree is a more realistic approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a similar duty on liquidators already.  Section 299 (2) (iv) of the Companies Act, 1963, imposes a similar obligation on the liquidator of the company to report suspected criminal acts to the DPP.  The proposed new section is closely <Col N="703" /> modelled on section 299.  Section 142 of the Bill proposes to place the same duty on the receiver of a company.  The wording of the proposed amendment provides that the duty imposed by this new section is to be discharged by a &ldquo;relevant authority&rdquo;. This is defined in subsection (6) as being any management body of a recognised Stock Exchange or the actual manager of the authority.  The effect of amendment No. 110 is to put a signpost into section 90 as to where the meaning of this term is actually to be found.</P>
    <P>There are other avenues of information I want to comment on.  One obvious way the relevant authority of the Stock Exchange would become aware of possible unlawful dealings would be from its on-going surveillance of dealings in the exchange.  Complaints could also be made by the public in writing or by telephoning. This could be examined.  Subsection (2) provides that members of the Stock Exchange should report suspected cases of unlawful dealings to the relevant authority while subsection (3) enables a court to direct the relevant authority to prepare a report in case the court becomes aware of the possible unlawful dealings through other proceedings which were brought before it.  That is something they would find out as a result of an existing case, for example.</P>
    <P>One final point I want to raise here is that we are not, in the section, proposing to name the Stock Exchange specifically.  This is to take account of the possibility that other exchanges may soon be set up here for example, futures or option exchanges.  The expression &ldquo;recognised stock exchange&rdquo; which we propose to use here is already defined in section 3 (2) of the Bill as the stock exchange prescribed by the Minister.  For the purposes of Part V of the Bill, that expression is further refined by amendment No. 109 which will ensure that such futures exchanges and so on can be covered by this Part of the Bill as they evolve.  No doubt they will evolve over time.  Following the enactment of the Bill, therefore, the Minister can make a <Col N="704" /> regulation prescribing the Anglesea Street exchange as well as any other exchange which would evolve in the meantime or, indeed, subsequently.</P>
    <P>On Senator Ross' amendment No. 122, again this amendment was tabled before I had announced the terms of the major amendments which I propose to make to the Bill.  In this connection, Senators may recall that one of the two main reasons the original civil route was proposed was that, from our examination of the problem, we were dismayed at the scale of State resources which might be required if the State were to have a central role in tackling the insider abuse.  In my examination of how this Part might be strengthened, I sought ways in which this could be done without involving the State in any significant expense but, at the same time, ensuring that the problem could be effectively tackled.  I think the package we have come up with which recognises and builds on the existing surveillance operated by the stock exchange is a viable alternative to involving the State machinery in investigations and in prosecutions. I am confident that, in an Irish context, it is the best and most workable solution we can achieve.  However, I would like to thank Senator Ross for the thoughtful amendment which he has put forward and to explain to him that we have gone this route rather than precisely his route, although they are very similar, based on my reluctance to involve the State directly in additional bureaucracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Government have taken the view in principle which they have taken.  Reading amendment No. 129 from the Government convinces me even further that Senator Ross has a very important point. We need not get into an argument about the precise wording of Senator Ross' amendment.  I and the rest of the non share-owning people &mdash; at least not directly share-owning; I am sure there is an insurance policy of mine somewhere that is speculating its way through the Stock Exchange, but I have to live with the realities of life as they are &mdash; have frequently heard officers and, indeed, <Col N="705" /> various senior officials of the stock Exchange deny categorically that there is any widespread insider dealing going on in the Irish Stock Exchange.  On the other hand, I have heard Senator Ross, who normally sits on my left, but who is sitting on my right today for reasons that escape me, say quite frequently in this House that insider dealing is widespread in the Stock Exchange.  It appears to me that to leave it to the relevant authorities of a recognised Stock Exchange to say &ldquo;if it appears to them that any person has committed an offence,&rdquo; it is to leave it to those who have already assured us that it does not appear to them that anybody is committing any serious offence on this issue.  Precisely the people who say there is no problem are now being left to regulate the problem that they say does not exist, whereas the best authority I have on the Stock Exchange is sitting here beside me and he assures me that it does exist.</P>
      <P>I do not really believe that the competent authority to deal with the problem are those who pretend that the problem does not exist.  Therefore, it appears to me that, while self-regulation may be a useful part of the enforcement procedures on an issue like this, it does behove us to allow the Minister, where he believes it necessary to conduct an investigation similar to that proposed to be conducted by the Stock Exchange, where it appears to the Minister that an offence may have been committed, not to impose the entire duty of investigation on the State.  It is not reasonable to preclude the Minister from carrying out an investigation with all the same powers that are given to the relevant authority under amendment No. 129.  That is the nub of the problem.  You cannot really expect the public to believe that the Stock Exchange which denies that insider trading exists is realistically going to take an active part in dealing with the problem that it pretends does not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I do not believe in too much self-regulation.  None of us are saints, least of all those of us who have power and influence, including the extent to which I have it myself.  Therefore, to <Col N="706" /> presume that a small body like the Irish Stock Exchange will operate in an independent, detached, dispassionate fashion in investigating one of its own members is a little bit much to expect.  It is absolutely necessary that some form of independent investigation should be possible where the Minister believes it is necessary. Otherwise, we could have the ridiculous position when there is a public outcry about some particular share dealing and yet the relevant authority will say: &ldquo;No, it does not appear to us that there is any problem&rdquo;.  It could well be done in good faith and nothing could be done, and it appears to me that nothing can be done. Therefore, it is necessary in my view that there should be another route to investigate other than <i>via</i> the relevant authority i.e., the Stock Exchange.</P>

      <P>Taking up the points raised by Senator Ryan, could the Minister define for me what bad faith means in terms of legal documentation?  Bad faith are two words that do not have any relevance for me in legal terms to anything.  I would like to know.  &ldquo;Knowingly&rdquo; has been omitted from the new licensing laws that are coming in.  So &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo; and &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; are two terms that are difficult for me.  I would like to know how the drafters of this amendment can put in &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo;.  If somebody goes into court and says: &ldquo;I did not do it in bad faith&rdquo;, what is the legal situation about &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the genuine attempt made by the Minister in his amendment here to prevent or at least to discover insider dealing on the stock exchange where it occurs.  I read it very carefully and very often and if I thought for one moment, as one who practised in the Exchange for 15 years, that this would work, I would wholeheartedly support it. It seems to me that we have a fundamental problem with our two amendments because what my amendment does &mdash; and I make no apology for it and I think it should be spelled out &mdash; is it fundamentally attacks self-regulation in the Stock Exchange.  It is the only way <Col N="707" /> you can actually police this problem.  Self-regulation is a very thorny and difficult subject and is one which has ideological problems.  It is an area which I am sure the Government do not want to enter simply in an amendment of this sort but I think they have absolutely no option at all.</P>
      <P>The reason I oppose the Government amendment is quite simple.  The Government amendment leaves it to the Stock Exchange to take the initiative on insider dealing.  My understanding of it is that the Stock Exchange sets up a relevant authority which investigates this and refers it on if it feels it is necessary.  There are several reasons why I do not think it will work.  The first one is that the Stock Exchange has for as long as I know and as long as I remember by its own rules outlawed insider trading.  The Stock Exchange &mdash; the Irish Stock Exchange &mdash; has policed these rules and this particular rule itself.  In policing this rule as far as I know and according to all the public statements that have been made, it has never once discovered a case of insider trading.  To me this speaks for itself.</P>
      <P>We are really continuing with the same investigating body which has not only publicly maintained that this is not a large problem but has publicly admitted that its own procedures are incapable of discovering it.  The conclusion we come to here as a result of this must be that the Stock Exchange will continue to be unable to discover it.  Now whether that is for good or bad reasons I do not know, but what I do know is that there has not been such a thing happening.  For the Government to say that, in effect, they will continue with this procedure in a more elaborate form is disingenuous because the Government are leaving it in the hands of those who do not believe in its existence.  I cannot see how you can expect the stock exchange when it maintains that this is not a real problem to pursue it with any great vigour.  It would be an enormous waste of its time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also worth remembering in this context that the Dublin Stock Exchange consists of very few members.  It is a small <Col N="708" /> group of people, all of whom know each other extremely well and have done so for many years.  It is emerging to a certain extent, but not totally, out of the sort of club atmosphere which was always one of its great characteristics.  Clubs of this sort automatically protect each other and it would be unreasonable to expect them to do anything else.  What is being asked again here by the Government is that these people should investigate each other, that people who meet each other day in and day out, for drinks, at the market, socially, in a very small clique, should refer each other for criminal prosecution to another body.  It is just not going to happen.  The pressures that can be brought to bear in a small financial community like Dublin will militate very, very strongly against this.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Government are being dishonest in introducing this.  I think they are saying: &ldquo;We want to wipe our hands of this and it is easier to leave it to them&rdquo;.  That is cowardly and it is unrealistic.  This is not the system which exists under the Financial Services Act in the UK.  The Financial Services Act in the UK is not necessarily any better <i>per se</i>, but it is not the system that exists there.  The system that exists there is very similar to the one I suggested in my amendment because it has successfully prosecuted people for insider dealing.  It is essential that the initiative comes from the Department and not from the Minister because the Department will be impartial in their investigations.  The amendment is meant to be as broad as possible in that basically it gives the Minister power to investigate anything at all where he is suspicious.  That is the general thrust of it.  In the UK this has worked and it has worked partly because the powers given to the inspectors include the power to ask questions under oath, in other words, those who obstruct it will be committing a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>In the suggestion given by the Minister &mdash; he will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; what happens is that the Stock Exchange gets wind of insider dealing and in an unspecified time it refers it to a relevant authority.  Whatever that relevant authority <Col N="709" /> is &mdash; it is described as a board of directors, committee of management, or other management body &mdash; that takes time and it seems to me that on top of that an authorised person can then be appointed to investigate this.  There is a massive delay and a massive bureaucracy involved in it.  It is also a massive passing of the buck from one person who is involved in the financial world specifically, I presume, to another person who is involved in the financial world.  I would like some indication from the Minister about who this authorised person is likely to be.  To me it would seem that it is essential, even though I oppose this amendment, that that authorised person should have no connection whatsoever &mdash; and an amendment should go in on Report Stage to this effect &mdash; with the people involved in the insider dealing accusations, that he should have no connection whatsoever with the Stock Exchange and should have as little connection as possible with the company involved or with the financial world.  We are getting into a web of people who are inter-connected and who will be instinctively protective about this sort of an issue.</P>
    <P>I would just like to know who is envisaged as this authorised person, but I would like to hear first the Minister's comments on the impartiality of the Stock Exchange which I think is quite simple.  I do not want to knock the Stock Exchange but it is quite obvious that they will be instinctively defensive about anybody who is accused of committing a criminal offence in their midst and the effectiveness of the provision will be enormously reduced as a result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the intention behind the Minister's amendments and, indeed, what Senator Ross is proposing in his amendment and trying to achieve.  Basically we are trying to get a form of words which will have the effect of outlawing and making a criminal offence of the practice of insider trading. The Minister should listen to what Senator Ross has to say in regard to this <Col N="710" /> matter.  First, he has tremendous experience on the Stock Exchange and, secondly, it is important for the Minister to remove himself or herself from any pressure that might come on the Minister of the day in relation to some kind of malpractice or functioning on the Stock Exchange that was far from healthy.  You are talking about millions and millions of pounds in Stock Exchange activity.  On paper the value of any could go up or down by millions in a matter of hours. There should not be any pressure on a Minister as an individual, as a political representative, through having representations made to him or her regarding this matter.  We all know as public representatives that we have pressure on us at particular times to do certain things that may not be at certain times in the common good.</P>
      <P>I would not like to have that pressure myself if I were a Minister and no Minister would like to have that pressure.  I am in sympathy, as a result of that, with what Senator Ross is proposing.  He is removing the issue into an independent arena which would be given authority to settle the issue once and for all.  If insider trading is taking place and if it is a criminal offence the Director of Public Prosecutions is the person who should be dealing with it.  It should be taken out of the ministerial arena.  I shall reserve what I have to say further until I hear the Minister's comments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan spoke about the statutory duty on the Stock Exchange and I just want to say to him that the submission which I have from the Stock Exchange clearly says that they want this made a criminal offence.  They also felt that the existing powers of the Stock Exchange itself were totally inadequate to handle what they see as the problem.  If the Stock Exchange sees it as a problem and is urging additional powers to cope with it, I would be reasonably satisfied that it would be responsible enough to use those powers if and when it gets them under this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that submission say <Col N="711" /> it is a problem because in many public statements before it has actually maintained that there was no problem?  If the Stock Exchange has changed its position on this, it is significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think I had better say that it is not so much saying it is a problem but that the present legislation is totally inadequate to deal with the practice of insider trading.  I have yet to meet a stockbroker or any member of the Stock Exchange who has not told me that there is a potential problem there. That is why we have this legislation.</P>
      <P>I want to say to Senator Ryan and, indeed, at this stage to Senator Ross that we have been giving a lot of thought to this question of the impartiality of the Stock Exchange.  I did not want to draw on the Department of Industry and Commerce or any Department of Government the requirement of policing this system in the first instance.  There may be a case for some final arbitration, or some final reserve power.  In the front line, I am not satisfied that our Departments of State have available to them the expertise to detect, track down and pursue this type of crime, as it will become.  I am not satisfied that the additional bureaucracy which would emerge from it is warranted at this stage. I am also quite impressed with the way the UK have been operating their financial structure and to this extent, even though I know they have problems, there seems to be a movement towards self-regulation and a movement towards ensuring that a profession regards itself as a profession and regulates its members.  If the State says that something is a crime, as will be the position if this Bill is passed, it would be unthinkable that any self-regulating, professional body like the Stock Exchange should not carry out the law as it is written once it knows it has got the statutory backing for a particular approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I can say to Senator Ross and Senator Ryan in this area is that we are not really taken with the argument which says: give the Minister the power to <Col N="712" /> initiate the inquiries for the reasons I have given &mdash; bureaucracy, expertise and a drift towards self-regulation.  I feel we should insist that the Irish Stock Exchange controls and monitors and generally supervises its members and supervises the activities it may become involved in downstream.  It is in a far better position to do it and more likely to have the information to do it, than say, the Department of Industry and Commerce would be.</P>
    <P>Having said that I do not think the Minister should be in the frontline; I think that would be unreasonable.  It would be drawing unreasonable bureaucracy on the State and would be letting the Stock Exchange off the hook.  It has a responsibility; if it feels there are any difficulties in this area and we give it the power to deal with them, I have enough confidence to feel that it will do it.</P>
    <P>I take the point Senator Ryan makes in particular.  If the Stock Exchange is not seen to do its job or does not do its job, there may be a case for some reserve power for the Minister in some way to direct, advise, request or demand the Stock Exchange to do its job.  I have no difficulty with that concept or perhaps looking at the notion of having another final arbiter.  In the first instance, as Houses of the Oireachtas and as legislators we should lay it on the Stock Exchange to control its members who can go to jail for ten years or be fined up to £200,000.  In view of the fact that that is in our legislation I would be absolutely amazed if the Stock Exchange did not take it deadly seriously and did not start to root out any practices it comes across.</P>
    <P>In that regard I will take a look between now and Report Stage at whether we might be able to put together some reserve power.  At this stage I am opposed to putting the Minister of the day or the Department in the front line. I am also opposed to having a parallel reporting structure whereby you could either have the Stock Exchange or somebody else responsible.  Let us put the Stock Exchange in the front line and get it to do it.  If it does not do it, we can devise some mechanism on Report Stage <Col N="713" /> for doing that.  I am not opposed to that principle.  If we want to concentrate on that point first I can deal with the other points later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder what I am doing here.  It is not my role in life to be increasing the credibility of the Irish Stock Exchange.  This is not intended to criticise Senator Ross; he is one of the best things that has happened in terms of Irish public perceptions of events in the Stock Market.  He seems to be the only one and, presumably because he has a certain privilege in here which will not allow him to end up in various courts, he can say things&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He never gave me any information that was of any use.  I have to clear him of that offence.  I must remind the House that last October when there was the great stock market crash, <i>The Irish Times</i> in a particularly succinct editorial said two things motivated both the stock and financial markets and they were greed and fear.  I do not think they are the sort of motivating forces which guarantee enlightened self-regulation. They are not the basis for the enlightened self-regulation we would expect.  I am happy with the Minister's approach when he says it is reasonable that the Stock Exchange should be given the job of looking after its own affairs first.  I agree with that.  My major quibble with the amendment as it stood was that, in the event of the Minister being dissatisfied with the way the Stock Exchange was doing its business, he ought to have the power either to direct it to standards that he was satisfied with, or to assume the same powers that are given to the Stock Exchange through this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are serious questions already about the way people manipulate the Stock Exchange.  It has been said, for instance, that a certain newspaper has discovered oil 250 times in the past two years and that certain newspaper is owned by the same person who has a <Col N="714" /> particular interest in off-shore oil exploration in this country.  That type of question ought to be addressed by a Stock Exchange which is serious about self-regulation and about ensuring that the public are not conned.  That is why I am extremely sceptical about that type of body.  I also know Irish life well enough to know that the very fact that people are liable to be subject to penalties of up to ten years in prison will inhibit a body from investigating it.</P>
    <P>I agree with the penalties.  They are even harsher than the ones I had proposed in my own amendment.  They are appropriate, given the scale of the gains that could be made.  It is not usual for me to be supporting harsh penalties but I am a great believer in threatening prison on those who are most inhibited by it.  I believe that the stockbroking fraternity would be inhibited by the possibility of ten years in jail.  Some of them would need about ten years to be inhibited.</P>
    <P>May I ask the Minister, on the precise wording of his amendment, what penalties will apply to the relevant authority of a recognised Stock Exchange if it does not carry out satisfactorily the powers it is given?  In other words, if it fails to do the things it is expected to do under amendment No. 129, or section 98 as it is proposed to be, what penalties will apply either to the relevant authority or, as in amendment No. 30, to the &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;?  What penalties will apply if they do not do the job that it is envisaged they should do?  Then perhaps we can come back again.  I am happy with the idea that the Minister's power should be a reserved power to be used where he is dissatisfied with what the Stock Exchange is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome what the Minister has had to say especially about there being some reserved powers for the Minister.  If we could put something together on that before Report Stage it would be very useful.  I will not press my amendment if that is what is going to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have difficulties about certain of the things mentioned.  In a general way it <Col N="715" /> should be pointed out that if the Stock Exchange is going to regulate this criminal offence itself, the Stock Exchange will be in the front line.  The cases which come to it and which are referred, if any are referred to the DPP, will have an enormously high profile.  The Stock Exchange will now come under a lot of pressure from the Press and from outside when these things are raised.  It may put the Stock Exchange in an invidious position because the Stock Exchange is obviously going to be the arbiter of its own case.  It is a principle which we should consider, whether it is a good principle especially in cases of criminal offences.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, simply because he did not reply to it, whether he thinks there is any validity in the statement I made that the Stock Exchange has, unfortunately, in the past completely failed to discover any cases of insider dealing.  I do not think anybody maintains any longer that this does not happen; otherwise we would not have this legislation. It is very important to realise that it has never been discovered, whether that is because its systems are inadequate or because there is not a will, I do not know, but it is a fact.  There is no reason to believe that it will happen in the future.</P>
    <P>I would like simply to comment on what the Minister said &mdash; the Department do not have the resources.  I hope this is not the reason the onus is being put on the Stock Exchange in this Bill.  It is a very bad reason.  Is he saying: &ldquo;Look, we do not have the money or the expertise to do it so we had better find somebody else to do it for the sake of the legislation, even if they will be ineffective&rdquo;?  I have a suspicion that that is part of the reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment.  I have listened carefully to the debate.  As Senator Ross said, no insider dealing has ever been discovered on the Irish Stock Exchange.  It is obvious that it is very difficult to prove that insider dealing takes place.  It is nearly impossible. On Second Stage I had reservations about making it a criminal offence for the very reason I have just stated.  It is so <Col N="716" /> difficult to enforce that it would take a specific State agency which would have to be funded with substantial amounts of money even to make an effort to monitor and to discover that insider dealing was taking place.  I believe for that reason that the only real option we have is a very strong deterrent.  I welcome the fact that Senator Ryan also recognises that a deterrent is necessary.  I believe the Minister's amendment which has built in a fine of £200,000 and a sentence of ten years in prison is the only realistic way of deterring insider dealing.  The people dealing on the Stock Exchange will take cognisance of this amendment and, as such, I believe it will go a long way towards eliminating insider dealing.  The consequences of insider dealing are that private investors are reluctant to invest in companies. This hinders the aim of promoting a wider share ownership among the general public.  I welcome the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Lanigan asked me earlier on about bad faith.  All I can say is that it is the opposite of good faith.  I suppose he will ask me now to define good faith.  It appears already in the Stock Exchange Regulations, 1984, so there is a precedent for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is.  There is a well-established legal principle for it. Good faith, too, is a statutory duty which is done reasonably and responsibly &mdash; a definition which is generally accepted. Senator Hogan asked the Minister not to get involved because of pressure on him and so on.  I think he might be a little bit confused because he is, in fact, supporting the Government amendment with those comments.  I am not sure whether he is clear on the actual difference between the amendments.  I should point out that I agree with the comments he made that the Minister should not be in the front line, at least initially or at an early stage.  That is a job for the Stock Exchange and we will consider what will happen if it does not do its job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> Senator Ryan asked a very good question, indeed, about what happens in the event that the Stock Exchange does not appoint an authorised person or does not make the necessary reports because the amendment says, if it appears to a relevant authority that any person has committed an offence, the Senator is asking me, if it does not move on that, what sanctions do we lay on the Stock Exchange?  The short answer at present is that in the legislation, as it is drafted, there is no formal sanction, but there is a statutory duty now laid on the Stock Exchange.  In the case where you have a statutory duty laid on Ministers or on semi-State bodies &mdash; there are plenty of areas where there are statutory duties laid on public companies or public persons &mdash; there is not usually a penalty built in, as such.  They could, of course, be sued for breach of duty, but there is no precedent that I can discover for laying a penalty on an organisation like this.</P>
    <P>All I can say publicly at this stage is that I will certainly look at all of these things but if the Stock Exchange does not do its job in this regard I can assure Senators that this Government, and I would guess any future Government, will certainly come down like a ton of bricks on them, in regard to amending the legislation if that is necessary.</P>
    <P>Another point we have difficulty with is not so much a question of proof, but the legislation says, &ldquo;if it appears to the Stock Exchange.&rdquo;  You might have a difficulty in getting proof that it did not appear to the Stock Exchange because you would nearly need to know its conclusions before you could conclude that it had not appeared to them.  That may be semantics.  You could probably get a court order in the <i>mandamus</i> area to force the Stock Exchange to carry out its statutory duty.  I will ask the legal advisers to give me a closer fix on that one.  In other words, we have not laid down a penalty because that brings us into another layer of almost having to have court cases, or some sort of cases, where we start to try the Stock Exchange&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because it did not carry out a statutory duty.  There seems to be a well-established way of ensuring that people carry out their statutory duties.  If there is another way of handling it, we will certainly have a look at it.  I will just finish with one or two other points and then I will hand over to Senators.  I wanted to mention also that one of the amendments we are coming to includes provision for an annual report from the Stock Exchange to the Minister and we will dig up the details when we get to the actual section.  On an annual basis the Stock Exchange will have to report on the number of cases it dealt with and on general information about the cases, not names as such.  Perhaps we can deal with that further when we get to the amendment, but there is an annual reporting mechanism from the Stock Exchange to the Minister.  We will know how many cases it looked at, how many it looked at and turned down, how many it was going to go ahead with.  We will have that basic information, a bit like the Ombudsman does at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross asked me a very intriguing question, which I am sure he could answer better than I can, as to why the Stock Exchange in the past has not discovered insider trading.  I would speculate that first of all it had no legal backup and, therefore, the incentive to do it may not have been as great.  Secondly, it may be &mdash; again the Senator would know better &mdash; a relatively new practice.  It may not have been as prominent many years back as perhaps it is today.  Again I would not be certain about that.  Of course, the Stock Exchange did not have this force of law where it could appoint an authorised person who can get certain documentation. I can only speculate again that the Stock Exchange may not have been able to get the information because it could not appoint an authorised person to go in and get it.  It did not have the force of law behind that authorised person and generally did not have a legal framework within which to chase it.  I cannot be <Col N="719" /> definite about that but I can say it is a very difficult area to get convictions in. Even if this legislation is passed in its present format &mdash; which is very tough legislation &mdash; there will still be difficulties in securing convictions.  In the UK system where you have the Minister of a Department more directly involved than here, there have been remarkably few convictions achieved.</P>
    <P>It may not be as much to do with the way the legislation is drafted as the difficulty of proving things like knowledge, proving who knew what and when they knew it.  It is a difficult concept in law. What may have prevented the Stock Exchange in the past was a feeling that it was not going to get anywhere with this. That feeling may have permeated the exchange and it may have felt that it did not want to get into it for that reason.  It may now feel that there is a much higher chance of success because there is a statutory framework.  I take the Senator's advice on that but I can only speculate as to why it was not more successful in the past and I can only hope &mdash; I cannot say for definite &mdash; that this structure, which I regard as very tough, is going to work. It is a tough attempt and we will be watching it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point that it is a very difficult area in which to get convictions.  There is absolutely no doubt about that.  What we are talking about is the best possible route to discover this particular crime.  It is a mystery to many why the Stock Exchange has not been able to discover it in the past.  I accept the Minister's genuineness when he says that the appointment of an authorised person with strong powers may help.  The Stock Exchange in the past has always had the power to ask its members virtually any question it wants about any deal.  Presumably through that it has been able to pursue it to its source but no member has been censored or punished in any way under self-regulations by the Stock Exchange.  There really is a serious weakness because the Stock Exchange has not been able to prove itself interested in this problem in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> At this point &mdash; I am not sure whether it is totally relevant but I think it probably is to this section &mdash; I would like to refer to the difficulty of getting convictions. There is one problem which is that more and more frequently in recent times there have been appearing on the register of public companies the names of companies purchasing shares from the Isle of Man, from Jersey and from further afield. There is a very strong suspicion that these companies are controlled by Irish people and that these companies are buying Irish shares in highly sensitive situations under the cover of names of professional people or companies in Jersey for which there is absolutely no remedy at all.  In other words, the Stock Exchange and the forces of law and order here cannot discover who the beneficial owners of these shares are because they are hiding behind off-shore companies.  This is an area which is not attacked by the Bill at all.  It is a difficult one to attack but I have suggestions about it which I will be happy to give to the Minister or to put down as amendments on Report Stage.  It is one area in which this law will be by-passed. I suggest what will happen is that more sophisticated means of insider dealing than have existed up to now will be adopted.  People will deal in the names of Jersey and Isle of Man companies so that their identity is hidden from the public and from the Stock Exchange.  Perhaps we could look at that particular problem for a moment.  I would like to ask the Minister if he has any plans for dealing with it.</P>
    <P>Having established that there has been a complete failure on the part of the Stock Eexchange to discover insider dealing, can the Minister assure me &mdash; because what he said is very conciliatory &mdash; that on Report Stage he will bring forward an amendment giving power to the Minister or an impartial authority and making him the final arbiter in this particular case? I will certainly not press this one.  The difference between our amendment is about who is going to investigate.  I accept the Minister's problem about resources and expertise.  I do not think they are <Col N="721" /> good enough.  Can he promise an amendment on Report Stage saying that, in the event of the Minister being completely dissatisfied with the way a particular case has worked, he can intervene?  Let me paint a scenario, and it may not be a very good one.  If, despite a large amount of disquiet publicly or elsewhere the Stock Exchange is refusing to investigate a case, the Minister can initiate proceedings. That would be acceptable because that would take the sting out of the whole element of self-investigation which is going to draw a lot of suspicion here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to go back to some questions I asked earlier about the penalties for either the authorised person or the recognised authority who do not do what they are required to do under the Minister's amendment.  The Minister spoke about the statutory duty and he said he would examine it again.  I would like to make this point in general on this question.  It appears to me that in terms of legislation we have very different perceptions about different groups in our society.  For instance, anybody applying for a means tested benefit has a statutory obligation to do certain things and it is not sufficient that he must do it.  There are very explicit penalties if he fails to do it.  It is not simply that people can be sued for damages.  They can end up in jail if they do not disclose relevant information when they are applying for a medical card, for unemployment assistance, or some such thing.  Doctors, for instance, have a statutory duty not to sign medical certificates for disability benefit unless they examine the person etc.  People have gone to jail for fiddling disability benefit but the doctors who signed the certificates for them have not even been reported to the Medical Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that perhaps we operate two separate sets of rules, one for those who are relatively well off, influential and important &mdash; we presume they will act in a civilised and proper fashion &mdash; and another set for those who seem to be dependent on the State.  We impose criminal and other penalties on them if they do not do what they are <Col N="722" /> legally obliged to do.  If we are going to give the Stock Exchange responsibility for this thing and it fails to do it, at least the authorised person ought to be liable for some penalties if he or she fails to do it.  There is no point taking about damages because they can be covered by the relevant authority.  The relevant authority could well cover for something like that.  I think, for what it is worth, that if penalties are to be applied, they should apply universally.</P>
    <P>Since we have a lot of uncertainty about people's views on whether or not insider trading is a problem I would also like to know whether the Government think insider trading is a problem.  Are we in a position where the Government are introducing complex new amendments to the Companies (No. 2) Bill because people are talking about insider trading?  Do the Government actually think we have a problem with insider trading?  That should be susceptible to a yes or no answer.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am not sure that we should keep going on about this lack of expertise in the Department.  The Minister is working within the Department which successfully rescued the PMPA from its own foolishness and managed to have the expertise to do that in a way which did not cause a collapse in the insurance industry or cause any great hardship to the policyholders with the PMPA.  Within the public service also was the expertise to rescue both AIB and ICI from the foolishness of the directors of AIB. Again, notwithstanding the implications of this mysterious thing called the financial markets and all of the expertise that is required there, when the State had to bail out some of the high flyers of the financial market they managed to do it quite successfully, and in my view, with far too little penalty for those who made the cock-up in the first place.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should stand up here and say things about the public service that are manifestly less than fair to the expertise that is there.  The public service displays a remarkable degree of expertise in many areas.  The Minister has given good reasons for leaving the Stock <Col N="723" /> Exchange to deal with this matter in the first place, but let us not knock the expertise that is there.  I cannot accept that the Minister or the Government have the expertise to draft legislation like this if they do not have the expertise to ensure that the legislation is enforced.  We cannot have it both ways.  If we can draft the legislation and pass it, we must presume that the people who gave the Minister the advice in drafting this know what they are talking about and are capable of enforcing it.  Otherwise we are living in an unreal world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ryan. The Minister seems to be getting extremely good advice this afternoon and I do not see any lack of expertise there. I would like to quote one case to the Minister on the point I am making about off-shore dealing.  There will be enormous loopholes in this area if this Bill goes through.  I have not picked out this case myself because I am always getting into trouble with the Stock Exchange if I pick particular cases.  I have taken it from the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on insider dealing.  Merchant Warehousing is a small company dealing on the Dublin Stock Exchange but not dealt very often, and it has a small capitalisation.  I want to point out a share movement which illustrates very well what has been happening. On 30 October 1986, the shares in Merchant Warehousing stood at 43p, on 31 October at 50p, on 3 November at 55p, on 11 November at 75p, and on 17 November the shares were suspended and the company announced that takeover negotiations were in progress.  That is a rise from 43p to 75p which is almost double in a week.  What happened was that there was one significant buyer of these shares in the market, and only one. Three quarters of the transactions which happened were in the name of one company and this buyer was a nominee company based in Jersey.  There is nothing that can be done about that under the present law and there is nothing that can be done about that as this Bill stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that in this case whoever <Col N="724" /> was dealing in those shares had knowledge of the takeover that was coming. That is very alarming.  It is obvious to me that there are other companies operating from overseas in this way.  It is a reasonable suspicion &mdash; it cannot be a certainty &mdash; that these are Irish people, and that these companies are fronting for an Irish person.  The movement in the share price in that situation is just too suspicious because of what happened almost immediately afterwards.  This illustrates a classic case of what is happening and what will continue to happen and will get worse if that loophole is not closed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The off-shore situation is not attacked in the Bill but if we can find a way to attack it we will.  There are a number of difficulties.  First of all there is a difficulty in the area of jurisdiction, which is a problem we have yet to face.  The European Communities are drafting initiatives in the area of insider trading and this may be a case where we should do something at EC level because there are a number of stools here and perhaps this is just one leg of it.</P>
      <P>I recognise an increasing problem in the area of off-shore dealers in our companies. I assume that if the people behind the company subsequently on investigation turned out to be Irish citizens and they were also investing in the Irish Stock Exchange, that would bring them into the legislation in the sense that they would now be insider traders.  I will have to double check that for the Senator.  I assume that if somebody has a company abroad and is hiding behind that company in order to buy shares on the Irish Stock Exchange &mdash; which is one of the things the Senator is concerned about &mdash; if it then turns out that the person behind that company is an insider trader, as an Irish citizen he is amenable to Irish law and we could catch that person in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the problem of catching them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  I would imagine that the Stock Exchange authorised person would go after this area, in <Col N="725" /> so far as he can.  We cannot write the law for the Isle of Man.  That is the difficulty, but reasonable efforts will have to be made by the authorised person to find out who is buying Irish shares behind foreign companies.  I will give the Senator a more definitive version of that when I come back to him again on it.  If there are any proposals in that area which the Senator can offer me any road out of, I will consider them.  It is a jurisdiction problem.</P>
      <P>I would not want to be on record as doubting the expertise of our officials. Quite the contrary.  They are extremely expert people.  I was referring to their day-to-day experience, not so much their expertise, of what is going on in the Stock Exchange.  The people who are closer to it are the Stock Exchange itself, so it is not a lack of expertise and I would not want to give that impression.  There would not be as much experience available in the Department of State on the day-to-day operations of the Stock Exchange.  I also meant to refer in that statement &mdash; and I do now &mdash; to the additional resources we would need to try to encompass it.  Senator Ryan asked me if we have a problem and Senator Ross was saying earlier that the Stock Exchange does not seem to have rooted out one in the past.  A rhetorical question for all of us would be that if we have not got a problem why have we been making speeches and bringing in Bills about it?  We will have to get back to the source of all of that.  People are wearing handcuffs in the United States for insider trading.  People have been dragged through the courts in the UK.  Those Stock Exchanges have a problem and ours has not surfaced because we have not had the legislation.  It may take the legislation to discover the extent of the problem but one would want to be extremely naive to see it operating in other jurisdictions and not to know and assume it goes on here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give Senator Ryan a very practical example.  I understood Senator Ross's example to be an indication of the kind of practice that can go on and the <Col N="726" /> kind of difficulty we can be faced with.  I am sure there are many more examples where one could trace the share price and also trace the activities of individuals connected with that company.  I am sure I could sit down with Senator Ryan and Senator Ross and trace a large number of such share movements and we could link them to specific knowledge of connected persons to companies.  That has not been done but if there was a serious suggestion that this was not a problem we would get down to digging up that bit of research work.  It is safe to assume that it is the practice on other exchanges and, from general knowledge here, it is also a practice on this exchange.  If it is not a practice in this exchange there is nothing to worry about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister accepts that he, Senator Ross and I could trace the prices of shares over the past couple of years and come up with very suspicion generating conclusions, perhaps he would ask the Stock Exchange between now and Report Stage why they have not done that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I should make that specific request to the Stock Exchange. The Government have decided to tackle a practice called insider trading which we are satisfied exists through general knowledge and observation of the exchange and the business scene and the international activities of which we are aware and, include a small number of obvious examples which a student of the financial press could follow very carefully.  I think that is enough to go on to get this on the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be fine if we were not essentially giving the Stock Exchange a preponderant role in implementing this legislation.  I am not trying to play games.  A serious question arises. If the Stock Exchange has not investigated, in proper detail, the sort of suspicious share price rises we are talking about, why should we, as legislators, now believe that because it is given all of these <Col N="727" /> powers it will now be more diligent in investigating than it was before?  The fundamental wording is &ldquo;if it appears that a person has committed an offence under this Part.&rdquo;  As it stands, its own regulations would suggest that a person who does these sort of things is in breach of Stock Exchange regulations.  Yet it appears from what we have heard and, as Senator Ross has said, from what we know, that it has not even bothered to investigate these suspicious trends in some share prices.  Why should we believe now that it will behave differently?  That is why I think the Minister ought to ask it, before we come to Report Stage, why it has not done this in the past and why he should trust it with this sort of major responsibility in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to respond to that very quickly.  I have no direct evidence that the Stock Exchange has not investigated insider dealings and dealt with them.  If Senator Ross tells me it is true, I accept that.  I have no direct information which tells me that the Stock Exchange has not conducted its internal investigations.  There is a different situation. Internal regulations are one thing.  The law of this country is an entirely different operation, and a law that is backed up by very tough penalties is an entirely different operation.  If the Stock Exchange has been coy about tackling practices which worry it one could perhaps take the view that it was just shy about it and did not regard it as a priority but had other priorities.  Certainly, it has to move up its agenda right now because it will become, with the agreement of the Seanad and the Dáil, the law of the land. It is an entirely different ball game when it has a legal, statutory duty to do this work as opposed to when it is just one of its internal regulations.  I have no proof that that will be the case but, if it is not the case, we will look again and we will also look at this reserve power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very reluctant to push my amendment to a vote.  I asked the Minister a question a few minutes ago <Col N="728" /> which he has obviously forgotten about. Could he assure the House that on Report Stage he will introduce an amendment to give the Minister final power as the final arbiter to take initiatives in this area?  That is a totally acceptable compromise. What we are talking about in the end, between the Minister's amendment and mine, are two very different principles. We are talking about two very different parties taking the initiative in investigating this.  I would like to see is there some way in which this could be bridged.  If the Minister could introduce an amendment on Report Stage literally saying that the Minister, in the event of being dissatisfied with the operation of section 129, will himself take the initiative and order an investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be foolish of me to be tied to the wording of an amendment at this stage.  I need to be very careful about that.  I have no difficulty with the principle of what the Senator is suggesting if I interpret it as follows: I want, in the first instance, to make sure that the Stock Exchange stays in the front line and to make sure that the law lays it on the Stock Exchange to keep its house in order and carry out these investigations, get its authorised person in place and report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I want to make sure that that duty is firmly placed there. A worry that I want to share with the Senator is that if I open up a second avenue which is parallel to that, I want to be careful not to open up the opportunity that everybody will use the second avenue and the Stock Exchange will start to feel that it can deflect people to the second avenue, rather than tackling the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a difficulty if I put in an equally accessible parallel mechanism, so I cannot do that.  That would deflect people and the exchange might conclude that it would be better if the person went to see the Minister because it did not want to get involved as it might upset its members.  I do not want to give the Stock Exchange any way out of the statutory duty we are <Col N="729" /> proposing to lay on it.  Having said that I am certainly taken with the idea of putting in a power after that.  I want to make sure that it does not become an &ldquo;instead of&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That would be a major requirement; otherwise the Stock Exchange might sit back and leave it to the Minister.  Then we might as well have gone the ministerial route, but that also has other difficulties. I want the Stock Exchange to be there on the front line.  I can give the Senator an undertaking to bring forward something along the lines he is talking about which would give the Minister, in certain cases, a final say without in any way undermining the main thrust of the attack.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the present version of the Bill securities are defined as shares or debentures issued, or proposed to be issued, by a public limited company.  In view of the new functions we are now <Col N="730" /> proposing to give to a recognised Stock Exchange, we feel it would not be realistic to have the exchange investigating suspected insider dealing cases involving companies outside its direct sphere of operation and control.  Having looked further at the matter we can find no particular evidence suggesting that insider dealing is a significant problem in the case of unquoted companies but, again, that is a matter of knowledge and information which I do not have.  In the circumstances we are proposing to confine the definition of securities and thus the application of this part of the Bill to company securities which have some form of quotation on the Stock Exchange.  This should have the effect not just of making the new arrangements that much more workable but also of concentrating our efforts on where the real problem appears to be.</P>
      <P>I should also like to say a brief word about the phrase &ldquo;recognised stock exchange&rdquo; which appears in this amendment. This is the expression used throughout the Companies Acts and throughout this Bill.  However, by virtue of section 3 of the Bill, the Minister will be able to recognise not just the Anglesea Street Exchange but also any other exchange which is set up or evolves in the future.  I should add also that the wording of the amendment would cover not just shares which have a full listing on the Stock Exchange but also those which have any form of quotation on the exchange, for example, on the unlisted securities market, the smaller companies market, or whatever.  We have already used this form of wording in previous parts of the Bill, for example, in section 29 of Part III of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Acceptance of this amendment will involve two consequential amendments, Nos. 113 and 117.  This would amend section 91 (5) and section 91 (9), respectively. In the case of section 91 (5) it will not now be necessary to mention specifically securities traded on a recognised Stock Exchange.  Hence paragraph 91 (5) (a) can, we think, be omitted. Exactly the same applies to the similar <Col N="731" /> reference in section 91 (8) to securities traded on a recognised Stock Exchange.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are very technical in nature and arise from a very recent insider dealing case at Southwood Crown Court, London in which it was held that to &ldquo;obtain information&rdquo; means not simply to get or have the information but to actively seek or acquire it.  For our part, we would obviously not want the word &ldquo;obtained&rdquo; to have this narrow construction in section 91.  What we want to provide is that no matter how the insider got his information, in other words, whether he went looking for it or not, he should still be prohibited from dealing under the section.  Therefore &ldquo;received&rdquo; seems a better word for this purpose than &ldquo;obtained&rdquo;.  I understand that the definition in the London case has been criticised in some quarters since it was taken. In this context we could have waited to see whether there were any developments in the UK following the case.  It might also be argued that our courts would not feel bound by the decision of the UK court in any particular case.  On balance I thought that it might be wise to take the opportunity to remove any doubt about the matter in our own Bill.  These two identical amendments would, therefore, simply substitute &ldquo;received&rdquo; for &ldquo;obtained&rdquo; in subsections (3) and (8) of section 91.</P>

The object of this really is to tighten up the policing of insider dealing.  The problem all along in the US, the UK and everywhere else has been to actually prevent it and to discover it.  The objective of this amendment is to put a strong obligation on intermediaries, stockbrokers, authorised dealers, members of the Stock Exchange and on everybody involved in actually dealing not to deal for those who are insider dealing.  It is incumbent on them, according to this amendment, not to deal on behalf of anybody doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this is that every single deal which is carried out by an insider must go through a trader of one sort or another.  If these traders commit an unlawful offence by doing this, it would make them much less willing to do so. The reason I put in &ldquo;or to cause or procure any person to deal in those securities&rdquo; is that the Stock Exchange and the financial world in recent years have <Col N="733" /> become increasingly competitive.  It is a real jungle of very ambitious and competitive people.  There is undoubtedly a temptation in the search for business to relay information which is highly sensitive. It is absolutely no secret that those who are trading in shares are, from time to time, in possession of very sensitive information.  Part of this is the result of what they call Chinese wars, where one person in the office is dealing in corporate business, another is dealing in shares and another is dealing in something else and they, like it or not, switch information which they should not be doing.</P>
    <P>Stockbrokers come across information which is extremely sensitive in the work they are doing dealing in shares.  The temptation, therefore, would be there for them to ring their clients and say they just heard there was going to be a take over or to get into these shares very quickly and they would make an absolute killing.  That is a conflict of interest which they would have.  By making this a criminal offence, we will deter them from behaving in this way.  It will deter them from using information which they might have heard next door in another part of their office.  The idea of this is to put that sort of pressure on them not to relay iformation to encourage people to get themselves involved in insider dealing, and indeed, to refuse to do so if they have any suspicion that the client is involved in it.</P>

      <P>I fully support Senator Ross.  There is a phrase coming out of my mouth that I may well be hanged on.  I am surprised to hear the Minister constantly refer to the two Senators; it is unusual for me to be described in collective terms along with Senator Ross.  Senator Ross has made a very valid point.  He has also made the point that there is a difference between his own amendment and Government amendment No. 127 about advice.  If we are to stamp out or attempt to stamp out the practice of insider trading, it should be an offence to offer any sort of advice or assistance to any third <Col N="734" /> party to make what is euphemistically described as a killing.</P>
      <P>It is true that the public perception of the Stock Exchange is not what the Stock Exchange would wish which is an exchange to raise money to invest in useful projects, but it is more seen as a gamblers' den where people with either luck, good fortune, or access to extra information can make a &ldquo;killing&rdquo;.  In order to restore the proper function to a Stock Exchange, even in a free market economy that perhaps I do not altogether approve of, it ought to be clear that the people who make money out of the Stock Exchange are those who invest in companies that end up being successful in the production of goods or services which can be traded either domestically or internationally. That ought to be the idea of a Stock Exchange &mdash; to entice or persuade people to invest in various areas of investment in order to make money out of a risk that they take in developing something and not out of some sort of short cut equivalent to backing the heavily doped outsider in some horse race or other.  In order to restore that image of the Stock Exchange, it should be quite clear that any advice, any assistance, direct or indirect, which enables somebody either by nods, winks, hints or otherwise to by pass the normal operation of the market in terms of the way the Stock Exchange operates ought to be illegal and ought to carry similar penalties to those who directly use insider information.  Therefore, I support Senator Ross's amendment which I think is more comprehensive than the Government's amendment.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the context in which Senator Ross tabled this amendment.  We have come to the same view ourselves, looking back on what the Senator had to say on Second Stage, that an amendment along these lines would be worth making.  The wording of the Government amendment is slightly different from that proposed by Senator Ross.  For example, the Government do not mention authorised dealers as the Senator does, principally from the point <Col N="735" /> of view that this was not a concept which was recognised here.  Secondly, we did not mention causing or procuring a person to deal in securities since that would seem to be covered in section 91 which provides:</P>
      <P>It shall not be lawful for a person at any time when he is precluded by subsection (1), (2) or (3) from dealing in any securities, to cause or procure any other person to deal in the securities.</P>
      <P>That is on page 80 of the existing Bill.  The Government amendment meets Senator Ross's point.  The actual wording of the Government amendment is preferable for the reasons which I have mentioned.</P>

In other words, does it cover bank managers and accountants and other people who are in the way of giving advice all the time on this sort of thing? In other words it shall not be legal for them to encourage people as well.</P>

      <P>That is a good point. In addition to covering brokers as agents the section would also apply to any person who deals on behalf of another person.  This would apply to nominee companies, for example, those operated by financial institutions and others, those nominee companies whose business might involve buying and selling shares on behalf of clients.  It will also apply to any nominee company or other person who might be interposed between the client and the market.  I think it covers the point.  I appreciate very much the tabling of that amendment because it did concentrate our minds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested to us that the wording of the last two lines of section 91 (8) may open up an undesirable loophole.  That is on page 81.  The intention of this subsection is to actually allow straightforward dealings by one company in another's securities to take place and the exemption it embodies is a narrow strictly technical one.  The very fact that financial institution A proposes to sell its complete holding in blue-chip company B could be regarded as inside information since, first of all, no one outside institution A would have this information and, second, if such information were generally available it would be likely materially to affect the share price.  On reflection, however, the wording of the last two lines of subsection (8) does not make the narrow nature of the exemption which I want to bring out here clear enough.  The expression &ldquo;relates only to proposed dealings&rdquo; could be capable of a wider meaning than the one we intend.</P>
      <P>For example, in the case I just quoted, institution A could have some real inside information on company B, for instance, that its next annual returns were going to be worse than expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subsection (6) the institution would, quite rightly, be prohibited from dealing on the basis of such information. However, if this real information did indeed prompt the institution to sell its holdings, it might be argued that under the terms of subsection (8) this would still be information that relates only to proposed dealings by the institution in <Col N="737" /> the second company's stock.  This amendment, I hope, will make it clear that all that is being exempted here is the very possession among the personnel of institution A of the single piece of information that the institution proposes to buy or sell the other company's stock.  I am sorry about the long explanation but, because of its technical nature, it is important to get this on the record properly.</P>

      <P>I do not have any particularly very strong views on this, but prevention is much more important than a penalty in all criminal cases.  Having said that.  I would like to know where the Minister gets his figure of £200,000 from. There is a wide variety of punishments in these amendments.  To see Senator Ryan only fleecing rich capitalists of £20,000 is an enormous surprise to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when the soldiers of destiny who have a different ideology, if they have one, are prepared to take £200,000.  This is a strange paradox.  My amendment, for what I think is very good reason, does not specify a fine.  The <Col N="739" /> reason for this is that, although £200,000 sounds an enormous amount of money and is an enormous amount of money, on the scale that insider dealing can take place, it is not an enormous amount of money.  It seems to me that it is absurd that there should be a limit, unless this is an actual statutory limit, which I do not know about, that you cannot fine anybody more than £200,000 for a crime of this sort.</P>
      <P>Remember that Mr. Boesky in America has done quite well out of this.  He has paid over £100 million and he is doing two years in jail but he will come out a very rich man.  I do not know where the £200,000 came from but it would appear to me that it should be left open, if that is legal, to say how much the fine is because it is quite possible for people in this sort of situation based in Ireland or overseas to make millions of pounds on this sort of crime and £200,000 really is not very much to them.  If it is possible to leave it open I think what any judge or jury should do is fine them an appropriate amount.  It is obviously absurd to fine people £200,000 if they do not have it and have no hope of getting it.  If they have made millions of pounds on this sort of a transaction, which is not inconceivable and which happened in America, it is absurd to fine them as little as this.  To put such a rigid maximum is a pity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My interpretation of the Senator's amendment about the fine &mdash; to clear it up from a legal point of view &mdash; is that by leaving it the way it is actually worded we would get caught on page 141 of the Bill under &ldquo;General&rdquo;, in line 33 where it states: &ldquo;on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £10,000.&rdquo; My current advice is that the Senator's word &ldquo;fine&rdquo; would refer to that clause. His amendment, in fact, means a fine not exceeding £10,000.  I am not trying to be clever about that but I want to bring it to his attention because that would be the impact on the currently drafted legislation of leaving the word &ldquo;fine&rdquo; hanging there.  I do not think it is possible to leave legislation open-ended to the extent that it could be left to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> It is normal in legislation to lay down &ldquo;minimums&rdquo; or &ldquo;maximums&rdquo;.  I do not think that those are the plurals of those words.  They may be minima and maxima.  It is normal in legislation to lay down limits.  We have never, to the best of my knowledge, brought in open-ended offences where the court was free to make up its own mind.  Between now and Report Stage I will check that but, in general, one has to make up one's mind to guide any court of law as to what the Legislature have in mind.  As regards the limit I would have to say quite frankly that the Senator's guess is as good as mine.  We could have made it £500,000 or we could have made it £1 million.</P>
    <P>Considering that this is the first time we have introduced a criminal offence for this activity, it seems to be a sensible starting figure and I would remind the House that there is also the option of a ten year jail sentence.  If some judges feel that someone has made millions of pounds and that £200,000 is not enough, they have the option of the jail sentence as well.  I am not sure what the inflation rates will be, but ten years of inflation could put some hole in one's profit.  That depends on one's investment strategy, I suppose.</P>
    <P>The limit is not scientifically put together.  It would be foolish of me to pretend here that we have a slide rule and a formula.  Given the kind of money involved in the exchange and the kind of money that can be made, it seems to us like a sensible figure when you combine it with a ten year jail sentence.  It is £200,000 and ten years, or either.  Certainly if people want to run the risk of having both those penalties imposed on them, they are obviously very foolish indeed.  When you take the £200,000 with the stiff jail sentence, perhaps it might be enough.  If experience shows it is an insufficient limit, it would not be a major legislative matter to increase it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point. In that case I was completely wrong about putting down a fine.  I thought that by putting a fine in my amendment it meant <Col N="741" /> that it was open-ended.  I accept the Minister's explanation regarding £10,000 or more.  In that case this is far too small an amount.  If this legislation is passed, I suspect that will be the end of it for a very long time.  It is not normal for these Bills to be changed by separate legislation, to go to the trouble of doing it.  A sum of £200,000 in the context of what we are talking about is a very low limit indeed.  I know it is a lot of money but, if you are talking about people who are professional insider dealers, as happened in America, it will not take long for them to make £200,00.  I know Boesky was doing it on a scale which is enormous by comparison with what we are talking about here but he parted happily with £100 million and that was all ill-gotten gains.  There is no doubt about that.  He presumably has a lot to spare.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to consider putting a much higher limit on this type of transaction. Perhaps it is difficult for him and for many other people to realise the enormous sums which change hands on the Stock Market from day to day even in Ireland.  The turnover is quite staggering in an active market.  The sort of profits which an insider could make in an active market are absolutely enormous.  To limit it to £200,000 is, I think, giving people a reasonably easy way out.  A really professional insider dealer would be able to make much more than that in a short time.  I understand the point the Minister made about the ten years jail sentence. That is a matter for the courts and for future conjecture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot predict whether the courts will be handing out sentences of ten years for this sort of crime but the first case they had in England on this matter involved an individual who did not receive a jail sentence.  He received a fairly small fine. I would be surprised if long jail sentences of this nature were handed out initially. To my mind people who are involved in this crime are motivated by one thing and that is greed, and the best way of hitting them back is by taking their ill-gotten gains from them and anything else which they have.  I would ask the Minister to consider raising this threshold a great <Col N="742" /> deal higher.  Surely there is no harm in having a ceiling of £1 million plus because it is up to the courts to use their discretion about the scale of the crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about 100 companies quoted on the Stock Exchange here, give or take a few.  My Department would have no direct knowledge about the kind of insider deals that might pull in the kind of money the Senator is talking about.  He is talking about a small number of companies.  If the Senator is saying to me that in those small number of companies you can still make those large kind of killings and get the major fluctuations at share price, I will certainly have a close look at it.  It seems to us that in this whole section we are talking in round figures of about 100 companies.  We are not talking about thousands of companies.  They seem to be largely stable type companies which we consider did not show the huge fluctuations in share prices that would give rise to killings but again the Senator would have a better knowledge of that area.  Perhaps in the energy area there are opportunities which there would not be in banking shares.  There may be a case for increasing the fine.  People who make a lot of money, &mdash; hundreds of thousands of pounds, millions of pounds &mdash; in deals like this do not mind paying large fines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you make a few million pounds in a killing, you do not mind paying a few thousand pounds in a fine.  Where you really get petrified is when you have to spend even one day in jail.  We are putting into this legislation &ldquo;up to ten years&rdquo;.  I suggest that the real deterrent here is not the money because people who operate like that and make those kind of killings, are calculating enough to build a fine in, almost as part of their costs, particularly if the deal is big enough.  If you make £5 million and you pay £2 million fine, what is the difference?  People like that are petrified of spending one week in jail because of what it does to them in all sorts of ways.  Those people are not accustomed to that kind of treatment.  Therefore, I think the ten year jail sentence would petrify anybody who would run <Col N="743" /> the risk of getting that kind of jail sentence. That is the real deterrent and the money is more of a token.  For the moment I would like to let it stand and I will think about the comments which the Senator has made in the meantime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says about jail sentences being a deterrent but I am not sure that I believe it.  I suspect that those people who are dealing in this way feel that they will not be caught, so the deterrent in that case will not be as powerful as it might be.  I know we are talking about 100 companies or so, but the turnover is quite staggering in active times in these companies.  A profit of £200,000, in circumstances in which there is insider dealing, would be very small.  He would be in before a sensitive movement and out very quickly, so he could deal with the larger companies in very large amounts.</P>
      <P>The Minister touched on it when he said that a profit of £200,000 in the oil companies, in the energy companies, is quite a normal type of profit to make in widely fluctuating times.  Everybody knows that the profits taken out of these companies and the losses made on these companies have been enormous and are way over the £200,000 mark and that, if the fine remains as low as that, the risk of discovery, as this Bill stands at the moment, is minimal.</P>
      <P>The deterrent effect is very small.  I will probably put down an amendment on Report Stage because it would be no harm to have a much higher ceiling and leave to the discretion of the court how they impose it, because a court will decide the scale of the operation.  It seems a little absurd that if someone goes into court and it is discovered that he made £1 million or £1.5 million on insider dealing, the maximum fine he can get is as little as a seventh of that.  I leave it totally to the discretion of the Minister but that is the sort of thing we are talking about.  It would be helpful to have a high ceiling and to leave it to the discretion of the court to decide the scale of the actual insider dealing.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that since it will be a criminal offence to be involved in any of these activities, there is no legal basis on which a person should be entitled to retain any of the money he made out of the criminal activity and the court should be allowed to assess the degree to which the person has benefited from these illegal activities and should be allowed to confiscate the proceeds of such illegal activities.  We would not countenance persons who robbed a bank being able to hold onto the money.  Neither should we countenance persons who robbed the community by insider dealing holding onto their profits.  Therefore, the simple solution would be to insert a provision, similar to that which applies in <Col N="745" /> other areas of illegal activity, for confiscation of any proceeds from such activity.  We rushed a Bill through this House not many years ago dealing with the proceeds of certain illegal organisations and allowed the accounts to be frozen and various other things to be done.  A similar provision here, in addition to a fine, that where the court deems it appropriate all profits from such illegal activities shall be forfeited seems to me to be consistent with other areas of legislation and would meet the problems Sentor Ross has addressed.</P>

What will really deter them is the prison sentence. I want to remind Senators of one other area which I did not refer to when I was speaking a few moments ago.

      <P>If you made £5 million on a killing, you could go to jail for ten years, pay a £200,000 fine and then all of that £5 million could be taken from you in a civil action because a victim, either an individual or the company if it suffers, can take a civil action to seek compensation from you up to the £5 million.  If you make £5 million on a killing, you could to to jail for ten years, pay a £200,000 fine and you could have to pay over the total of the profit you made on the deal to a person who takes a civil action against you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I read that the DPP actually said in a speech or a lecture &mdash; he floated the idea of the benefits from crimes being paid over to the victim &mdash; that the concept which is a new one in this country is one which we have not really grasped.  It is interesting that he should float that. I will certainly have a close look at it, although that is more a matter for the <Col N="746" /> Minister for Justice obviously.  In the example I have given that is quite a hit on the person who made that £5 million killing.  The only area on ahich we differ perhaps is that the £200,000 is not high enough but if those three things hit you, you will certainly be very sore indeed.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make for the benefit of Senator Ross is that, if we raise the maximum penalty, say, o £1 million from the £200,000 figure, we might run the risk of the courts taking the view that we expect them to have a financial remedy only for this crime.  The courts could say there is plenty of scope to take the money back and, whether or not you are institutionalising your feeling in the courts, you do not go to jail for this kind of problem.  Because the maximum penalty is so high we can hit them for a fortune and therefore you do not go to jail.  If the court considers that £200,000 is not enough the jail sentence can be imposed.  This is an attempt to get a balance between the more normal penalty for criminal offences and the fine.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Ryan's point about the confiscation of money, obviously the Senator did not address it until recently either, because his amendment suggested much lower penalties.  I have not addressed that problem.  We examined it from the point of view of getting a jail sentence, a substantial fine and a civil remedy.  You could, of course, argue that you could go much further and take all the money back, and so on, but you are dealing here with a new type of crime.  It may be very close to robbing money from a bank, but it is not quite the same.  There are similarities.  It may not be quite the same and, therefore, the confiscation area has not been probed yet.  If Senators feel it should be probed we will certainly probe it as much as we can.</P>
    <P>I want to say also that another of our amendments will ban a convicted person from dealing for 12 months after the conviction, so that might really hit his pocket if he is successful at it.  The balance is right between the prison sentence, the fine and the civil remedy.  Anyone could come in with a different package and as we discuss the matter I will certainly give <Col N="747" /> serious thought to what Senators have been saying about the limits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister is getting at.  In many ways it is a good balance.  I am not sure whether the civil remedy has been thought through by the Government and by those who drafted this Bill.  The theory is clever and apparently it is fair but it is very difficult in this case to prove who the injured party is.  I also do not see how you can prove that the injured party was injured by the person insider dealing.</P>
      <P>In the transfer of shares &mdash; say the insider is buying the shares &mdash; is the injured party the seller of the shares or is he not and does he have an action against the buyer?  Presumably that particular seller would have sold anyway, so he has not been induced to sell shares by the insider.  Had he not sold them to the inside dealer, he would have sold them to somebody else in the market.  I would have thought it was very difficult for anybody to prove a civil liability in this case. I will be very interested to see what happens when these cases come before the courts.  If I sell to Senator Ryan who is the buyer, it is very difficult for me to maintain that he has injured me because I would have sold these shares to somebody else at the same price&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He would have bought them from somebody else at the same price anyway, so he would not have a genuine claim of injury against me.  I think the market is too big to pin one transaction down like that.  I suspect this sort of civil liability is absolutely full of difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this whole area is a maze of difficulties because of the rather ephemeral nature of it and the difficulty of proving it.  Regarding the civil remedy all you have to do is show that you have suffered and that you are a victim.  If you sell your shares and subsequently they go through the roof, that would obviously be public information. <Col N="748" /> If you then feel that that very action happened because of an insider trader who had this information and went pumping the shares, the person who sold the shares could go to court and claim that he would not have sold the shares if he had access to the information.  If you sell shares on a Wednesday and on the following Monday they double or treble&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>They rarely do things like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you are selling shares on a Wednesday at £100 and on the following Monday they go up to £1,000, on the Monday when you discover what has happened you can sit back and say: &ldquo;Hold on.  I am a victim here and I will take a case.&rdquo;  Obviously, you have got to find out who caused this to happen.  Once you know who caused this to happen &mdash; obviously something caused it to happen because somebody bought the shares &mdash; you could then claim in court that you were a victim, that you had suffered that £900 loss, for example, because you sold without information which was available to another person at that very time and was not available to you.  The court may conclude that you did not really lose because there was not an inside trader operation, or whatever, but it can also conclude that you were right.  You could have said: &ldquo;If I had known that last Wednesday I would not have sold but what I did not know was that there was a person inside the company who knew that information and was a trader and I can now prove that there was an insider trader.  The shares were bought.  Therefore, I lost because of that inside trader.&rdquo;  It works the other way as well.  I would speculate that that is the view a court would take.  In any civil action for damages or compensation you must show you lost and that you lost because of an insider trader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incredibly difficult to prove that because there could be a completely innocent transaction.  You could have sold to another party who did not <Col N="749" /> have any inside knowledge at all and then you would be maintaining that you were deprived of information while there were other parallel deals going on between insiders and other innocent parties.  I suggest it will be impossible to prove.  If anybody maintains this and takes a civil action the defence will be that this person took the initiatve in selling.  Nobody will have been persuaded by an insider to actually sell direct to them.  That is not how the market works.  They will be selling to a market maker because of a voluntary decision of their own.  If you take a civil action when you have made a voluntary decision and have not been induced and, indeed, had no contact at all with the insider, which is how it will happen, it will almost certainly fail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you took a certain course of action without the knowledge that there was an insider trader who was about to cause a heavy loss because of thier inside information a court could conclude that you lost.  The other point is that it is not a matter of linking the buyer and seller.  I know that is not the way the market works because you sell to a pool.  The onus would be on the person taking the case (a) to show that they lost and (b) to show that they lost because there was an inside trader at work.  It is a matter of satisfying the court that you have suffered a loss because of this kind of activity.  There may not be a direct link obviously when you take the case.  The onus is on you to show to the satisfaction of the court that there is a direct link and that, had that person not been operating as an inside trader, you would not have sold those shares and, therefore, not have suffered that loss.  It is a civil action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very difficult area because you are dealing with knowledge and state of knowledge and proving people had knowledge.  Other jurisdictions have somewhat similar ways of dealing with the problem.  It may not be that impossible in the sense that, if you demonstrate to a court of law that you have suffered a loss and you can further demonstrate why you suffered that loss and you can <Col N="750" /> further demonstrate the person who was behind the loss, you are getting close to making a very good case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister's point.  I do not think there is any further we can go on this.  It should be impossible to prove a civil case if there is a case.  There is no point in arguing about it.  That is a matter for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we leave the section I am not clear on how it operates. I am worried about the level or the power of discovery that a court in a civil action would have in this kind of situation. Would the insider trading have been proved by the internal investigation of the Stock Exchange and would that be the evidence of insider trading?  I agree with what Senator Ross has said.  There seems to be a very tenuous link between the person who is responsible for the change in price and the taking of a case against someone who might not even be known.</P>
      <P>The only way I can see this happening would be if there was an internal investigation of the Stock Exchange and they found that that person was guilty of insider trading.  Having established that fact through the internal operations of the market, somebody might be in a position to take a case.  If I were to take a case against a named person working in the Stock Exchange, or working in a company which deals in the Stock Exchange, could I or the courts have access to the information?  Can they seek disclosure? Can they seek discovery?  Is there a power of discovery or how does that legislation work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I want to make which also refers to Senator Ross's point regarding the question of a civil case being difficult.  It would clearly be much easier if there had been a criminal conviction.  Civil cases will come up in the next section but I suppose there is a link there.  If a criminal case is taken and proved, obviously a civil case would be an easier arrangement for anyone to consider taking because they would have <Col N="751" /> a lot of the evidence.  In the absence of a criminal case I want to stress that the civil case is totally parallel and is a matter for the individual citizen.  I would imagine that the usual discovery orders which are available in any civil action would be available here also.  When taking a case you would be entitled to seek certain information but I will double check that. I am reasonably certain that the normal discovery orders which you can make in a civil case would apply here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem because I do not see any way in a civil action in which the buyer and the seller will be connected because they will be dealing through an intermediary and they will have no direct contact whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not need to have direct contact.  If you can show that you have suffered a loss because of an action by another person and you can satisfy the court that that is the position, you have a case.  You do not have to have direct contact.  I do not think it is envisaged that you would buy X's shares specifically but if you held shares in a company and certain things happened to those shares because of an inside trader, you might have grounds for a civil case.</P>
      <P>The important thing here is that all we are talking about is a person who has shares in a public company and feels that has suffered loss because of the actions of an inside trader.  It is entirely a civil case.  That person has got to to to court and has to prove that to the court.  I take the Senator's point that that is an impossible thing to prove to a court. Obviously we have got to take that on board.  It is something that I would like the lawyers to look at again for me.  I would be surprised if some of our legal people were not able to make a very strong case in the event that I suffered a loss and could then subsequently show that I lost that money because of the activities of somebody inside the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so sure it would be as difficult a case to make as the Senator might think <Col N="752" /> but I will consult the lawyers again on the point.  It is very much a tight legal question, a question of establishing that you have suffered damage.  I am not clear on whether you have to show directly that you suffered it in a direct link with the individual.  It is enough at this stage to show that you suffered it because of an individual and his actions.  I will double check that point for the Senator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The real point is that in a transaction of this sort almost inevitably the initiative for buying or selling from the innocent party will come from himself and he will only be an innocent party because he is a participant in that large market out there.  I suspect that, in nearly all cases of insider dealing, those who are exploited by the insider dealing are only exploited because they are in the market and they would have taken that action anyway.  A civil action is impossible to take or to prove in this case because the initiative comes from the innocent party who would have done that whether the insider was in the market or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the person know at that time that the insider trader was in the market?  It would be up to the court to decide.  You might say you would have sold earlier but if you can prove to the court that you would not have sold because you had not information which was at that moment available to an inside trader &mdash; say there was going to be a takeover bid next Monday and on the Wednesday you sold your shares and the insider trader knew about the takeover deal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, anybody who sold and lost money and at that moment there was an insider trade at work.  If you could show to the court that perhaps you would not have sold had you the information which that inside trader had, you are in a very difficult legal area and I better be careful about speculating on the record.</P>

      <P>I intended to bring this up on section 92 (1) (a), that is where it is dealt with.  I can see the argument on both sides.  It will be very difficult to determine the loss incurred and to identify each and every individual shareholder who may be affected.  I was going to question whether it should be actually left in place because of this and whether it had a worthwhile part to play in the Bill but, listening to the arguments, I can see that these civil cases will be very rare and few and far between.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ross said earlier, the size of the transaction and the amount of money that can be made on these transactions in a very short time can be enormous and possibly, if there is a very substantial amount of money and if somebody feels he has lost millions because of an insider dealing in the market, he might welcome the fact that this has been left in the Bill and gives him recourse to the courts in that instance.  I can see these cases being brought very rarely.  As I say, somebody who has lost that substantial amount of money would be glad that it had been left there.  I can see the difficulties in identifying it.  It might be easier to identify millions rather than thousands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a straightforward drafting amendment.  Section 91 (6) prohibits a company dealing if any of its officers are themselves prohibited. The effect of the present section 93 (1) (a) is, among other things, to exempt the obtaining by a director of his share qualification in his company from this general prohibition.  This obtaining of a share qualification is a common stipulation in a company's articles of association. However, an exemption from subsection (6) is not necessary in this case since the director of a company could not be a body corporate anyway under section 176 of the 1963 Act, so it simply could not arise that a body corporate would have to obtain a director's share certificate.  The net effect of this amendment, therefore, is to make the obtaining of a share qualification by a director exempt from subsections (1) and (3) only of section 91.</P>

I have read it a few times.  I am not speaking speculatively.  It appears to me that it would be possible that the pensions funds in particular would be able to use information which nobody else would be allowed to use simply because they were acting on behalf of the employees of the company. Let us not pretend that pensions funds operate in a totally benevolent atmosphere for the benefit of the people on whose behalf they manage the funds. They are in it to make a few bob and if they can make a few bob they will.

I would not for one second argue with the Minister about it if he can tell me what it means.  When I read it and reread it, I could not put any other interpretation on it.

      <P>In page 83, before section 94, but in Part V of the Bill, to insert a new section as follows:</P>

      <P>This is one of the major amendments which, as I mentioned at the outset of today's preceedings, provide for the criminalisation of insider dealing and the introduction of an enforcement role for the Stock Exchange.  This is very much the kernel of this whole Part of the Companies (No. 2) Bill.  Taken together, they will greatly improve and strengthen the effectiveness of Part V of the Bill which deals with insider dealing.  The amendments concerned are a considerable response to the commonly expressed view that the present civil proposals do not go far enough.</P>
      <P>I would like to say that the section introduced by this first new section will simply make unlawful dealing within the meaning of section 91 a criminal offence. Because of the nature of insider dealing, however, there is no real point in criminalising it without devising an enforcement mechanism and this is provided for in the other new sections which I am proposing today that I should add to Part V of the Bill.  This very much is the core Government amendment which, in fact, criminalises the insider dealing.</P>

These automatic consequences arise in two situations. First of all, where a person has been convicted of insider dealing under this part of the Bill, he will be prohibited from any further dealing, as defined in section 90, for a period of 12 months from the date of his conviction.  Secondly, if, despite such a prohibition, such a person does deal and is convicted of an offence under this new section for doing so, he will be automatically prohibited from dealing for a further 12 months from the date of the second conviction.</P>
      <P>The risk of the sanction I am proposing here would be quite a significant extra deterrent to insider dealing and that area. It is one thing to be fined heavily for such dealing, but it is quite another to face automatic disqualification from dealing in the market for a year.  I suppose what I am trying to do here really is to hit the insider where I know it hurts, which is in the pocket.</P>

      <P>This is a very fine amendment. I have not thought about it before. I am just thinking about it now.  Will this apply in cases where the person is holding rights, warrants and options at the time of conviction, in other words, transactions which may have to be closed at a certain time, where he will have to take up an option within a certain time afterwards, or whether he has warrants to subscribe the shares?  I am literally just thinking on my feet at this moment.  You can prohibit him from dealing but he will possibly hold rights or receive rights in the meantime. What happens in that case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a pretty technical one.  The definition of dealing on page 79 says, &ldquo;&lsquo;dealing&rsquo; in relation to securities, means... acquiring, disposing of, subscribing for or underwriting . .&rdquo; If you have an option at a certain point, then you will be prohibited from subsequently acquiring the benefit of that option.  That is my thinking on it just now, but I will have to come back on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is the way I would interpret it right now.  If I find that not to be the case, I will make sure the record is properly corrected.  Our intention in regard to &ldquo;acquiring&rdquo; under section 90 is that the acquiring is from the date that you acquire the shares.  You do not acquire them when you get the option.  You get the option to acquire.</P>

      <P>What happens if the particular individual is short of stocks which is the type of situation he might be in? This type of individual could be short of stock at the time.  He would be under an obligation to buy that stock back and to forbid him to deal in this situation seems completely unreasonable because he would have to buy stock back to square <Col N="760" /> the situation.  It is the first time I have looked at this amendment, but I suspect a blanket deal will close off options for him which would make it more difficult for the Stock Exchange and for himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had better look at the words here again.  The clear intention is to stop automatically dealing.  We are talking here about at what point can you stop the dealing.  One view which makes some sense but may not be legally the right thing to do is to say you allow people to complete a transaction which they are legally bound to complete.  If you are legally locked in, perhaps you should be allowed to complete that transaction legally.  Against that you have to be careful that that is not used as a loophole out of the 12 months business, that people start devising legal situations where they are legally imposing restrictions on themselves to complete a deal. The Senator and I have exactly the same intention here which is to make sure that urgently and immediately we stop the dealing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

It comes at a later stage about companies that are wound up.  Is there a case to be made that a register of persons who are prohibited from dealing should be available to all outlets where people could be envisaged to be buying shares?  If both Visa and Access can supply every retailer in the country with a list of the numbers of cards that are stolen or lost, it seems to be not impossible to provide every outlet for the purchase of shares with a list of persons who are prohibited from dealings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to understand how this would operate in practice. My first instinct is the same as Senator Ryan's in that if somebody is found guilty he should not be back in the market place ever again.  The more I think about it the more I figure that it may be in some sense unfair.  There should be a punishment to fit the crime but when people get through their period of punishment they should be in a position to rehabilitate themselves.</P>
      <P>I am trying to establish whether there is a danger that by saying this person will only be prevented from dealing for one year, you are actually protecting that person?  Could that be interpreted as a restriction on the internal controls of the Stock Exchange?  The Stock Exchange might want to say in certain instances of insider trading, assuming that they would not all be of similar severity or that the offences could be judged by the amount of money involved, &ldquo;having examined the case in front of us we do not think this person is a fit person ever again to deal in the Stock Exchange&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A person can seek access to or redress from the law.  Under the terms of this Bill the maximum period for which a person might be deprived of dealing is one year. Therefore, the Stock Exchange or other control could not implement a more serious restriction.  If that is the case I would be very worried about it.  The market might have its own levels and find its own controls and it would be a pity if the one counteracted the other.  I suspect that, should it go through a court of law, people would interpret what was enacted as being the criterion by which it should be judged.  If the law says, &ldquo;We forbid a person from dealing for a full year&rdquo;., could the domestic remedy that might be available within the Stock Market impose a longer period of expulsion?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> (2) For the purpose of obtaining any information necessary for the exercise by a relevant authority of such exchange of the function referred to in section 98, an authorised person may, on production of his authorisation if so required, require any person whom he or such relevant authority has reasonable cause to believe to have dealt in securities, or to have any information about such dealings, to give the authorised person any information which he may reasonably require in regard to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the securities concerned,</P>
    <P>(b) the company which issued the securities,</P>
    <P>(c) his dealings in such securities, or</P>
    <P>(d) any other information the authorised person reasonably requires in relation to such securities or such dealings,</P>
    <P>and give him such access to and facilities for inspecting and taking copies of any documents relating to the matter as he reasonably requires.</P>
    <P>(3) Every document purporting to be a warrant or authorisation and to be signed or authenticated by or on behalf of a relevant authority shall be received in evidence and shall be deemed to be such warrant or authorisation without further proof until the contrary is shown.</P>
    <P>(4) An authorised person, or any person on whom he has made a requirement under this section, may apply to the court for a declaration under this section.</P>

    <P>(b) that the exigencies of the common good do so warrant.</P>
    <P>(6) Where the court makes a declaration under subsection (5) (a), the authorised person shall, as soon as may be, withdraw the relevant requirement under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the new section 99 which is available.  This is the sixth new section which we are proposing to add to Part V of the Bill.  Since we are proposing in the previous new section to create an enforcement role for the Stock Exchange under this Part, we then have to give the exchange a statutory basis to establish the information on which it might ground its referral of suspicious cases to the DPP.  This section enables the exchange, with the concurrence of the Minister, to appoint authorised persons to investigate suspicious cases and give such people the necessary powers to establish the required information.  Of course, if a case is sufficiently clearcut, there may be no need to appoint authorised officers but it is likely, in the vast majority of cases, that some inquiries will have to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> However, because this approach of giving investigative powers to a non-State authority is a bit unusual and to avoid any suggestions of abuse of power by such a body, we though it prudent to build in a kind of referral role for the court. Subsection (4), therefore, allows either the authorised officer or the person who is the subject of his investigation to apply to the court for a decision as to whether the exigencies of the common good require that the information should be given.  If the court decides that the common good does not require the information to be given, the request must be withdrawn &mdash; that is in subsection (6). On the other hand, if the court upholds the request as being in the public interest the person concerned must give the information &mdash; subsection (7) &mdash; and will be subject to contempt of court if he does not &mdash; subsection (8).</P>
    <P>The authorised person will be empowered by subsection (2) to require information from any person whom he or a relevant authority of the exchange considers may be able to help him in regard to dealings in security.  He can acquire information in regard to the securities concerned, the companies which issued the securities, a person's dealing in such securities and any other related information. There could be situations where a person under investigation refuses to give information to an authorised person within a reasonable time despite a court direction, thereby frustrating the whole intention of this section.  Subsection (8) provides, therefore, that the authorised person can come back to the court and that the court can treat the refusal as contempt.  This is a much better approach than making the refusal an offence punishable solely by fine and/or imprisonment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This section which covers authorised people means, so far as I can see, a person who is appointed by the Stock Exchange.  In effect, it is a person who is appointed by the relevant authority who are in one way or another, arms of the Stock Exchange.  It would be very helpful if this person was not a member <Col N="769" /> of the Stock Exchange and was not in any way connected with the company and the transactions involved.  In order to protect the Stock Exchange, this person should be seen to be at arm's length.  We have already touched on the subject of self-regulation and the Stock Exchange being defensive about insider dealing, about the Stock Exchange protecting itself.</P>
      <P>It seems very logical that this person who is going to investigate this should not be a member of the Stock Exchange and should have as little connection with the financial world as possible.  In other words, he should be seen to be impartial. We have only had these amendments for a day, so I have not put down an amendment to this amendment.  I ask the Minister to consider whether it is possible to put certain restrictions on who this person should be so that he will be seen to be unconnected with those who appoint him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister or the Government given any thought to who would pay the salary of an individual such as this?  With whom would the person's contract be?  Would it be with the relevant authority?  Would the person himself or herself be precluded from dealing in stocks and shares?  It appears to me that in many other areas of life an investigator would be precluded, because of a possible conflict of interest, from dealing in the business which he or she was supposed to examine.  I can think of a number of areas where people are precluded because of a possible conflict of interest. Even in trivial things such as the competitions which are run on the backs of cornflakes packets the employees of the sponsoring company are precluded from participating.  I would find it rather peculiar if somebody who had the major job of investigating the proper behaviour of the Stock Exchange was permitted to participate in the activities of the Stock Exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the person be dismissed and, if so, by whom and in what circumstances?  If the Stock Exchange chooses to dismiss the person, what can the Minister do about it?  He may choose to refuse to <Col N="770" /> employ another person.  I do not want to accuse people of too much but, if the Stock Exchange does not like the way the authorised person is doing his or her business, it may choose to get rid of him or her.  What can be done about it?  I would like the have answers to these questions because this authorised person is central to the whole situation.  His role needs to be defined and teased out in greater detail.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister has the power to make supplementary regulations. It would be useful if the Minister, either now or when we come to amendment No. 132, were to explain some of this thinking.  It is extremely important that the authorised person should be seen to be independent and secure.  For instance, he should not be capable of being dismissed by the revelant authority without the approval of the Minister. Otherwise, the person will feel permanently under threat.  Far be it for me to be the author of a revamping of the image of the Stock Exchange, but if we are endeavouring to create the public perception that the Stock Exchange is operated according to a reasonable set of standards, it is extremely important that the person who is given the basic role of regulating the behaviour of the Stock Exchange should be seen and should be perceived to be separate and independent. We have provided in our Constitution that the Judiciary may not be put under any pressure by the Executive in order to ensure their independence.  A similar protection ought to be given to this authorised person in the legislation if he or she is to be seen and perceived by the public to do the job they are expected to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Senator's points.  I think they are covered to the extent that the section clearly states that in this section &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; means a person authorised in writing by a relevant authority or recognised Stock Exchange and approved by the Minister. So the Minister would have to approve formally an authorised person.  I make that very clear.  It is not left entirely to <Col N="771" /> the Stock Exchange.  I think the Minister would take into account the views expressed by the Oireachtas now that the person should be as independent as possible.  The Minister would be watching out carefully.  The reason we have the provision here is to make sure that there is no &ldquo;old pals&rdquo; act in the business.</P>
      <P>With regard to the terms, the payment of expenses and the termination of a person's job in that area, Senators can see that the section says &ldquo;a person authorised in writing&rdquo;.  My own assumption would be that in that writing the terms of the engagement would be laid out, which would cover items such as expenses, remuneration, possible termination and any other conditions which the exchange wanted to lay down before submitting it to the Minister.</P>

It appears from the way subsection (1) of what is to be section 99 is written that the authorised person means a person authorised in writing by a relevant authority and approved by the Minister.  If the person authorised in writing by a relevant authority has that written authorisation withdrawn by the relevant authority, is there anything the Minister can do about it?  It appears that as it stands, there is not.  It seems to frustrate the intent if the Minister cannot say to the Stock Exchange: &ldquo;No, I will not approve of your withdrawing this person's authorisation&rdquo;.  Apparently, as it stands, the Minister cannot do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Further, to clarify the position of the authorised person for the purpose of this section, it is a novel position. Under this section a person can be appointed in writing to carry out the purposes of the section and that is to obtain information.  It does not, as the Minister has conceded, relate at all to <Col N="772" /> either the terms and conditions under which an authorised person would hold the position.  Senator Ryan has raised an important question in that regard.  Nor does it deal with the question of the necessity to apply to court for a declaration. Who would bear the costs of that?  Is it the Stock Exchange?  Is it the Minister because he has approved the authorisation who would bear any costs that might be incurred?  I do not quite understand the circumstances in which an authorised person might apply to the court for a declaration under the section. Is it envisaged that an authorised person would apply if somebody refused to co-operate? Or, would an authorised person apply, if it became necessary to exercise the powers, for a declaration that these were necessary or the exigencies of the common good warranted them being exercised?</P>
      <P>I can foresee circumstances where the authorised person might look for information from somebody who was completely innocent of any possible allegations being made and pursued and who would submit or furnish the information requested.  I would have thought that, if anybody was the recipient of a letter, or a request, or whatever form the matter might take, from an authorised officer seeking the type of information set out in subsection (2), the likely result would be failure to respond.  Is it in those circumstances that the authorised officer would seek a declaration?  It is easier to see a situation where somebody would seek a declaration that the exercise by the authorised person was not in fact warranted by the exigencies of the common good.  One could see somebody going to court to protect himself from having to respond to the request for detailed information from the authorised officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am not as clear on is how the Minister envisages that the authorised officer may find it necessary to go to court and get a declaration in order to exercise the powers.  It would be helpful to clarify that because that would again tease out the actual working conditions of an authorised officer.  It is necessary for the Minister, <Col N="773" /> if he is going to have an entity like an authorised officer of this kind, to take on to himself the statutory power to describe the conditions under which authorised officers may be employed.  It seems as though it is going to be necessary to have power to regulate that, perhaps by statutory instrument, so that there is a standardising in relation to the terms under which an authorised officer could then be authorised in writing by the Stock Exchange and approved by the Minister. Such an officer would then hold the position on whatever terms were prescribed by the Minister under the section.  Without that, there is going to be a great deal of confusion about the role of the authorised officer.  What happens if the Stock Exchange no longer authorises in writing?  What happens if the person has incurred expenses in going to court for declarations and so on?  There are some points to be clarified.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the ineffective and uncaring approach adopted by the Government in resolving the plight of the Irish (out of status) emigrants in the US, especially in view of repeated and unambiguous assurances given by the present Government when in Opposition and requests that the Government uses all in its resources to:</P>
      <P>1. obtain support in the US Houses of Congress for legislative initiatives to change their status;</P>
      <P>2. establish as a matter of urgency support and advice centres in New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco;</P>
      <P>3. supply support for Irish emigrants in the United States similar to that supplied by the Department of Labour to Irish emigrants in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party are moving this motion in the House this evening because the crisis for the undocumented, out of status young Irish emigrants in the United States looms larger by the day.  Over the past nine months much hope has been raised regarding the easement of the very precarious situation of the young Irish in America by the legislative initiatives in the US Houses of Congress.  The US Immigration Bill, 1987, popularly known as the Kennedy-Donnelly Bill, was introduced in the American Senate in the latter half of 1987.  Basically the intent of this Bill is to correct the discrimination and imbalances which arise out of the US Immigration Act, 1965.  We should say in passing that the 1965 Immigration Act &mdash; its main author was a well-known Irish-American politician, Robert Kennedy as Attorney General &mdash; set out to change what was seen as a bias in the US immigration law and the Act really did change the principles of immigration into the United States.  Prior to this, the law discriminated in favour of the older European countries who provided most of the <Col N="775" /> white settlers on the North American Continent in the 18th and the 19th centuries. The 1965 Act abolished this and abolished the principle of national origins, and gave a bias towards people from the eastern hemisphere.  It reversed the trend away from the countries from which the great masses and waves of emigration had originally come.</P>
    <P>Since literally millions of Irish people settled in the United States in the 200 years of main settlement, this country was well favoured by the earlier legislation governing immigration in to the United States, that is, the Acts of 1924 and of 1952.  However, in 1965 the principles upon which American immigration was based were changed and an immigration ceiling of 290,000 persons was fixed per annum to enter the United States &mdash; 120,000 immigrants from the western hemisphere and 170,000 from the East or from the oriental world.</P>
    <P>However, the new rules hardly affected Ireland at all since this was the era of economic change in this country. It was the first time in well over a century that the flow of emigration was stemmed. The number of people wishing to leave and live in the United States fell off to a trickle.  We were not using the quota we could have legally taken up under the new 1965 Act.  That was the case for several years after that.  However, the economic downturn which commenced in the late seventies changed all that.  In addition, there was the radically altered demographic profile in the country.  For the first time in generations a greater proportion of the population was in the age group 15 to 35 years.  This was the result of a growing population and the relative prosperity of the sixties and most of the early seventies on this island.</P>
    <P>By the early eighties well over half the population was under 25 years of age. They were the very numerous generation, the product of the baby boom of the early sixties.  They were all well-educated and trained because of radical changes in our education policy in the sixties and seventies which ensured that we spent a very high proportion of our <Col N="776" /> national income on education particularly beyond primary level, with all the various trainings in the new technologies, etc.  In that period, incidentally, we were spending a greater proportion of our GDP than any other country in Europe on education.  This was right and proper and, above all, it was highly enlightened. Alas there the enlightenment ended, because little was done to ensure that the Irish economy would be developed in such a way that it would provide jobs, careers and a satisfying lifestyle for most of the young people here at home.</P>
    <P>Many experts, including politicians, pointed from the mid-seventies at the enormous problems we would face in providing sufficient work and job opportunities for the children of the boom of the early sixties who would be young adults in the early eighties.  Towards the end of the seventies an economic madness was embarked upon in this country that has no parallel outside of the disaster of Mao Tse-tung's great leap forward.  At the very time in our economic development when we should have been making special provision for the future of these young people by prudent investment and spending policies, we embarked instead on a wild orgy of overspending, irresponsible borrowing and the casting out of all the usual norms of economic management. All this quickly gave us the highest inflation rate among our competitors and the most adverse national debt outside the worst examples in Latin America, and an investment in everything except the productive area.</P>
    <P>Very rapidly we had mass factory closures, job shedding in successful industries and no job opportunities for the tens of thousands of new entrants onto the job market.  Then in the great Irish tradition, tens of thousands of our young people, particularly from 1982 onwards, took the boat and the plane to the United States and many of them went to the United Kingdom thus re-introducing the phenomenon of mass emigration.  In the United States, except for a small elite handful, the vast majority were illegal or out of status, because of the terms and <Col N="777" /> complexities of American immigration law.</P>
    <P>The 1965 Act gave emphasis and priority to family reunification.  If you were the son or daughter of an Irish emigrant who had become an American citizen you had ready and easy access to the United States.  Similarly, the brother or the sister of an established citizen in the US had ready and easy access.  This category had preference in getting citizenship or a work permit to go and live in the United States.  That was the family reunification preference.  All this would have worked well for the Irish had there not been a stem in the flow of emigrants to the United States in the mid-sixties.  That stem in the flow effectively meant that there was a whole generation when hardly any Irish had moved to the US, unlike the previous 100 years when there was a constant flow.  There were very few citizens in the US who were born in Ireland, had emigrated and had become US citizens and who could then claim their brothers or sisters, or their sons, daughters, or other close relatives.  In the decade before the reform, that is 1955-65, approximately 50,000 Irish people entered and settled in the US legally but in the decade following the 1965 Act, that is 1965-75, only about 10,000 people moved from Ireland and settled legally in the US.  Sadly, it is now estimated that there are at least 150,000 young Irish who have gone there since 1982, who are undocumented or illegal, and their position was never more threatened or more precarious than it is now.</P>
    <P>Recently, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in the United States, based in Washington, issued the results of a survey which was carried out on a broad representative sample of young Irish emigrants found in most of the major industrial cities in the US.  The survey shows that about 70 per cent of them left Ireland because there were no jobs available for them here, and the remaining 30 per cent left because of a feeling of frustration with the economy and with the standard of living in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Why has the optimism which was so prevalent up to two months ago about <Col N="778" /> the prospect for the typical Irish non-documented emigrant started to wane so rapidly?  The main reason is, I suppose, that the Immigration Bill, 1987, which passed so well in the Senate by a majority of 95 votes to five, has now started to languish and to falter in the House of Representatives.  Many observers feel, and I am quite sure rightly, that this Bill has no chance of passage before the presidential and general election in the US in November.  If it has not been passed by then, the legislation dies.  The success in the Senate will be put at nil since, if a similar Bill is to be re-introduced in the next Congress, the same painstaking process will have to start over again in the Senate and it may not be successful the next time around.  There is the added difficulty that this kind of legislation has to be discussed by a House of Representatives Judiciary Committee chaired by a liberal friend of this kind of legislation, Congressman Rudino.  Congressman Rudino will be retiring from active politics and from the House in November, and his successor may not be so friendly towards this kind of legislation.</P>
    <P>Let us be mindful at this stage, of course, that the Kennedy-Donnelly Bill will have a very small impact in easing the situation of the tens of thousands of immigrants who have been living illegally in the States since the last amnesty.  The last amnesty, incidentally, was the result of the 1986 Immigration and Reform and Control Bill and it gave amnesty to all illegal immigrants who had settled in the United States before 1982.  The 1987 Bill, now in the House of Representatives, provides for the creation of 50,000 additional visas for people wishing to enter the US from the older sources of emigration, that is, countries like Ireland, Italy, France, Germany etc.  It is estimated that we would qualify for approximately 10,000 of these visas in each year, if we were lucky.  Of course, these visas would apply only to young people at present here in Ireland and who wish to leave for the United States, or so it seems.</P>

      <P>Much has been said about the great benefit this will be to the young people already in the US, undocumented or illegal.  It is claimed that they can return to Ireland and make an application for one of these visas and they will be considered in conjunction with all the other applicants who have not already left this country.  There is considerable doubt about this.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Minister that one's passport is stamped when leaving the country.  It is stamped when one is entering the United States and it is also stamped when one is leaving the country again.  All of the people we are talking about will be found to have overstayed the limits of their visa as issued.  This constitutes an immigration offence under US law.  It is very doubtful that these people would be considered for any of those new visas because they may be considered as having committed an offence under US immigration law.  The Minister might take that point on board. From that point of view, it is absolutely useless to the young people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who are already there.  On top of that there is the problem created for young people in America by the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act.  The effect of this law is very effectively to close one of the last avenues of illegal entry into the United States since it requires employers to hire only citizens of the United States, or aliens who are authorised to work in the USA, i.e., those holding the Green Card.  The employer is bound by this law to verify the legal employment status of all his employees.  He must keep a full record of them and this record must be available at all times for presentation and examination by officials of the United States <Col N="780" /> Immigration and Naturalisation Service. If an employer is found in breach of this law, he can be fined up to 10,000 dollars for each unlawful employee.  The unfortunate immigrant who, of necessity, may be forced to make an untrue statement, or use improper documents in order to gain employment, could be imprisoned for up to five years or heavily fined, and of course, he would face deportation. This Act comes into the full force of law on 1 June next.  One can easily imagine the apprehension and fear that will lead to for so many young people.  If something is not done to create an amnesty for these 150,000 people whom the legislation under debate can hardly help because of the relatively few it can reach to start with, many immigrants will be fearful to make an application for these visas because it might reveal their overstay and all that might entail for them.</P>
      <P>The 1986 Reform and Control Act had in it an amnesty principle, but provision was made, as we have said before, for people who had entered the US illegally prior to January 1982.  A Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy was established in the United States in 1981.  They reported two years later and, as a result of their report, the 1986 Bill was introduced.  The Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy estimated that in 1982, there were 3.5 million illegal immigrants living in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time allowed for people to apply for the amnesty extended from the date of the passage of the Bill in 1986 to 4 May 1988, today.  It now seems that fewer than half of the people who are eligible for this amnesty have applied since it looks as if approximately only 1.5 million illegal aliens have sought the amnesty.  It is a good two million persons short of the expected number.  Of course, since most of the out of status emigrants in the US arrived after 1982, this amnesty has no beneficial effect on their situation.  The great shortfall in the number who might have applied for the amnesty &mdash; as we have pointed out two million short of the <Col N="781" /> expected figure, or at least the eligible figure according to the report of the commission &mdash; has greatly diminished the problem for the US immigration authorities. We should now immediately be pleading with the United States legislators, and I mean we should be pleading at every level, particularly at the level of Government to Government, for an extension of this amnesty.  We should ask, if at all possible, that it be extended to 1986.  This would in a single act solve the problem for thousands perhaps, in excess of 100,000 young Irish immigrants now living in limbo land, with no security in the United States.  When we call for an extension we should not be calling for an extension for the Irish alone, but for all the other nationalities who were living in the US since 1982. There is no doubt that the Irish would have a greater proportion of benefit from such an extension than any other ethnic group.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a back-bench committee of my own party which is studying the effects and problems of emigration. It is chaired by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry.  Our committee has lobbied and called for an extension of this amnesty on a number of occasions, but I am not aware of any other body in this country doing likewise. It is particularly sad that we have no evidence that the present Government have done anything in seeking this particular concession.  The Government do not seem to be aware of the special opportunity created by the major shortfall in the number of eligible applicants for the amnesty.  We in this party by this motion now call on this Government immediately to take advantage of this opportunity, even at this very late stage, and to formally request the US congressional leaders, particularly that group known as The Friends of Ireland, actively and sympathetically to consider an extension, especially in the light of the fact that there will be fewer problems resulting from the two million fewer seeking the amnesty than the commission report suggested.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> Our motion also calls on the Government to establish support and advice centres in the major cities where you find most of the young immigrant Irish.  This is absolutely urgent, given their fears, the dearth of information on any legal rights they may have, exploitation by unscrupulous employers &mdash; and there are plenty of those &mdash; and health care etc.  The typical problem and fear experienced by the illegal Irish immigrant is the problem and fear in the workplace because he or she is undocumented.  They must accept working conditions imposed upon them. Some of them are exploited, almost blackmailed, by unscrupulous employers. Many work long and unsocial hours and for rates far less than those rates available to documented or legal aliens.  There is no social insurance to cushion them in the event of losing their job, or in the event of illness or an accident at work.</P>
    <P>I have known instances of young immigrants having fallen ill who were afraid to go into hospital because they would have to identify themselves and, as a result of improper and inadequate treatment, had to return home very seriously ill.  They have the awful feeling of insecurity about the money they earn, where to keep it since they cannot open bank accounts without a Green Card.  Even the cashing of their pay cheques present a problem.  Since they cannot use the banking system, they are forced to cash their wages in bars or in establishments where alcoholic drink or perhaps worse is served.  This draws many young, vulnerable people into an atmosphere or a milieu that is most undesirable.  There is a pressure on them, because they feel under a compliment for having their wages cheque cashed, to be drawn into the drink culture.  There is also the ordinary temptation to imbibe to excess purely because of the necessity to have that most essential service of having their cheque changed into hard cash, which is what keeps their bodies and souls together.  The greatest fear of all is the omnipresent apprehension of deportation, the knock on the door to reveal the visit of the immigration official, or <Col N="783" /> the approach of a stranger to the workplace who turns out to be an investigating officer from the US Naturalisation and Immigration Department.  Those fears are all the more heightened and all the more real now with the coming into effect on 1 June next of all the quotas contained in the Immigration Reform and Control Act, 1986, This is the legislation.</P>

      <P>This year should have presented us with our greatest opportunity to help our people in America.  It is an election year but it looks now as if we may have thrown away the opportunity.  The visits of our own Government Ministers to the US have borne few results and one visit, that of the Minister of State at the Department of Education was a disastrous comedy, a foot in the mouth blunder of errors if I may say so too.</P>

      <P>It was Deputy Barry, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, who used his good standing with the Irish-American politicians on Capitol Hill to bring about the only tangible help &mdash; the Kennedy-Donnelly Bill.  Granted the uncertainty given the long delay in knowing who would be the Democratic candidate for the Presidency did not help, but that alone did not stand in the way of greater effort to help this lost generation, for a lost generation to this country they are. The greater part of this generation now abroad might never have felt the need to leave if ten years ago we had taken courageous political steps to prepare this economy to absorb them in gainful employment at home, instead of looking to the short term at the time.  The Government did the opposite by bribing the electorate with their own money and colossal sums of borrowed money, borrowed in their own name, resulting in the creation of a totally dislocated economy devoid of any career opportunity for the present generation of job seekers and resulting in mass emigration.</P>

At that time they called on the newly elected Government to take appropriate and presumably immediate action to help to alleviate the situation of the undocumented Irish in the United States.  We have to admit that what has happened since has been little and disappointing.</P>
      <P>We referred to a group of people sometimes called the undocumented persons, sometimes called the unextended, sometimes called the out of status or, in other words, illegal aliens.  Their numbers are hard to clarify.  As Senator Connor stated, we are speaking in the main about the people who emigrated to the United States between the years 1982 and 1987 because those are the people at present most severely hit and those are the people whom no present legislation seems certain to cater for.  They are amongst a lost generation, but that lost generation is part of the grouping we so often refer to as our greatest natural resource and our greatest natural asset.  These highly qualified, highly educated young people unfortunately find themselves, through no fault of their own but through the fault of Irish politicians not just today or yesterday but down through the years, having to seek not their fame and fortune but their simple livelihood abroad.  Our failure to provide them with an adequate living here on this island makes it all the more important for us to ensure that their present status and their present livelihood are made as comfortable and as safe as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that it is the United Stated we are discussing tonight when we are discussing the difficulties of Irish emigrants abroad, because no country has benefited more from Irish immigrants than the United States.  No country has been built up more from its very roots than the United States has been by Irish immigrants.  The signs outside many businesses in the United States a century ago read: &ldquo;Help wanted; no Irish need <Col N="787" /> apply&rdquo;.  That attitude changed.  Many Irish people became prominent in business, prominent in the labour movement, prominent in politics, and they went on to develop and have a huge influence on that nation.  I do not think we can expect any favours from the United States because of our history down through the years, good as it is.  Obviously there are many other ethnic groups throughout the United States who feel that they have an equal right to special attention as of now.</P>
    <P>The people of whom we are speaking now, are earning an honest living in the United States at present.  They are not taking anything out of the economy.  They are not living on social welfare.  They are not net beneficiaries of any United States Government funds.  Instead they are net contributors to the United States economy. They are wanted out there by the employers who are employing them. They are contributing further to the building of the United States.  It is sad and ironic that these people who are actually wanted by their employers to further build and enhance the economy of the United States are being pressurised and almost frightened into returning home.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know the numbers we speak of.  They vary from 100,000 to 120,000 to 150,000 people.  We have to make this group a priority as of now. There has been much lip-service paid to them, not just at home but also abroad. We can quote various speeches by politicians in Opposition not just over the past year but over the past number of years.  It is amazing how something which seems so solvable from the Opposition benches becomes very much unsolvable once you take the reins of power.</P>
    <P>Another group with a major role to play and in whom I am very disappointed are the Irish-American politicians.  We always tend to judge United States politicians on their greenness.  The greener they are in relation to matters northern, matters sometimes not even concerning us, the greater we think they are.  I submit that they should be judged by what they do on the ground in situations such as this.  Admittedly, some of them are trying <Col N="788" /> at present to push forward legislation such as the Bills mentioned by Senator Connor.  Unfortunately, there has still been no major effort made to deal with this major group of immigrants, the post-1982 pre-1987 grouping whom none of the legislation covers.  It would be far better for the Irish American politicians to seek to help this country by providing adequate legislation to extend visa and working rights to the Irish in America than to comment as freely as they do on internal Irish affairs.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor referred to the problems being faced at present by the Irish immigrants in relation to their welfare rights and their health rights, etc.  That is something which is very well documented. We have all heard some very chilling examples not only of what can happen but what is happening at present. Another angle has been raised recently. It is a very serious one which again illustrates clearly the need for immediate Government action, that is, the situations which have arisen recently as a result of Irish people in medical difficulty being afforded so-called help and assistance by the Nor-Aid Group and other associated groups.  These people come along with their so-called charities.  They pay the bills today but their influence tomorrow and the day after on these Irish immigrants whom they purport to help could be very damaging and is certainly doing this country no great favour.  It is a great pity if we have to depend on groups like Nor-Aid to provide aid and assistance to our emigrants abroad.  I am not saying there is a total lack of action, but the lack of adequate action is resulting in this happening at present and it is a very dangerous scenario which is emerging.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor also referred to the problems being faced by the Irish immigrants in banking their money.  That might not seem too grave a problem to some, and others would see it just as a reflection of how well the Irish are supposed to be doing economically. However, it is a matter of fact that illegal immigrants cannot open bank accounts and it has been and is giving rise to all the <Col N="789" /> problems which Senator Connor raised.</P>
    <P>We have, as Senator Connor mentioned, the undesirable situation of people keeping their money at home. This is indeed becoming quite obvious to the more criminal elements running on the verge of these groupings who can then take advantage of it.  Senator Connor also mentioned the fact of cheques being cashed in pubs only and mentioned the undesirable effects of that.  He also mentioned drink and things far worse, what things I would not know.  Presumably Senator Connor may be able to clarify that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>We should also begin to approach this problem at European level.  This country is not the only country which is facing a problem with illegal immigrants in America at the moment. It applies to many countries throughout Europe.  All of them do not have the same unemployment or emigration problem that we have, but many of them have a problem at the moment with illegal immigrants in the United States.  As a member state of the European Community we should try to ensure that the whole problem of illegal emigrants to the United States from Europe is taken up at central level and a solution found at that level.  The Bills at present going through the US Congress take into account the European situation and allow different quota levels for European countries.  It is time that a more concerted effort was made at EC level to bring about a solution to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of our motion relates to the setting up of advice centres in New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco and other such centres throughout the United States, and part of it also seeks support similar to that supplied by the Department of Labour to Irish immigrants in the United Kingdom. Presumably these two parts of the motion would run hand in hand.  We are told that the numbers emigrating from this country last year were close on 30,000.  If those <Col N="790" /> 30,000 were at home at present, presumably most of them would be faced with a future, in the short term at least, on the dole.  You do not have to be a great economist to know that would be costing this State at least £30 million per annum.  I do not think it is too much to ask any Government to invest some of that saving to ensure that those unfortunate people who have no choice but to leave our shores are able to get advice and help where necessary in the United States.</P>

      <P>The centres work very well indeed in the United Kingdom.  If anything you could say they are so successful that they are under-staffed and even more of them are necessary.  There is no doubt that there is a grave need at present for these centres in the United States.  The setting up of such centres would help to alleviate many of the smaller problems being faced by Irish immigrants.  It would help alleviate much of the unnecessary fear in the minds of Irish immigrants abroad at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will conclude my comments at that. This motion is slightly more political, I suppose, than the motion which was on the Clár a year ago, but we have to reflect on the fact that the Government have been a year in office and a lot of talk has taken place with regard to the whole issue.  We have to recall the promises made by the present Taoiseach before the last election when he stated that his party intended to use every diplomatic and political means available to secure legal status for these young people abroad.  He will claim that he has been doing this but, unfortunately, he has not been successful.  If what we have seen up to now is the best effort he can manage, I am afraid it is not good enough.  We have young people out there looking to us for help and support.  I wonder what would happen if they could cast their votes in the next general election.  They are out of sight and out of mind.  We must speak up for them and I appeal <Col N="791" /> to Members to support our motion and hopefully it might stir the Government into some action at last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I have listened to both Senators.  You would think they were living in the United States all their lives, they have such a fierce grasp of it.  I can speak with a lot of authority because I happen to have lived as an immigrant in the United States for ten years.  You would think, listening to both Sentors, that the immigration problem and the fact that many people are living illegally in the United States are due to the economic failures of the Government.  It is amazing that they seem to forget that all of this happened between the years 1982 and 1987 when there was mass emigration, mass borrowings and a doubling of the national debt.</P>
      <P>If the Opposition, in Government at the time, would be good enough to admit that, this would be a very constructive debate.  We are men enough and our Government are good enough to recognise that there is a problem out there. We have recognised that there is a problem out there and we have helped.  I would like the remark made by Senator Bradford that the Taoiseach was ignoring these young people to be withdrawn and also the remark made about the Minister, Deputy Fahey.  It is a wonder that nobody said something about our Minister for Foreign Affairs because since we took power we have a full time Assistant Consul General in the United States working full time on the immigration problem.  That has only happened in the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the honour recently of being in the United States and visiting centres in Boston, Chicago, Washington, New York and other various centres.  I met with all these groups, including the Immigration Reform Movement and the Ancient Order of Hibernians.  I met with Senator Brian Donnelly, Senator Joe Kennedy, Congressman Mockler, the Speaker of the House Jim Wright.  To say <Col N="792" /> that this Government have been doing nothing whatsoever to help this new legislation that has now gone through the Senate and which we hope will get through the House of Representatives by the end of this year is totally ludicrous.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Opposition gave us the opportunity to debate this very important issue here tonight.  During my recent visit to Washington I met with a number of Congressmen and Senators. I was there on 15 March when the Bill went through the Senate.  There are many good items in that Bill which are badly needed because I know several families from my constituency who had to wait as long as eight years to claim a direct relative, like a brother and sister, in the United States.  I have three of my family in the United States at the moment legally and one who is illegal.  It will take me or my wife approximately 18 months to two years to get legal status for that child even though that child is one of ours.  My wife is a legal American resident but still, under the present legislation, it now takes almost two years to legalise a child and up to eight years for a brother or sister.</P>
    <P>This new legislation that has gone through the Senate would enable an extra 100,000 people to be added on to that quota and it would bring the waiting period down from eight years to approximately one year for a brother or sister and from one year to about eight or 12 weeks for a son or daughter.  I was disappointed that, with the many friends we have in the United States in very high positions, for example, Supreme Court and District Court Justices and people in high places with political power that the Government have done nothing to try to have legislation introduced.  Brian Donnelly brought in the legislation we all know as the Donnelly Bill and thousands of young Irish people came in the back door and got legal status in the United States.  That legislation was introduced to benefit the Mexicans and not the Irish. Thank God, the politicians in the United States were smart enough to make sure they dovetailed us into that, and we are still working with the Donnelly Bill. Brian Donnelly is to be complimented on <Col N="793" /> what he has done to date for those Irish.</P>
    <P>As well as that we have the Amnesty Bill relating to those who emigrated prior to 1982.  I was disappointed at the number of people who came forward to get amnesty under that legislation.  They were, of course, afraid that since they were working in the States illegally they would be used as scapegoats.  Then various organisations in the United States, with the help of the Government and the Consuls General in New York, Washington and all the larger centres, asked those people to come forward for help and assistance.  Not alone did they do that, but Catholic charities have organised another grouping within the United States to give free legal aid to document those people.  That is done by the present Irish Government, through the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>There was a problem two or three years ago with young people being maimed, hurt and even killed in the United States. I had several brought back to my own constituency in boxes.  No help whatsoever was given to our young people except by the county associations to which they belonged.  Because of representations by our Taoiseach and our Department of Foreign Affairs, people can now get free legal aid in New York city, in Chicago and in Boston.  If they become seriously ill, help from the Consul is there.  While I was in New York recently I called to see the Consul and there were four problems in one day, two that I brought to the notice of the Consul. Within that very short period four young people were helped.  They got guidance and recognition and were told exactly what to do and where to go for help.  To come in here to the Seanad to try to cut down those young people who are in need of our help at the moment is a scandal.</P>

      <P>Irreparable damage was done to those young people in the first three quarters of an hour of this debate this evening.  How can anybody accuse this Government of not being there to help them when the documentary evidence is there in front of everybody? What we should be doing now as politicians is to unite for once on this issue. We might differ on economic issues etc., but this is so serious.  I am delighted that it is being debated.  We should be at one on this issue and try to help those people to be documented.  We should be using all our resources, all our connections, to make sure that the Congressmen in the United States get this crucial Bill into Committee Stage because it cannot be taken on the floor of the House of Representatives until it is at Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that we will get that legislation through and that we have enough friends in Congress.  I am convinced that, with the likes of Brian Donnelly, Joe Kennedy and others, we have enough people to get this legislation through to give recognition, for the first time since 1965, to 50,000 people from this country who have no relatives in the United States and to give them the chance and the opportunity to use their skills and talents abroad and possibly bring them back here some few years later to set up industry here.  It is something we should be encouraging.  I am not encouraging emigration one way or the other but I would like to see those people documented.</P>
      <P>There was also mention by one of the Senators over there of the amnesty relating to emigration between 1982 and 1987. I agree with them that there should be an amnesty because they were the years when there was mass emigration out of this country and the Coalition Government completely ignored it and said it was not happening at all.</P>

We admitted that it was happening and now we are trying to right it, just like all the other things that went wrong in this country in that same period.  You have to stand up and be counted in these situations.  Congressman Joe Kennedy has another Bill drafted looking for an amnesty for those people who immigrated between 1982 and 1987. The Donnelly/Simpson/Kennedy Bill is the one that is most important to us at the moment and we should be using all resources in that regard.  The people in the Opposition benches should be helping the Government if they have any friends in Congress in the United States, and I do not think they have many left from the remarks they made.</P>

I would like once again to congratulate the Taoiseach on his recent visit to the United States to meet that group of people in New York City and Boston.  I was delighted to be able to report to him my findings in the three or four weeks which I spent there.  It is good that the Government are able to recognise those problems and that they are tackling them.  As I stated in my few brief words, we made the moves and now we will have to make sure that the legislation will go through. For the sake of all the young people in the United States, I appeal to the people on the Opposition benches to, for goodness sake, speak with some hope of help, not destruction, for our young people in the United States.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all too obvious from this party bickering that is going on in the course of this debate that all the Senators who have spoken up to now realise in their hearts and souls that we are dealing here with a problem which is <Col N="796" /> a reproach to the whole political establishment of this State since its foundation. What we have here is the politics of guilt expressing themselves.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Bradford I recall the motion we discussed which was moved by Senator Paschal Mooney in June last, nearly ten months ago.  I said things then which I have been reading recently which I would find very hard to express better than I expressed them at that time. Having been in the United States twice since then, though I cannot pretend to have the experience Senator Kiely has had.  I am more than ever convinced that what I said on that occasion is absolutely valid today.</P>
      <P>I support the motion.  If this country cannot give employment to our young people, it is our responsibility to promote their welfare where they have to go.  They are a grave embarrassment to us and by us I mean not one party or the other but everybody responsible for running this country's affairs since independence.  It is an embarrassment that goes very deeply into our historical subconscious because it was one of the assumptions of our nationalist philosophers, in the century before independence, that independence would solve, among other things, the curse of emigration, that all you had to do was to establish a native Government and the thing was solved.  Well we know better now.</P>
      <P>When Éamon de Valera proudly boasted in 1933 that our children, like our cattle, would no longer be brought up for export, it was a golden promise that perished very quickly on his lips. He went on to preside over the massive haemorrhage that characterised native Government under his rule and that of his party and that characterised the whole period since independence, apart from a few years in the sixties and early seventies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unpalatable fact we have to face is that emigration is the norm in this country's historical experience.  It is a dominant feature of the Irish national personality since well before the Famine. It is a historical fallacy to think that all this began with the great Famine.  Exodus <Col N="797" /> began long before then.  Over a century and a half one could say that the periods when there was no or little emigration were very few and far between and these periods significantly generally spelt trouble in this country.  Perhaps that is why, despite all the hand wringing and all the rhetoric, our Government are in their hearts and souls secretly not totally displeased that emigration is a safety valve.</P>
    <P>There is some evidence from researchers in Government archives that Governments look on emigration as an integral component of policy, of planning or what passes for policy in planning. There is a deep cynicism about this, and only someone with the incorruptible innocence of our present Minister for Foreign Affairs speaks the truth from time to time and suggests that our young people will have to accept this as a fact of life.  It is inevitable in the kind of ramshackle mix of an economy we have had since 1922.  It would be the same under Fine Gael and it would be the same under the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>Only if we use the resources of this country properly, systematically and ruthlessly in the public interest, will we change that dismal picture and, even then, if we had full employment, which presumably is the answer to emigration, what would be involved is that people who now enjoy a high standard of living would have to lower their expectations very drastically.  That is the fundamental domestic fact whether we like it or not. That is the background to this motion.</P>
    <P>Turning to the motion, it does not recognise certain unpalatable realities about the situation in the United States. What is in the favour of our young people who have to emigrate to the United States is the fact that they are white, that they are English speaking, that they are well educated.  At first glance that would seem to be a great factor in their favour. We frequently trumpet the merits of these alleged benefits.  These very qualities are what makes them a subject of envy to young Americans.  They are in competition with the flower of America <Col N="798" /> because they are white, English speaking, and well educated.  In many areas they are in competition with Americans.  The real problem for America in terms of the immigration problem is not the Irish, not the Europeans, because the age of Irish emigration and the age of European emigration are over.</P>
    <P>What is now the great problem is the uncontrollable and massive influx from Latin America, Mexico, the Philippines and Asia &mdash; though to a lesser extent because the Asians are not a problem but an enormous resource for Americans.  As for the others, the Mexicans, the Hispanics and so on, they are the wretched refuse of the new teeming shores.  They are the huddled masses yearning to be free.  They are the Irish of the 20th century. If there is a grand and generous American tradition of welcoming the wretched of the earth to their shores, they are the people who are the real pity and they are the people who inspire pity from the most noble hearted Americans of our time.  Let us stop this talk about what we gave to America and how much they owe us.  They owe us nothing.  We have got our whack and America has done extremely well by the Irish, so there is no point in pleading that they owe us a historical debt because that debt has been paid.</P>
    <P>We have to remember that the people we are talking about, the Congressmen on Capitol Hill have no longer the political clout they had, that is to say, the Irish American politicians who are presumably the people referred to in subsection (1) of the motion are not as powerful any more.  It is doubtful that they ever cared that much about us apart from St. Patrick's day sentimentalities, apart from when it suited them domestically, when they were amenable to pressure from Irish Americans in their constituencies, but these constituencies are now disintegrating.  The inner cities are now becoming the preserves of the new emigrants and the new poor, so that the Kennedys and the Donnellys, and so on, do not matter anymore &mdash; not to the extent they did matter anyway.  Even if we are to approach the topic on this <Col N="799" /> cynical basis, I doubt that the welfare of the Irish emigrants matters to them at election time.</P>
    <P>There is another interesting factor in this situation.  Our young illegal emigrants are by no means universally pitied and sympathised with by the older generation of the Irish in America, even by the Irish emigrants of the fifties who look upon these new narrowbacks &mdash; to use a traditional way of looking at the more recent emigration wave &mdash; as people who are having it fairly easy and who did not have the tough times they had.  This is regrettable.  This may be selfish, but it is a fact of life.  There is no great pity going for them among the more senior generation of Irish emigrants.  That is another reason the politics of Irish emigration are no longer central to Irish American concerns.</P>
    <P>Suppose we adopted what has been suggested recently &mdash; which at first sight seems an intriguing idea &mdash; and applied the same technique to our American cousins as we are applying to the people we know in Britain, the &ldquo;Write and Invite&rdquo; approach, that we should write to people in America and say, &ldquo;Pressurise your local congressman in order to do the best we can for our local emigrants&rdquo;, there is no guarantee that that will work for the reason I mentioned because the people we write to may not be very sympathetic to these young people and because we have grossly exaggerated the number of &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; in America.  These are the harsh facts.  It is very sad that we have to say them.</P>
    <P>The only ultimate salvation, if we are to have a future in Ireland, is to drastically recast our whole ideas about the economy and society.  In the meantime I support this motion and I wish it well.  If there is anything I can do through my own American contacts I will be glad to help these young people, but no purpose will be served by the pretence that one party or the other are responsible for this sad state since we are all responsible for it.</P>

That is not the kind of language which will facilitate consensus.  It is not the kind of language which would be used by someone who was genuinely interested in assisting these young people, or in finding solutions to their problems.  If the Senators who drafted this motion had any real or genuine interest in the plight of our out of status young immigrants, they would have drafted a motion which would receive the unanimous backing and support of every Member of this House, irrespective of party affiliation.

    <P>Fianna Fáil are greatly concerned over the plight of many thousands of <Col N="801" /> young Irish people who have been forced to emigrate over the past four years.  Special problems have arisen in the United States where the status and general uncertainty of their position prevents them from making definite plans for the future and where they are often exposed to exploitation in their employment.  This is a cause of great anxiety not only to those directly involved but also to their families here at home.  Fianna Fáil would therefore undertake a major political and diplomatic initiative to secure legal status for these young people.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the implication in this motion Fianna Fáil in Government have undertaken such an initiative.  Over the past year the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and various Government Ministers and Ministers of State have visited the United States.  The Taoiseach has visited the United States on two occasions in that period.  All of them have availed of every opportunity presented by these visits to raise the plight of our out of status young emigrants and the special difficulties they face, particularly as a result of the Immigration Reform and Control Act, 1986. These problems have been discussed with a variety of congressional and administration leaders in addition to having been discussed by the Taoiseach with President Reagan.  I am satisfied that a genuine and concerted effort is being made by the Government, on an ongoing basis, to bring about a situation which will enable the legal position of these young Irish citizens to be regularised.</P>
    <P>I am also satisfied that considerable progress has been made and is being made in regard to this.  I would like to be associated with the many tributes which have been paid to those members of both Houses of Congress in the United States who are doing everything that is humanly and politically possible to ensure that a situation is brought about which will enable those of our citizens who wish to live and work legally in that country to do so.  The Kennedy-Simpson Bill, which has already been referred to, has been passed by the Senate.  A similar Bill, <Col N="802" /> sponsored by Congressman Donnelly and Congressman Schumer, is currently before the United States House of Representatives. This Bill provides for substantial revisions in the immigrant selection system.  The very considerable number of additional visas, which the Bill proposes to make available for non preference aliens, will be distributed on the basis of a new points system which will favour emigrants from Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in recent newspaper reports in this country that the Bill is meeting some opposition from the influential Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Peter Rudino of New Jersey.  I would go along with the suggestion that people in this country who have relatives or friends in New Jersey should ask them to contact Congressman Rudino and seek his support for the measure.  I understand that the reservations which Congressman Rudino had about the Bill were because he perceived its provisions to be discriminatory in favour of certain ethnic groups.  The other side of the coin, so far as Ireland is concerned, is that the Bill will be doing nothing more than redressing, to some extent, the situation which resulted from the 1965 legislation.</P>
    <P>It is of vital importance to Ireland that this Bill should become law.  It was suggested to me, when I visited the United States recently, that a high profile lobby in support of the Bill could be, and probably would be, counter-productive.  If the Bill is perceived to be a measure which is designed to give a particular advantage to the Irish, there is a distinct danger.  It is certain that other ethnic groups will seek to mobilise opposition to it.  Consequently the lobby in support of the Bill has to be discreet and has to be on the basis of the greater degree of fairness and equity which it will bring to the immigration system.  It is on this basis that its sponsors are promoting the Bill.  In a letter to their congressional colleagues dated 11 February 1988 Senators Kennedy and Simpson stated:</P>
    <P>From the outset it has been our goal to reform the immigration system so <Col N="803" /> that it more faithfully serves the national interest, so that it is more flexible, and so that it is open to immigrants from nations who are shortchanged by the current law.</P>
    <P>That letter, which outlines the provisions of the Bill and the revisions which are being proposed concludes with the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>The time has come for Congress to pick up where it left off in 1986 and address the unfinished agenda of immigration &mdash; the reform of our <i>legal</i> immigration system.  The bill is a balanced attempt to serve the national interest; it preserves the immigration rights of those who have close family connections in this country; it stimulates immigration from the earlier sources of immigration to our country that have contributed so much to America in the past; and it promotes the entry of those who are selected specifically for their ability to contribute their needed skills and talents to the development of our country.  This reform will both continue and strengthen one of the oldest and most enduring themes in our nation's history &mdash; America's immigrant heritage.</P>
    <P>It is of vital importance to very many Irish citizens that this legislation is enacted as soon as possible.  In this regard I believe that great credit is due to the Taoiseach and the Government for the progress that has been made to date.  I am confident that the Bill will be enacted before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The staff of the Irish Embassy in Washington and the staff of all the Irish consulates in the United States also deserve to be commended for their role in helping to bring about this situation.  I am satisfied that they are also a source of very valuable assistance and advice for our young undocumented Irish emigrants in the United States.  During my recent visit I had the privilege of visiting both the Embassy in Washington and the Irish Consulate in New York.  I was most impressed by the very genuine concern <Col N="804" /> for these young people which was expressed to me by both Ambassador McKernan and Consul General Ó Ceallaigh. I am absolutely satisfied that no stone is left unturned by either when it comes to providing advice and support for our young emigrants who may seek their help.</P>
    <P>Speaking at a function in New York during his recent visit to the United States the Taoiseach stated:</P>
    <P>The Irish Embassy in Washington and all our Consulates in the United States have explicit instructions to give this problem their full attention.  We have augmented our staff at our Consulate in New York and appointed an officer there to work full time in providing assistance and advice to our young people.</P>
    <P>This statement clearly gives the lie to the implication in the motion that support and advice are not being provided at present.</P>
    <P>I would also like to pay tribute to the various county associations and to the very many Irish American societies and organisations and individuals who are also helping and supporting these young people.  I was delighted to have been able to accept an invitation to a meeting in Washington of one such group during the visit to which I referred.  The group in question is known as the Irish Emigration Support Committee of the Washington DC Metropolitan Area.  This group is doing excellent work in assisting and advising new Irish emigrants in the greater Washington area and also in lobbying support for the proposed new immigration legislation.  This group is fortunate to have as its Chairman Mr. Pat Troy who also hosts a weekly radio programme in the Washington area and who is, therefore, in a position to make the work of the group, and the assistance which its members can provide, widely known in that part of the United States. Such groups have a wide range of expertise available to them.  This group is in a position to provide invaluable assistance in relation to the wide variety of problems which can arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> The motion in subsection 3 asks the Government to supply support for Irish emigrants in the United States similar to that supplied by the Department of Labour to Irish emigrants in the United Kingdom.  I am sure the Government have looked at this.  I do not know how feasible this would be but certainly the Department of Labour are doing an excellent job in providing a pre-departure advisory service for persons who are contemplating seeking work abroad by helping them to make informed decisions and also by assisting them in relation to information on the conditions obtaining in the countries to which they may be emigrating. I am sure that, if it is feasible to implement that suggestion, the Government would be very willing to do so.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that the real task facing this country is not to deal with the emigration situation by providing support services for our emigrants. The real task is to create the employment opportunities here at home which will ensure that no young Irish person will be compelled to emigrate to find a job.  For the first time in many years, we have a Government who are working towards this objective in the only realistic way possible.  I certainly hope their efforts will be successful.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for youth and sport.  The man looks as if he has an amount of time on his hands with most of his area of responsibility wasting itself across the Irish Sea <Col N="806" /> and the Atlantic.  I congratulate him on the brave words he spoke last term when many of us shouted &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; and agreed with him.  I want to indicate to the Minister regarding his comments on Irish American politicians that he had many supporters on this side of this House.  In the Irish society at present the concept of emigration and the concept of youth unemployment have become almost institutionalised with a range and variety of support services.  It has almost reached a stage now where youth unemployment has become a law unto itself.  It is surviving on its own internal synergy because unemployment has almost become an energy in Ireland.  If we were to wipe out youth unemployment tomorrow morning, there would be many people out of work in the support services and industries.</P>
      <P>The Minister is presiding over a young population who, in their growing and formative years, are threatened by the prospect of unemployment and stunned into passivity and acceptance, a generation who are now beginning to forget how to question and demand what is right for young people.  We are looking at a generation of young people who are being exploited in hamburger joints, back street operations and who are part of the black economy in many places at the level of £1 or £2 an hour.  Many studies have emphasised that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest census figures, as outlined in the preliminary report of the Central Statistics Office, are frightening.  We see that the projections and demographic trends which were spoken about and put in front of us for the past number of years are all turning out to be true.  Since 1981 the annual rate of emigration has moved from 10,000 per year to 31,000 or more per year in 1986.  I want to put those 30,000 a year in some kind of context.  It is easy to say that the figure is massive, and disgraceful and that it shows an uncontrolled rise of 300 per cent in half a decade.  The vast majority of these are young people.  Regrettably we are now also looking at a totally new concept, new in modern terms of family emigration. This is a complete turn around from ten <Col N="807" /> years ago when we were inviting people back and when we had family immigration. We are now back to the position where we have got family emigration again.</P>
    <P>The young people who are leaving the country are out greatest national natural resource.  How often do we hear that?  It is the chant of politicians.  It is the chant of the political parties.  I want to put in context what 31,000 people leaving Ireland per year means.  In very simple terms there are roughly 60,000 births per year in Ireland.  If there are now 30,000 or more leaving the country that is one out of every two young people at present. An examination of the spin-off and cumulative effects of that is very frightening.</P>
    <P>The people who are leaving fall into different categories.  There are certain people who, by virtue of their privileged background, or by virtue of the fact that they have been able to survive and exploit the educational system, can get themselves qualified in areas where there are jobs available and who will remain in this country.  There are the very bright, innovative, decision-making calibre people who leave because they see no future in this country.  Left behind are those people who do not have the courage, qualifications, or the sense of adventure to leave and start up elsewhere.  In many ways it is a sad way to describe people.  The people who are leaving are the people we most need to develop this country in the way we would like to see it developing in the future.</P>
    <P>It is a distressing forecast but the fact is that we are now well on the way to seeing half of every generation of our young people lost to emigration as long as this trend continues.  I have not even adverted to the fact that this figure of 30,000 is a conservative figure.  The latest figure I saw was 35,000 per year.  Does the Minister accept my concern for the young people or is he querying the figures? He can take them up with the Central Statistics Office.  The figures are coming down because there are more families leaving the country.  There are <Col N="808" /> fewer children being born.  That is the only reason.  If the Minister says they are going down, to what figure are they going down?  Is it 25,000, 26,000, 27,000 or 29,000?  It is somewhere between 25,000 and 30,000.  There is no survey, trend or forecast which has shown less than that and, either way, it is half a generation. They are dispensable.  They will go on the next boat if they do not go on the first boat.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that my colleague, Senator Murphy, referred to one of the founding fathers of the Minister's party who said that when we became independent we would export cattle rather than young people.  Now we have stopped exporting cattle because, since we joined the European Community, the national herd has been halved and we have doubled the export of young people.  That is the direction in which we are going.  Apart from the environmental damage, what would be the response if the Kinsale oil or gas field were going to waste?  Can you imagine&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is clear that the private sector are losing more jobs than they are creating despite the fact that we had 720 new jobs last year.  Relying on the private sector has been a disaster.  In our new drive to create employment for young people and to stop emigration, our motivation must be the public good and not private gain.  I will be pleased to continue in the same vein with a brand new script for perusal by Senators next week.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise this matter. For the benefit of my colleagues I will read out the text of the matter that I want to raise here.  It is the failure of the Department of Foreign Affairs to forward to the secretariat of the Inter-governmental Conference a document submitted by the Campaign for the Separation of Church and State alleging discrimination on religious grounds in the Republic and directly relevant to the stated concern of the Anglo-Irish Agreement to bring about peace and reconciliation in all of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Campaign for the Separation of Church and State are a very reputable civil rights association.  They have impressed me very much by the moderate tone of their approach and by the very impressive depth of their research.  I would not lightly agree to sponsor a group who did not have this responsible approach.  It is interesting that their guiding principles have been endorsed by leading Irish Catholic churchmen.  In fact, their ultimate goal would seem to be the same as the goals fervently expressed by Bishop Cathal Daly at the New Ireland Forum and endorsed by Cardinal Ó Fiach on numerous occasions since then.  Never mind that this is a belated recognition by churchmen of their own best interests, namely, that it is in the interests of the Church that it should be separated from the State.  My personal view is that it is in the best interests of the Church that it should be always teetering on the edge of persecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aims that they espouse are the aims of the leading Roman Catholic <Col N="810" /> churchmen.  They are also the classical aims of Republicanism.  Our best Republican thinkers in the past knew that there would have to be an Irish nationality which would have to separate Church and State, whether it was the established Protestant Church, or whether they could see into the future of a quasi-established Roman Catholic Church.  This is a highly respectable organisation with a highly respectable objective.</P>
    <P>The document I referred to which they sent to the Department of Foreign Affairs is far from being a frivolous document. It is very well researched.  It is a document of substance.  It is not relevant here to go in any detail in to the document itself.  I am concerned about the lack of action by the Department of Foreign Affairs when they received the document. It is relevant to point out that the main theme of the document is that we are very far from a separation of Church and State in this Republic.  The Church and State are intermeshed in a most undersirable way and in such a universal way that we are not aware of it, it is such a part of the scene.  In particular, the areas of health and education contain large sectors which are publicly funded but denominationally controlled.</P>
    <P>Historians will recall that one of the great themes of 19th century Church-State relations under British rule was the attempt of the Catholic bishops to secure the domination of the educational field under their direction and the reluctance of the British liberal and secular establishment to concede that principle.  In the end the bishops won, because they were allowed to denominationalise areas which were supposed to be theoretically secular.  The primary schools are an obvious example.</P>
    <P>One of the areas where there is denominational control over public funding, and which is a grave cause of concern, is teacher training.  It is impossible in this jurisdiction for someone who wants to be a primary teacher, but who subscribes to no institutional religion &mdash; and this is a growing section of the population &mdash; to have access to a suitable area of training, to an area which is not <Col N="811" /> dominated and controlled by denominational forces.  That, in itself, is an argument for being concerned about this integration of Church and State.</P>
    <P>The state of affairs is that in health and education &mdash; in health for example, trainee nurses, both in their training and in the opportunities available to them when they are trained &mdash; we come up against this area of denominational control. The principle of separation of Church and State is contradicted in practice. It violates the Constitution because there is more than one constitutional provision which upholds the right of the citizens to be equally treated without distinction of religion and there is another provision in the Constitution which says there shall be no endowment of religion even though there are chaplains to community schools who are paid out of public funds, which is the essence of endowment.</P>
    <P>The present practice in all these areas violates minority rights.  The minority in question here are not Protestants in the sense in which we understand it.  I wonder if the Protestants do not share this undesirable state of affairs because what happens is that the Protestants have their slice of denominational control out of public funds, arguably in the interests of sustaining the Protestant ethos.  I sometimes wonder if the Protestant ethos is simply not any more than keeping them separate from the Catholics and ensuring that their own people get the jobs.</P>
    <P>They are not the minority who are being discriminated against in the Republic.  The real and growing minority are that dissident body of people who, as Catholics, simply do not subscribe to the totality of control by bishops and who want to see the separation of Church and State.  As the census return shows, the largest religious minority now in the Republic are the non-religious minority, those who now have the courage to declare themselves at successive censuses as not belonging to any particular religious group.  It is they who are being discriminated against in areas that I talk <Col N="812" /> about.  They are the new Protestants as it were.  They are the new discriminated against minority.</P>
    <P>One of the core problems that was addressed by the Anglo-Irish Agreement was discrimination against minorities. Admittedly, the most obvious example of that is in Northern Ireland but, if you look at the text, the Agreement by no means confines the resolution of these problems to the area of Northern Ireland. The spirit of the Agreement is against discrimination of any kind in Ireland.  The reconciliation spoken of in the Agreement is reconciliation in Ireland as a whole.  The Agreement is conscious of the historic nature of the objectives laid out here and there is no doubt that reconciliation is meant as a two-way process and inter-denominational relations are not simply confined to Northern Ireland alone.</P>
    <P>I cite, as I have done in the text of my motion, article 2 (b) where it says: &ldquo;The conference will be mainly concerned with Northern Ireland but some of the matters will involve co-operative action in both parts of the island of Ireland.&rdquo;  Article 4 (a) sections (1) and (2) are concerned with peace, stability and prosperity throughout the island of Ireland by promoting reconciliation, respect for human rights, etc.</P>
    <P>It seems that the spirit and the letter of the Agreement are, in effect, being violated by the existing state of affairs. That is the essence of the document submitted by the Campaign for the Separation of Church and State.  Therefore, I would argue that there is a strong <i>prima facie</i> case for putting this on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference and that it is vital in the end that we sort ourselves out in this regard, that we separate Church from State just as much as it is that discrimination on the grounds of religion ceases in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The facts of this particular case are fairly incontestable.  It may well be that the Department would contest a point or two.  The facts as they have been given to me &mdash; I have no reason to doubt them &mdash; are as follows: The Campaign for the Separation of Church and State <Col N="813" /> approached the Department of Foreign Affairs and they submitted to them this document for transmission to the secretariat for consideration by the secretariat. That was made perfectly clear. My information further is that in the initial conversations the campaign people were promised that it would be forwarded. The document was submitted eight weeks ago, on February 26.  I understand that this, in effect, is the only way for a concerned group of citizens to approach the Intergovernmental Conference. The secretariat, after all, is virtually incommunicado, so what would you do only go to the Department of Foreign Affairs with an important document?</P>
    <P>Despite the initial promise of the exchanges, it would appear that after two months nothing has been done.  The document was never forwarded.  The Campaign for the Separation of Church and State have got no formal acknowledgement of their submission.  It would appear further that, on 25 April after the Press had been alerted, Department officials began to say: &ldquo;Well, we have not forwarded it.  We are not obliged to forward it&rdquo;, and there the case rests.  All the evidence is that the Department regard this as a highly politically sensitive subject and simply are dragging their feet on this issue.  As I have said, we have to realise that, if we are talking about the totality of relationships, that much-vaunted phrase, the reciprocity of relationships, we must attend to the beam in our own eye.</P>
    <P>The Conference today had on its agenda the whole business of religious discrimination and it seems to me that the Department of Foreign Affairs missed a valuable opportunity to face up to our responsibilities in this matter by not forwarding this document to be considered at today's Conference.  It is, indeed, a great pity that the Campaign for the Separation of Church and State in the end had to have recourse to the British Embassy which, of course, willingly agreed to forward the document to the secretariat.  That should not have had to be done.  It puts the matter in a kind of <Col N="814" /> adversarial context.  It should not be a question of the British Embassy having to score points over their Irish counterparts for not living up to their obligations.  That is a great pity, indeed.</P>
    <P>That is the situation.  It is a great pity that the Department of Foreign Affairs are not recognising that, if there is to be reconciliation in Ireland, it has to be a two way process and that, by not forwarding the document, they are helping to violate the spirit, and arguably, the letter of its provisions.  There can be no reconciliation between Catholic and Protestant in the North as long as the Republic is perceived, with very good reason, as having large areas of public life dominated by the Catholic ethos.  That is the vital matter being addressed by the Campaign for the Separation of Church and State and, irrespective of the Minister's reply, the issue is a large one.</P>
    <P>Down here, most people think of discrimination as something that happens up there.  It is an unfamiliar one; it is a startling one; but one that is vital to the solution of our deeply rooted historical problems in this country, the ingrained infection of bigotry and discrimination which is shared by the island at large.  If the Department of Foreign Affairs do not realise that, it is time they did.  It is a political nettle to be grasped.  What is at issue really is nothing less than reversing the course of Irish history.  I did not intend to conclude on such a cosmic note. I look forward to hearing the reason why this matter was not properly addressed by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Senator Murphy for his contribution. Let me say at the outset that, while I always take great cognisance of Senator Murphy's contributions, and have been a student of his line of history in the past, I simply cannot understand the logic which he puts forward in defence of this motion.  The motion suggests that he believes that a document containing the views of the Campaign for the Separation of Church and State either did <Col N="815" /> not receive proper attention, or was mishandled by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The belief is without foundation.</P>
      <P>The document which was typed on notepaper of the Campaign for the Separation of Church and State was headed &ldquo;Submission to Ministers and Secretariat of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Religious Discrimination in the Republic of Ireland.&rdquo;  It was received through the post on 22 February 1988 and was referred internally in the normal way to the Anglo-Irish division of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Although the notepaper of the campaign bears the name and address of its secretary, the document itself was not signed.</P>
      <P>It was not accompanied by a letter, nor did it contain any covering note or request that it should be transmitted elsewhere. There was no indication of what the author of the campaign wanted the Department to do with the document.  It appears from its presentation and title to be a formal statement by the Campaign for the Separation of Church and State. It was, accordingly, assumed that the document was, in effect, a press release and that copies were being circulated on a wide basis to those deemed relevant to the campaign's objectives.</P>
      <P>The document has, of course, been available to the Tánaiste in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and as Irish Joint-Chairman of the Anglo-Irish Conference as well as to officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Since it also referred to matters of concern to the Departments of Health and Education, the Department of Foreign Affairs took the initiative in sending copies to both those Departments.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, for the Government and in particular, the Tánaiste in his capacity as co-Chairman to consider any policy issues which may arise so far as we are concerned in relation to the workings of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  I would add that the role of the secretariat, as set out in article 3 of the Agreement, is to service the Conference on a continuing basis in the discharge of its functions as set out in the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> I do not propose to deal here in any detail with the content of the document, nor indeed does this arise from the motion.  In fact, contrary to what the Senator was saying, the motion has nothing whatsoever to do with the aims or objectives of this particular organisation. However, the authors of the submission stated their views and beliefs on the existence, as they see it, of religious discrimination in this State.</P>
    <P>I would contest that assumption and I would assert strongly that the claims made by the Campaign for the Separation of Church and State are unfounded and, in fact, contest it even more strongly having heard the case made by the Senator which, as I say, I find illogical. If, however, those involved in that organisation remain convinced that religious discrimination exists here, they will no doubt continue to press their views politically. I wonder if those views have been addressed specifically to my own Department of Education.  Certainly if they have, nobody has ever approached me about the issue.  If they wish to pursue specific issues, I would invite them to take those issues up with the relevant Government Departments or with, indeed, any other Department or governmental agencies dealing with the matter in question.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but I find it quite literally incredible that the Department should have mistaken the purpose of the document. I simply cannot accept that answer seriously.  The other thing is that, even accepting that the Department up to now have mistaken the ultimate destination of the document, they can be in no doubt as to what was intended after my speech here tonight.  Action will be taken either way.  This weak attempt at fobbing off this campaign will simply not be tolerated. I hope there will be opportunities in the future for the Department of Foreign Affairs to face more responsibly and more seriously than they have done to date on this matter.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 5 May 1988.</P>
