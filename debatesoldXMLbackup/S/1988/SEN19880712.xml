      <P>I have notice from Senator John A. Murphy that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clarify the Government's attitude to the Mawhinney proposals on integrated education in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Philip Hogan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to retain the school transport service to Tullaroan national school, County Kilkenny, as operated for the school year 1987-88.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the several changes in the international patent scene, the need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to indicate how this will affect the workings of the Patents Office.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>

    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Murphy, Hogan, Bulbulia and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Murphy's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business this evening.

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, the resolution of the House of the 8th July, 1987 providing for the edited broadcasting of the proceedings of the Seanad and Oireachtas Committees by Radio Telefís Éireann be extended for a further period of twelve months.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to allow RTE to continue the arrangements for radio boadcasting for a further year. Pending an overall review by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, it is intended that these arrangements will be put on a more permanent basis within the next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not objecting to Item No. 1 but it would be no harm if we had a look at progress &mdash; or should I say lack of progress &mdash; in connection with this House and RTE in the year which has just passed.  What has prompted me <Col N="2343" /> to raise this matter is that I received a phone call recently from a friend, who in the course of the conversation, asked: &ldquo;Does the Seanad only sit when the Dáil is adjourned?&rdquo;  When I asked him what he meant he said he was listening last week to &ldquo;Today in the Oireachtas&rdquo; and the Seanad got great publicity, but he had never heard that before.  I had to agree that that is the position because on a Thursday night, usually on my way home from here, I listen to that programme and rarely, if ever, does it give the Seanad a mention.  It is all about what happened in the Dáil.  The only time the Seanad is mentioned is when the announcer in conclusion says, &ldquo;The Dáil will meet again on Tuesday and the Seanad on Wednesday.&rdquo;  I am not complaining about the publicity I receive, because I make very few contributions.  Indeed if you want to have your name mentioned on RTE, you have to criticise a speech made by a bishop, or you might make some remark about the British Army.</P>
      <P>When RTE decided they would like to come into the Houses and make live programmes, this was the first House they approached.  As far as I am aware, at that time the Dáil was not too keen on allowing them in.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges had discussions with them ranging over 12 months and eventually we agreed, but we were forgotten in a very short time when the Dáil took over.  I would like to make it very clear that I am not blaming any of the reporters in this House, either from the media or from RTE.  I am quite sure they give their reports to their editors and that is where the harm is really done. Anything said here is not considered worth publishing or transmitting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House should get more publicity than it ever got before simply because so many people, especially one parliamentary political party, say that it should be abolished.  We are coming towards the end of this session.  Business has increased considerably in the past two years.  This is our 49th sitting day and, if we sit tomorrow, it will be the 50th, an all-time record for this House.  We have <Col N="2344" /> sat long hours.  In comparison with the Dáil, we will have sat 50 days by tomorrow and in that period the Dáil sat 63 days &mdash; and we get half their salary.  We passed 35 Bills this year and 14 Private Members' motions but that probably will not be mentioned anywhere.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges should have another meeting with RTE in the very near future to see that this House gets more publicity in the coming session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion moved by the Leader of the House to continue the provision whereby RTE have the facility to broadcast the proceedings of this House.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ryan said, ours was the first Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the Oireachtas to suggest that it was appropriate that the public should have an opportunity to listen directly to the contributions of Members.  Afterwards the other House condescended to agree with us and it was as a result of our initiative that the facilities were given. The committee also agreed that RTE television should be given the opportunity to broadcast what happens in this House.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that the public should know what their public representatives are doing.  On balance, we do all right but certainly at the weekend this House does not get a fair mention; the other House is predominant.  Generally speaking, in the evening time, the coverage of this House gets a proportion of space and there is only a limited time available to RTE to broadcast it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we agree that we should get a fair balance, let us talk to RTE to make sure that the balance at least is more visible in the future.  The concept is right.  We agree that RTE have a job to do in a balanced way and that they try to do it. It is within the control of editors and other people in RTE to decide what amount is covered.  Other programmes on RTE, with no responsibility to broadcast what happens here, should at least mention the fact that we are sitting.  At the end of &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; when they <Col N="2345" /> tell the listening public what is on today, they mention the Dáil, meetings of a countrywomen's association or a trade union and a meeting of protestors somewhere else but they forget to mention that the Seanad is sitting.</P>
    <P>When the day of the abolition of the House comes &mdash; and that will mean the abolition of the Constitution &mdash; we will be able to fight our corner with any of the political groupings who feel that, because they cannot elect anybody to this House, it should be abolished with which I do not agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion that RTE should be granted facilities to continue to report the proceedings of the House as mentioned by other speakers. My observations are very simple and clear.  You have to sensationalise something to be mentioned on RTE.  Some people here are very clever &mdash; I single out the Independents &mdash; and get more than their fair share although I am not being personal or vindictive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The tonnage might not represent the quality.  I support the motion and I also ask the Leader of the House when the matter is being reviewed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to include and insert after &ldquo;Radio Telefís Éireann&rdquo;&ldquo;and by any other legally established broadcasting authority&rdquo; which would mean more healthy broadcasting and reporting of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to what Senator McGowan said about the Independent benches, it should be said that on a number of occasions recently all six Independent Senators contributed to all the debates.  Certainly their contributions stand up to scrutiny.  There are rows on <Col N="2346" /> the Order of Business day in day out &mdash; the Leader of the House seems to get confused when we do not have a row and we should look after him in future on that issue &mdash; because we have tried time and time again to make this House respond to topical issues.  Every time we do that there are howls of protest from the other side of the House who refuse to discuss such matters which are topical and newsworthy. We cannot create news by just talking.</P>
      <P>It is quite important that the Order of Business should reflect topicality.  We have proposed to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, as has the Leader of the Fine Gael group, that an hour should be laid aside in this House every day to deal with topical matters, which would be far more newsworthy.  I did not notice that the Independent benches got such an amount or percentage of publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to get any sort of representation when one is an Independent.  We are six Independents so we should be compared in that sense.</P>
      <P>The broadcasting of &ldquo;Today in the Oireachtas&rdquo; in the middle of a light entertainment programme on RTE at the moment might be considered very appropriate by some although others might find it somewhat incongruous &mdash; I am one of the latter &mdash; as it does not do anything for the programme makers or for the quality of the contributions in the context in which it is now being broadcast.</P>
      <P>The question of seeking publicity needs to be looked at by Members of the House particularly Members of the Government party.  There is a great dichotomy between people standing up and saying that this House is not getting publicity and then saying that to get publicity we must make ourselves very publicity conscious. Members of the Government party feel that there should be a higher profile for the House, then let us take on the issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2347" /> We are still looking at the debate on Anglo-Irish affairs which we were guaranteed would be dealt with.  We were given a guarantee by the other House that Middle Eastern affairs would be dealt with.  We have a long list on the walls over in our office of the commitments given and broken or not responded to by the Leader of the House. The programme makers in RTE are doing their very best and we should endeavour to co-operate with them when ordering business to discuss topical subjects.</P>
    <P>Finally, I totally support the comments made by Senator Ryan on the business going through in this House because legislation is discussed in depth only in this House.  The other House do not know how to deal with legislation as we have seen on four occasions in the past fortnight when items which they passed in half an hour, a quarter of an hour or an hour, were found to be completely and utterly flawed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unusual to comment on what goes on in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed it is, but we need to break the mould in order to deal with this topic.  In the main, I agree with Senator Ryan's comments on legislation and motions but we certainly also need to put &ldquo;our own House in order&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we are considering extending broadcasting the proceedings of the Seanad for another 12 months.  Since the proceedings of both the Dáil and the Seanad have been broadcast on Radio Éireann I have noticed that a great interest has been taken by my constituents.  It is amazing that they listen almost every night the proceedings are broadcast.  I think it is very educational for the public to hear what is discussed both in the Dáil and in the Seanad.  I will make one request, that is, that they should consider extending the time for the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Dáil and the Seanad.  This <Col N="2348" /> would be welcomed by the general public, especially as they have taken such an interest in these broadcasts.  I am delighted the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Houses is being extended for another 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion by the Leader of the House to extend broadcasting of the proceedings of both Houses for another year.  Why just another 12 months?  Why should it not be for an indeterminate time?  We will never go back to the time when the proceedings of both Houses are not broadcast on radio and, hopefully, on television.  Anything that makes politics relevant is good and should be continued and expanded.  I do not hear the Oireachtas reports every day, but I think they are not as bad as they are painted.  Given the time we are sitting and business we are dealing with, I think the House gets a fair coverage.  It is no worse than the coverage we get in the newspapers.  One of the irritating things I find is that, although a number of important Bills are introduced in this House, they seem to be discovered by the media only when they go to the Dáil. That is a great pity because, having been in both Houses, I consider that the treatment important Bills, such as the Adoption Bill and the Status of Children Bill, get here is far better than in the other House.  It is clear that issues are dealt with on their merits, not on a partisan basis in this House.</P>
      <P>I support this motion and hope there will be an extension of broadcasting and listening time because it is very important to make people realise that what happens here is relevant to their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support the motion and I want to make two points briefly.  The first has to do with balance. Clearly, the allocation of time between the Dáil and Seanad in terms of coverage is something that might well be scrutinised by RTE, but more important, one of our main concerns before the introduction of radio broadcasting was whether there would be adequate editorial balance.  I am very happy to say <Col N="2349" /> that has occurred.  A very professional, fair approach is adopted to the editing of the proceedings.  Furthermore, it is exceptionally well presented.</P>
      <P>The second point has to do with the times of the broadcast.  The evening time in particular might be looked at because many people do not have the opportunity to listen to radio at the present broadcasting time.  Perhaps one way of getting over the allocation of time between the Dáil and Seanad would be to extend the broadcasting time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two problems here.  I would like to reply to one of the points raised by Senator McGowan.  One of the main reasons the proceedings of the Seanad are not covered is that the subjects we discuss are not of such great interest as the subjects in the Dáil, and we refuse to discuss a great many subjects of public interest.  One of those subjects is Anglo-Irish relations.  Were we to discuss such an issue, as promised by the Leader of the House, there is very little doubt that we would get extremely good coverage on RTE.  I do think we should hear complaints from the Government benches about not getting coverage when they put a gag on their Members on a particular subject.  We do not get coverage because the Government will not give us interesting things to discuss.</P>
      <P>The second point is directly in reply to Senator McGowan.  I am sick and tired of Senator McGowan and other Members on the Government benches accusing the Independents of sensationalising things and looking for publicity. We are.  He is dead right.  I welcome publicity on the subjects I raise in this House; I want publicity on those subjects; I want to annoy the Government; and I want a response from the Government.  If the Government find those particular subjects uncomfortable or awkward, I welcome that.  Senator McGowan is the epitome of that because he is particularly sensitive on the subjects which attract media publicity.  It is those subjects we should be discussing, not avoiding.  The more publicity I get the better.  Let us get that straight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator come back to the narrow motion which is dealing purely with RTE&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It was broadened by the Government benches and I welcome that.  I do not think we can dictate to RTE.  I do not think we can tell RTE how much they can cover of the Seanad and the Dáil.  I would say to the Government benches, that they will cover us half and half if we provide them with the material. If the Government continue to be silent and to avoid those issues in which the media is interested, which is what they do, and leave it to us, we will get the publicity and they will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, as you mentioned, a narrow motion simply providing for an extension by a period of 12 months for the broadcasting facilities here.  I welcome this motion.  It is particularly important while we are sitting in this Chamber and when public access to the Seanad is limited.  Those circumstances make it vitally important that the public have some degree of access to this House.</P>
      <P>With regard to broadcasting the Oireachtas report, I believe this is balanced. I make a habit of listening to it, and not merely to hear the sound of my own voice occasionally.  I am very glad Senator McGowan recognises the superior intelligence of the University Members and our disproportionately valuable contribution to the proceedings of this House.</P>
      <P>The reporting on RTE radio is balanced. The items are mixed between the Dáil and Seanad, so it is not quite clear all the time if you have missed what is going to be said about the Seanad.  I do agree with Senator McEllistrim and others that it wold be greatly appreciated if the time for reporting the proceedings of both Houses could be extended. However, I imagine RTE do a certain amount of research in terms of audience interest and it may well be that the great Irish public are less interested in our proceedings than we are, and anything that can make our proceedings more relevant is to be applauded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2351" /> I regret that there was not continuous live broadcasting here last week, for example, when the Government failed to take up Private Members' time despite the fact that there are a number of extremely important motions down in the names of individual Senators.  The Irish people would have been most interested to learn that the Government side had absolutely nothing to contribute during a period of time that was allocated to them and that they then deprived&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure that RTE will be well able to look after their own affairs when they sit down and address themselves to what has been said here this morning but there are a number of things that I would like to say.  First, I do not like the condescension of people like Senator Norris who speak about the superior intelligence of University Members.  That is an insult to the people of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that from the cocoon he lives in his items of interest might not be the items of interest that should be addressed in this House.  I am talking about the people on the back-benches, including Senators Ross and O'Toole, who consider that what is of interest to them is of interest to the nation.  What we are here to do is to ensure that legislation goes through.</P>

      <P>This House has addressed itself to more legislation in the past session than has been done heretofore. We have also addressed ourselves to more items of public interest than any other Seanad.  There are certain Senators here who think that they should each day raise what they call a topical matter.  That is not what this House is here for and this side of the House will not accept their strictures just because we do not agree with what they say this House should be doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been a number of points made.  The point was made by Senator McGowan that we should review this motion and also that of any other legally authorised broadcasting authority being allowed the privilege of coming into this House.  That is a matter for the Committee on Procedures and Privileges and will be taken up by that committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the resolution only granting a further extension of 12 months, again, it has been determined by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that this is the way we should go about things and until they change that rule the matter will come before the House every 12 months.  Just in case anybody goes out of the House with the impression that the committee have <Col N="2353" /> agreed that RTE should come in here and be allowed to broadcast, may I just say that what was agreed was that there should be further investigation by them as to whether television should come in here or not.  We should give due credit to RTE for the coverage they give to this House and the other House.</P>
    <P>As far as the newspapers are concerned. I have to say that the coverage of this House by <i>The Irish Times</i> and by the <i>Cork Examiner</i> is excellent. Occasionally there is good coverage by the <i>Irish Independent</i>; I am afraid that there are reporters here from the <i>Irish Independent</i> who sit here day after day and they do not apparently get the support of their sub-editors when they send in their reports.  I have again to say that the <i>Irish Press</i> group are disgraceful&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The <i>Irish Press</i> group is disgraceful in its attitude towards this House.  There seems to be a total lack of coverage and it must be deliberate policy in that newspaper that this House is not covered.  The seeking of publicity is a matter for individual Members.  They are not going to be allowed to get publicity here from me for their own particular interests.</P>
      <P>On the programme slot, I would agree that there may be better times for both programmes but, having said that, from the number of people who come to Members of the Seanad and mention what has been said in that particular programme, it would appear that quite a number of people around the country find that the time slot for &ldquo;Today in the Oireachtas&rdquo; is good.  There has been criticism of the time given to the Seanad compared with that given to reporting the proceedings of the Dáil.  I would agree we should get more time.  If the editorial staff have to cut us down to a very small slot, obviously it will be difficult to give a broad view of what happened on a particular day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recommend this motion to the House. The points raised will be put by me to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges <Col N="2354" /> and I am sure that RTE will take notice of what has been said here today.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>First I wish to express my appreciation to Senator Magnier and his colleagues for putting down this motion in the House which enables us to have a discussion &mdash; to my knowledge the first in the Oireachtas &mdash; on this very issue based on this very important report.  It is appropriate that I should give something of the background to the issue we are addressing here this afternoon and then give a flavour of the Government's position at this point and some guidelines as to what our position will be in the future in respect of the Killanin report.</P>
      <P>In September 1982 the Government established the commission of inquiry into the thoroughbred horse breeding industry under the chairmanship of Lord Killanin.  I am sure I echo the sentiments of Senators here when I express our appreciation to Lord Killanin for this very thorough report and also our particular welcome to him in the House here this afternoon to listen to the views being expressed by Senators to, hopefully, advance the ideas further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference given to the commission were: to examine all aspects of the thoroughbred horse breeding <Col N="2355" /> industry including horse racing and to make recommendations on its future development.  In doing so the Government considered at the time that in view of the important role which the horse plays in the economic and social life of the nation there was a need to examine the state of the thoroughbred breeding and racing industries to identify the contribution to the various sectors in it to the economy, to analyse the financial structure and to present guidelines as to future policy.</P>
    <P>The commission visited other countries to study racing, betting and breeding and, of course, visited racecourses and a number of studs in Ireland.  A comprehensive picture of the structure, organisation and inter-relationship of the breeding, racing and betting sectors of the industry is given in the commission's report.  A valuable economic analysis of the racing industry is also given and statistical data and information are compiled in the appendices.  The report, of course, contains many recommendations.  Most of these are for consideration and implementation by the bodies or organisations directly concerned and are not a matter for the Legislature or for Government: others require Government decision and subsequent legislation.</P>
    <P>Lord Killanin and his colleagues in the commission are to be thanked for the thorough and comprehensive study they made of this important sector of the economy. Likewise, many individuals and bodies who assisted the commission in their work must be thanked for their helpful and positive approach.</P>
    <P>The report was published in July 1986 without commitment on the part of the Government in order to stimulate public debate on the issues raised.  The various interested bodies in the racing and breeding sectors were asked for their views on the report in general and also on those recommendations which directly affected them.  As I said earlier, this debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas will have a major bearing on the Government's thinking on this matter and is being held at an appropriate time in view of the <Col N="2356" /> fact that the Government are actively considering the report.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a long tradition of breeding racehorses and indeed the thoroughbred horse is perceived abroad as an element in the country's identity.  The breeding industry has prospered in recent times with output and employment rising.  The more traditional element in the breeding industry is long established as a part of Irish farming where, typically, the farmer keeps one or two mares producing foals for flat or national hunt racing.  Over the years breeding has developed successfully and now also consists of stud farms with a large number of mares and stallions of all classes in addition to smaller breeders.</P>
    <P>In terms of climate, availability of labour and management skills, Ireland possesses natural advantages as a centre for thoroughbred breeding.  There are a number of others areas in the world which enjoy some advantages and, as a consequence, there is strong international competition for business in thoroughbred breeding.  Nevertheless our advantages and achievements in breeding, training and racing are such that we can face the future in this industry with confidence. While many individuals have succeeded and put the name of Ireland prominently on the map I feel the extraordinary achievements in the national hunt and flat of Mr. Vincent O'Brien as a trainer are worthy of special mention.  Ireland will always have a prominent place in the thoroughbred industry when individuals of Vincent O'Brien's calibre are involved.</P>
    <P>The structure of the industry reflects the uncertainty inherent in racing.  The risks of stallion ownership are systematically spread by the practice of syndication. Typically, 40 shares in the stallions are allocated, each share carrying liability for one-fortieth of the cost. However, there are many kinds of syndication arrangements, but the essence of all of them is the spreading of risk.</P>
    <P>Mare owners are also exposed to substantial risks.  Only 53 per cent of mares bred worldwide produce live foals.  A mare owner, who breeds a foal and keeps <Col N="2357" /> it for racing is exposed to further risks. Most breeders dispose of the horses they have bred as foals or yearlings, thus realising cash to finance their activities and off-loading some of the risks.  People who purchase foals for subsequent sale as yearlings provide another source of liquidity in the bloodstock market.  Most yearlings are sold into training establishments. Between mares and stallions, about 7,000 horses are involved in the Irish thoroughbred breeding industry. The industry is characterised by large numbers of breeders with just one mare. There were over 2,000 of these, out of a total of nearly 4,000 breeders.</P>
    <P>Most stallion studs have relatively few stallions.  At present, it is estimated that about a dozen studs in Ireland have four or more stallions standing.  The vast majority have one or two.</P>
    <P>Let me say a word on the Equine Centre.  Equine diseases can have a devastating effect on breeding and racing stock.  There are many diseases with which breeders have to contend which call for investigation and diagnosis.  The Equine Centre fulfils this need.  Its brief is to deal with disease problems as they arise, and its facilities are available, through veterinarians, to those engaged in thoroughbred breeding, racing, show jumping, eventing, hunting, pony clubs and all other equestrian activities.  The Equine Centre was an initiative of the Irish breeding industry itself and it has been funded entirely by the Irish racing and breeding industries.  They deserve our congratulations and appreciation for taking this very worthwhile initiative.</P>
    <P>The Irish National Stud was set up under the National Stud Act, 1945 and given power to operate special schemes for improvement of thoroughbred breeding. In particular, it attempts to make available good stallions at reasonable stud fees to the smaller breeder.  In addition, the National Stud pursues a programme of activities which include: (i)  standing its stallions at public studs; (ii)  providing training courses for the various categories of stud-farm personnel &mdash; the stud management course attracts students from all over the world; (iii) <Col N="2358" /> the provision of certain services to the industry, including a foster mother service, a plasma bank, and the promotion of research into equine diseases.</P>
    <P>In regard to the racing industry attendances at race meetings increased steadily from 1950 to the middle of the seventies. However, there has been a fall-off since. The rise in attendances was accompanied by a substantial increase in the number of race meetings and in the average attendance at each meeting.  The subsequent decline has been reflected, primarily, in a drop in the average attendance rather than a reduced number of meetings.  Racing is a significant attraction for visitors.  Many of our summer race meetings are patronised by tourists and the introduction of Sunday racing creates an additional opportunity.</P>
    <P>At present there are just over 350 trainers involved in the racing industry. Many of these have relatively small stables.  Sixty-seven per cent of all trainers have ten or less horses to look after. In addition to trainers, the racing industry employs jockeys, apprentices, stable staff and those employed by the racing authorities and the racecourses.  There are close to 5,000 full time equivalent jobs in the racing industry.  That is a measure of its importance to the economy generally and no doubt its potential to create even greater employment is a matter that will concern Senators today in the follow-up to this report.</P>
    <P>There are 28 racecourses in the whole of Ireland &mdash; two of which are in Northern Ireland and 26 in this State.  Most are privately owned and are run by committees or as private companies. However, three of the courses, Leopardstown, Navan and Tipperary, are either wholly or partially owned by the Racing Board, while the Curragh is owned and run by the Turf Club.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; courses hold relatively few meetings but achieve an exceptionally high turnover per meeting.  This is particularly true of Galway and Listowel.  Galway, in fact, despite having only nine race days a year has the third highest annual turnover following Leopardstown and the Phoenix Park. <Col N="2359" /> Between them, the &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; courses and the Dublin area courses account for over 51 per cent of all turnover.  Facilities for the racegoing public are indeed inadeqaute at many of the racecourses.</P>
    <P>Let me a say a word on the organisation of the racing industry.  The governing bodies, comprised of the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee (INHSC), administer the rules for flat and national hunt racing respectively.  Both are voluntary bodies and elect their own members.</P>
    <P>The Racing Board, established under the Racing Board and Racecourses Act, 1945, is the principal instrument of State involvement in the industry.  It collects the on-course betting levy and operates the on-course tote.  The proceeds fund the board's own activities and are the major source of finance for prize money in horse racing.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to deal with the actual recommendations contained in the report.  As I have already indicated, I hope Senators will appreciate as the matter is currently before the Government I will not be able to make a definitive statement in advance of full Government consideration of the matter. I cannot anticipate the outcome of the Government's discussions and I would not want in any way to cut across collective Cabinet responsibility, in which I am involved, by directly conveying my own personal impression.  Having said that, I feel free to give my own personal and ministerial impression on a number of important areas, even in advance of Government consideration of the matter. No doubt the Government response will at least take account of the views expressed here this afternoon.</P>
    <P>The report contains 123 recommendations of which 32, if implemented, would require amending legislation. Responsibility for action on many of the recommendations currently lies with a number of bodies such as the Racing Board and the governing bodies of Irish racing.</P>
    <P>The main recommendation of the report is the setting up of a Thoroughbred <Col N="2360" /> Industry Board to replace the Racing Board.  It would: (a)  have responsibility for planning, financing and developing racing and the development of an ongoing strategy for breeding; (b)  have power to establish subsidiaries and be given responsibility for the National Stud, the totalisator, a new racecourse management company, The Irish Equine Centre, the Racing Apprenticeship Centre of Education, RACE; and (c)  be financed by on and off-course betting.</P>
    <P>I am not certain that having one body with responsibilitiy for all aspects of the industry would be necessarily in the best interests of the industry.  The breeding sector has very different demands in terms of expertise, advice and information needed in contrast to those of the racing sector.  Placing responsibility for these very diverse needs under one body may not be highly desirable.  Successful private bodies such as the Irish Equine Centre and the Racing Apprenticeship Centre of Education should not be absorbed into the public sector and be a charge on public funds.  Senators will note that in general the Government are going in the other direction.  I am satisfied that they operate very successfully under private funding.  I consider that the Racing Board and the National Stud should retain their identities and continue to decide their own priorities, policies and courses of action for the two quite distinct sectors of the industry for which they have responsibility.  The National Stud has a good record as a commercial State company and has operated in a satisfactory manner under the statutory restrictions imposed on it.  It should, therefore, be left as an independent State body.  All in all I do not favour the adoption of the concept of a single Thoroughbred Industry Board.</P>
    <P>It is, however, appropriate that the Racing Board be reconstituted with a view to becoming more effective in the implementation of its functions.  I am considering how this can best be achieved and hope to be in a position shortly to outline proposals in this regard.  The recommendations for the governing <Col N="2361" /> bodies are matters for themselves and I do not propose to comment on them.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that the National Stud should set charges at rates prevailing in its area and have its borrowing limit increased to £5 million.  The National Stud was established under the National Stud Act, 1945, to provide good-class stallions at a reasonable fee to the small farmer-breeder.  Were it not for this policy many small breeders who are the lifeblood of the breeding industry would be put out of business because they would be unable to afford the service fees charged by private studs.  For this reason I consider that the stud should not implement the recommendation that it should charge stud fees at the rate prevailing in its area.</P>
    <P>The National Stud has operated quite successfully.  It provides necessary advice and help on aspects of horse production and also runs a very successful course in stud management.  It is desirable that the stud should be given every chance to operate in the commercial market place. It is inhibited in this regard by the fact that its borrowing capacity is limited to £0.5 million at any one time.  I am, therefore, in favour of the commission's propoal that the borrowing powers of the National Stud be increased from £0.5 million to £5 million.</P>
    <P>The recommendations on breeding raise complex and legal questions relating to a system of registering legal title to thoroughbred horses, reviewing the Agricultural Credit Act, 1978, to facilitate borrowing against bloodstock, registering all charges against bloodstock in a central register for bloodstock mortgages. These recommendations require further detailed examination particularly with regard to the legal considerations.  I am in favour of the recommendation that the suffix IRL be used to identify Irish horses.  I am happy to see that the bodies with responsibility in this area are endeavouring to have this recommendation implemented.</P>
    <P>My colleagues and Senators will appreciate generally that the primary responsibility for taxation within the collective responsibility of Government is <Col N="2362" /> obviously for another Minister.  I must bring the attention of the House to that fact.  Recommendations on taxation relate to taxation of Racing Board grants for the improvement of racecourse amenities, exemption of stallion nominations, the provision of stock relief, the level of off-course betting, taxation of on-course betting.</P>
    <P>The recommendation that 2 per cent of off-course betting should be returned to racing and that the level of off-course betting duty be held at 10 per cent would have serious implications for the Exchequer.  Currently this would cost £4 million per year.  Recommendations on taxation have serious implications for the public finances and I do not propose to comment further on them at this stage as taxation is a matter for the Government as a whole when framing the budget.  I will certainly bring the recommendations and views expressed by Senators to the attention of the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Finance.  The recommendations relating to racecourses highlight the need to improve the facilities and amenities at Irish racecourses.  I am confident that many of these deficiencies identified by the commission will be improved in the near future.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate the Racing Board to meet its obligations I consider that its borrowing power should be increased significantly from the current level of £20,000 which was set in 1945.  I am prepared to take action to implement that. The recommendations on the rules of racing are a matter for the governing bodies of racing.</P>
    <P>The commission recommended that 2 per cent of off-course betting should be returned to racing.  I have referred to the implications of this when discussing taxation.  On the recommendations to establish the tote as an off-course betting medium, I am not convinced on current level of off-course betting that this is the appropriate time to do it.  I feel that such investment would not be a commercial success.  The same would be true for telephone betting as experience to date would seem to suggest.  The level of <Col N="2363" /> investment required is high and a commercial failure would have serious adverse consequences for the Exchequer. As to a computerised tote system at racecourses, phase one is already operational at Leopardstown.</P>
    <P>The recommendations on bookmakers and bookmakers shops relate to improving the facilities offered at betting shops, improving the appeals procedure, control of bookmaker admission charges, disputes between bookmakers and bettors. The current procedure for hearing bookmakers appeals can lead to long delays before the hearing is held.  The number of members on the appeals committee is three.  In order to improve the whole procedure and reduce the time delays I consider that the appeals committee should be increased to five with a quorum of three.  I will be taking action shortly to implement that.</P>
    <P>I also consider it appropriate that the present control on admission charges to racecourses for bookmakers and their assistants should be reviewed.  The current control relates bookmakers' entry fees to admission charges for the general public.  A better system would be to arrange a fixed charge which would be subject to annual review.  I also consider that a body should be established to arbitrate on disputes between bookmakers and bettors.  This might be done by extending the powers of the appeal committee. This is generally in line with the Killanin report.</P>
    <P>Sunday racing has been introduced by the Racing Board.  Every effort should be made to maximise the potential offered by this development towards attracting more tourism and improving the industry in general.  The provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Act which prevent alcohol from being sold at most Sunday race meetings can be considered in the context of the continuing general review of the Liquor Acts.</P>
    <P>Many of the other recommendations made by the commission are matters to be considered and implemented by the Racing Board, the governing bodies and <Col N="2364" /> other bodies and organisations in the industry.</P>
    <P>The report of the Killanin Commission has focused our minds on the issues currently demanding attention. There are some recommendations which require Government decisions and subsequent legislation.  A memorandum on these recommendations is already prepared by me and will be considered formally by the Government in the very near future. It might well be that, but for the absence of the Taoiseach in Australia and New Zealand these days, it would be on the Government agenda this week.  Senators will be aware of the fact that the Taoiseach has a very lively interest in this whole area and I do not propose to take decisions on this matter in his absence. That would, to say the least of it, be inviting a degree of criticism, and problems.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the report, I have given approval to the Racing Board for the setting up of a subsidiary company for the purposes of: operating the three board owned racecourses at Navan, Leopardstown and Tipperary; providing management, training, computer and consultancy services and facilities in all aspects of horse racing to interested parties; setting standards for all authorised racecourses and for the monitoring of them; and assessing racecourses which apply to the board for grant assistance to ensure the limited resources of the board are utilised in the most effective manner.</P>
    <P>I consider that the establishment of this subsidiary company, together with a £500,000 grant for the refurbishment of racecourses as a means of increasing tourist numbers and revenue, will go a considerable way towards meeting the industry's needs as regards racecourses. That is very much in line, as Senators will appreciate, with the recommendations of the commission.  The Government in deciding to make such a major allocation to the improvement of the racecourse facilities from the lottery funds are giving a clear indication of our acceptance of that priority.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government will, in the <Col N="2365" /> very near future, be considering many of the report's recommendations &mdash; at least those that are relevant to us in Government. While I cannot pre-empt Government decisions, I can assure the House that, where legislation for the implementation of any of the recommendations is required, it will be implemented as quickly as possible.  I should like to thank the House for giving us the opportunity to make this general statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to second this very important all-party motion, that Seanad Éireann takes note of the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Thoroughbred Horse Breeding Industry, generally and rightly known as the Killanin Report, 1986.  The commission was set up by the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Austin Deasy, to examine all aspects of the industry.  The report is divided into three broad areas, breeding, racing and finance.  I welcome the practical suggestion, mooted by Senator John Magnier, for the setting up of an Oireachtas group to examine the urgent needs and requirements of the industry and to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Killanin report.  It was Dr. Michael Smurfit, chairman of the Racing Board, who said in the course of the 1986 annual report of the Racing Board:</P>
      <P>Our aim must be to provide opportunities whereby our best horses remain in training in Ireland, race in Ireland, and are enjoyed by race goers experiencing the best racing and social facilities possible.</P>
      <P>That statement sums up in a nutshell two of the central and most important recommendations of the Killanin report when it states:</P>
      <P>Racing and breeding should be promoted and developed by one authority, and a programme for the upgrading of amenities to be financed by a special levy on off-course betting should be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Commission of Inquiry, which was chaired by Lord Killanin, in their report <Col N="2366" /> underscored the fact that racing and breeding are totally inter-dependent.  It is not widely recognised just how important racing and thoroughbred breeding are to the Irish economy.  This can be seen from the fact that 12,000 people are employed through racing and breeding.  In Ireland the industry has a greater share of the Gross National Product than any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>Indeed, Tony Morris, a top English writer on bloodstock has described Ireland as, &ldquo;now assuredly Europe's leading stallion base&rdquo;.  Jonathan Irwin, managing director of Goffs, Ireland's premier bloodstock sales company, stated that, &ldquo;we have proved that our prices are as good as any in the world and we attract all the world's top bloodstock buyers&rdquo;.  Income from racing sponsorship has increased considerably in recent years.  The Budweiser Irish Derby is the richest classic ever run in Europe and Derby Day is one of the richest ever race days.  In fact, more than £1 billion has been invested in the industry and in many of the technical areas of racing and thoroughbred breeding.  We have, indeed, an indigenous industry of world class.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in one important area, that of amenities and facilities which are available at our racecourses, we lag behind our international competitors. Apart from the fact that our racegoers deserve better, attendances will suffer if we do not invest in amenities and facilities. There is, as the Minister for Agriculture and Food has indicated, a contribution that the industry can make to the tourist trade both from the point of view of publicity gained abroad and from the attraction it provides for tourists. Unless a programme of investment in racecourse infrastructure is undertaken immediately, attendances will drop with a consequent effect on breeders who rely on our racecourses as showcases for our important breeding industry which now produces more thoroughbred foals per annum than does Britain.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should like to welcome the comprehensive programme for <Col N="2367" /> the provision and development of facilities and amenities in Greenpark Racecourse, Limerick, recently formulated by the Limerick Race Company which will involve, in partnership with Shannon Free Airport Development Company, the provision of an exhibition and conference centre, a small business and holiday park and extensive car parking and other essential facilities.  I should like to appeal to the Government, and to the relevant Ministers, including the Minister for Agriculture and Food who has many connections with the mid-west region, to give this unique project and partnership every support and assistance by way of Government and European funding.</P>
    <P>The Killanin report states:</P>
    <P>Horse racing is a sport, and it is part of the entertainments industry, and as such the provision of satisfactory facilities and amenities on the racecourse for racegoers is a necessity.  The prevalence of inadequate services and substandard amenities on Irish racecourses has been a recurring theme in the submissions received by us and while services remain inadequate the racing industry has little hope of attracting new patronage to the sport.</P>
    <P>To rectify the position the Killanin report called for a programme of investment to be financed by a special levy of 2 per cent on off-course betting.  The report has pointed out that Ireland is, indeed, the only one of the major racing countries where racing does not benefit from the proceeds of betting off-course.  However, in the light of developments since the publication of the report it would appear that a 1 per cent special levy would be sufficient to finance an amenity programme over a period of, say, ten years. This levy would enable the Racing Board to carry out a planned development programme over that period and would give a meaningful employment in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>At the moment horse racing in Ireland receives no share of the tax revenue yielded by off-course betting, and I believe that a 1 per cent levy would be a <Col N="2368" /> great help to our racecourse executives. In all the principal racing countries a proportion of the tax raised from off-course betting is returned to the industry for its development.  For example, in Britain the Betting Levy Act, 1961, introduced a levy on off-course bookmakers and established a statutory body to collect and distribute it.  It should be noted that Irish betting shops which were legalised as far back as 1926 were used as an example by the British authorities when considering the legalising of high street betting shops in Britain.  This levy has been used in Britain to improve prize money, to fund improvements to racecourses and, indeed, for a variety of other important purposes.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as the Minister has rightly indicated, has a long tradition of breeding thoroughbred horses.  The thoroughbred horse is perceived, as the Killanin report indicates, as an element of our country's identity.  The more traditional element in the breeding industry is long established as part of Irish farming where typically the farmer keeps one or two mares to produce foals for flat or national hunt racing.  Over the years breeding has developed successfully and now consists of not alone the traditional breeding farms but also stud farms, with a large number of mares and stallions of all classes.</P>
    <P>In terms of climate and the availability of labour and management skills, Ireland possesses natural advantages as a centre for thoroughbred breeding.  However, our circumstances are by no means unique.  There are a number of other areas in the world which enjoy comparable advantages.  There is, of course, at present very strong international competition for business in the thoroughbred industry.  There is also an unfortunate widespread misconception in some quarters that thoroughbred breeding and profits from stud farms are in some sense exempt from taxation.  This, of course, is not the case.  Breeding in Ireland is taxed as an agricultural activity with one important exception and this relates to the income directly generated by stallion nominations and forms a major part of <Col N="2369" /> the income generated in the commercial stud sector.</P>
    <P>Since 1969 this category of income has been exempt from income tax and corporation tax.  It is now generally accepted that, without this very important exemption of stallion income from tax, most of the top stallions in this country would not have come here in the first place.  This point has been very forcibly put by Pat Fitzgerald of Allied Irish Investment Bank in a recent article entitled <i>Banking on Bloodstock, a Major National Opportunity</i> when he stated:</P>
    <P>The thoroughbred horse is a highly saleable and easily transportable asset. The foreign investor in a stud farm in Ireland may have land assets worth £½ million and bloodstock worth £20 million.  It would be an easy decision to relocate in another country.  That would be a tragedy as bloodstock breeding is a growth sector capable of creating wealth and additional employment.</P>
    <P>The location of the best stallions in Ireland is the single most important factor contributing to the success of our Irish bloodstock industry.  It is no wonder therefore that the Commission on Taxation in their second report recognised the value of this important exemption to the industry and recommended that the exemption be continued.</P>
    <P>The Killanin report recommended that the exemption of the stallion income from tax should be continued and that the position should be strengthened to give the industry better stability by including in the next Finance Act a provision that the exemption will stand for at least the period, say, up to the year 2000.  This would give a measure of security especially for new syndications where the stallion might have a productive life of, say, 15 to 20 years.</P>
    <P>On improving general facilities at racecourses the Killanin report recommends that priorities should be given to the provision of special facilities for the disabled and the elderly and, where feasible, that racecourses should have a service road to allow ambulances access to the track. <Col N="2370" /> Racecourse executives should make every effort to improve the standards of catering and the improvement of stabling should be accorded a high priority.  The Killanin report states:</P>
    <P>The poor quality of catering at many racecourses featured prominently in submissions.  We recommend that racecourse executives should make a renewed effort in this area which is a recurring source of adverse comment.</P>
    <P>Finally, Lord Killanin, in a foreword to this report, states: &ldquo;The implementation of the recommendations in the report will help to achieve the full potential of racing&rdquo;.  It is important, therefore, that this report should not be pigeon-holded and that the Government should implement without delay as many as possible of the central and main recommendations contained in the report.</P>
    <P>I would like to express the thanks and the congratulations of this House to Lord Killanin and the very dedicated and widely representative members of the commission who produced such a fine and excellent export.  I formally second the motion proposed by Senator Magnier and I fully support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMagnier" hpid="Mr. Magnier Mr. Magnier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magnier</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to say how honoured I was to accept the Taoiseach's nomination to this House and how pleased I am to be here to promote and represent the views of the bloodstock industry.  That is the role I see for myself and will continue to pursue as long as I am here.  In addition, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Lord Killanin for the excellent work he has done for all aspects of the thoroughbred industry.  I would like to pay tribute also to the other members of the commission, all of whom made an enormous contribution to the production of the final report.  I welcome the opportunity which we have today to debate and discuss the thoroughbred industry and its future and I looked forward very much to hearing the views and contributions of my fellow Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having been here for a year and a half I am very glad to be able to debate the <Col N="2371" /> horse industry.  In future perhaps more time should be given in both Houses to what is a very important industry.  It is very much tied to agriculture and it is a very important sector within agriculture. The thoroughbred industry is one of Ireland greatest assets.  Irish horses have a well-earned international reputation. Our climate and our natural resources and amenities are also conducive to the successful breeding of top class horses and, most important, the natural ability of Irish people is well recognised and speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>The industry has created jobs across the entire spectrum of the employment scale including veterinarians, agents, auctioneers and sale companies etc.  We now have young people of world class calibre with a wealth of experience and acquired knowledge which forms an ideal base for the future expansion of the industry.  In addition, the Irish bloodstock industry is among the most innovative in the world.  The recent establishment of the Irish Equine Centre, working in conjunction with similar organisations around the world, will help to provide the industry with the technical expertise necessary for future development. As pointed out by the Minister, this was funded completely from within the industry.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that, where possible, the industry has generated funds internally to provide the necessary tools for expansion.  The Irish Equine Centre is a prime example of that. We are also fortunate in having sales companies and bloodstock agencies of a high standard.  These companies have invested the capital necessary to assist in selling and exporting Irish bloodstock.  In fact, they operate all over the world and we are very fortunate to have them based in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As well as relaying on its natural advantages the Irish industry has also had support from successive Governments.  The tax concession introduced in the Finance Act, 1969, marked the real beginning of the development of the bloodstock industry in Ireland.  This was brilliant <Col N="2372" /> legislation and, at no cost to the Exchequer, allowed the bloodstock industry to become a world force.  The net effect of this has been to create something out of nothing.  The Exchequer has backed a real winner in terms of its return on investment made.  I will return later to this matter and will refer to the current problems.  We should bear in mind that the Exchequer is now reaping the added value and all the related downstream activities from something which would not have come here otherwise.</P>
    <P>The combination of natural advantages and State goodwill which is essential for the success of any venture has enabled this country to build up a strong and vibrant domestic thoroughbred industry of international importance.  Out of the top ten stallions currently active in Europe, five are standing in Ireland.  In addition, many of the top stallions which in previous years would have gone to stud in the US or Europe are now standing in Ireland.  This is not only as a direct result of the level of investment, both domestic and foreign, which was promoted in the industry during the seventies and early eighties but also relates to the natural affinity of Irish people to work with the horse.  We are now really beginning to reap the benefit and it has been a slow but positive growth pattern.</P>
    <P>The industry also made a major contribution to our economy in an era when many of our traditional industries were in decline.  This contribution can be seen in a number of areas, including employment. The Killanin report estimates that the thoroughbred industry employs 10,000 full-time workers, 10,000 part-time workers and several thousand others who are indirectly dependent on bloodstock for their livelihood.  We should remember always that these jobs are mainly in areas where employment opportunities are extremely limited and where skills are passed on at no cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I should also point out the importance of the fact that a large number of farmers also rely on bloodstock breeding as a secondary source of income.  This is especially true in the area of the National <Col N="2373" /> Hunt, which is where we have had our most traditional success, whereas the upgrading of our flat racing and breeding to international levels has been more recent.  This is particularly important in the current climate of quotas for milk and grain and maybe more quotas to come. This is an industry in which there are no quotas and where we have the raw materials, the people and the facilities to produce the goods.</P>
    <P>The State also receives a direct financial contribution from the racing industry by way of a 10 per cent tax on off-course betting.  In 1987 this represented a contribution of £19.5 million on a total betting turnover of £214 million.  The industry also contributes high value-added exports and foreign exchange earnings.  Additional taxes are also generated within the breeding industry itself and from other spin-off industries, for example, the construction and transport industries, suppliers of agricultural produce and feedstuffs, professional and other service industries, to name but a few.</P>
    <P>There is a problem which I believe is a major weak point in the industry.  This was highlighted by the Killanin report and relates to the fact that the Irish racing industry is extremely weak, both in terms of finance and facilities.  The report concluded that the prospects of the industry developing further are non-existent under the current structure.  The reality is that many of the racecourse buildings are falling down and are generally in an unsafe condition, giving rise to health and fire regulations problems.  This is neither the fault of management nor a problem which can be solved within the industry; it is because of the way the system is currently structured or, to put it another way, it is a matter which the Minister and the members of the Cabinet have to fix.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that many of the other recommendations in the report are matters for the internal bodies of the industry.  He rightly pointed that out and, of course, a lot of action has been taken in many areas, but the industry is not in a position to fix the main problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2374" /> The lack of finance has a two-fold effect and can immediately be seen by visiting the majority of our racecourses. Nearly all racecourses are not commercially viable.  They are unable to generate funds to modernise facilities and must, therefore, rely on sponsors and the Racing Board.  I repeat that this is not the fault of the management or the industry as a whole; it is the fault of the system.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the Racing Board's contribution of income to the racing industry amounted to £4.2 million and, of this, £2.9 million went in prize money.  Only £460,000 went to development grants for racecourses and spread over 26 courses in the Republic this gives an average grant per course of approximately £17,500.  Even a three-card-trick man could not operate on those numbers.  I have experience of the effect which this is having on the Irish breeding industry. Racecourses near Fethard, including Limerick city, Tipperary, Clonmel, Thurles and Mallow, have facilities which are a long way below comparable courses in other countries.  Foreign owners who visit some of our venues once to see their horses run, are reluctant to make a return visit and we often get a &ldquo;Don't call us, we'll call you&rdquo; response.  This could not be more serious because the next step is that they will relocate to a more suitable and profitable environment.  We may not see these people again and the country as a whole will lose out.  This will be after the trouble of getting them here in the first place.</P>
    <P>One Senator who spoke painted a very rosy picture of Limerick city.  It was far too optimistic a picture and unless the Government can do something about giving some help to racing this will remain a pipe dream.  The people of Limerick, in the future, may be watching their racing from a tent because as I see it, the buildings are about to fall down and, in fact, one building there has been already condemned. Some drastic action will have to be taken if we want to improve our racecourses.</P>
    <P>The second area of weakness relates to poor prize money.  This is an important aspect if more top-class horses are to <Col N="2375" /> remain in Ireland.  It is especially important given the internationally mobile nature of the industry and the extent to which other countries have invested in and developed their bloodstock industries. Prize money determines the quality of our races in the relative pattern of international racing and we must keep pace with our competitors.  We must make no mistake about it: racing is an international business and we are in direct competition with other countries. Some improvement has been made in recent years on the prize money front. However, drawing a conclusion from this can be very misleading.  I believe that the growth in prize money is not sustainable as to some extent it is generated by one-off short-term sponsorship deals and the resourcefulness of some people in the industry.  It, therefore, gives the entire prize money areas a false perception of success and, when judged against what the rest of the world has to offer, it stands out as the weakest in a very conspicuous way.</P>
    <P>These weaknesses are serious in that structure of the entire bloodstock industry is such that a weak racing industry has implications for all other aspects of the industry.  Strong racing encourages foreign owners who have bred in Ireland, to keep their horses here, giving rise to future strength in the industry and it helps all other sectors of the economy as well. We need to get people to come to Ireland in the first place so that they can become investors in and buyers of Irish bloodstock and potential ambassadors for the whole industry and the country.  Every product needs marketing and Irish racing is the shop window for the entire bloodstock industry.  The quality of our races, the worldwide reputation they have acquired and the continued worldwide coverage of that is something which benefits the entire industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We need to be conscious that the bloodstock industry is an internationally mobile asset and that if we allow our domestic racing industry to decline our traditional dominance in the industry will be lost to other countries which have <Col N="2376" /> not been so negligent.  This would have serious consequences not only for the Irish bloodstock industry but also for the wider economy.  We cannot afford to stand still as this means we are constantly losing our position to our competitors.  If we lose our worldwide standing the Irish bloodstock industry will become a third rate industry with reducing export potential and an inability to retain and attract foreign investors and will, of course, mean an obvious reduction in employment opportunities.  To date we have been propping up the racing industry on a temporary basis with grants, one-off sponsorship deals and various other fire-fighting methods.  This is not workable and is totally unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Given the limited resources we have as a nation, any solution would have to ideally balance a number of factors: it would have to be self-financing from an Exchequer viewpoint; have immediate impacts which would be visible; secure the future strength of the entire bloodstock industry; by improving the facilities thus making racing a sport for all, irrespective of wealth or position, have wider benefits for the entire economy and for the quality of life in the country as a whole; be easy to implement and involve only a minor restructuring of the current legislation governing the racing industry.</P>
    <P>I want to refer further to the proposed solution.  As I previously mentioned, there is a 10 per cent rate of off-course tax which generates close to £20 million in revenue.  I would propose to reduce the current rate of tax on off course betting from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent and, of that 7.5 per cent, 1.5 per cent could be channelled directly back into the racing industry.  The proceeds would amount to £3 million or £4 million and would be used urgently to improve racecourse facilities and, over the longer period, to make improvements in the prize structure.  If this were to happen, I am confident that the impact would be worthwhile and immediate.  I believe that such a contribution would fund a substantial building programme, which could be immediately started.</P>
    <P>Investment in improved facilities does <Col N="2377" /> result in increased attendances at race meetings.  The evidence for this comes from the recent experience of the Leopardstown Race Course.  When Leopardstown was rebuilt by the Racing Board, there was a rise of 50 per cent in attendances.</P>
    <P>Increases in racing prizemoney will not only encourage owners to keep their top quality horses in Ireland, but will retain the international status of our races abroad and, like every other entertainment industry which needs a stage or shop window, racing provides the major international marketing focus for the industry.  As well as coping with the direct problem, such a proposal would have very many benefits, both to the bloodstock industry and to the wider economy. The resultant improvement in facilities will strengthen the racing industry.  This will have a knock-on effect on the breeding industry and more top horses will come to and remain in Ireland.  In addition, a strong bloodstock sector is very important to the national interest. This was highlighted by the Killanin report in its comments on employment levels and the fact that the sector is international in focus &mdash; total foreign trade in the sector in 1984 was estimated at £114 million.</P>
    <P>Racing is also a sport and like any other sport when you achieve international success, it helps to build a sense of pride in the nation as evidenced by our recent success in the European football competition and other sports such as the success of Barry McGuigan, Stephen Roche, Seán Kelly, Eamon Coughlan, John Tracey, to name but a few.</P>
    <P>The industry is also a valuable source of foreign exchange earnings and makes a major contribution towards the image of Ireland abroad.  For example, it is impossible to quantify the value of the Budweiser sponsorship and its international projection of Ireland abroad. Bloodstock is one area where Ireland has the ability and potential to become a major world player.  We must exploit this potential to the full for the benefit of everybody.  The consequences of not doing so are too serious to ignore.  There <Col N="2378" /> has been a lot of talk about 1992, but 1992, after all, is a two way street.  People can come here and horses can be brought here but on the other hand, people can also leave and go elsewhere.  It is not all good news.  We have got to be vigilant.</P>
    <P>The horse breeding industry is already at a level to generate and support high quality employment.  This extra employment would be important in that, not only is it high quality, but it is focused in rural areas, areas which have not benefited as much under other employment schemes and under the urban renewal schemes specifically designed to promote inner city development.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of that proposal would also have an immediate effect on employment in the construction industry at a time when construction in general is still depressed.  It would have knock-on effects in terms of increased VAT, PAYE, PRSI contributions and reduced dole payments.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a major growth sector internationally and with the shortening of the average working week, the increasing amount of leisure time available and the increasing disposable incomes, it is the sector which will make an increasingly important contribution to the economy of Ireland in future years.  Racing has an important contribution to make towards tourism and as an attraction for visitors to Ireland, as for example, Ascot, Cheltenham, York and Liverpool attract visitors to England.  A vibrant domestic racing industry will encourage many Irish racegoers to remain at home and spend their money here, rather than go abroad. It will encourage people to come to Ireland.  We cannot guarantee the weather, but given the right financial environment, we can guarantee successful racing festivals.</P>
    <P>Research carried out by the Racing Board into the popularity of Sunday racing showed that the meetings at Navan, Leopardstown and the Phoenix Park drew an average of 9 per cent of their attendances from Northern Ireland alone.  The potential for racing to attract tourism has long been recognised with many local festivals using race meetings <Col N="2379" /> as their centre point.  Consequently, a revival of the racing industry will give a major boost to the tourist sector and this will have a knock-on effect on all other sectors.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about 1992 and rightly so.  Given the right investment, there is no reason Ireland cannot become the home of racing and bloodstock in a Europe of over 300 million people.  The possibility of creating an export betting market should not be overlooked.  The reduction in betting tax to 7.5 per cent would make betting in Ireland a more attractive proposition for overseas punters. Rates would then be lower than our nearest competitor, the UK.  The attractiveness of betting in Ireland will be assisted by the fact that it is now possible, with the advent of satellite TV, to view live racing as never before.  The removal of barriers on cross-Border transactions now planned to take effect in 1992, will make the timing of reforms all the more opportune.  A reduction in the rate of taxation would also have the effect of reducing the amount of illegal betting which is still taking place.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the racing industry should get 1.5 per cent of the 7.5 per cent, that is 20 per cent of turnover. What I am really saying is that racing needs that 20 per cent regardless of what the turnover may be.  The reduced figure of 7.5 per cent is a figure which I believe is in the best interest of everybody and could help turnover.  This proposal could be implemented with negligible overall cost to the Exchequer and the immediate gains from such a project will be very visible.  The direct effect on the Exchequer would be that their share of the off course betting receipts would be reduced from 10 per cent to 6 per cent. However, it must be remembered that the likely effect of this would be much less and, even ignoring the potential for gain on turnover, it would result in an overall gain to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the levy on off course betting was reduced by 50 per cent, from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.  Total betting turnover increased by 60 per cent between 1984 <Col N="2380" /> and 1986.  I believe that there is room for similar expansion now.</P>
    <P>There will also be other benefits to the Exchequer.  Lower tax rates leave punters with more money to wager, increasing total betting turnover further. There would be a gain by way of PAYE and PRSI on extra employment.  The recycling process of the money involved would result in additional VAT and increased taxes on profits, both within the betting industry and in related industries. In other words it would benefit everybody as well as the Exchequer. What I am really saying is that we should circulate this money for the benefit of all before it gets back to the Exchequer and on its way back I think it will collect some more.  Everybody can win in the long run. The investment spread would result in jobs being created throughout the country and the industry would have the immediate confidence to borrow the money required to put them in place.</P>
    <P>There is a popular mistaken conception that the horse industry is completely tax free.  This ill-informed and sometimes publicly paraded concept has, I feel, damaged the image of the industry at home and abroad.  Apart from the concession in the 1969 Finance Act, the industry receives no other benefits.  This concession to breeding involves very little actual cost to the Exchequer, since much of the breeding activity would relocate abroad in the absence of the concession and would not have come here in the first place without this benefit.  In fact other countries with a supposedly more hostile environment are investing more in their bloodstock industries than we are.  Our nearest neighbours, England, have a situation where there is no on course betting tax and parts of the industry can benefit from the small business expansion schemes.  They generate in excess of £20 million from a betting levy which goes back into the industry.  They also have the considerable advantage of lower overall tax rates with resultant higher disposable income and favourable investment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Support for racing should be set in the context of economic development policy <Col N="2381" /> generally.  Racing and breeding are already a very substantial industry competing in a very competitive international market and making an important contribution to GNP and to the Irish economy in general.</P>
    <P>The State supports certain manufacturing activities with grants and profits tax rate of just 10 per cent.  Many industries pay less or nothing at all, because of capital allownces and other reliefs.  The State also spends substantial capital moneys in grants and other aids to economic development to create jobs in those same sectors.  The IDA budget exceeds £200 million and about £30 million is spent annually on tourism.</P>
    <P>Thus the case for State assistance to racing is based on the extent of State assistance to comparable sectors of the economy.  Racing is part of a broader thoroughbred industry which is competing for its share of the world market. My present proposal will, I believe, give it an ability to do so in future.  The racing and breeding industry is internationally mobile and should be seen and treated as an economic sector similar to industry and tourism with an important role to play in the overall economic policy.  For a negligible outlay we can now ensure that Ireland continues to play a major role in the international bloodstock markets and that the domestic bloodstock industry can play an increasingly important role in our economy.  This industry is one which we know will succeed and expand, given the right conditions, environment and encouragement.</P>
    <P>The proposal is not unique.  Ireland is one of the few countries where none of the off-course proceeds is returned to racing.  In fact, to my knowledge I cannot name another significant racing country that does not benefit in this way.  The UK, America, Australia, France and Japan all have such schemes providing a major boost to the industry there and not only to the bloodstock industry but to the overall economy, tourism and the quality of life in general.  The Taoiseach who is in Australia will, no doubt, see some of the effects of this himself at first hand.</P>
    <P>By comparison with the countries <Col N="2382" /> listed above the thoroughbred industry in Ireland is much more significant in relation to our overall economy in terms of GNP.  Therefore, a similar programme of finance for this industry will pay higher dividends on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  We have made a major success of our domestic bloodstock industry and built up an industry which is strong and has become a major force in international markets. We have attracted major foreign investors here.  The fact that people such as His Highness the Aga Khan, Prince Abdullah, the Maktoum family, Mr. Walter Haefner and Mr. Bert Firestone, just to name a few, have invested here should be a source of pride to us as a nation.  We must remember that we have no natural wealth.  Whatever wealth is in this country must be got in from outside. We must encourage these people to come here in the first place and when we get them here keep them here for their benefit and in that way to the benefit of everybody.  They have all invested significant capital amounts and created continued employment at no cost to the Exchequer and, more importantly are seen as roving ambassadors for this country. By their actions and by being here they help many sectors of our economy.</P>
    <P>However, there is a need for us to continue to develop this industry and capitalise fully on the enormous potential which exists within the industry.  This need is made all the more urgent by the findings of the Killanin report which highlighted some serious weaknesses within the industry, weaknesses which, combined with increasing international competition, could seriously affect the future health of the industry.  The Killanin Commission report contained 123 wide-ranging recommendations, the most essential of which is to put in place a structure for the refining of the industry and to reinvest some of the betting revenue generated. That is a job for the Government, as the Minister said here.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for continuing to harp on the financial state of the industry because, if we cannot fix that, nothing else will work.  Many of the other recommendations are matters for the various <Col N="2383" /> bodies within the industry but the important thing is, as the Minister has pointed out, that it is a matter for the Government. I get great comfort from knowing that a memorandum is now before the Government and I have every confidence that the people around the table will take note of what we are all saying and, again, what the Taoiseach will see on his visit to Australia.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is no magical formula or something dreamed up in Tipperary. We must explain it to the people properly and if they do not understand it the first time we must continue to say it.  This happens the world over and Ireland is unique in being the only country that gets no help in this way.  This country has survived because the people are so good at this.  The environment is right and, as a result of various facts I have described, we now have some of the best horses in the world.  This is &ldquo;make up your mind time&rdquo;.  The horses are going to stay where we have gone to a great deal of trouble to get them to in the first place.  We have gone from a very good national hunt industry to a wide-ranging dual purpose industry.  It is really up to ourselves now whether we want to go the whole way or see it disintegrate slowly and consider the tens of thousands of people that will affect.</P>
    <P>For example, if a factory around the country somewhere which had cost the IDA many hundreds of thousands of pounds was going to close with a loss of 200 jobs, there would be uproar with people marching and all the media would have hold of it.  It just would not go unnoticed.  We are talking about something much bigger in the horse industry and it is within the power of the Government to decide whether to help it and make it even better, or watch it disintegrate. Now the thing has been started I have every confidence that we will get a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that many of the other recommendations have been put in place since the commission first sat.  This is all credit to Lord Killanin because when the commission were put in place many <Col N="2384" /> people stood up and took notice and by the time the commission's report was published many of them had their house in order.  The report really has done a great deal of good.  Though it has not been discussed in this House it has had a meaningful effect on the workings of the industry in Ireland and abroad.  It is used as a textbook the world over.</P>
    <P>This proposal will, I believe, secure the future of the bloodstock industry.  It is very important for the tens of thousands of people involved in that industry whose jobs have been built up over the years.  As the Killanin Commission point out also, there is an extreme danger if the racing side of the industry does not get what is its right.  If it does it will provide many future further benefits to the wider economy and be of benefit to the man in the street.</P>
    <P>Do not ignore the warning signs.  Sponsorship is drying up.  Race-tracks are in a bad state of repair, as I can say with a great deal of knowledge as a result of my membership of the Racing Board.  The vast majority of trainers are finding it difficult to make ends meet.  Again, just think of the consequences for all the people who work for trainers.  It is very labour intensive.  You cannot get computers to ride horses, and so on, so it is not the fault of trainers that they are having a hard time also; it is the fault of the system.  As I have said, the world over is completely different from Ireland. This is the only country where they do not get a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>Up to now previous Administrations may have been reluctant to take such a step as they feared it would have been seen as pandering to a particular section of the community, whereas in reality it would have substantial employment and quantifiable national benefits.  It would stabilise and guarantee the jobs for thousands of people already involved in the industry.  To me it is as basic as having a line of ESB poles and trying to turn on the light while the connection between the two in the middle is missing.  In other words, we are 95 per cent of the way. Everything is in place.  The stakes are high.  There is an easy solution; just <Col N="2385" /> urgently take the last logical step for the benefit of the nation.  The alternative, that is, putting it on the long finger, is the road to no town.  This is the one industry in which we know we can succeed.</P>
    <P>The industry needs immediately at least 1.5 per cent of the off-course betting levy.  I explained before that I mean 1.5 per cent of 7.5 per cent, which is 20 per cent of the tax.  Regardless of the rate of tax, the industry should get 20 per cent. I believe that 7.5 per cent is an optimum figure.  It could help the betting industry, the racing industry and the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>This, however, will not resolve all our problems.  Much more needs to be done and in this regard.  I invite Members of this House and the other House to join me in the formation of a joint committee to examine other issues in detail and indeed, if necessary, to visit the various facilities throughout the country.  I will be only too pleased to assist in any way in the formation of the committee and I invite Members from both Houses to contact me with a view to bringing this idea to fruition.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Minister and his officials for being here and also Lord Killanin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Farrell) Acting Chairman (Mr. Farrell)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Farrell)</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I compliment Senator Magnier for a very thorough and comprehensive run-down on the bloodstock industry and for his response to the Killanin report.  It is always a great pleasure to hear someone who is an expert in his or her own area speak on that subject.  I learned quite a lot from what he said, although I would disagree with some of his remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general terms, the report we are discussing &mdash; The Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Thoroughbred Horse Breeding Industry &mdash; The Killanin Report &mdash; I would describe as being thoroughly progressive and absolutely necessary at this time for the bloodstock <Col N="2386" /> industry.  I hope to deal with some aspects of the report &mdash; those aspects to which I can respond as a lay person; I know very little about the bloodstock industry.  I know what I learned at Dingle races many years ago and what I have learned since I moved to North County Dublin in the past 15 or 16 years, from watching horses riding out and from visiting stables and establishments in that area.  Certainly, the report, in its recommendations, touches on items which to the lay person in the street are very important.</P>
    <P>The whole area of betting shop licences has interested me all my life.  It concerns me because I am quite likely to have the odd flutter, not too often successfully, but I do invest my money there.  Much of the report is directed towards the basics of the bloodstock industry.  To my mind, the basic person is the person who bets on a horse.  The people who want to place an each-way bet on the 4 o'clock race in Cartmel, or some such place, are the people we need to consider at all times. I know that the writers of the report might perhaps be more interested in directing it purely at the race meetings taking place in this island, but we need to go somewhat beyond that.</P>
    <P>The system &mdash; and our attitude towards betting &mdash; are utterly Victorian and almost moralistic in their approach.  I welcome particularly the recommendation in the report that betting shops should be able to adapt to the changing needs and time zones of race meetings.  For instance, we have satellite racing now being transmitted from halfway across the world; we have evening race meetings and we have Sunday race meetings. These have taken place and have developed more quickly than our legislation. Our legislation does not respond to those changes.  It is inevitable that the changes will take place and take place very quickly.</P>
    <P>I remember on my first trip to England as a teenager going into a betting shop on a Saturday afternoon being surprised at the plush seats and a television up in the corner.  When I came back I questioned somebody as to why it is that in <Col N="2387" /> Ireland bookie shops are usually very badly laid out, poorly decorated, badly in need of a coat of paint and of general improvement.  To be fair, it is very hard for them to offer the same facilities as are available in the UK because of our outdated legislation.  I certainly welcome the recommendation in the report on that aspect.</P>
    <P>I would also like to comment on something that works against the development in the bloodstock industry.  One of the things that stop people from going racing is the high cost.  It is a very costly day out for a person or a couple to go racing, to pay for the reasonable comfort that one would demand at a racing meeting.  The report states that free entry is quite common in many parts of the world. Those courses which have made an effort to attract the general public and the family have been more successful.  I do not believe it has to do solely with the question of prize money or of big fields. Even in the last couple of weeks, we had huge prize money for a race meeting in the Phoenix Park, with a very small attendance.  We had, conversely &mdash; in Dundalk last Sunday, very small fields and a huge crowd.  A lot depends on the way something is sold.</P>
    <P>I want to point to what I think has been a major error, that is, the weighting in favour of flat racing as against national hunt racing.  I am delighted that that matter was addressed in the report. There is much more to it than looking into the need to increase the prize money for the national hunt in order to bring it into line with flat racing.  The normal punter who places perhaps a dozen bets in the year responds to names and in terms of flat racing sees the horses as two-year-olds, or might read something about them at the sales before they are even named.  If they come from a very strong blood line, one might know something about the background of the horse.  We see them as two-year-olds or three-year-olds and the more successful they are, the less likely we are even to see them again.</P>
    <P>That, to my mind, is what is wrong <Col N="2388" /> with flat racing.  Most people cannot remember who won the Derby; and they are far more likely to remember who won the Grand National.  It is not just because of the spectacle of the race, it has to do with horses being around longer. National Hunt animals will be running and racing before the general public for six, seven, eight, nine, ten years, or even longer.  What has happened is that the industry has taken over from the sport. A successful two-year-old becomes an even more successful three-year-old and after that, the odds against running him as a four-year-old are very high because any defeat as a four-year-old would reduce the stud value of that animal.  The sport loses out, for that reason.</P>
    <P>I certainly recall when growing up that we used to have what were called cup races &mdash; long distance flat races for four, five and six-year-old animals.  They always produced great interest.  Those cup races have decreased in popularity over the years because there are even fewer of the well known, successful flat racing animals participating in them. Those that do participate in them become folk heroes.  It is horses such as Arkle, L'Escargot and all the animals that succeed in the national hunt that live in the folk memory.  They are the crowd pullers. I was not at my local race meeting in Bellewstown last week because I was in here, but I heard people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did have a successful wager on a horse from Dingle, Flower from Heaven I believe it was called.  In the middle of what is mainly the flat season, the local people would not have gone to the meeting if they were not national hunt racing and racing over jumps as well.  They would not see it as a spectacle.  The idea of horses running around in a circle is not enough to bring in the ordinary person, although it would bring in the expert.  We need to sell the meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I totally support the recommendations and the commitments in the report to <Col N="2389" /> improve the facilities at race meetings.  I also support the point made by Senator Magnier that many buildings on our racecourses are a threat to life and limb. Unfortunately, it will only be a matter of time before we have a serious accident on one of our major racecourses.  That needs to be looked at.  However, I have a different opinion as to where the money might come from to do that.</P>
    <P>One thing I always welcome in any legislation or discussion in this House is the adaptation of an industry to modern technology.  One of the problems of the report is that it is not vehement and strong enough in some of its recommendations. I single out a recommendation that there should be an all weather track, a major asset which would have an immediate return.  There are many days in winter when racing is totally closed down in the UK and this country. There is a case to be made for an all weather track which can also be pressed into service at short notice as well as having ordinary meetings scheduled. That should be put into operation as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The recommendtion that the Aertel service and the Teletex services from the different companies and television broadcasting outlets should be used effectively should be accepted.  It is high time that was done and if it was put into operation sponsorship would be available because people need to know the racing results and do check them.  Therefore, there is a market there already waiting to be tapped.</P>
    <P>It is important to develop the whole idea of closed circuit television even though it is very costly.  It could be a successful-subsidiary or offshoot of the racing and bloodstock industry as it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I now come to the part &mdash; it is hardly fair to call it modern technology &mdash; which the report and the industry funked and to which I have never got a satisfactory explanation, that is the absolute refusal to use artificial insemination in the racing industry.  I understand how it works, I do not need the <Col N="2390" /> graphic details, but I need to know the thinking behind the lack of commitment to artificial insemination in the bloodstock industry.  It is nothing short of crazy, particularly in the national hunt area where good stallions have to be gelded before they continue racing.  It seems to be a very clear reason for having semen banks for the bloodstock industry which could be used to artificially inseminate at a later date.  I do not understand why it is not done, it is insupportable and we are losing out badly, even in areas beyond racing.  The only argument I have ever heard is a lack of trust, that people would not believe that it came from the right animal.  That is fair enough but is no different from any other buying and selling.  It is a clear case of <i>caveat emptor</i> no matter what the business is.  It seems that if a urine sample can be taken late at night in Tipperary and delivered from there safely to Dublin and be identifiable, artificial semination could be similarily checked and followed.  I regret that it was not a recommendation.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to the discussion on taxation.  I do not agree either with the section and the recommendation dealing with taxation in the report nor with the comments made by Senator Magnier.  The whole taxation of the bloodstock industry is weighted against the small person.  If I wanted to put a £10 bet on an animal I would go to a bookie and pay him £11, a £10 bet and £1 tax.  I would pay that tax whether I won or lost. That is the worst end of the bloodstock industry.  It could be that employees are as badly off and are also paying full PRSI and income tax.  Instead of going to the bookies shop.  I could walk down to Davy's and invest my £10, if they would accept it in classic thoroughbreds and gamble on the same horses, but in a different form.</P>
    <P>Under present legislation, I would not have to pay any tax on the income that I would win on classic thoroughbreds until I exceeded a certain margin, which varies with the Finance Act from year to year. In other words it is easier to gamble on the stock market than it is in the bookies' shop.  I do not understand why that is the <Col N="2391" /> case.  Similarily, if I had enough money to buy a share in a stallion and have an income from that investment it would also be tax free.  I do not accept that that is correct, it is bad for the industry. Senator Magnier is right in saying that the bloodstock industry has been a tax free industry.  The freedom from income tax which is allowed to people who have shares in stallions is insupportable and not the way to support an industry.</P>
    <P>One should not support an industry by allowing the income to be tax free, there are other ways of doing it.  For that reason I cannot support the idea that the Government should now put more money into the industry without getting anything back.  I hope that the Minister supports me on that point because the industry needs an injection of cash.  I would prefer to see it done by some form of levy at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>The proposal to reduce the 10 per cent tax on bets to 7½ per cent and to take 1½ per cent out of that 7½ per cent and give it back is reducing the income to the State by 50 per cent.  The State cannot afford it and I certainly would be one of the people who would cry halt and would want a very good explanation as to why that should be done.  Maybe people are badly off, but there is a huge amount of money in circulation in the bloodstock industry.  Maybe it is not getting to the right place but the money is certainly there.  It has almost become an accepted part of life in gambling on horse racing that one does not pay the full tax due to the Government.  I know it has been said before but two Members of the Oireachtas were on television one night boasting that they did not pay their full betting tax.  To give any kind of substance or support to that activity does not do any good to the industry.  I am not saying that the people behind the racing or that those who wrote this report would support that, quite the opposite.  They say that taxes should be paid but I disagree with the way in which they feel the money should be spent.</P>
    <P>The bloodstock industry touches many parts and aspects of Irish life.  For that <Col N="2392" /> reason it should be a very precious thing and it needs cultivation.  Profits should go back into the industry but I do not believe the only money to go back into the industry should be a clawback from the Government of the tax paid by the small people in the industry.  I do not think that is right.  It is not sustainable.  We need to look very closely at profits.  I do not mean that people should be put to the wall in order to support the industry but where there are genuine profits, we should wield the axe.</P>
    <P>The bloodstock industry is very much part of our leisure activities and for that reason alone deserves to be supported, but it is also a major part of our tourism industry and draws people to this country. Not only does it draw people to this country to watch racing events, but there is also the spin-off from showing televised Irish race meetings abroad.  People do not give this spin-off due recognition.  A well run race meeting, good racing in a nice environment, does wonders for Ireland's general image abroad.  That is one of the reasons we look very seriously at improving facilities at race meetings. It is important when journalists cover an event in Ireland that they do not go home and write about the condition of the toilets, washing facilities, the lack of cover for the stand, or safety rather than the event they came to watch.  These are things we need to look at.</P>
    <P>This industry provides employment for many people.  I met one of my past pupils recently who gave up a job in town to go back to work in stables for half the wages. I give that example to show that a love for the racing industry is in the blood and people are so committed to it that wages are not the main priority.  I regret that many people working in stables are very poorly paid, and will put that in context. I am not saying they are being bled dry by their employers.  I understand trainers and people trying to upgrade the business are not making huge sums out of it either, but I regret that people who are so committed to this industry and who work such long hours are paid such low wages.</P>
    <P>Racing is part of Irish life; it is part of the Irish psyche.  There are very few <Col N="2393" /> people in this country who would say they never watched a horse race or had a bet. It is part of what we are.  Therefore we have a responsibility, which we may not abrograte, to see that this industry is developed.  As legislators, as Members of the Oireachtas, we have a very clear duty to see that it also pays its way.  It is not something that is there simply for the good of racing, it is there for the good of the country at all levels.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report and I go along with more than 90 per cent of the recommendations, but I have difficulties with the area dealing with taxation.  I will not go through the 122 other recommendations in the report.  However, it is excellently presented.  There is a lot of reading in it and I hope the recommendations are taken to heart and considered by Government very shortly with a view to putting them into operation.  I support the proposal by Senator Magnier to have a committee of the House look at the bloodstock industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak on this important issue from the point of view of one who clearly loves a day's racing, as one who had the pleasure of having a stake in two different horses, without success I might add, and as one who likes a bet.  Anything I say on this issue is said with the best interests of the industry at heart.  All of us who have an interest, whether it be a vested interest or otherwise, have a role to play in making this a vibrant industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to individual performers &mdash; for example, what Stephen Roche has done for cycling, what Liam Brady has done for soccer what Barry McGuigan has done for boxing, what Mick O'Connell and Christy Ring have done for their sports.  I always think that anybody, or any animal, who can win the hearts of the people can do great things for their sport.  That is why I have always regarded the exploits and the performances of Arkle as special.  They clearly won the hearts of the Irish people and generated interest in the industry. Roll on another Arkle, or Dawn Run, so <Col N="2394" /> that we may create that same interest in the Irish people once again.</P>
    <P>A lot of this debate centres on finance, what finance is available and ought to be available.  I am not opposed to the view that this State should contribute to racing.  Racing is a native sport, it is part of our way of life.  It does much for our international image.  It is an essential part of the economy and I stress, has been with us from time immemorial.  It is something we all enjoy.  It is capable of creating new jobs and maintaining existing jobs.  It is adding to our exports.  It is good for tourism.  Galway, Listowel and Tralee had been referred to.  For example, the first week of February is carnival week in Clonmel and is centred on the greyhound scene.  We have racing in Galway, Listowel and other areas, all important in their own way and adding to the tourism potential of this country.</P>
    <P>In good times I would have no hesitation in asking the Government for State support.  I do not have to spell out the demands and the cutbacks that are being made unfortunately in areas of health and social welfare and the other Government Departments but at present Government Ministers are pruning their budgets.  I am not sure a contribution from the Exchequer would be the best thing at this point, much as I would love it.</P>
    <P>It is no harm mentioning what has been touched on here and is clearly referred to in the Killanin report, that is, that racing is basically a rich man's sport. Owning and training a horse is not a commercially viable proposition.  We are told in the report that prize winnings only cover one eighth of the training and racing costs and that an average horse may lose up to £6,000 per year.  It is the sport of kings.  To expect funding from a hard pressed Exchequer at this time, I regret, is probably not on.  I wish it were. Knowing the Taoiseach's interest in the sport, maybe I will be proved totally wrong, I hope I am.</P>
    <P>There is another area from which funding can be provided.  This, too, was touched on by Lord Killanin in his report. I refer to the national lottery.  The report clearly indicates that the national lottery <Col N="2395" /> could have a severe impact on betting on horse racing, as obviously this is creating free competition for the betting pound. The report goes on to make the point that in the US from 1974 to 1984, horse racing track revenue increased by 51.6 per cent to $1,948 million, that horse racing tote revenue increased by 135.4 per cent to $408.9 million, but that the lotteries have increased by 1,045 per cent to $4,147.5 million.  If that were to happen in this country it would have very serious repercussions also for betting in the greyhound industry and in other areas of life.  Lotteries are damaging and will continue to damage the betting pound.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong case to be made for lottery funds to improve racing in Ireland.  That could be legitimately entertained. Section 5 (b) of the National Lottery Act of 1986 would not in any way be breached if this were done.  Betting suffers because of the lottery as many of the people who enjoy a flutter on the horses are now contributing largely to the lottery.</P>
    <P>With regard to the lottery itself there could well be, at this time, a change of emphasis, away from the lotto idea, for example.  It could be based, as Lord Killanin mentions on a particular race.  We all know there is the Triers in France which is a lottery based on racing.  Lord Killanin's recommendation 98 says that ideally that could be a handicap of 16 runners minimum.  That would have advantages.  It would have the advantage of creating interest in racing as a result of the national lottery and it could easily be organised.  I propose that An Post be consulted in this regard to see if they can arrange it for the reasons I give and which have been given by Lord Killanin in his report.</P>
    <P>Much of the report centres on the very important area of racecourse development and increased attendances.  Facilities at racecourses are adequate at only a handful of the tracks and improvement depends on the availability of finance. Better facilities are a very necessary part of racing and while services remain inadequate the racing industry has little hope <Col N="2396" /> of attracting new patrons.  The racing industry, as the report indicates clearly, is a weaker branch of the industry and therefore needs this kind of support.  Its financing in this area in recent times has been insufficient to support the various improvements that are necessary on the scale that is necessary.  Again I would agree with recommendation 60 of the Killanin report that the allocation that funds be based on betting turnover generated at the course.  The reasons for this is that they will give increased incentives to individual racecourses to attract more people to the races.</P>
    <P>All of us must help the racecourses to achieve higher attendances, to help them get in the necessary revenue from betting that would enable them to implement that recommendation of the report.  Why not have as Senator O'Toole mentioned, free admission?  Admission charges should be kept to a minimum.  Why not look, for instance, at the charge per car arrangement as is done at point-to-points.</P>
    <P>For the future, the design of new course facilities should be dual or multipurpose to facilitate other leisure activities. Leopardstown and the Phoenix Park are the obvious ones.  Down the country, the Ballinrobe track has a golf course in the middle of it.</P>
    <P>The report refers also to the question of catering.  This is an important aspect from the point of view of attracting people to the tracks.  Prices for snacks at many of the racecourses are a rip-off. What happens is that the racecourses award the catering franchise to a firm and after that they wash their hands of price control.  I recall recently being at a meeting where an old age pensioner who, one hopes, had gained admission free, was buying a container of soup and a roll and paying a rip-off price for it.  That is doing nothing to get the crowds into racecourses.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that I think the industry has a role to play in this area.  Cliff Noone whom I do not know but who wrote last week, and writes regularly in <i>The Irish <Col N="2397" /> Field</i> said that the downward trend continues. He was talking about Roscommon and Saturday 2 July specifically and he said that because that meeting clashed with the Phoenix Park races it damaged the aggregate.  He made the point that 12 months ago at the corresponding meeting &mdash; I was present at that meeting; Roscommon and Kilbeggan are my local meetings and I enjoy them very much &mdash; which was held on a Monday evening, the day's aggregate was £47,000 while this year it was down to £27,634.  I recall that only two of the six races in Roscommon were flat races where obviously the other six races in the Phoenix Park were all flat. What Cliff Noone did not say was that the first race in Roscommon had four runners; that the second race had four runners; that there were two further races of seven runners.  I noticed that in the Phoenix Park on the same day the first race with prize money of nearly £4,000 had three runners; that a race or maybe two had five runners and there was a group two race that had a mere seven runners.  Downpatrick on 1 July had five runners in two of its races and six runners in one of its races.  I seem to recall that Gowran Park sometime back had a walk over in a race of £3,000 value.  Is this the kind of racing to attract the crowds?</P>
    <P>Senator Magnier made the point that sponsorship is drying up.  Do these kind of fields inspire confidence in the area of sponsorship?  I do not think they do because small fields can be disastrous so far as crowds are concerned.  The Racing Board and the governing bodies should examine this entry and declaration problem urgently because we all have a role to play.  That includes the owners and the trainers.</P>
    <P>Another disincentive to attendances in Ireland is the public perception of races. I am not saying we have non-triers in races in Ireland.  The question of no-triers in is referred to specifically in a paragraph in the Killanin report.  There is a widespread complaint that many horses, for whatever reason, are non-triers in Irish racing.  If this is the case, there would be more confidence in the industry if all horses were seen to be running on their <Col N="2398" /> merits.  Many punters tell me that it is their perception &mdash; that is the thing that matters &mdash; that English racing is more controlled.  My local bookies tell me that 90 per cent of all their bets are struck on English racing.  Admittedly there is more English racing, but even on Saturdays when there might be one, two or three meetings in Ireland the majority of betting is struck on English racing.  I do not say this is happening in Ireland but the public perception is there that there are non-triers and this is specifically referred to in the Killanin report.</P>
    <P>The Racing Board are responsible. Their main purpose is the development of racing.  The first recommendation of Lord Killanin's committee is the establishment of a thoroughbred industry board to take over the functions of the existing Racing Board with wider functions of planning for the future of the industry.  That recommendation goes on further to state that they do not envisage the governing bodies, that is the Turf Club and the INHSC, being part of the new statutory body as such.  The Turf Club are a very important body in the Irish racing industry.  They have many functions including looking after stewards, trustees, the Curragh, races, jockeys, betting, the accident fund, the owner register, entries and declarations, licensing, accounts, dope testing, patrolling courses, starting stalls and so on.  The INHSC have the repsonsibility of looking after stewards, flagmen and the clerk of the course.  Therefore, they are very important people in the Irish racing scene.</P>
    <P>The arguments that have been made to exclude the governing bodies from being part of the new body &mdash; and this is one of the disappointments of the report &mdash; ring hollow.  We should remember that the report quite clearly suggests that the governing bodies are archaic and undemocratic.  I do not say that they are archaic or undemocratic but the report says they may in some way carry that tag. I do not say that we should abolish the Turf Club and their sister organisation but what I would say is, and this, as I have said, is one of the disappointments of <Col N="2399" /> the report: why not a full examination mindful of the fact that the functions which these bodies carry out are of vital importance to the industry?  I note that at their final meeting in March 1986 nine members of the committee of 14 were also members of their sister organisation. I hope and expect that is mere coincidence but I feel that self-examination is not the best form of examination and a glorious chance has been lost.  That is a matter for consideration in the future.  It would be better if independent consultants were brought in to examine how the workings of the Turf Club and their sister organisation could be improved for the betterment of racing.</P>
    <P>Senator Magnier in his excellent address earlier today referred to new betting methods.  He referred to a reducation in tax to a rate of 7.5 per cent with 1.5 per cent of the revenue raised going to the industry itself.  That is a new idea and is worthy of consideration.  In my opinion, sooner or later the Tote will compete in the off-course market.  Let me make one observation.  It is absurd that the Tote operates credit betting while not entertaining deposit betting for new customers.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to deal with the question of tax.  Again, in support of looking at new ways of betting, why not a tax on winning bets only as distinct from the present arrangement where tax is payable when a bet is actually struck?  Many punters would prefer this and, indeed, at my request my local bookmaker carried out a survey over a five week period following which he concluded that, even if the betting levy were increased to a rate of 12.5 per cent, it might not affect his turnover if the tax was payable only on winning bets.  I know the results of the survey are not a good yardstick but it does provide food for thought and that is what this report is all about, to get us thinking and talking.  My local bookmaker came to the conclusion that, by taking this option, there would be an increase in revenue to the State of about 14 per cent and if that were to be the case the argument for <Col N="2400" /> ploughing it back into the industry would be all the stronger.</P>
    <P>Let me make another observation that all tax free bets should be outlawed.  It is wrong that the big bookmakers and even some of the smaller ones are allowed to take a bet without tax being paid on it.  I know they pay the tax themselves on it but can that industry carry that kind of loss?  It amounts to unfair practice.  I am not saying that bookmakers should not be allowed to introduce innovative bets, for example, higher limits or place betting on the first five horses home in a race, or other traditional gimmicks which are necessary to attract punters, but if this practice is allowed to continue certainly the big bookmakers in time will wipe out the smaller bookmakers.</P>
    <P>In regard to betting let me make the point which was touched on by Senator Magnier that, with the completion of the internal market in 1992, it is probable that there will be no obstacles to placing bets in other member states, notably the United Kingdom.  If UK rates are more favourable it could spell disaster for the industry in this country.  We should aim to reduce our rates below those of the UK to encourage the placing of bets from the UK here.  That is where I see much merit in Senator Magnier's proposal in regard to a reduction in the rate of tax charged to 7.5 per cent.  If you like, it adds to his case.</P>
    <P>Breeding has already been referred to and the Killanin report states that that section of the industry is in a healthy state at present and I believe it is.  As long as the present tax regime remains, it should stay that way.  Senator Magnier referred to the danger of relocation if there were to be any change in the present tax regime.</P>
    <P>I cannot let this occasion pass without referring to point to points and the contribution they make to the national hunt scene.  Many of our top national hunt jockeys started their careers at point to point meetings throughout the country. In my own area in south County Westmeath there is a hunt which is 100 years old and certainly they are keeping the flag flying in a very competent manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2401" /> In conclusion, I have enjoyed this debate and I have read the Killanin report a few times.  I enjoyed reading that report and I gleaned great knowledge from it.  I congratulate Senator Magnier on initiating this debate and perhaps we will take up his offer in the future.  I also congratulate the Killanin committee, in particular Lord Killanin.  I admire his work in this area and the role he played in the Olympic Games movement.  The report before us provides us with a great insight into the industry.  I hope this debate will lead to optimism in the future. As the Minister has indicated, the Government will soon be discussing this report.  That it will be on the Government's agenda is something positive as is the realisation that something will be done for this industry which provides so much enjoyment for so many people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a declared runner for this debate for some time but unfortunately the rules of the House did not allow me to get away from the starting gates until now.  I understand the rules and procedure of the House but that fact does not diminish my enthusiasm to take part in this debate.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to join with you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, in acknowledging the presence in the House of the esteemed chairman of the commission and author of this report and to say how pleased I was to append my name on behalf of the Labour Party to this motion, with my colleague from County Tipperary, Senator Magnier, which takes note of this very fine report.  Indeed, Senators went into some depth in dealing with this report.  I would also like to put on record the fact &mdash; and I do this in the presence of a Minister from County Tipperary supported by an adviser from County Tipperary &mdash; that this is an indication of where the Golden Vale starts and ends as regards racing and breeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party considered this industry very important and were in Government with another party when this commission of inquiry into the industry was set up.  The employment potential of the industry, was outlined by many of <Col N="2402" /> the speakers today.  We recognise it as a major employment industry, albeit a service industry.</P>
    <P>Although it has occasionally been referred to as the sport of kings &mdash; and my friend Senator Magnier almost fell into the trap of acknowledging the kings and princes still involved like His Highness, The Aga Khan, Prince Abdullah and the Maktoum family &mdash; it is also the sport of many ordinary people, who own horses of all descriptions, from national hunt to thoroughbred runners.  Occasionally they own those horses at considerable cost to themselves because the Irish people love that particular animal.</P>
    <P>The industry gives a lot of employment and a great deal of pleasure.  It is enjoyed by a wide sector of the community, whether we are gainfully employed, unemployed, housewives or anybody else, all of us some way are involved with and have an interest in racing.  We had a submission from the Racehorse Trainers Association who itemised approximately the numbers employed; 2,000 grooms to look after 5,500 horses, assistant trainers, secretaries, horsebox drivers, stablelads, studgrooms and those in indirect employment like printing, garages, petrol stations, chemists, veterinarians, hoteliers, saddlers, farriers, horsebox companies and so on, and we realised that some 18,000 to 20,000 people in Ireland are involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>Certainly we felt that the Labour Party should not only take an interest in the industry and formulate a policy on all its aspects, including breeding, racing and betting, but should also submit a policy to the commission, as was advocated by the last Government who set up the commission. We did that.  It is of particular satisfaction to me that it is acknowledged in the report that the Labour Party were the only political party who made a submission to Lord Killanin and his commission. That says more than I can indicate in this House of the importance that the Labour Party attach to this industry. We were concerned that whoever would sit down to investigate it would have the benefit of the input from a democratic political party who represented and <Col N="2403" /> continue to represent the vast majority of the employees in the industry who also had submissions made on their behalf by the various unions, the Irish Transport Union, the FWUI and the IRMA and the IUDWC.  We also wanted to ensure that we could advise the Cabinet members who were Labour Party members of our views on this industry.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the committee we set up on the thoroughbred industry and which dealt with aspects of taxation and how we felt the industry should benefit from changes in taxation.  Our committee, representing as we did the party, made a submission to Lord Killanin and his commission advocating that the rate of tax on betting should be reduced for a trial period from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.  We were delighted that the then Coalition Government with which our party were involved accepted this and brought in a change in the Finance Act which brought this into being.  This proposal was accepted by Lord Killanin.  We advocated that this reduction would be self-financing, and that it would address the problem of money going out of the country on telephone betting to Britain because the levy on betting here was double that in Britain.  I think it is agreed by anybody who has had an interest in what has happened in the meantime that this step was not alone justified but was of benefit to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In fairness to Senator Magnier, he has suggested what is a slight change to what was suggested by Lord Killanin, that in a self-financing way the current rate of tax on off-course betting be reduced from 10 per cent to 7½ per cent.  If it is self-financing I think this should at least set at ease Senator O'Toole's reservations, because if the current rate of tax on off-course betting was reduced and some of this reduction was in fact transmitted to the industry, then it could only benefit from that process.  This suggestion would have initial implications for the Exchequer but provided it is self-financing I do not think we would have a reservation about it because we used the same argument in our submission to reduce the other levy <Col N="2404" /> on betting which cut it in two and yet the Exchequer benefited.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is addressing the problems of state funding and the preparation of next year's budget with his colleagues, perhaps he would consider a trial period to see if it is self-financing.  It should certainly be considered in that light only, when there are widespread cutbacks in public sector spending which involve all the social areas that the Labour Party are extremely concerned about such as health, social welfare or education.  If the income for current budget spending was interfered with in some way by suggestions like this, then it would create problems and the concern that has been expressed by Senator O'Toole would be justified.  In fairness, Senator Magnier has said it would be self-financing from the Exchequer's point of view.  He also says, and I agree with him, that it will have an immediate visible impact on the industry.  Also in our submission to Lord Killanin, we took what we considered a courageous step and advocated that the income from stallion's fees should continue to be tax-free.  It was not easy for the Labour Party to suggest that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Senator to allow me to intervene for a moment? Regrettably, I have to leave at this point. I had actually entered into committments on the basis that there was a fixed time for the debate, which I now understand is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the other House, we have freedom of speech here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no criticism of the fact.  I was told that the debate would conclude by 2 p.m.  On that basis I made arrangements for discussions.  I regret that I have to leave.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, will be here, and I will hear a full report afterwards on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a point of historical accuracy, while I am on my feet, it is a tribute to Lord Killanin that everyone is claiming paternity for this report.  My historical <Col N="2405" /> recollection has now been verified and it was, I understand a Fianna Fáil Government which set up the commission in 1982.  I know that it reported to my predecessor Deputy Deasy, but it is just a point of fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We will allow the Minister that parting shot and hope he will take on board some of our suggestions in the area of taxation.  I know the Minister expressed the view on many occasions that when changes in Exchequer funding are involved he has a high regard for the finances of the State.  What I am trying to put in context is the validity of the suggestion put forward by Senator Magnier which was made on the basis of being self-financing.  We have used that example when we were in Government and the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, was in Opposition.  In fact, we reduced the tax by 50 per cent and that move proved beneficial to the industry and the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I have been dealing with the recommendations that income from stallion fees should be tax free, as provided in the 1969 Act.  We carried out a lot of research into this and we came to the conclusion that such a provision had advantages for the economy because while it is difficult to move goods, at least until 1992, it is easy to move money, as has been proved in the past.  If breeders are to be taxed on their thoroughbreds it will be a simple matter for them to move their stallions outside the country.  Such a move would lead to a drop in employment in the industry here.  No longer would thoroughbred mares be brought to Ireland to be serviced.  We had no hesitation in advocating that that sector of the industry should be tax free.  We are aware of the loopholes in the tax code which result in shares in the ownership of stallions standing in other countries being tax free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister permits abuse of that provision the whole concept of the concession will be defeated.  We are in favour of the owners of stallions maintained here getting a tax concession because there <Col N="2406" /> are tremendous benefits for our economy. The Labour Party, at an annual conference, accepted the benefits of the 1969 provision and that says something for our interest in and commitment to this industry.  It is wrong to say that the industry is tax free.  We are all aware that profits from all other activities in that industry are subject to tax.  It is important to remember that employment in that industry is not State assisted.  We have always advocated that profits should be subject to tax but we made an exception in this case.  It was pleasing to note that Lord Killanin accepted our recommendation in regard to that provision.</P>
    <P>Senator Magnier dealt with off-course betting from which the State benefits to the tune of £20 million annually.  The suggestions put forward by Senator Magnier would result in the Governing losing approximately £8 million, if they did not prove self-financing.  In his view the only beneficiaries would be the industry and the punter.  It is popular to suggest that the Government should reduce taxation but I am sure that punters, who always complain about having to pay tax on bets, realise that if the industry is not allowed to prosper there will not be any racing to bet on.  Likewise, those involved in breeding, training and racing realise that without the punter the industry would collapse overnight.  Those who invest in thoroughbreds accept that they will get little return on their investment.  The State invest very little in that industry.  In my view the State should consider our suggestion so that we can compete with the industry in Britain where attendances at race meetings are higher than in Ireland.  In my view attendances here are dropping because of inadequate facilities and high admission charges.  It should be possible for people in our big towns to bet on the Tote.  Profits from the Tote go to the Racing Board who play a useful role in the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>We suggest that the Racing Board should be an independent body and not, as Lord Killanin has suggested, amalgamated with all those involved in the industry.  Some sectors of the industry are not compatible and it would not be good <Col N="2407" /> for the industry if they were amalgamated. Senator Fallon referred to membership of the Turf Club which, as everybody knows, is an exclusive club.  It has been part of the racing scene since the foundation of the State and existing members can nominate new members to the club.  I am sure Senator Magnier is in a position to explain the procedure better, but most people are aware that it is difficult to become a member of the Turf Club.</P>
    <P>The legislation establishing the Racing Board stipulates that of the 11 members representing the State on that board six must be from the Turf Club.  I do not have any objection to that if those involved have a knowledge of racing and a commitment to the development of the industry and are not simply appointed on their membership of the Turf Club.  Lord Killanin has suggested that five members should be appointed to the board he has recommended from the membership of the Turf Club.  In my view the Minister should appoint the members of the Turf Club to the Racing Board and it should not be left to the Turf Club to decide.  I accept that the Turf Club includes people who are expert in horse breeding but they should be appointed by the Minister.  I do not think the Turf Club should have the majority of members on any board appointed by the State.</P>
    <P>The Racing Board own, or have a major shareholding in three of our most important racecourses, Leopardstown, Navan and Tipperary where a very high standard is maintained.  The Racing Board give grants to racecourses and recently paid £300,000 to Fairyhouse. Supporters of National Hunt racing agree that Fairyhouse which has a long tradition with the Irish Grand National, is an important racecourse.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister when replying, might say what are the proposed plans for the spending of £300,000 of taxpayers' money through the racing board on a racecourse like Fairyhouse.  The taxpayers are entitled to know.  Likewise, <Col N="2408" /> we give a grant of £300,000 to the Turf Club.  Perhaps they would tell us on what they spend this money.  I have never seen any of their accounts published.  If public funding is being allocated to an organisation, it is appropriate that we should know what the money is being spent on. Perhaps there are very simple answers to all these questions.  I am trying to strike a balance between what the taxpayer considers is his obligation to the industry and what happens to his contribution. The Turf Club deal with entries, overnight declarations, arrangements about jockeys and other such matters.  It sounds a very simple process.  Perhaps they might even have a very worthy credit balance at the moment.  If we saw their accounts, perhaps it would be of benefit to all of us in the House.</P>
    <P>In Lord Killanin's report he recommends the establishment of a thoroughbred industry board, about which the Minister has expressed some reservations, as indeed I have.  He also suggests that the National Stud, the Totalisator, the Racing Apprentice Centre for Education, the Irish Equine Centre, a racecourse management company and other companies would be subsidiaries of the board.  Many of these probably would have compatible interests.  The Totalisator, the State run betting organisations which is a subsidiary of the Racing Board, could be revamped in a way which has not been done in the past.  As I suggested, maybe outlets could be opened throughout the country to ensure that the State has a further take from betting at that level. That money could, of course, be transmitted back into the industry as Senator Magnier has said.</P>
    <P>One of the other bodies mentioned in the report as being brought under this umbrella organisation is the Racing Apprenticeship Centre of Education, which is an extremely important service to young apprentices.  One of the best jockeys in Ireland at the moment, Christy Roche, who comes from my native village of Bansha; came through that procedure and I consider him worthy of mention among the greats in sports.  He has <Col N="2409" /> brought much pleasure to many people who knew him.  They are proud that he came from a small village in the heart of County Tipperary.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring it to the Minister's attention that in this year alone AnCO, through FÁS, have reduced all grants to this sector of the industry.  It is important that we recognise that this training sector is doing a useful job.  It should be supported by the Government through the Youth Employment Agency funding. The Irish National Stud supported it by making a six acre site available to it but it is still in need of urgent funding.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation of the commission of inquiry is that there be a change in the financing of the Irish National Stud.  I want to pay the highest compliment possible to this State run stud both for the service they have given to small breeders and for the fact that, despite legislative restrictions, they have been able to borrow to meet their requirements.  Under the 1976 Act their borrowings were limited to £500,000.  In the 12 years since then no account whatsoever has been taken by the Government of the change in money values.  I was pleased to hear the Minister today say that he is in favour of the recommendation to update this figure.  I am also pleased to acknowledge that the Taoiseach has put it in writing that he is personally in favour of increasing the borrowing capability of the National Stud.  Certainly, as it has no consequential cost factor on the Exchequer, it should be supported.  I hope sincerely that the necessary amending legislation will be brought before this House as quickly as possible to ensure that, as no additional public funding is involved, we should at least facilitate the industry, through the National Stud, to be able to avail of borrowings from banks, based on expertise and on record.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate, when speaking about records, to put on record some of the performances of the members of the National Stud in the past.  I would like to pay tribute to a previous chairman, Larry Ryan of Cratloe, who brought much expertise, ingenuity and common sense <Col N="2410" /> to the industry.  When he purchased the sire, Ahonoora, for £250,000 he actually brought to the State a horse which has since proved to be worth £7 million.  That has been of tremendous benefit to the State.  I am delighted that that horse is still standing in this country.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record my appreciation of people like Senator Magnier, Vincent O'Brien and the owners of all the other stud farms in the County Tipperary area such as Ballykisteen, Longfield, Lismacue, Rathduff, and so on.  I could go on listing them.  All of them have made a tremendous impact on employment in the county.  They employ more people than some of the multinationals and are a great asset in the area.  When discussing this motion in the name of Senator Magnier it is appropriate to record the appreciation of everybody within the county for what those people are doing for the bloodstock industry.</P>
    <P>I am delighted, as I have said, that the National Stud were able to realise the kind of money I have mentioned from a stallion which they brought for relatively little.  It is important that the nation be involved in acquiring stallions which could be used for the benefit of smaller breeders.  With their success on the racecourse they could benefit the State in no uncertain terms as that horse has done.  I hope the Committee of Public Accounts will recognise that fact when they meet representatives from the National Stud tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Lord Killanin's report recommends that the National Stud be involved with other people in the purchase of stallions. I know it might be a complicated leasing process but at least the State would be still involved.  Because of the legislative restrictions on their borrowing they have used another system, involving people with an interest in horses, to acquire such stallions as Magical Wonder and the classic winner, Clash of Steel.  That is an indication of the commitment of the National Stud, in spite of the restrictions placed on them.</P>
    <P>The report deals with other matters such as Sunday racing, a concept which has been a tremendous success.  Let us <Col N="2411" /> hope that the new licensing laws which have been passed and which are relevant to race meetings on Sundays in particular courses are subject to ministerial amendment. The Labour Party believe that if the industry is addressed in a constructive way it will have tremendous employment potential and give job satisfaction to those involved.  Many of the people employed in the industry are involved in it because of the enjoyment many people get from going to racecourses and having a flutter on a horse.</P>
    <P>In addressing the recommendations of this report, I believe we have a duty to respond, where necessary, to it by way of Government legislation.  We should also recognise that the industry has addressed some of the needs in this area. Hopefully some of the criticisms that have been made here about the facilities at racecourses and the exploitation of the people who attend racecourses will be addressed by the governing bodies.  I hope that the Turf Club do not take my criticism too severely because Members of this House are criticised on a daily basis.  If the criticism is constructive perhaps they will become more democratic, open and frank with people so that there will be a better regard and more support for the contribution they obviously make to the industry in conjunction with the State agencies.  I hope FÁS will address the question of the apprenticeship education group and that the other groups who need assistance by way of additional employment incentives will get it.</P>
    <P>This is a service industry.  Anybody who says that the process of artificial insemination is not used in the bloodstock industry shows a lack of knowledge of the industry.  Artificial insemination used on a widespread basis, as it is for cattle breeding, would eliminate the whole concept of quality and the demand for extra special horses.  At times artificial insemination can be used by veterinary inspectors.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion when we discussed the rationalisation of the Veterinary Surgeons Act with regard to the change in Community Regulations, I paid tribute <Col N="2412" /> to Dr. Brendan Farrelly, an Irish veterinarian, who has gained recognition in the field of equine diseases to such an extent that he is regarded as a world authority on equine diseases.  I am delighted that in relation to the identification of disease, in particular those that are transmitted by the female of the equine species, all the studs I know have set up laboratory facilities to ensure that a process of isolation takes place due to the tremendous movement of international bloodstock from Australia, Japan, New Zealand and other countries to this country.</P>
    <P>Because of the quality of the stallions standing here I believe that if we did not operate a control system over the transmission of some of these damaging diseases the industry would have been decimated by now.  The industry has shown a willingness to address this problem. It is an international industry and people recognised that it had international risks because of the movement of animals, I am happy that the Department of Agriculture and Food and the veterinary research laboratory in particular as a result of the work of Dr. Farrelly, made facilities available so that people could identify whether visiting mares had contagious diseases which could decimate the bloodstock industry and cause major losses.</P>
    <P>In spite of what is perceived by the ordinary punter and the ordinary man in the street this industry does not make money.  This is an industry in which major capital risks are involved.  The infrastructure is such that the people involved cannot evade tax and they are not tax assisted by way of grant.  The actual capital investment involved is very considerable and if it were not for the dedication of some people in this country and some international people who have chosen Ireland as a suitable place in which to stand their stallions and have mares visit here the industry would be very poor.  Instead of that we have achieved an international reputation, of which I think all of us are proud.</P>
    <P>I want to commend Lord Killanin and his group on this report.  On behalf of <Col N="2413" /> The Labour Party I have expressed our reservations on it.  I commend Senator Magnier for having brought the report to the floor of the House so that at least one House of the Oireachtas could address this very important economic development that takes place within our shores.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because the contents of the report have already been dealt with in great detail by other speakers and I do not wish to prolong the debate by repeating what has already been said.  However, it is very important that the House should discuss the Killanin report and consider the many recommendations made by the committee for the betterment of the bloodstock industry. Some of the recommendations made by the committee have already been put into effect and I hope that as far as possible the Government will implement the other recommendations as soon as they can.</P>
      <P>The thoroughbred industry is, as Senator Magnier rightly stated, one of Ireland's greatest assets.  Irish horses are recognised world wide as being the best and are eagerly sought after by breeders and trainers throughout the world.  The sale of bloodstock abroad and the employment generated by the industry at home made a tremendous contribution to our balance of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association, the representative body for the breeding industry in Ireland.  Their main aim is to promote and protect the interests of the breeders and owners of thoroughbred stock.  I had the pleasure of working very closely with them during my term in the Department of Agriculture and I saw at first hand the commitment of men like Captain Seán Berry, Secretary of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association, Sir Ian Harris who was chairman at that time and his successor, Mr. Stan Cosgrave.  Those people and many others are slogging away to ensure that the thoroughbred industry is protected and expanded.  With a little support the industry will continue to play a major role in international bloodstock markets and the <Col N="2414" /> domestic bloodstock industry at home can play an increasingly important role in our economy.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to thank Lord Killanin and the other members of the commission for this very important report, for their in-depth investigation into the problems of the industry and for the many recommendations they made to improve the industry.  I am satisfied that this debate will highlight some of those problems and I hope that there will be a resolution of them in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too want to add my voice in welcoming the Killanin report into the thoroughbred horse breeding industry. Like Senator Hussey, I do not want to go over much of the ground that has already been covered.  I believe the report has got a significant airing as it is.  Nevertheless there are a few important points that need to be emphasised in the context of the discussion on this report in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>As has already been pointed out by Senator Magnier, racing is a business today.  It was probably regarded as a sport or as a hobby in the past, but now it is a big business.  Without wishing to sound facetious I have no doubt that even the sale of newspapers would go down by about 50 per cent were it not for racing. Many people get up in the morning with the intention of buying the newspaper to seeing where they can back a few winners for the day, whether it is in Ireland or across the channel.  That is an important feature of everyday life in this country and is an important part of the day's work for many people who have nothing better to do.  We must acknowledge that there are, unfortunately, a growing number of those people in Ireland today.  In addition it gives enjoyment to a large number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am heartened by the statistics on page 201 of the report which show that out of a population of 3.2 million people, 1.1 million recorded attendance days are shown for Ireland.  Compare that with Great Britain &mdash; our nearest neighbour &mdash; where out of a population of 56 million <Col N="2415" /> people there are 3.8 million attendance days recorded.  That gives some indication of this important feature of Irish life, which is a traditional part of Irish life &mdash; the racing industry.  Various speakers have acknowledged the enormous contribution the industry are making to employment both part time and full time. Many parishes have ideal conditions for racing and agri-related activity and they would feel the pinch were it not for the enormous contributions of the O'Brien stable, Dreaper and Mullins.  If those people were not involved to the extent they are involved in the horse racing industry, many thousands of people who derive their livelihood in a local rural community would find great difficulty in finding similar employment or in finding employment at all.  We know the consequences for rural parishes in particular in that the emigrant boat or the spectre of unemployment would loom greater for them.</P>
    <P>The great spectacle of racing gives everybody a thrill.  In fact, the spectacle of the Budweiser Irish Derby, the Irish Grand National or the English Grand National has a significant interest for us all because of the impact Irish horses make abroad at meetings like Cheltenham. Horse racing captures the imagination of the Irish psyche to such an extent that I do not think we could live without it.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food has an onerous responsibility to meet the challenge of the racing industry in the future.  We must admit that the racing industry today is not in good shape.  It is not in good financial health and the standards are not good.  A large amount of finance is required for capital investment to modernise the facilities and to keep attendances up in order to compete with other sporting organisations and other sports that have become modernised very quickly and are competing in the diminishing marketplace of the sporting attendance and the sporting public.  We have to put it in context with other sports such as rugby, GAA games or tennis.  Because of the vast sums of money invested in sports <Col N="2416" /> over the years, they will have a great attraction for the younger generation who will be looking to leisure activities for their free time.  The older age groups in our society have grown up with a traditional love of the Irish racing industry and a traditional love of going to a race meeting.  That trend can change quickly if we are not careful and if we do not plan ahead to meet the challenges of that extra competition.</P>
    <P>A character who frequented race meetings in the past was the single young person with a good job and who was a big spender in the leisure activity he or she enjoyed.  Unfortunately, those people are now emigrating.  All too often we rely on redundancy payments from factories that go into liquidation as the main source of big spending sprees that are so essential to keep many race tracks open.  That is a short term expedient and something that will not last.</P>
    <P>Senator Magnier has drawn attention to the drying up of the sponsorship money that will become available in the future. He sounded a warning about that source of revenue to keep the many race tracks in operation.  It is not good enough that the State which derives significant finance and employment opportunities from the industry should rely totally on the private sector and on the goodwill and expertise of people in the Racing Board or the Turf Club to bring sponsorship to this country to the significant extent we have seen in the past.  I pay tribute to the efforts of the Racing Board to attract a significant amount of sponsorship in the past couple of years and I hope it will continue.  We must heed the warning that the pool of sponsorship is diminishing.  The State will have to plan ahead to upgrade the facilities and standards and modernise the industry so that the attractiveness of sponsorship will be maintained for people who want a return on the investment and a return on their sponsorship.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there are too many race meetings at present.  Senator Fallon developed that point and showed graphically the problems that can arise and the bad name that racing as a sport can get from having small fields and too <Col N="2417" /> many racing days.  It is notable that, if you go to race meetings frequently, you will see the same faces.  There is only a certain amount of disposable income in the country now and it is even less now than it was a few years ago.  That disposable income is becoming less and less with the impact of the national lottery and the effort to maintain the standards of living to which people have become accustomed.  If we do not have rationalisation of race days and if we are not positive about making our tracks more attractive to keep attendances up, other sports will benefit and other attractions will become the norm and racing, unfortunately, as an industry and as a leisure activity will suffer.</P>
    <P>I want to support the 2 per cent levy on off-course betting or the 20 per cent of turnover suggested by Senator Magnier and in the report.  I think Senator Magnier mentioned a figure of 1.5 per cent of 7.5 per cent of the off-course levy.  The report mentions 2 per cent and a 10 per cent levy.  Whatever figure is arrived at a significant case can be made for some proportion of the off-course betting to be levied and given to the racing industry to meet the challenges to which I have referred.  There are no better people than those involved in the racing industry to channel that money into projects that will get the required investment return essential for the benefit of the Irish economy. Leopardstown is a perfect example of that.  I hope that other courses will see the need to modernise and the need for extra resources to be made available, whether by means of the national lottery or through the financial incentives as outlined by Senator Magnier.  Those courses should upgrade their standards and modernise to the extent that is so essential.</P>
    <P>I question the value of some of the sponsorship we get in this country.  I question the value of some of the races and stake money because we have classics which perhaps might be over-rated even though they are of tremendous benefit to the people involved.  There are classic runners that are trained for one race from the time they are born.  Their owners derive an income from the stud fees they <Col N="2418" /> generate afterwards.  Taking the racing industry in its widest context, the high level of finance we get from some companies for sponsorship could be spread more evenly in order to cater more widely for the range of racing owners and trainers who have put in a tremendous amount of money in their own way to keep their interest in the racing industry.</P>
    <P>The contribution of bookmakers could be more significant in the development of racecourses and facilities.  I would like to question the Minister as to what contribution bookmakers made to racing at the moment.  My information is that it is not significant; in fact, it is only nominal. That could be looked at in the context of generating extra finance.</P>
    <P>Communications have been referred to in the report.  The need for modernisation and improving our standards was never so important as now in the context of the improvement in satellite communications throughout the world.  The day is fast approaching when TV cameras from Australia will be beaming on to Irish racecourses and betting taking place on Ireland and Australia races and <i>vice versa.</i>  That day may not be very far away and the impact TV can have, in no matter what country, is an important selling point for the country at large.  The first impressions a person from outside a country receives of that country are important and the importance of the racing industry as a catalyst for tourism promotion and a contributor to the development of the economy cannot be overestimated in this context.</P>
    <P>Sunday racing has become a novel feature which has caught the imagination of and is being supported by the general public, but I hope it will not be over-emphasised as an essential solution to the financial problems of many of our racing boards at the moment.  Sunday is a day much revered by the ordinary people.  In my opinion we have opportunities enough with the present number of race days without over-relying on Sunday racing.  We must recognise that we are living in a society which has a gambling instinct and if racing were arranged for seven days a week you would find the <Col N="2419" /> same people ending up at the race meetings every day.  I fear that by developing too many race days and including Sunday, normally a traditional family day, we could over-kill in this regard to the detriment of many families.</P>
    <P>Another area we could examine in the context of our racing industry is the inconsistency of stewards' inquiries.  In my opinion, stewards are too old.  With all due respect to their involvement in the industry, we should set an age limit on the stewards involved at race meetings, and they should be properly trained in order to provide more consistent decisions.  In addition, the advent of computerisation to tote facilities is an important step forward.  All too often I see people with permanent employment getting part time employment on Saturday or Sunday on the tote &mdash; the computerised tote as it is now.</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity here for racing concerns and the Racing Board to insist that young people coming out of school with no hope of employment, who are well trained in secretarial courses and computerisation, should have this opportunity to gain some experience and get some financial help at a stage in their careers when they are vulnerable.  At local level at the racecourses the Racing Board and the Turf Club could give a lead here in encouraging young people into that employment rather than giving it to people who are mostly civil servants &mdash; with all due respect to the civil servants present.  If we want to get young people more involved in the racing industry and ensure the continuation of that industry, they should be brought more into racing under local administration and governing level.  We have perfect examples of that.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to see the report did not go in depth into the administration of the racing industry to the extent of discussing, examining and assessing the Turf Club and the Racing Board and whether there is a need for both.  We have in the racing industry an opportunity to amalgamate many of the functions of the Turf Club and the Racing Board at the moment.  Perhaps loyalty is coming <Col N="2420" /> before interest in relation to the racing industry in which there is an opinion abroad, rightly or wrongly, that the Turf Club is a very exclusive club and the ordinary person involved in the racing industry would find it very difficult to become involved in that very elite organisation. The ordinary people involved in the racing industry would articulate that opinion.  From a public relations point of view alone, the racing industry should analyse to see how it can achieve greater involvement at local level in the operation, administration and governing of the racing industry.  All too often, wrongly in my opinion, the common perception is that the hard hat is a symbol of power on racecourses.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to thank Lord Killanin and his committee for a very detailed and extensive report.  There is an opportunity in this debate here today to appeal to the Government and highlight the fact that the racing industry is in a bad financial situation.  Many racecourses are in the red and rationalisation is needed, as can be brought home by the fact that in Kerry we have three racecourses and I do not think we have a trainer.  We might have two permits in the whole county of Kerry. In the huge county of Cork, probably the greatest county in Ireland from the point of view of breeding and training horses, the facilities are very poor, with only one racecourse.  That is an example of the industry being at a crossroads.  Now we have to appeal to the Government to provide some source of financial aid to ensure that this important industry continues with the contribution it has made to Irish life, the Irish economy and the Irish psyche.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage of the day I will make just a few brief comments because time is getting on.  First, I welcome Lord Killanin to the House.  It is good to know that among all these Tipperary men Senator Ferris was referring to at least one man from the west who knows something about horses is here. I congratulate the commission members because I understand that in the preparation of this report they accepted no <Col N="2421" /> expenses during the time.  That is to their credit.  As Senator Magnier said, the report has become a textbook for the industry and is used abroad as well as here.  I agree it has implications for a large section of the population, indeed, for everybody including the housewife; not, as Senator Ferris said, from everybody down to the housewife, rather downwards from the housewife to everybody.</P>
      <P>The bloodstock industry is in what I call the traded sector, that is the sector of economic activity which is exposed to international competition or involves the provision of goods and services to international markets.  The bloodstock industry on an international level gives rise to high added value exports in terms of sales of animals and sales of nominations. Consequently, the industry contributes in no small measure to a healthy balance of payments.  These days we are hearing continually about the importance of increasing our exports in order to generate long-term economic growth.  The bloodstock industry with its breeding, trading, racing and studs, is an industry we should encourage by every possible means, and this brings me to the nub of the matter.</P>
      <P>I cannot imagine that breeding, training etc. could possibly survive or thrive without a viable racing industry.  I welcome any incentives offered for racing. I know the Minister cannot make any promises today but I am sure he will take back our views to the appropriate quarter.  I welcome Senator Magnier's proposals on taxation and his ideas on reinvesting in racing.  The lower tax rates would leave the punter with more money to wager and I believe that he or she is likely to do this.  The total betting turnover would increase and the Exchequer would ultimately benefit from this increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to one other point which is important.  On page 202 of the report mention is made of the various prize moneys.  The average prize for a flat race is £5,756 and for a national hunt race is £2,317.  That is a ratio of about 6 to 2, <Col N="2422" /> which is a rather unfair allocation.  Probably about 60 per cent of the prize money goes to flat racing, excluding classics and about 40 per cent to the national hunt.  If we examine the revenue generated by betting we will probably find reverse proportions. If we look at the figures for France, West Germany, or the US there is a much fairer distribution between the two types.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the small man who keeps a couple of foals.  It is becoming ever more difficult to get a very good horse for flat racing but for a relatively small investment, he can still have a good hunter.  We need some scheme to rejuvenate national hunt racing and one way in which this could be done is by increasing the prize money.  Another suggestion at which the Minister could look is that when betting shops apply for a licence a levy of £500 per year per shop could be applied.  There are over 2,000 shops in the country &mdash; perhaps a few more if all were told &mdash; but at £500 each, that makes a total of £1 million.  That is a simple and effective financing method.  I would like to see those funds allocated back to national hunt racing.  It would do a great deal of good.</P>
    <P>The Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee have done a tremendous job down through the years.  However, as one or two Senators have mentioned already, they are self-perpetuating in that they elect themselves. They are funded by the owners, but I am not sure the owners get to see the accounts.  I am not suggesting that anything untoward ever happens, but as we draw nearer to 1992 and with the Fourth Directive of the European Community imposing upon corporations, indeed, private companies, the obligation of disclosure of funds, it would be no harm if we could get a peek at them.  It might help to open it up just a little.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to thank Senator Magnier for bringing this report before the House.  It is thanks to men like him, Vincent O'Brien and John Mulhern, to mention but a few, that the industry is thriving.  I welcome Senator Magnier's <Col N="2423" /> suggestion of a joint Oireachtas committee to look into any further details.  In general, I welcome the report.  It is a good report and one which commends itself to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I shall be very brief, not just in order to facilitate the House but because I have a very limited knowledge of the subject on which I am speaking, which is not without precedent in this House.  While welcoming this report, which is a very comprehensive and useful one, I would like to express one or two reservations about the way in which it is being treated in this House and about the report itself.</P>
      <P>First, as a non-racing person, I would like to express a certain amount of puzzlement about the image of the industry. While this industry is obviously of great importance to our economy and even more important to tourism and employment, it has a very strange and very distinctive image and one which could mean that the population as a whole would be reluctant to see it subsidised to a large extent.  I welcome what Senator Ferris said &mdash; and if it is good enough for Senator Ferris and the Labour Party it is good enough for me &mdash; in welcome of stallion fees being exempted from tax.  If he believes that this makes good economic sense, then they should be exempted.  If giving incentives like this would lead to increased employment and an increase in the wealth of the economy, further incentives should be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say something in general about the industry.  I do not think people feel that they can identify with the industry. This is an industry which is glamorous in a sense, but it is very important to consider the benefits from it.  It is important to remember that in this large industry there are the punters, the owners, the trainers, the breeders, but the beneficiaries are very few.  As Senator Hogan said, it is an industry with which the ordinary punter does not identify.  Nowhere was that more underlined than in the case in England of Lester Piggott, where the punters' great hero has ended up in jail <Col N="2424" />&mdash; the man who has done more for British racing than anybody else.</P>
    <P>It is generally believed &mdash; and I do not want to be sensational here &mdash; that the industry is not completely straight.  We all know that horses have been pulled back and that strange things have gone on in this industry, but one person appears to have taken the rap for it all.  It is important to underline that that sort of incident does the industry no good.  It does not make the punter identify with it.  That should be taken into account by the Minister and the Government when considering the recommendations of the report and also the reason for the industry as a whole being given the preferential treatment that it is at present receiving. I do not join quite so enthusiastically with the welcome given to the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>Senator Magnier recommended that we set up a joint Oireachtas committee on this issue.  It would quite simply act as a bar on the recommendations or the postponement while a committee considered and reported on them in so many years' time.  We have a real problem in this House and in the other House about reports of this sort.  I could not help noticing that this commission was set up in 1982.  They reported four years later, in July 1986, having done an enormous amount of work and we are only now debating the report in this House &mdash; two years later.  The problem obviously was recognised six years ago.</P>
    <P>I would just like to go through a couple of things the Minister said in his speech. It is indicative of how difficult it is for people like Lord Killanin and those who have written this report actually to get anything done.  Whereas some of the minor recommendations of the report have already been implemented, the major ones are still hanging in the air and have not been acted upon.  I was disappointed to read in the Minister's speech his response to the recommendations of this commission.  I have no axe to grind, not being qualified to judge the merits of these recommendations.  I accept them because they are written by <Col N="2425" /> people who were involved in the industry and who are experts.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech states that the main recommendation of the report is the setting up of a thoroughbred industry board to replace the Racing Board.  It would have responsibility for: (a) planning, financing and developing racing and the development of an ongoing strategy for breeding; (b) it would have power to establish subsidiaries and be given responsibility for the National Stud, the tote, a new racecourse management company, the Equine Centre, the racing apprenticeship centre for education and (c) be financed by on- and off-course betting.  That makes a lot of sense.  It is the principal recommendation of this report which took four years, which the Government have had two years to consider and which we are now just considering in this House apparently for the first time.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say that all in all he did not favour the adoption of the concept of a single thoroughbred industry board.  What is the value of a report like this if the Fianna Fáil Government which set it up will consider and then just dismiss something which they will not implement?  They should take these things more seriously.  The Minister said the report recommends that the National Stud should set charges at rates prevailing in its area and have its borrowing limit increased to £5 million but he dismissed several recommendations of that sort. The only recommendation he accepts is so minor it is laughable.  He said he is in favour of the recommendation that the suffix IRL be used to identify Irish horses and he is happy that bodies with responsiblility in this area are endeavouring to have this recommendation implemented. He rejects the other recommendations or gives the worst possible response to a report like this.  He says that these recommendations require further detailed examination, particularly with regard to the legal considerations.</P>
    <P>These recommendations have already had six years of detailed examination and that is why I reject Senator Magnier's obviously bona fide suggestions that an <Col N="2426" /> all-party committee should consider matters which have already been considered for six years and which will then go back to the Government for consideration.  It would have the effect not of having the recommendations in this report implemented but exactly the opposite.  It would have the effect of delaying them. The Minister should not hide behind the fact that there are complex and legal difficulties because the Government have legal people and draftsman to advise them.</P>
    <P>While I thoroughly welcome this report &mdash; what I have read of it is very good, effective and diligent &mdash; the Government's response is very disappointing.  It is really not good enough to have a two or three hour debate today and then dismiss the matter and say these things need further consideration.  What we should see if these debates are to have any meaning is certainly an opening speech by Senator Magnier, who is an expert on this, and several speeches from anybody else, but also a well prepared case by the Government in response to this report or reports of this sort.  That is exactly what we have not got.  What we have got is a mealymouthed, weak, milk and water response from the Minister saying these have to receive further consideration.  I am very disappointed in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMagnier" hpid="Mr. Magnier Mr. Magnier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magnier</NameTxt>
      <P>An interesting thing happened to me last Sunday.  I was at a lunch and there was a debate as to whether this House should be abolished so I declared I was coming up here to move that the Seanad note the report of the Killanin Commission.  Generally the people were very embarrassed at having suggested such a thing when they found out what I was going to do.  When the third speaker got up here today, declared that he knew nothing about the industry and went on to say that he expected somebody to inquire into it, it behoves me to answer him.  He is a prominent Member of the House and has plenty to contribute in other areas on matters he knows about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will go through what he said and the House should learn from what happened <Col N="2427" /> here today.  What is the point of a member standing up in front of a senior Minister who is in a rush to get out of the place, who could not listen to the last number of speakers, after he declared he did not know what he was talking about? His remarks should be ruled out of order as they were total rubbish.  He went on to say that people should be let in to racecourses free.  This proves he does not know what he is talking about because the only source of revenue for race tracks is what people pay going through the gate.  He also spoke about building an all-weather track.  Who will build the track and why will they build it?  To let all the people in free?  That kind of thing is not representative of what goes on in this House and the Minister should not heed him.</P>
    <P>The Senator said there would be no more money for this industry, that we were clawing back the small people's money.  Maybe I did not explain it properly. Going from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent is not a hand-out; it is really an investment and for the benefit of the Exchequer, the betting industry and, of course, the bloodstock industry but, more importantly, for the wider economy as a whole and all the other sectors that are integrated in the racing industry.</P>
    <P>He then said that there was a lot of money circulating in the horse business. It is a pity he did not go to Bellewstown or his local meeting because he would find out that he was mistaken.  He made one point of some merit, that he preferred to look at the national hunt racing as opposed to flat racing.  I am an industry man and I share that Irish trait.  Most people feel that way but the reality is that tens of thousands of people involved in the bloodstock industry, and whom we are supposed to represent, are dependent on the export industry and dealing with the world at large.  It is very important for us to have a flat racing industry.  When people come from abroad to see our racing many of them will demand flat racing because they are not into national hunt racing.  However, we might be able to educate people in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2428" /> He made another point that the trainers in this country are paying their people very badly.  The ordinary trainer who takes his horse down, say, to Limerick city and wins £900 on a race will pay £200 costs in running that horse.  The jockey gets 10 per cent if he wins, that is £90, the trainer will get another 10 per cent.  By the time he has filled his car with petrol and given a drink to the winning owner &mdash; which is the custom &mdash; he is out of pocket.  From the remaining £500, unless you work a loaves and fishes-type miracle, you could not look after everybody out of that amount.  The structure of this industry is wrong and unless it is changed at Government level, it can never be put right.  All the little things can be put right by people in the industry.</P>
    <P>Another speaker rightly mentioned that it costs about £6,000 a year to keep an animal in training and that anybody who had anything to do with racing is employed in that area.  We also have an image problem which Senator Ross mentioned. I am not concerned with the person who is paying £6,000 for the pleasure of making a fool of himself; I am concerned about the tens of thousands of people involved in the industry.  Who represents them in this House?  They have a voice as well and it is very important for them that we have a strong bloodstock industry.  The main thing the whole debate has been about really is money. Unless the racing industry gets what they get in other countries, no more or no less, we will not be able to compete. The industry is very important for this country; it is a very big part of our GNP. The ball is in our court.  The people, the raw material, the horses, the land, the foreign investment, and most important, the people in the industry are here.  It is up to the Government.  They have to decide if they are going to let the race tracks fall into disrepair, as they are about to do, or if they are going to give this industry a boost and safeguard the jobs I am talking about.  Many of these people are very worried about what they will do if anything happens to the racing industry. Many of them do not have third level education.  They live in rural areas.  The <Col N="2429" /> racing industry can give a huge boost to the wider economy.  This is a point I have tried to make today, perhaps not very well, but that and the image go together. This is something we need to work on.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross mentioned committees. I agree that we do not need more committees; we need action at this stage.  I was very pleased to hear the Minister say there is a memorandum before the Government about the report on racing, but in a broader sense the industry is big enough for some sort of a joint committee to look at it on an ongoing basis, not just to comment on the report.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Senators for their very constructive and wide-ranging contributions to this debate.  I am also very grateful to the Minister and the Minister of State for being with us and responding so positively to the debate, and also to Lord Killanin.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 106.</P>
      <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 153:</P>
      <P>In page 92, lines 45 and 46, to delete &ldquo;or to a fine not exceeding £10,000, or to both&rdquo;.</P>
      <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator J. O'Toole.)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already proposed the amendment.  This section is the kernel of the legislation; it is the <i>raison d'être</i> for this legislation.  This legislation was put together to deal with the single problem being addressed in this section rather than for any other reason.  It deals with people abusing the privilege of limited liability.  Over the years people have deliberately and recklessly traded a company out of business, and quite deliberately picked up the proceeds or feathered their own nests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section, as printed, allows a person on summary conviction to be imprisoned for 12 months or to pay a fine not exceeding <Col N="2431" /> £1,000 or, on conviction and indictment, a term not exceeding seven years or a fine not exceeding £10,000.  I did not press amendment No. 152 because, on reconsideration, I can see the reason that discretion should be allowed in legislation &mdash; it allows the legislation to operate more efficiently.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 153, we are talking about somebody being convicted on indictment.  I strongly believe that should be an offence meriting a jail sentence.  People who defraud others deliberately and use what was until now the protection of the law, in the sense of the limited liability legislation, should be penalised in the future.  That is why we set up this legislation.  All the discussion on company legislation was about people who had paid money into a company the owners knew was going into liquidation.  All I am saying is that on conviction and indictment a jail sentence should be mandatory, and that the time discretion allowable should be up to seven years.  I do not think people should be allowed to buy themselves out of this problem by the payment of a fine.</P>
    <P>My amendment insists on a jail sentence and should be accepted by the Minister. It is not unusual to have jail sentences imposed in this type of legislation. The Finance Acts of 1986 and 1987, and probably earlier, made provision for jail sentences for tax fraud, but as far as I recall they also included an option.  Consequently, there are people in this State who have defrauded the State and private individuals of vast amounts of money &mdash; hundreds of thousands of pounds &mdash; and they were able to buy themselves out by paying fines rather than serving jail sentences.  There should not be an option.  If hundreds of small people have lost their savings because of the reckless trading of a company director, which amounts to fraud, and if he is found guilty he should be jailed, not fined.  There should be no discretion on the basis of a fine.  The only discretion should be whether the sentence should be for one day or up to seven years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Senator O'Toole comments, what we are trying to do is to leave the courts with substantial flexibility. This section leaves it to the courts to decide whether a person should go to jail for fraudulent trading and-or suffer a hefty fine.  That kind of flexibility is preferable to making it mandatory, as it were.  It is perhaps better to leave it to the court to judge the circumstances as they see it.  I do, however, agree with the general thrust of what Senator O'Toole is trying to do and for that reason I have introduced a Government amendment raising the maximum fine for conviction on indictment from £10,000 to £50,000. Under this section a person can go to jail. In the Bill, as drafted, we are leaving that decision to the courts.  In this commercial area that might be the more sensible way to do it just now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to bring it to the Minister's attention that we are not talking about reckless trading.  I quote from the section:</P>
      <P>If in the course of the winding up of a company it appears that any business of the company has been carried on with intent to defraud...</P>
      <P>That is the classic line.  It is like the old penny catechism &mdash; the sin was committed once you decided to do whatever it was that was wrong.  Here we are talking about intent to defraud the creditors of a company.  In other words, if a person was knowingly a party with intent to defraud. It is a difficult thing to prove; it is almost like conspiracy.  We discussed reckless trading and what it meant.  I certainly see a case under the reckless trading, provision but here we are talking about people who coldbloodedly and knowingly set out to defraud somebody.  It could be, for example, setting out to take a total life's savings from a pensioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much appreciate the Government amendment increasing the fine from £10,000 to £50,000.  That is a very valuable change.  However, I feel strongly that there should be provision for a jail sentence for those who set out <Col N="2433" /> to defraud somebody.  We are not talking about someone who makes an error of judgment or somebody who could claim they were just taking a business risk and it did not work out.  We are talking about somebody against whom it has been proven in the courts that they set out to defraud.  They did not set out to take a risk; they did not set out to try to use the money for the good of the company; they set out from the moment the offence was committed to steal money, to defraud somebody else; to take something that did not belong to them.  It is an absolute breach of the spirit of this legislation that there is not the provision I am seeking to have included.  This amendment must be the most critical of all those tables.  I have given it a lot of thought and consideration. I have read reports of debates on similar legislation in other countries and I have gone through details of the British experience.  I do not believe a fine meets the case here.  Take, for instance, a pensioner &mdash; I pick that kind of case quite deliberately as being emotive &mdash; who has total lifesavings of, say, £2,000. Anybody who would set out to defraud that person of that money would deserve to be jailed.  I am not concerned with the kind of company that might be involved. We are talking about suppliers and distributors here but that need not necessarily be the case.  The company that were being defrauded might be a small company who make deliveries to a bigger company and could be on what was for them a make or break delivery.  The offending company could put such smaller companies out of business, perhaps in individual cases, putting 20 people out of work.  I am talking about the person who deliberately sets out to defraud without any concern whatever for anybody else.  I think that nobody can make the case for those people; they deserve to be put to jail and that is it.</P>

      <P>I can understand Senator O'Toole's very strong feelings on this issue.  However, I would agree with the Minister that it should be left to the courts to decide whether a person who is guilty of fraud should be sent to jail or be fined <Col N="2434" /> a certain amount of money because, after all, everything is relative.  A person for various reasons &mdash; and I am not trying to make excuses for anyone who is guilty of fraud &mdash; may trade fraudulently but it may be a first offence.  Does it mean, if we pass the Senator's amendment, that the judge has no option but to give such a person a prison sentence or let him off? Is there any in-between?</P>

      <P>We could debate this at length.  For the information of the House the situation in the UK is similar to what I am proposing, which leaves it to the court to decide.  I agree that if somebody sets out to defraud they should get the stiffest possible sentence.  We are touching on sentencing policy and that is an area I would not want to get into too deeply but each case will have different circumstances attaching to it.  A person can be sent to jail for up to seven years under this legislation but it would not be for me to tell the Judiciary how to interpret the legislation.  We are providing the courts with that option, if in the circumstances before them they wish to avail of it.  I am happy that this is the correct balance.  I think it does meet with Senator O'Tooles wishes.  It is not, as if we are not giving the option, and only providing for a fine.  We are saying that if the court so decides, a person can be sent to jail for up to seven years for the intention to defraud creditors of a company, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes the insertion of a new subsection in section 107 of the Bill, the purpose of which is to provide some guideline as to what is meant by trading in a reckless manner.  Essentially what we are proposing here is that an objective test should be applied in relation to what constitutes recklessness.  Recklessness is a concept which is familiar in our criminal law but it is one which is new to civil liability in company law.  Essentially what we are trying to get at in this provision is the situation where a director of a company may not have actually intended to do anything which would defraud creditors &mdash; the test in relation to fraudulent trading is the intention &mdash; but who either knew or should have known that his actions or omissions would adversely affect the creditors of the company but nevertheless went ahead in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central element in relation to recklessness is whether the test to be applied by the courts should be a subjective or an objective one.  If a subjective test is applied, it would be necessary to prove on the balance of probabilities that a person actually knew that, for example, a statement made by him was false, that the making of the statement could cause loss to creditors but nevertheless made the statement.  Experience of the way the Irish courts have interpreted the recklessness element in the area of criminal <Col N="2438" /> law shows that the subjective test is applied.  While the burden of proof would clearly be lighter in the context of civil proceedings, as envisaged in the Bill it seems likely that the courts would apply a similar test in such cases.</P>
    <P>It is considered, however, that the objective test is the correct test to be applied in relation to reckless trading. Thus, what is relevant is, first of all, whether the officer concerned acted in a particular manner when he actually knew what the result of his actions might be or, secondly, whether the officer so acted when he should have known the likely consequences of his actions, taking into account the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person in his position.  It is important that this be actually written into the legislation in order to ensure, first of all, that an objective test is applied by the courts and, secondly, that in applying an objective test the courts should bear in mind how a prudent officer of a company would act, thus taking into account, for example, the fact that all business involves the taking of some risks which may not necessarily amount to recklessness.</P>

      <P>While the proposed provision in the Bill is essential in view of the widespread abuse that is apparently taking place at the moment by people in directorship positions, I would be grateful if the Minister could define what is meant by &ldquo;reckless&rdquo;.  He has gone some way towards explaining it but I am worried that if we do not get the wording in this section completely right very bad decisions might be made in a court.  In addition, it will put a very onerous responsibility on the auditor, liquidator or shadow director, as defined in the section, and will place them in an invidious position if they are asked to give evidence in a court regarding a person involved in reckless trading.  In order to clear up the matter it is important that the words &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; and &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; be defined. We are all very clear on what the Minister is trying to stamp out in relation to this matter but I would like certain assurances in relation to this section and definitions of &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; and &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I would like to endorse what Senator Hogan has said.  I understand exactly what the Minister is getting at but I think we are treading on a very difficult area as regards the word &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; and the spirit of private enterprise and taking risks.  I am not sure where the line is to be drawn here.  There is a great danger that those who are involved in enterprise and venture capital will suddenly come under the reckless category in this Bill if we are not absolutely certain what the word means.  I would like the Minister to be a bit more specific on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not deny that this is a very difficult area.  I will summarise it quickly.  We are trying to introduce a new concept into company legislation called reckless trading.  The main reason for that of course, as Senators will know, is that in the past it has become virtually impossible to prove fraudulent trading. There was a need to show that while you might not be fraudulent, you could do as much damage if you were reckless. Reckless obviously implies culpability, knowingly and with full knowledge setting out to do something or doing something which could cause loss to the creditors of the company.  That is why we picked the words &ldquo;a party to the carrying on of any business of the company in a reckless manner&rdquo;.  This is fairly clear.  The amendment states: &ldquo;he was a party to the carrying on of such business and, having regard to the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person in his position, he ought to have known that his actions would cause loss to the creditors of the company, or any of them&rdquo;.  That is as clear as we can make it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the concept of reckless trading was introduced in New Zealand's company law in 1980.  In a 1983 New Zealand case in relation to the new statutory provision the court applied an objective test in respect of reckless trading. The test applied by the court was the following: &ldquo;Was there something in the financial position of (the) Company which would have drawn the attention of an ordinary prudent Director to the real <Col N="2440" /> possibility, not so slight as to be a negligible risk, that his continuing to carry on the business of the Company would cause the kind of loss to creditors which section 320 of that Bill was intended to prevent&rdquo;.  The judge in that case expressly stated that the carrying on of any business of the company in a reckless manner did not necessarily involve blameworthy behaviour to the extent of dishonesty.  While this case would obviously not be binding in Ireland, the decidion has been extremely useful in our endeavours to draft a provision which would set out clearly in the legislation what is meant by reckless trading, in the hope of reducing the amount of litigation necessary on the subject.  That case is Thompson v Innes, 1983, a New Zealand case.</P>
    <P>We are trying to bring in an important new concept to company law.  It is based on the idea that you can do as much damage by recklessly trading as you can by fraudulently trading.  We want to make sure that there is a remedy for that kind of behaviour.  The words are well known legal phrases.  The word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; appears throughout our legislation. &ldquo;Ought to have known&rdquo; is a phrase that I am certain is in many areas of our legislation.  The word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; also appears throughout our code of laws.  They are words that the courts are well used to dealing with and are certainly very comfortable with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have a real problem here, and maybe it is because it is introducing a new concept into our law. Will the difference, for instance, between reckless trading and risky trading, be an inhibiting factor in stopping companies and principals of companies from taking risks?  We may be entering that area because as the Minister said it will be an <Col N="2441" /> offence only if the officer of a company knew or ought to have known it would cause loss to creditors.  I do not think anybody is going to embark on a situation like that.  Maybe they ought to have known, but who is going to say they ought to have known?  They are not going to do it unless they think there is a fair chance of some sort of profit for the company. We could get into serious trouble in inhibiting people from taking normal commercial risks or maybe even taking slightly abnormal commercial risks, but which would be in the nature of a business to take.</P>
      <P>While I understand exactly what the Minister is at, I do not think he has covered people taking commercial decisions which would be risky by their very nature but which in no way would be totally irresponsible even though they might involve the company in serious losses.  Many companies, both public and private, take decisions knowing that the decisions are risky and could involve the company and the creditors of the company in losses.  They take those decisions having weighed them in the balance but afterwards it could quite easily be brought back to them that what they did was reckless in the light of events that happened even though it was just a very bad, high risk business decision.  I am not convinced of the difference between a reckless decision and bad, commercial, high risk decisions which are being taken every day.  I do not see that distinction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to say I am back in the Minister's court on this one. If I believed what Senator Ross has just said to be the case, I would certainly agree with him, but I do not believe it to be the case.  I want to make three points, the first of which deals with the last point he made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interpretation which he has taken would certainly be worrying but, in fairness, I think what he meant was that if in the light of circumstances following it was proved that it was reckless trading.  That would not be admissible evidence as I see it.  The circumstances following the <Col N="2442" /> decision could not be used to prove that a person acted recklessly, wrongfully, fraudulently or whatever at the time.  The legislation is very clear and excellently put together.  It says that without prejudice, an officer of a company must first of all have &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; done it.  The concept of &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; has to be proved in court and it is a very difficult concept to prove.  It is one of the most difficult concepts to prove because there will only be circumstantial evidence one way or another.  It will have to be proven conclusively in the court through circumstantial evidence that the person knowingly carried on in a reckless manner.</P>
    <P>The amendment says that &ldquo;a person of his general knowledge, skill and experience... may reasonably be expected or ought to have known&rdquo;.  That does not cover what takes place afterwards.  In other words, if I invest in a company and circumstances show it to be a very poor or unwise investment because of what happened afterwards, that is not, as I understand it, the evidence that would necessary be here.  That is a commercial risk and that is not being ruled out here. It covers somebody who hides information or who did not present information that was there at the time of the investment, which would prove one way or another whether the person knowingly or wrongfully traded.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to the Cork report which very definitely allows the out for honesty.  It is nice to see the word &ldquo;honesty&rdquo; appearing in legislation.  It says that &ldquo;If he was a party or contact to the debt and did not honestly believe on reasonable grounds...&rdquo;  There are safety nets all over that legislation.  What the amendment means is that the commercial risk is not excluded.  This amendment does not say: &ldquo;You asked me to invest in your company.  I invested in your company.  It proved to be a reckless decision and, therefore, you are responsible&rdquo;.  It says: &ldquo;You asked me to invest in your company and now it appears that at that time you knew well that this company could not have traded profitably or could not have reaped the investment&rdquo;.  In other words, <Col N="2443" /> it deals almost but not quite with the hiding of information or fraud.</P>
    <P>It is the concept which is referred to as &ldquo;wrongful trading&rdquo; in the British legislation and it is now being introduced here as &ldquo;reckless trading&rdquo;.  I still do not understand why we need a different definition. If we are just asserting ourselves, that is fine &mdash; I suppose there is room for a bit of chauvinism &mdash; but is there a difference between the concept of &ldquo;reckless trading&rdquo; in our legislation and the concept of &ldquo;wrongful trading&rdquo; in the British legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not call it &ldquo;wrongful trading&rdquo; because when this Bill was set out originally, a long time ago, it was referred to as &ldquo;reckless trading&rdquo; and when the UK legislators decided to bring in their legislation they chose not to use the phrase &ldquo;reckless trading&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senators made many of the points I would obviously have made in support of this amendment.  I refer the House to subsection (4) on page 93 which says: &ldquo;Where it appears to the court that any person in respect of whom a declaration has been sought under subsection (1), has acted honestly and responsibly in relation to the conduct of the affairs of the company or any matter or matters on the ground of which such declaration is sought to be made, the court may,... relieve him&rdquo; of the burden.  That makes it clear that it is not intended to take on the risk taker.  Somebody can be engaged in a very high risk venture provided they act honestly and responsibly in relation to the company, which you would imagine they should do even in a high risk venture. In a high risk venture you should certainly act honestly and responsibly.  I do not think there will be any great problem with this.  The points Senator O'Toole made in this area are valid.  I do not want to prevent risk taking because, as I have said many times in the course of the debate on this Bill, I am particularly concerned to ensure that enterprise and risk taking are encouraged more and more with this legislation.  However, we also want to make sure that we modernise and bring up to date the protection for <Col N="2444" /> the creditor, the investor and for people dealing with companies in the modern complex financial type of society which we now have.  That is what we are trying to do here.  If somebody is trading in a reckless manner, we are bringing in a remedy for that so that it will become a civil offence.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Toole rightly said, the UK called it &ldquo;wrongful trading&rdquo;.  There is a whole background to why they did that and I can let the Senator have this information if he wants it.  It is contained in section 214 of the Insolvency Act, 1986, and it deals with the principle of &ldquo;knew or ought to have known&rdquo; and it is very similar to what we are now proposing to do here.  If Senator Ross read the wording in the amendment carefully he will be reassured that it does not rule out in any way what you would call ventures that have a very high risk involved in them.  I do not think that could be deemed to be reckless if it is undertaken honestly and responsibly.  The point Senator O'Toole made about &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is included very much in the amendment and you will have to know or ought to have known that you could cause loss to creditors.  I understand the sensitivity between high risk and reckless, but I think the wording of the amendment makes it clear where the line falls.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand exactly what the Minister is getting at but the more I think about it the more dangerous I think it may be.  I think Senator O'Toole misunderstood something I said about subsequent events.  A business decision can look reckless a long time after it has been taken, whereas it would appear to be responsible at the time.  We are in serious danger here because one man's reckless decision is another man's high risk decision.  It may well be that decisions are taken by a principal of a company which are very risky at the time but which a judge or a non-commercial person who does not understand that sort of business may, as a result of subsequent events, regard as reckless and they may look much worse in retrospect than they did at the time they were taken.  We are <Col N="2445" /> moving into a dangerous area here &mdash; in one part we have fraud; there is no argument about that &mdash; which is the issue of honesty and we also have the issue of responsibility.  The two are coupled together in subsection (4) which states: &ldquo;Where it appears to the court that any person in respect of whom a declaration has been sought under <i>subsection (1)</i>, has acted honestly and responsibly...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I understand the concept of honesty. That is straightforward and we are all agreed about that but the concept of responsibility is far more blurred and far more difficult.  We are moving into a grey area which may haunt us in the years to come because of different interpretations of the courts.  While I think the concept has some merit in it, the definition just is not there.  It is not satisfactory at the moment and it leaves too much for what the Minister called a subjectivity about this subject later on.  It is very dangerous. What the Minister is thinking and what we are all thinking at the moment may well not be the same interpretation because of the subjectivity of this clause way down the line.  I am very unhappy with it.  Ordinary commercial decisions, because of the vague language and because of the lack of definition of &ldquo;reckless&rdquo;, may be inhibited as a result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much more to add except to say that it specifically talks about general knowledge, skill and experience that may be expected of a person in his position.  If you enter a high risk venture you obviously do so to make money for the company and, therefore, to pay your creditors.  If you go in with that intention, this does not catch you because you are not going in knowing that your actions would lose money for your creditors.  If you go into a high risk venture, no matter how high risk it is, you go in with the intention of making money for the company and therefore paying your creditors.  You do not go in with the intention of losing funds for your creditors.  The point must be made that the way this amendment is worded, &ldquo;may reasonably be expected of a person in his position&rdquo; you would have had to know <Col N="2446" /> that it would lead to loss, that his actions would cause loss to the creditors of the company.  You would not enter a high risk venture knowing that you would cause loss to the creditors.  If you did that, it would not be a high risk venture; it would be a reckless venture.  That distinction is an important one.</P>

      <P>Again, this is a drafting amendment to insert the word &ldquo;liquidator&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;receiver&rdquo;.  I have a long litany of reasons why we want to do that.  As currently drafted a liquidator would be regarded as an officer under the section so that if he acted recklessly he could have a declaration or personal liability made against him in the courts. However, there seems to be no particular reason why a receiver could not also act recklessly within the meaning of the section.  Amendment No. 157 would simply rectify this omission by allowing actions for personal liability to be taken against a receiver who acts in such a manner.</P>

      <P>Section 108 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 109.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 158:</P>
      <P>In page 95, between lines 15 to 16, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  the effect which such order would be likely to have on the creditors of the related company concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 109 of the Bill as it stands is designed to tackle the abuse of limited liability in a group situation. At its simplest the section will enable a court, on the application of a liquidator, a creditor or contributory of any company that is being wound up to order that any surviving related company should pay to the liquidator a certain amount towards the debts provable in the winding up. The section does not permit the limited liability of the related company to be automatically stripped away.  The section contains a number of matters to which the court must have regard before it can make an order under the section.  A number of parties have represented to us that, even with the safeguards and guidelines built into the section as it stands, inequities could result from an order to the court in certain circumstances. While the court always decide in some circumstances, that they may take a particular view, we think the court should be required to address itself to the question as to what effect the making of an order would have on the solvent company and that is the effect of my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 109 is seeking to introduce a concept which is also new to company law and that is the question of relating companies A, B, C and D who, up to <Col N="2448" /> now perhaps or in the past under the existing legislation were all parallel to each other and they not being related in terms of who was responsible for what if they got into difficulty.  What we are doing in these few sections is allowing the veil of limited liability to be somewhat lifted between companies so that if there are a number of companies that are very close and company A is pulling the strings and it is just a myth that they are separate and it is the intention to remove that myth and say that they are not separate. The general thrust of what we are doing here is to connect companies that may appear to be legally separate but who are in reality linked to each other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this section. It is essential.  There is one question about which I am not clear and I raised it with the Minister in another context, that is, the question of the related companies. Movement between related companies is referred to as synergy by the free marketeers but I am talking here about where they actually move the whole business of the company.  I raised with the Minister previously the question of people who are at this moment trying to subvert this legislation by stacking up other companies. Let us say that I own company A and I am trading in company A and I also own company B. Company A goes out of business and I continue the same trading and the same business with company B. They are not actually two companies within the same group but they are related inasmuch as I am the managing director of both.  I am walking away from company A; I will let the receiver, the creditors and so on all sort themselves out and I am setting up shop again in company B.  Without having any regard to carrying of liabilities from one company to another in other sections, under this section could the order be made governing company B?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maybe I have not explained that too clearly.  Let me sum up again.  I own a company.  It goes out of business.  I owe money to a number of people and the receiver comes in.  The receiver is trying <Col N="2449" /> to sort it out.  He is trying to find whatever is due to the creditors.  I walk away from the lot.  Forget about my liabilities under other sections for a moment.  I want to look at this in isolation.  I activate company B because it has been a dormant company now but, conveniently, I have bought it previously.  If I continue the same activities maybe with the same customers and certainly providing the same service or manufacturing the same product under the title of company B, can you get stuck into that company?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In short, yes, because it would appear under this present wording to be a related company from the example the Senator gives me.  We have a whole list of proposals as to how to link these companies.  In the example the Senator gives, one company in a group could be told to contribute to the deficiency of the company that has gone into liquidation.  That would be one of the effects perhaps of a related company. Where one company has very heavy debts and is in liquidation and another company is deemed to be a related company, then that company could be ordered by the court to make a contribution towards the deficiency of the liquidated company. Whether the example the Senator gives would be a related company would depend on how it would fit into the criteria laid down here.  Offhand, I think it would be a related company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite clear about the &ldquo;within a group&rdquo; concept, but the concept I am talking about is this: the company closes down today and tomorrow I open up with a new company providing the same service or manufacturing the same product and probably dealing with the same customers.  My company, while it existed, was not trading yesterday and, therefore, was in no way connected with that company because one company stopped before the other began trading. They are not a group.  The Minister will see why it is so important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me extend an interpretation of that point.  It means that for all those companies advertising on the back of <i>The <Col N="2450" /> Irish Times</i> and everywhere else for the past couple of months asking people to buy six companies for £1,000 or whatever &mdash; which is done to my mind with intent to defraud some time in the future &mdash; that it was all a sort of obair in aisce for them, they would not get anything out of it at the end of the day because they would just set up again and they would be liable. I am not talking about the other sections. I understand that in the other sections a liability becomes personal and it might be necessary to take it forward.  Can the Minister assure me that &ldquo;related&rdquo; companies mean companies with the same major shareholder, the same owner, the same managing director?  The Minister has gone into some detail but not enough for me.  I do not quite understand what is meant here.  This creates a marvellous opportunity of tying down something if we could be certain of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 109 contains a number of definitions and criteria laid down as to how we decide on what is a related company.  From the example the Senator gave from the way he described it, it would appear that they would be a related company.  A company in liquidation is still a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Therefore, the new company the Senator describes could be deemed to be a related company under this section because more than half the nominal value of the shares and so on could be held by a related company, a subsidiary or something like that.  The Senator is worried about the phoenix syndrome. That is basically the cowboys who make a business of going into liquidation and starting up again and doing that as a business in itself.  We are determined to stamp that out and we tackle that very strongly in the upcoming Part VII of the Bill which provides quite strong and hefty powers to prevent the phoenix syndrome carrying on.</P>

      <P>May I ask one question? I am aware I have got in ahead of Senator Mulroy.  To my mind &mdash; I may be wrong and I stand open to contradiction &mdash; the phoenix syndrome was the setting up of a new company.  I am talking about the activation of an existing company.  There is some difference there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this section because there has been a great deal of abuse in this area with assets being transferred to one company from another and then the company that is stripped of all the assets dropped and put into liquidation. Many people are concerned also that companies who stand alone or a company in a group of companies that stands alone, trades at arms' length and receives no benefits from a sister company would not be held responsible if, say, the parent company went into liquidation.  People want assurance that legitimate companies within a group, stand alone companies, are protected.  Has the Minister made provision for this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In short the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  The court has enough in the legislation to decide whether a company is related or not.  We should not forget the principle here.  We are trying to make sure that if companies are related in the ordinary meaning of the word, if they are very closely bound up in management, ownership and general direction, it should not be possible to pretend they are totally separate entities when they <Col N="2452" /> are not, when, in fact, being organised, orchestrated and managed by the same people and so on.  Where, genuinely, there is no relation, the separate corporate entities will have their separate corporate protections in limited liability and so on.  If they are related, then the court can deal with them under this legislation. I thank the Senator for raising the point.  I am happy enough that only where they are genuinely related would the court obviously take the decision that they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Companies could be related with common directors and common shareholders but the management aim of a related company may be acting and managing that company quite independently.  If they are trading, say, on a competitive basis with a related company I do not think they should be held responsible if the parent company gets into financial difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mulroy has given a very valid practical example of where we could find ourselves in trouble under the section.  I welcome the principle which the Minister is trying to enshrine in the legislation.  We have numerous examples of where asset stripping would have taken place from one company to another and financial arrangements would have been transferred from one company to the other and at the end of the day the creditors of that individual company would have nothing to fall back on.  I noticed the Minister has taken a number of his amendments from New Zealand legislation.  Certainly New Zealand legislation gives us an appropriate guideline and experience in how we can tackle the problem in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What guidelines will the Minister be laying down and what will be required for the court to make a decision?  What extent of intermingling of companies will be necessary?  The extent of intermingling of the companies is important to know now and to be written into the record of this House in order to give some guidelines to the court in making its decision.  If the guidelines are clearly set <Col N="2453" /> down fair enough, but on the extent of the intermingling being established &mdash; I think this is the point Senator Mulroy is trying to make &mdash; if sister companies become part of the one group of companies, if they are independently trading, one company should not have to cough up some of the debts of another company in the event of a financial problem.</P>
    <P>The problem here also is that you have to be careful not to inhibit joint ventures from taking place.  No matter what legislation is there, there are going to be difficulties in striking the proper balance.  I totally agree with the principle the Minister is trying to enshrine in the legislation. I would be interested in the guidelines that would be needed before there could be a conviction under the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not proposed to issue any guidelines, I do not think that it is necessary.  The section is quite clear. In the first instance, to make an application as to whether the company is related or not, subsection (5) states:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this Act, a company is related to another company if&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that other company is its holding company or subsidiary; or</P>
      <P>(b)  more than half in nominal value of its equity share capital (as defined in section 155 (5) of the Principal Act) is held by the other company and companies related to that other company (whether directly or indirectly, but other than in a fiduciary capacity); or</P>
      <P>(c)  more than half in nominal value of the equity share capital (as defined in section 155 (5) of the Principal Act) of each of them is held by members of the other (whether directly or indirectly, but other than in a fiduciary capacity); or</P>
      <P>(d)  that other company or a company or companies related to that other company or that other company together with a company or companies related to it are entitled to exercise or control the exercise of more than one half of the voting power at any general meeting of the company; or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e)  the businesses of the companies <Col N="2454" /> have been so carried on that the separate business of each company, or a substantial part thereof, is not readily identifiable; or</P>
    <P>(f)  there is another company to which both companies are related;</P>
    <P>That is to do with the initial view being taken as to whether they are related or not.  When it gets to the stage of a court hearing, the court has then further matters to look at.  They have to look, first, in section (2)(a) at the extent to which the related company took part in the management of the company being wound up; (b) the conduct of the related company towards the creditors of the company being wound up.</P>
    <P>I am proposing, in amendment No. 158, that the court take into account the effect that such order would be likely to have on the creditors of the related company.  I am happy that it is laid out here as clearly and as crisply as possible. The idea is simply to ensure, where companies are related, that they are seen to be and that the veil between them is clearly removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would support that point.  It is one that needs to be spelled out.  It is very important to read what is written here.  It is not being said here that because a company is related to another company it should be responsible for its debts.  It is not being said here that because company A and company B are a part of the same group or corporation, are totally related, or run by the same people, that one should be responsible for the other's debts.  I think that that is the question that Senator Mulroy asks. What is being said here is covered completely by the first sentence, that the court must be &ldquo;satisfied that it is just and equitable to make such an order&rdquo;.  If it is not just and equitable, then it does not happen, even if the companies are totally owned by the same person, or within the same group, or whatever.  In other words, it does not stop joint ventures; it does not stop a joint risk.  Therefore, it is not an additional risk to the company.  The receiver, or whoever applies to the court, <Col N="2455" /> says &ldquo;I think it would be fair that that company should take responsibility for some of the liabilities for this company because ...&rdquo;.  The court asks why and there is the burden of proof.  I have not the slightest difficulty with that.</P>
      <P>It is well worth stating, for the record, just, that there is no long tradition in Irish courts, or in the interpretation of our laws, if any sort of anti-entrepreneurial thread running through such interpretation; quite the opposite has been the case from the foundation of the State. British law has gone quite differently and has become what I would call more liberal in the area, although my colleagues here might look at it somewhat differently.</P>
      <P>Every time I stand up to speak here I am interpreted as taking the line of making it more difficult for people to take risks.  I want to make it absolutely clear that I take quite the opposite point of view.  I am a risk-taker myself and have no time for people who are not risk-takers. What we are saying here is that we should identify risks and that they are risks, rather than fraud and that people can trade honestly and properly.  Section 109 allows that to happen.  It allows people to split up their activities into companies without adding the liability from one company to the other just because they happen to own two companies, unless the court rules that it is right that this company should take it.  I am certainly satisfied that there are very few of our judges who would take an anti-entrepreneurial line in this area.  I welcome the legislation.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 159:</P>
      <P>In page 95, lines 20 to 24, to delete subsection (4) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P>(a)  the fact that a company is related to another company, or</P>
    <P>(b)  that creditors of the company being wound up have relied on the fact that another company is or has been related to the first mentioned company.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments arise in different sections, but they are linked.  Taking amendment No. 159 first, I mentioned already that section 109 will enable a court, on the application of a liquidator, creditor or contributor of any company that is being wound up, to order that any surviving related company should pay to the liquidator a certain amount towards the debts provable in the winding up.  I also stressed that the protection of limited liability of a company in a group situatuion will not be stripped away automatically.  The section already contains a number of matters to which the court must have regard in deciding whether it is just and equitable that a company should be required to contribute to the debts of a related company.</P>
      <P>Moving to subsection (4) in particular, that subsection specifically provides that, notwithstanding any other provision in the section, the court cannot make an order where the only ground for making the order is the fact that the creditors of the company wound up have relied on the fact that another company is, or has been, related to the company being wound up.  Amendment No. 159 would add a further somewhat similar bar to the making of a court order.  We would be saying that the court would also be precluded from making an order if the only ground for making the order would be the mere fact on its own that companies are related; in other words, whether creditors relied on the relationship or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a nutshell, paragraph (a) of the amendment is intended to rule out any <Col N="2457" /> question of automatic or strict liability of a parent company for the debts of their subsidiaries.  The same applies very much to section 110, but that is another matter. The same kind of reasoning would apply there.  It is not just that the companies are related, but the effect on the creditors and the other matters are very important, too.</P>

      <P>In page 95, line 50, after &ldquo;Acts&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and &lsquo;creditor&rsquo; means one or more creditors to whom the company being wound up is indebted by more, in aggregate, than £10,000&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to recap quickly, what we are doing here is putting in a number of guidelines for the court before they decide that companies are actually related, to help the court out.  As the Senators know, if the companies are deemed to be related, then the court can order that the good company, as it were, should perhaps pay something to the debts of the company in liquidation.  That is an overall picture of what we are doing here, just to try to put it in perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 160 would insert what I might call a qualifying threshold before creditors can make an application to the court under section 109.  It provides that an application cannot be made by a creditor unless there is a minimum aggregate of £10,000 owed to one or more creditors.  It has been strongly represented to us that the creditors should be owed a certain minimum amount by the company being wound up before it would be permitted to make an application for an order under this section. Otherwise, it is claimed the possibilities opened up by the section would be endless. There would be considerable uncertainty about possible exposure to risk. There would be the possibility of frivilous <Col N="2458" /> or devious applications by very minor creditors and so on.  That speaks for itself. What I am doing here is putting in the figure of £10,000 as being the figure which would be owed to a creditor or to a group of creditors in total before they could go into court and seek to have companies related.</P>

Perhaps the Minister would explain the endless legislation which might arise if this amendment was not passed?  I would like to hear an example of what we are talking about.  It seems that £10,000 is a lot of money for a small company, for instance, a supplier company to be owed.  Is this the aggregate debts of the company going into liquidation or is it the amount owed to the company seeking the order?</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 161:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2459" /> In page 95, after line 50, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(7)  Where an application for an order under subsection (1) seeks to require a licensed bank, within the meaning of section 24, to contribute to the debts of a related company, a copy of every such application shall be sent by the applicant to the Central Bank who shall be entitled to be heard by the court before an order is made.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 161 is fairly straightforward.  It simply requires that where an application under section 109 might result in a licensed bank being ordered to contribute to the debts of a related company in liquidation, the court ought to give a hearing to the Central Bank in the first instance.  I could expand on that if necessary but this really is to give the Central Bank a role in it where this matter of related companies refers to banks.  The reason should be fairly obvious.</P>

I have no doubt about it, this is probably a very sensible amendment but having recently spent some time trying to get through the morass of legislation which covers the Central Bank, I am sure anybody could say anything about it and be proved right because, between the 1926 Currency Acts and various changes in the Currency Acts in the forties and fifties, I do not know if anybody knows the precise nature of the legislation covering the Central Bank. When is it intended to bring in reformed, uniform legislation covering the Central Bank?</P>

      <P>When a company is being wound up, the court, on application, can seek companies to repay or restore money or property to an individual company and to directors.  I want an explanation in relation to subsection (2).  Does it refer to all directors or just to managing directors?  What is the situation in relation to nominal directors and all managers? The word &ldquo;manager&rdquo; is mentioned. Are we talking about all managers?  Does that include sales managers, assistant managers or just the principal manager involved in the management of the company?  Could we have an explanation of the definitions?</P>

      <P>Section 111 is to clarify what directors and other members can be held liable for and the list of people affected by it is given.  The court may, on the application of the liquidator or any creditor, examine into the conduct of the <Col N="2461" /> promoter, director, manager, liquidator, receiver or officer and compel him, and so on, so that net is cast fairly widely to include those involved in the management of the company.  If somebody is not involved in the management of the company, obviously you could not pursue him or her under this section.  I am reasonably happy it is laid out there that a manager would include senior management in the company who would be involved in the management of the company's affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the present wording of the section it casts its net, as the Minister said, very widely.  He is including in this liability a fairly wide number of people who might not be directly involved in the management of the company. They might be sales managers or marketing managers, and have nothing to do with the financial management or the day-to-day operation of the company. They have a particular role in the company and that is their job.  The overall operations of the company and how it survives financially is not their responsibility. I would be concerned that the Minister is bringing more people under the provisions of this section than might necessarily be needed.  We must clearly establish that the people we want to involve under this section are those who are managing the company on a day-to-day basis.</P>

I welcome the section as it stands because you could have a situation where, say, a salesman on the road with the task or responsibility of collecting money on behalf of the company, could during the course of a week's work collect several thousand pounds and, at the same time, the company could go in liquidation and he could retain this money.  This section gives the liquidator the opportunity to obtain and demand that this money is handed over.  Maybe I am reading it wrongly but that is how I see the section.</P>

      <P>The Senator is reading it correctly.  My response to Senator <Col N="2462" /> Hogan's point is that we are getting at a very specific situation from which top management and management generally in the company should not be excluded. It would not be my intention to exclude them from this.  It is quite the contrary, to make sure that they are included because it applies if the liquidator has reason to believe and so on that any person has misapplied or retained or become liable for or accountable for any money or property of the company or has been guilty of any negligence or breach of duty or trust in relation to the company. If any manager in the company fell under any of those headings one would certainly want to assume that the fact he was a junior manager instead of a senior manager should not protect him or her.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 163:</P>
      <P>In page 97, before section 112, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;.&mdash;Section 299 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1)&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1)  If it appears to the court in the course of a winding-up by the court that any past or present officer, or any member, of the company has been guilty of an offence in relation to the company for which he is criminally liable, the court may either on the application of any person interested in the winding-up or of its own motion direct the liquidator to refer the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions and in such a case the liquidator shall furnish to the Director of Public Prosecutions such information and give to him such access to and facilities for inspecting and taking any copies of any documents, being information or documents in the possession or under the control of the liquidator and relating to the matter in question, as the Director of Public Prosecutions may require.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a procedural amendment.  The intention is to require liquidators in court liquidations to cooperate with the Director of Public Prosecutions in the same way as liquidators in voluntary liquidations are already required to do.  If, during a winding up by the court, the court is of the opinion that any officer or member of the company has been guilty of an offence, it may, under section 299 (1) of the 1963 Act, direct the liquidator to refer the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Section 299 (2) of the 1963 Act places a similar duty in the liquidator of a company voluntarily winding up. However, subsection (2) requires the liquidator to furnish the Director of Public Prosecutions with such information as the DPP may require, and must give the DPP access to such documents and such other assistance as he may require.  There is no requirement on court appointed liquidators to help the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There is no such requirement in relation to the giving of information under subsection (1).  We have been told by the DPP's office that the absence of a requirement for court appointed liquidators to give the DPP any information which he may reasonably require has caused problems in practice in the past.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 163, therefore, proposes to amend section 299 (1) of the 1963 Act by adding a requirement in relation to the furnishing of information similar to that already contained in subsection (2) of section 299.  This is to ensure that court appointed liquidators co-operate with the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It may seem unusual that we have to legislate for that, but we are told this procedure is not flowing smoothly enough.</P>

      <P>This is a new subsection. In a number of instances throughout the companies legislation, requirements are imposed on receivers and liquidators to make periodic reports in relation to the discharge of their functions under the Act.  For instance, every six months a receiver has to furnish to the registrar of companies an abstract giving details of the assets and so on of the company.  Separately, a liquidator of a company is required or can be directed by a court to report to the DPP any criminal offences committed by officers and members of a company prior to his appointment.  We intend to make it clear that names do not have to be given.  There is no requirement in the amendment to name names.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience with receivers and liquidators is that there is always a danger of assets being sold for a knock down price.  The liquidator is charged with the responsibility of getting the best price he or she can for the assets of the company in liquidation.  Nevertheless the practice is that once the secured creditors are looked after &mdash; the Revenue Commissioners, taxes outstanding to the State or financial institutions &mdash; there is a temptation on the part of the liquidators to forget about the unsecured creditors, especially those who put in the liquidators.</P>
      <P>We spoke at length about this when we were debating the retention of title and the preferential status of the Revenue Commissioners, but it is no harm to reiterate my sentiments on the matter.  I hope the Minister will think about the role of liquidators and receivers and that he can compel them in law to seek the best possible price for the assets of the company in liquidation.  It is a step in the right direction that liquidators have to file reports and abstracts of accounts in relation to their activities.  The shroud of secrecy surrounding liquidators and receivers will not exist in future.  That is a welcome development because no matter who buys a company in liquidation, there will be unsecured creditors lining up to get what is left at the end of the day, which is invariably very little, and liquidators and receivers are of ten accused of acting to the detriment of unsecured creditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is specifically laying it on the liquidators to report criminal offences if they come across them.  The Senator's comments deal with <Col N="2466" /> the general duties of liquidators.  A liquidator has a duty, if appointed by the court or by the creditors, to get the best possible deal for those creditors, or for the court acting for the people.  That is the duty of the liquidator and the receiver.  The accountancy profession have very strict codes of conduct when their members are appointed liquidators or receivers as to how the liquidation should be seen through and I have no reason to believe they are not seeing them through.</P>
      <P>The Senator will be aware that when we discussed an earlier part of the Bill we dealt with preferential creditors.  I undertook at that stage to have a very close look at what we might do about providing greater protection for the unsecured creditors by looking at the rather privileged position of the secured creditor.  We are still looking very closely at that and I hope we will be able to make some interesting moves on it.</P>
      <P>The liquidators, when appointed by the court, and in all cases, are subject to a review by the court.  If the court is not satisfied with a liquidator's performance, it can deal with the matter.  I know it often seems that liquidators sell things for knock down prices, but sometimes it is justified and sometimes it is not.  It depends on how astute the person is, and how astute the liquidator is, but I do not think this is a widespread practice.  Most liquidators and receivers act very responsibly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Liquidators should have certain qualifications and expertise because a company's assets are very often sold for knock down prices, particularly the fixtures and fittings.  I do not believe the majority of receivers have the necessary technical expertise to evaluate the fixtures and fittings in some very modern companies.  There should be some type of check on this because I have known if fixtures and fittings valued at £250,000 being sold for a knock down price of £20,000 or £25,000.  A lot of IDA money has been invested in these companies.  A team of experts should move in when a company goes into liquidation to evaluate <Col N="2467" /> the assets, particularly when there is a lot of State money invested in the company. They should investigate what parts of the company should be retained.</P>

      <P>I did not quite hear the Minister's response to Senator Hogan on the question of unsecured creditors.  I recall the Minister's commitment to examine the area but I did not quite understand the answer.  The Minister said he was looking at it with respect to something or other.  I would like to hear him expand on that.</P>
      <P>On the question of the receiver moving into a company, I would have thought that when a receiver is preparing to dispose of the property of a company he would bring in a valuer or somebody who could give a professional valuation of the assets.  I am very worried about that area because, one of the great developments in the &ldquo;Phoenix&rdquo; syndrome is that not only do the company set up next door but that they actually buy the fittings and fixtures of their previous company at the knock-down price.  I thought that had been stopped and was not possible now. The old Irish tradition is that you do not buy from the banks or creditors who close on the company and if they put the goods up for sale, then the competition would gracefully stand aside and let the previous owner buy the whole lot back at 10 per cent.  I want to be reassured that we are not walking ourselves into trouble and that a seemingly innocuous section could throw up these difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have wandered completely from section 112 which simply says that if a liquidator spots something he should report as a criminal offence, he reports it.  We have wandered into an area, which is really a role for auctioneers, as to what they can get for property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of value is a difficult area. Something that is valuable today because the business is a going concern may not be that valuable tomorrow if it is not a going concern.  A thriving factory on a nice site could be worth a fortune or, <Col N="2468" /> three days later, if suddenly it is noticed that it has not been doing well, it could be argued that it is not a good stand after all, and it must not have been a good stand because it was not doing so well. All of a sudden the value of that property plummets completely.  Whereas last week it was a very valuable property, now it is worth much less because the perception of the value of that property has changed and value at the end of the day is about perception.  That is why many people are frightened when the items on the balance sheet do not fetch what they are valued at on the balance sheet.  It depends on the circumstances of the sale.  Most liquidators and receivers will try to get the best possible price.  One of the difficult areas for them is that they cannot often pick their time; they have to move in order to satisfy the requirement of being a receiver or a liquidator.</P>
    <P>The Senator asked about preferential creditors.  All I am in a position to say about that is that I undertook at an earlier stage in this Bill to look at the question of preferential creditors being ahead of the ordinary creditors by definition and to see whether we might be able to improve the situation <i>vis-a-vis</i> the non-preferential creditor.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when examining the operation of the company, if, for instance, the receiver felt that part of the property of that company was sold at 10 per cent of the price, would that constitute something that would be reportable under this section?  If that were to be the case, I would agree with Senator Mulroy's view on valuations &mdash; that the value of an item is what it is worth on the market on a particular day.  We are talking about something that is worth £250,000 being sold for one-tenth of that <Col N="2469" /> money.  If that were to happen when the company is being wound up would that be a reportable offence under section 112?</P>

I dealt also with the question of value.  The only regret I would have in that area would be on the question of time.  Very often if a liquidator or a receiver could pick a different time to dispose of a property or an asset they could perhaps get a better price for it but because their first duty is to try to get the funds for the creditors, they very often have to go at it much more quickly than would otherwise be the case.  I am happy that in other parts of the Bill we have made provisions which will greatly improve that situation and if assets are being disposed of they can now be disposed of at a more orderly pace.  It is a question of pace of disposal, not the price that is actually achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical amendment which does not alter the substance of section 113 in any way.  Under the present Companies Acts, when a requirement is placed on a liquidator or receiver to make periodic returns of one kind or another, the section concerned also sets out the penalties that can be imposed on defaulters.  In the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1982, the maximum fines were increased to £250 in some cases and £500 in other cases.  Section 113 of this Bill increases the penalties for contraventions of these existing provisions in two ways: first, by introducing the possibility of conviction on indictment and, secondly, by increasing the actual levels of the maximum fines applicable.  The section does not specifically provide that these new penalties supersede the penalties which previously applied and the purpose of this amendment, therefore, is to do this.</P>

I want to know more about the process.  We would certainly be shooting ourselves in the foot if that were to be the case.  I want to be reassured on that issue, and that if the liquidator or receiver was not doing his or her job that it should not in any sense <Col N="2471" /> be a further cost on the creditors of the company.</P>

These new prohibitions are in addition to the existing disqualification of bodies corporate acting as liquidators.  When section 114 comes into force there will probably be some liquidators in the process of winding up companies who will be caught by the provisions of this section.  The question this raised in our minds was whether such liquidators should be forced to resign when it comes into effect as they would under subsection (3).  Our initial reaction was that they should but, having reflected on the matter, we felt that the greater good would be served by permitting existing liquidators to complete their assignments. Take a situation where a liquidation has been going on for two or three years.  If the liquidator involved in <Col N="2472" /> such a case found that he was suddenly disqualified by virtue of the provisions of the section, a new liquidator would have to be appointed and this could cause delay and, more important, add to the cost of the liquidation.  On balance, we consider the existing liquidators should be permitted to complete their assignments and that is what this amendment provides for.</P>

      <P>This is a technical consequential amendment arising from the fact that section 114 of the Bill inserts a new section 300A in the 1963 Act. <Col N="2473" /> Section 228G of the 1963 Act which contains general provisions in relation to liquidators provides that subject to section 300, the acts of a liquidator shall be valid notwithstanding any defects that may afterwards be discovered in his appointment or qualification.  Section 300 disqualifies a body corporate from being appointed as a liquidator.  However, section 114 of the Bill inserts a new section 300A into the Principal Act and adds to the people that are disqualified from being appointed as liquidator. Therefore it is necessary to amend the provisions of section 228G of the 1963 Act by including reference to the new section 300A now inserted and this amendment provides that accordingly.  In other words, it is a technical amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a fairly straightforward drafting amendment and has no bearing at all on the substance of section 115.  Section 115 inserts a new section 301A in the Principal Act.  It is therefore wrong to refer in that new section to the Principal Act itself. Amendment 168 would simply remove the unnecessary words of the Principal Act from the second line of subsection (5).  Again, it is a technical amendment.</P>

      <P>As regards the relationship, a parent, spouse, brother, sister or child, I can certainly see how they would be closely connected.  Are we being somewhat unfair to such people?  I know that blood is thicker than water. Are we saying in this section that even though they have a connection they can <Col N="2474" /> still be appointed?  Is it a disclosure or disqualification or both?  What precisely is meant by the representative of a creditor? Is it anybody who seeks to represent a creditor or is it somebody specific?</P>

It really is to ensure that the meetings are conducted in such a way as there is not too much manoeuvering.  If there are interests in a room pushing for a particular liquidator to be appointed, I want to make sure that any connection between the person being proposed and the people doing the pushing would be made known to the meeting.</P>

      <P>That is very healthy but it is unfortunate that we gave any examples because the minute you give examples it becomes almost exclusive to that group.  For instance, somebody who was employed by another company in the group or who had some connection with another company in the group might not be tied in terms of &ldquo;employed by or a partner of&rdquo;.  I would have preferred a more general statement.  I do not think this subsection is necessary.  It may be a case of making an assurance doubly sure but in a sense it actually confuses the issue.  The section would have been fine without the inclusion of subsection (3).  I do not think it is necessary to identify or to tie down the categories of people.  It does not add to the legislation because it was very clear at the beginning but I found that on reading the section I became confused towards the end of it.  I am worried that somebody who would be much more closely connected with the business of the company than, say, a brother, father, sister, mother or partner, would in effect be eligible to be proposed <Col N="2475" /> without any disclosure.  In other words, they could use the exclusions or the definitions as a way around not making a disclosure which might otherwise be appropriate.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that there is a disclosure clause in this section and that the previous section disqualifies a related person from being appointed as a liquidator.  All too often in the past in the case of a voluntary winding up the members of the company would appoint somebody who would dispose of the assets at way below their actual value, and in some cases dispose of them to another related member of the company. Therefore, this section is very necessary and the important point is that in the case of a voluntary winding up a company can appoint a liquidator of their choice provided he is independent and not related to another member of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, so far as I know, that is not true.  Let us tease this point put.  So far as I understand and interpret the section, the person does not need to be independent of the family or otherwise; he just needs to disclose that fact.  In other words, if a company are going to the wall and I am about to be proposed for the position of liquidator or receiver all I have to say is &ldquo;I want to make it clear to the meeting that the managing director is my brother&rdquo;.  I should like the Minister to clarify that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me clear this up because we are getting our wires crossed. Section 114 deals with the appointment of a liquidator and it lists the people who cannot be appointed as liquidators, for various reasons &mdash; a person who used to work for the company, parents, spouses and so on, except with the leave of the court.  Section 114 sets out the people who cannot be appointed as liquidator. Under existing legislation the only body ruled out is a body corporate.  This section <Col N="2476" /> spells out the people who cannot act as liquidators.</P>
      <P>Section 115 is an entirely different section.  There is a practice by creditors at their meetings, when they are going to appoint a liquidator, for those people who want the appointment to canvass for it and in that canvassing to ensure that they have their people and their creditors at the meeting.  I want to be sure that the people at the meeting are aware of which applicant for the post of liquidator has his representative creditors, for want of a better word, in the audience.  It really has nothing to do with the appointment of a liquidator as such; it just seeks to make known the fact that there is a connection between the proposed liquidator and a particular creditor at the meeting. In a way it is to sort of flush out who is canvassing for whom at a creditors' meeting.  They are entirely different sections.  Section 115 has nothing to do with the kind of people who cannot be appointed; it is purely to make the information available.</P>

It is like lawyers in the US who chase after ambulances to get a case.  We will have potential liquidators following struggling companies around in the hope that they might go bust so that they get the job of liquidator.  I believe the section is useful but I am still not clear about who a representative of a creditor will be.  Will it be anybody who is representing the interests of a creditor?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(6)  Where a person to whom this section applies was a director of another company on the relevant date, and that company had not, on that date, commenced business, he shall not act in any way, whether directly or indirectly, as a director of secretary of that company unless that company meets the requirements set out in subsection (5).&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we are starting a new Part of the Bill maybe I should reflect a little on what we are at and where we are going.</P>
      <P>We are entering into a Part of the Bill which deals with the question of restricting directors in insolvent companies and of disqualification.  With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, I should like to mention one or two matters in this regard.  The Senators will be aware that the Bill deals with a number of areas.  Part II of the Bill strengthens the provisions of existing legislation regarding the investigation of the affairs of a company.  Part III is designed to give us more disclosure. Part IV has been designed to give us the true ownership of a company and to flush out the nominee director of a business. The House will be aware that Part V of the Bill deals with insider trading and that we brought in very substantial penalties for those found guilty of insider trading.  Part VI of the Bill, which we have just dealt with, deals with the question of reckless trading and the setting up of that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part VII deals specifically with what we can call &ldquo;delinquent directors&rdquo; and its purpose is to ensure that no one will be allowed to be involved in the management of a company if he is not a fit person to be a director.  This Part of the <Col N="2478" /> Bill ensures that if you are not fit to be a director, you cannot become one.  It deals with the restrictions on the activities of directors and is really the kernel of this Bill.  That is why I took the liberty, with the Leas-Chathaoirleach's permission, of saying that this is a very important Part of the Bill in that it contains a number of very strong measures designed to curb abuses of the privilege of limited liability, abuses which are in danger of bringing the whole concept of limited liability into disrepute.  I will deal with these issues as we move into this Part.</P>
    <P>I want to summarise briefly the remaining Parts of this Bill.  Part VIII deals with receivers and is designed primarily to clarify the existing law in a number of respects.  Part IX of the Bill deals with the question of company rescue and the business of providing a mechanism to allow companies to have a kind of intensive care period so that they can get their act together.  We are now dealing with the Phoenix syndrome, the famous and most widely known abuse in company law where a company closes down Friday, opens up under a new name on Monday with nothing having changed, except perhaps the name over the door.  Therefore, the kernel of the Companies (No. 2) Bill which is now before the House is to tackle this outrageous abuse of the Phoenix syndrome, of pulling new companies out of the ashes of the old.  Senators will agree that this section tackles that abuse head on and is the kernel of this Companies (No. 2) Bill.  I just thought I would put that on the record at this stage to help focus both my mind and that of the House on it.</P>
    <P>I want to move on to Government amendments Nos, 169 and 177.  The purpose of amendment No. 169 is to ensure that the stringent requirements of section 117 cannot be avoided by the use of shelf companies.  It has come to our attention that company directors are being encouraged in the city, even before the Companies Bill comes into operation, to protect themselves from section 117 by setting up shelf companies now which can be used at a later stage if the company, with which a director is already involved <Col N="2479" /> goes into insolvent liquidation.  The section, as presently drafted, applies the capitalisation requirement to situations where a person who has been involved in an insolvent company begins to act as a director or otherwise in relation to another company.  It is clear, however, that if a person is already a director of a particular company before another company of which he is a director goes into insolvent liquidation, then the section as presently drafted could be avoided.  In seeking to close off this possible loophole we have been conscious of the danger of restricting the operations of a genuine director who is involved in two companies, one of which goes into insolvent liquidation.</P>
    <P>It is not our intention that section 117 should apply to the director in relation to the company which is solvent.  The formula which we have devised in amendment No. 169 therefore is to cover the type of situation where a director becomes aware that his company is in trouble and may become insolvent and in order to protect himself he incorporates another company of which he will be a director so that he can start up business again without being subject to the requirement of section 117.  It can be seen that without this provision our reference in dealing with this Phoenix syndrome could be thwarted quite legally by unscrupulous operators.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 177 which is related to amendment No. 169 ensures that the further restrictions relating to maintenance of capital contained in section 119 will apply also in the type of situations which I have just outlined.  Section 119 as presently drafted applies where a person begins to act or becomes involved in another company.  As with section 117 (4) it is necessary to amend section 119 to ensure that its provisions are not avoided by the use of shelf companies.</P>

      <P>There are times in the business of legislation &mdash; which appeals to me greatly at the best of times &mdash; when it is worth while being a legislator and this is one of those times.  I compliment the <Col N="2480" /> Minister and the drafters of this amendment for dealing with what was a blatant abuse.  It is worth making headlines about the fact that the Minister has taken on hand very promptly and responded very quickly to an untenable situation which was developing where people were advertising, selling and shelf companies were being bought for the express purpose of subverting what was intended by this legislation.</P>
      <P>I almost succeeded in being thrown out of this House one day by the Cathaoirleach when I attempted to raise this matter on the Order of Business as a reason for bringing the Companies Bill forward urgently.  I discussed it with the Minister and I compliment him on the way he has taken on board this matter and the way in which it was very efficiently drafted.  I cannot underline enough the importance I attach to this matter because this is what legislation is all about.  If this House means anything, this shows where it can be important.  This could not happen in the other House. The legislation is strengthened beyond measure.  Nothing else we have done today could strengthen it as much as this has done.  The proposal which I pushed to a vote was less important than this particular one.  This means in effect that all those dormant inactive companies lying on shelves all over the city are now no threat to this legislation.  I compliment the Minister and his team for bringing forward this legislation and it deserves recognition.</P>

      <P>I am moving this amendment on behalf of Senator Brendan Ryan who, unfortunately, cannot be here today.  It goes with the general thinking of this section that where justice is done, it should also be seen to be done.  The proposal here basically is that we should have a list to which we could refer.  It should be an easy operation, so that when the company goes into liquidation the information is at the disposal of the registrar and it should be quite easy to compile that list.  The last part of the amendment: &ldquo;and shall publish the list by whatever means he sees fit&rdquo; means to hold that list in the Companies Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>These three amendments are related.  I will deal with amendments Nos. 170 and 194 first.  I respectfully suggest that these amendments are unnecessary.  What the Senators are proposing will in effect happen.  Section 117 (6) (b) requires every liquidator of an insolvent company to give the registrar of companies the names of all present and recent directors <Col N="2482" /> of the company.  Secondly, section 132 (1)  provides that where the court makes a disqualification order or convicts a person of an offence which has the effect of that person being deemed to be subject to a disqualification order, the registrar of companies must be notified.</P>
      <P>Section 370 of the 1963 Act provides that any person may inspect any documents kept by the registrar on payment of the prescribed fee.  Therefore, any document sent to the registrar under section 117 or section 132 of the Bill will be available for inspection by the public in the Companies Registration Office. The registrar is required to keep this information indefinitely and not just in relation to companies wound up in the previous ten years.  This is because the provision in the 1963 Act which allows the registrar of companies to dispose of documents relates only to the dissolution of a company itself and not to any officer of the company.</P>
      <P>Part IX of the Bill, section 188, will allow the registrar to classify all the information he gets in any manner he thinks appropriate.  Thus, he might, for example, see the registrar compiling a list of all directors.  Such a list might well show those people who had been disqualified under Chapter 2 of Part VII of the Bill as well as directors of insolvent companies, details of whom had been sent to the registrar by liquidators under section 117.  Therefore, in all the circumstances I hope the Senators will accept that the 1963 Act together with sections 117, 132 and 188 of the Bill will cover what they are trying to achieve with these amendments.</P>
      <P>Related amendment No. 195 proposes that the Minister should be required to make regulations in relation to the specific register which Senator O'Toole wants to provide for and which is perhaps unnecessary.  It follows that if amendment No. 119, is unnecessary then amendment 195 is also.</P>

      <P>I am happy that the list is compiled.  Will the Minister explain somewhat further the access to that list? Who would have access?  How public or <Col N="2483" /> accessible is that information?  I certainly take the point that because of paragraphs (a) and (b) it is quite possible that the list has been put together.</P>
      <P>I made the point at an earlier stage of the Bill that these things should be retrospective for ten years, so here I am speaking against myself: what is the significance of them being available for longer than ten years?  Do they become a historical record at that point or do they have some significance in terms of either this legislation or the 1963 Act?</P>

      <P>Section 370 of the 1963 Act provides that any person may inspect the documents kept by the registrar of companies, on payment of such fee as may be fixed by the Minister.  That quite clearly allows any person to inspect the documents.  In regard to the ten years, I suppose it is important that they are there for as long as possible.  That makes sense.  I want to be careful regarding the amendments that the registrar may not necessarily have the list in the format the Senator was suggesting, but the information is available for anybody who wants to go after it.  It may not be available in list form but it would certainly be available on a company by company basis, or a specific request about a specific director or company will certainly get the information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 117 (7) which requires a liquidator of an insolvent company to inform the court where he is of the <Col N="2484" /> opinion that the interests of any other company will be jeopardised by the fact that a person who was a director of the insolvent company is involved in the management or formation of that other company. It can be seen from the wording of the section before us as presently drafted that the liquidator must be of the opinion that the interests of another company will be placed in jeopardy by the particular circumstances.  On reflection, we consider this to be a very heavy onus of proof on a liquidator and we are concerned that this could result in the liquidator not bringing proceedings where such would be desirable simply because it is not possible for him to establish that the interests of the company will, in fact, be jeopardised. Therefore, we are proposing to replace the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; by the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  This, we feel, will make the provision much more workable and will ensure that matters which should be brought to the attention of the court will, in fact, be brought.  I think that is a much more practical approach because if we leave &ldquo;will&rdquo; there we run the risk of it not being used.</P>

      <P>I want to ensure that the reference there is not ambiguous. Subsection (9) provides, as the Senator will see, that a person to whom section 117 applies, in other words a person who has been a director of an insolvent company, may apply to the court for relief. As drafted at present the application for relief will be from the requirements of subsection (5).  However, the requirements of subsection (5) are matters which apply to a company and not to the director himself.  It is really a matter of not being ambiguous about it.  What applies to the director concerned is the restriction imposed by subsection (4), in other words that he may not become involved with a company unless that company meets the requirements of subsection (5). I consider that the subsection would read better by virtue of amendment No. 173 and would better reflect the meaning intended, that is that a person may apply for relief from the restrictions referred to in subsection (4) of this section.  It is a drafting change which does not change the meaning of the section itself.</P>

      <P>The minimum paid up capital for a company where a restricted director is on the board will be £50,000 for a public company and £10,000 for a private company.  In subsection (9), line 42, I see the words &ldquo;just and equitable&rdquo;. This section provides for relief for a person or a director on whom a restriction has been placed.  The phrase &ldquo;just and equitable&rdquo; is a description or a directive for a judge.  Could we be more specific about &ldquo;just and equitable&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>I think the point the Senator is making <Col N="2486" /> could be made more aptly on the section when we come to deal with it.  We are dealing now with amendment No. 173.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 174:</P>
      <P>In page 101, lines 47 and 48, to delete paragraph (a), and substitute the following paragraph&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) to the liquidator (if any) of the company the insolvency of which caused him to be subject to this section;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is also a very straightforward drafting amendment.  It relates to section 117 (10) which provides that an applicant for relief under subsection (9) must give notice of his intention to apply for relief, first of all to the liquidator of the company of which he was formerly a director and, second, in the newspapers.  The purpose of the amendment is twofold.  First, in relation to the requirement to give notice to the liquidator, clearly there may be situations where no liquidator would be acting.  For example, the liquidation of the insolvent company may have been completed or simply no liquidator may be acting. Maybe he has resigned or died.  We consider it desirable, therefore, to make it clear that the requirement to notify the liquidator applies only if there is one acting.  Hence the inclusion by virtue of the amendment of the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo;.  I think that is a logical step.</P>
      <P>The second reason for the amendment is simply typographical.  The reference in paragraph (a) to &ldquo;the insolvency to which&rdquo; should, of course be &ldquo;the insolvency of which&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 175:</P>

      <P>On this section, it is appropriate to place on record that here we are restricting access to limited liability. For that reason it will be welcomed.

      <P>It is important that we are quite clear what we are doing in section 117.  It is the core of this Bill in many ways because people have been talking for years about this Phoenix syndrome, of companies going bust and starting up again the next day.  There is an important matter which has not been mentioned by anybody, although Senator Mulroy may have just touched on it.  It is simply that section 117, in effect, says that if you have been a director of a company that goes insolvent, you cannot start another company without a minimum share capital of £10,000 paid up in cash.  It is important that commentators and the business community, in particular, understand that.  In the case of a public company it is £50,000.  It is important that we focus on that and ensure that the business community are aware that that is quite a major step forward.</P>

      <P>There are just one or two points on which I would like some clarification.  Subsection (2) imposes certain restrictions.  Will these restrictions result in an exodus of non-executive directors from both commercial and semi-State companies?  Their expertise is <Col N="2488" /> particularly badly needed in the semi-State sector.  I wonder if they will continue to provide this type of public spirited service for which they get very little remuneration, when the consequences of these restrictions may have such a major effect on commercial life.  Would the Minister consider an exclusion clause for companies in which the State has a majority shareholding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know exactly what the Senator is getting at.  I suppose what the Senator is worried about is whether, in laying down these kinds of controls, it will be more difficult for people to become directors, particularly in State companies.  The answer is that I would think not.  Other countries also have very modern legislation like this and have no difficulty in recruiting directors.  In many ways it will make life simpler and clearer for directors who are serious about their business.  I would not envisage that directors would be hard to get as a result of this legislation or would be worried by it. Would-be directors of companies should be very aware of the new legislation and understand that there are additional responsibilities.</P>
      <P>There is additional exposure for many directors, but it is appropriate exposure. Honest, straightforward directors who do a good job and know their duties and responsibilities will have nothing to worry about in this legislation, once they are aware that it does lay certain new duties on them and are aware of those duties and do not regard the job of company director as just a handy sinecure.  We want them to take seriously the job of directing the affairs of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a non-executive director of a semi-State company, if that company go into liquidation, will he be prohibited from, say, becoming a director of a private company?  If, for example, there is some very good, professional person who would be a great asset to any company &mdash; maybe a small, indigenous company which need professional expertise &mdash; does it mean that the private company need to increase <Col N="2489" /> their share capital to have such a person on their board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important area that should be cleared up.  If you are a director of a company which go into liquidation, be it owned by the State or owned privately, and you want to become involved in another company afterwards &mdash; the next week, or next year, or immediately &mdash; if it is another public company then the share capital of that must be £50,000 paid up.  If it is a private company, it will be £10,000.  I think that the Senator is asking if a non-executive director of a State company which goes into or is put into liquidation by the Government of the day is left in the position where if he wants to start his own company the next week he has to come up with £10,000.  The legislation means that precisely and I would argue that that is a good thing.</P>
      <P>I do not think we can accept a notion that there are innocent directors.  If you are on the board of a company you have responsibilities to make sure the company is run properly.  If the company goes insolvent, we want to make sure that the next company you get involved in is, at least, properly capitalised.  The specified £10,000 for a private company, particularly in legislation today, is the minimum capital that a company would even dream of starting up with in modern circumstances. It does make life more difficult for directors of companies that go insolvent but the legislation is not necessarily geared towards making life easier for such directors.</P>

The Judiciary are the only people who could approach any attempt at deciding what is just and equitable. That is what the courts are for.  It is the best phraseology we could come up with and it also makes sense.  Even in layman's language it is reasonably obvious. I will not comment on the mood of the Judiciary on any particular day.</P>

      <P>On the issue, I take Senator Mulroy's point that it will certainly make directors more aware of their responsibilities.  It should be great relief for political parties in Government that perhaps they will not in future have people queueing up for nominations for directorships of various semi-State bodies when they realise that there is more involved than just warming the seat and claiming the expenses.</P>
      <P>It does what the Minister claims that it does, it makes people more responsible and more interested in their company. At the same time, it would be regrettable if it backfired on us to the extent of depriving the State of the expertise of people who could make a very practical input into developing State or semi-State industry.  The let-out of the application to the court would cover those cases that deserve to be covered.  I do not think there is a real danger of its being over-harshly implemented or of creating a difficulty. The fact that it does expose people more will make them more aware of their responsibilities.  That is probably a good thing.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this important section is to curb the abuses of public liability and to get rid of the cowboys who fold companies one day and open a new company another day.  All the legislation <Col N="2491" /> in the world would be useless if we did not have personal liability.  This section focuses on the individual directors becoming liable for the activities of the company going into liquidation, the activities of a company that recklessly traded or the activities of a company that fraudulently traded.</P>
      <P>The 1963 Act, in extending the scope of limited liability to companies, did so for perfectly good reasons but it certainly did not do so to flout the law.  The experience over the past 25 years has been the flouting of the status of limited liability, which has been a national scandal.  The deterrents here and the onerous responsibility placed on the directors to ensure that they know exactly what is going on in their company, together with the information now needed to be supplied by auditors, will certainly copperfasten the fact that directors will have to be on top of their job and know what the information in the company is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned in my Second Stage speech and earlier on Committee Stage my concern about community enterprise.  There are situations &mdash; Senator Mulroy touched on them &mdash; where communities might become involved in a FÁS funded scheme, might even seek to become directors or might wish to become directors to represent a community group on a particular private company to lend professional experience to the formation in the initial stages of that company.  I am thinking of people in the public service who, through their experience in local authorities or in the semi-State sector, lend their names now to being directors of a private company to assist a community enterprise project to get off the ground. Indiscretions could take place because of the nature of part time directorship.  One will not be absolutely familiar with the day to day management of the company. That will be left to the managing director and the people involved in the day to day running of the company.  We could infringe on a great resource in a community that might be essential to assist community enterprise.  I hope subsection (9) will ensure that the just and equitable <Col N="2492" /> phraseology mentioned in the subsection will allow people in that capacity who are there for bona fide reasons to assist people to create employment and will not be unfairly treated in the event of unscrupulous and reckless activity on the part of others in the company.</P>

What about the managing director who resists the winding up of the company, activates another company, moves sideways into another company, or begins trading under another title in some other way without winding up the company which cannot meet their liabilities? I did not get a chance to investigate how far the law could be pushed in that area but there must be room there for manoeuvrability where the law could be abused by the managing director of a company resisting the winding up by whatever means, activating another company and trading for quite some time in the sort of interregnum.  There could be a lacuna in the legislation.</P>

I would like to pose a question.  In section 113, for a similar type of offence, it says that on summary conviction there will be a fine not exceeding £1,000 and, for continued contravention, a daily default fine not exceeding £50.  Paragraph (b) says: &ldquo;on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £10,000 and, for continued contravention, to a daily default fine not exceeding £50.

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 118.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 176:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 176 is simply intended to ensure some consistency between sections 117 and 118. Section 118 applies the provisions of section 117 to receiverships.  The House will recall that section 117 imposes restrictions on a person who has been a director of a company which has gone into voluntary liquidation.  The principal requirement of that section is that any new company with which the person becomes involved should be properly capitalised.  I talked a while ago about that aspect of section 117, basically putting down the requirement for a private company to have a share capital of £10,000 fully paid up if a director becomes involved in it who had been a director of an insolvent company under section 117.  Section 118 provides that the provisions of section 117 will apply if it appears during the course of the receivership, as opposed to liquidation, that a company are unable to pay their debts. This section as drafted does not make it clear that in determining whether a company are able to pay their debts in receivership, contingent and prospective liabilities should be taken into account as they are in the winding up by virtue of section 117 (1).  It is important that this should be made clear as the ability or otherwise of a company to pay their <Col N="2494" /> debts, including their contingent and prospective liabilities, is a normal test of solvency of a company.</P>
      <P>Besides section 117, this test is used already in the 1963 Act in section 214 where one of the circumstances in which a company can be deemed to be unable to pay their debts is if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts the court shall take into account the contingent and prospective liabilities of the company.  What we are doing here is extending the idea of section 117 to receiverships because section 117 deals with the question of liquidations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That phrase appears in the accounting standards; it is well known in company legislation generally and covers the ability of a company to pay their present debts and their contingent and prospective liabilities.  It is not enough, in company law in determining solvency, just to be able to pay your existing debts.  If there are prospective or contingent debts, you would need to be able to meet those also.  There are debts and there are contingent liabilities &mdash; contingent on some event happening or contingent on some sale going through.  It is a well-established accountancy concept.  As well as being able to pay your debts you must be able to pay your contingent and prospective debts, debts which you can foresee in the normal course of business.  For example, you may have concluded a deal and it has not become a debt yet, but it will become one in three weeks time, and you are not sure exactly what the amount will be or on what date it will become a debt.  To include the contingent and the prospective debts of the company is an extension of the debt of a company.</P>

      <P>I understand contingent liability, but as regards the prospective liability, I am not clear that a company being wound up in receivership could have a prospective liability.  I am trying to think of an example where it could happen.  I am not arguing if there is a need for it, but it seems unnecessary. Can the Minister give me an example where it might come into operation?  In the winding up of a company by the receiver, are we adding to the liability of the company, which would appear to be one interpretation?  The contingent liabilities would be there from the time the receiver took over, but prospective liabilities would appear to develop while the company were being wound up.  By implication, it would appear that the receiver will worsen the situation by adding to the liabilities and debts.  I am worried about that.</P>

      <P>Debts are not just debts, they are debts plus contingent liabilities. I will give an example.  Say there was an insurance claim to be made against the company, but you are not sure when it will be made, for how much it will be or, whether there is possible litigation. You cannot ignore that because it is every bit as much a liability or debt as the debts in front of you.  You cannot stop the definition of debt at the debt that is actually incurred.  If you take that insurance case, that is a prospective liability or debt which may not have crystallised but you are aware of it.  Therefore when you are talking about debts you must include it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be a prospective debt but it is a current liability. If I am to take over the running of an insurance company, the liability is there. Say there is a a car accident in which four people are claiming against the company, <Col N="2496" /> that is a liability I have now and it becomes a prospective debt, not a prospective liability.  Maybe we are only arguing about words here but I am just trying to establish that I could not run up a new liability.  There is a difference between a liability and a debt.  One is liable for the debt, but the debt is prospective in the sense that the court case has not been heard yet and we do not know the exact amount involved, but I am aware of the liability now because it is on the company's books.  I have no difficulty with the word &ldquo;contingent&rdquo; because that is quite clear, but I am worried that a receiver could incur new liabilities. I am not talking about new debts; new debts I can understand.  As Senator Mulroy said, the lights have to be switched on every morning and the electricity bill will keep going up, but that is not a new liability as such.  I am worried about a prospective liability which means to me that your are now creating a new liability for the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the intention. The wording here is to include contingent and prospective liabilities in getting the overall picture of what the company may ultimately be responsible for.  Under this section a receiver would not be able to use it to run up further debts, but there is a separate discussion where a receiver in the normal course of managing the disposal of the assets would be entitled to run up certain debts, but that is not covered in this section.  This section attempts to make it clear that the debts are there at the start of the receivership &mdash; it is the time frame we need to get clear here &mdash; and we have to look at what contingent liabilities are there too.  There is a difference between debts and liabilities, and we could debate that, but ultimately both have to be met, The debt is probably more imminent and more immediate, but then some liabilities are also imminent and immediate and some are longer term and do not have to be met just now.  It would be nonsense just to take account at a particular date, say at the start of the receivership, of debts without taking account of, for <Col N="2497" /> example, an insurance claim that might be made, but it cannot be used, and would not be used, by a receiver to incur unusual new contingent liabilities other than those in the course of doing the receivership of the company.</P>

      <P>This amendment combines sections 120 and 121 of the Bill as it stands.  Our reason for doing this is that having examined these provisions further we decided that the two sections are very similar in a number of respects and that it would be better just to have one section.  There are, however, a number of problems in relation to the two sections as they stand and we are dealing with them in the amendment. Sections 120 and 121 are largely similar in that they set out the requirements in relation to the allotment of shares in the context of section 117 (5).  Section 120 deals with situations where shares are allotted without being fully paid up, while section 121 deals with the situation where shares are allotted without being fully paid for in cash.  It can be seen, therefore, that subsection (1) of each section is similar in a number of respects.  Furthermore subsection (4) of section 120 is the same as subsection (5) of section 121.</P>
      <P>What we are proposing is to combine these two sections, and in doing so try to iron out a number of other problems which we see with them.  For example, there is a reference in section 120 (1) and section 121 (1) to &ldquo;interest at the appropriate rate&rdquo;.  This however, is not defined.  We are introducing an appropriate definition in subsection (5) of the amendment.  Similarly, in section 120 (3) the term &ldquo;employees share scheme&rdquo; is not defined.  We are clarifying the situation in subsection (4) of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other important matters which we are seeking to rectify in this amendment.  First, the reference in both sections to &ldquo;contravention of section 117 by a company&rdquo; is inappropriate as there is no obligation imposed on a company under section 117.  We have, therefore, reworded this reference.  Thus, the reference in subsection (1) of the amendment will be to the allotment of the share which is not fully paid up as required by section 117 (5) (b).  The same change will <Col N="2500" /> be made in the new subsection (2) of the amendment.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are a number of provisions in section 121 which, on reflection are not appropriate.  These are subsections (2) to (4).  These provisions relate to contracts for the allotment of shares and the avoidance of certain variations in such contracts in certain circumstances. Having re-examined these provisions we are satisfied that they are not appropriate in the present context.</P>

On getting back to applying to the court for relief on the appointment of restricted directors, I understand that this request has to go before the High Court, which is expensive.

      <P>I have some difficulty with this section.  I am not clear in what circumstances it might be implemented or as to the necessity for it.  It seems to me that it puts undue pressure on a Minister to allow an out from the requirements of section 117.  Perhaps the Minister could explain the intention of it or the times when it might be implemented or the appropriateness of it in general to the legislation as we have discussed it.</P>

      <P>Any action would have to be cleared by the Oireachtas. There would be no question of the Minister doing it without coming to the Houses.  That is the first point.  Second, with regard to some of the figures mentioned in the Bill, time may show that they are inappropriately low and the Minister of the day may wish to amend the figures in the light of the circumstances of the day.  Again, they would have to go through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If you put figures into a Bill you must give the Minister of the day the power to come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas and have them altered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give any indication of how these figures would be amended?  I know it is a difficult question but if, for example, a company wants to employ a restricted director and, say, they evaluate the necessary share capital to qualify to employ this person, they would need to have some guarantee that in a month's time the paid up share capital would not be doubled or trebled.  Would it be index-linked or is there any means whereby the adjustment up or down would be just and equitable.</P>

      <P>I see the Senator's worry but there is no great cause for concern.  If I knew what the figure was going to be I would have put it in the Bill in the first place.  I do not know what the figure would be but the figure that is in <Col N="2502" /> the Bill is the figure that is appropriate for here and now.  The Minister of the day could change that figure when the time comes.  The figure we have now is sensible for today's conditions.  There is no question of it being jumped on the business community.  In all the orders that go before the House there is always a couple of months lead time, so a company will have time to adjust.  There would be no question of a company being asked, time and time again, to put in more and more money.</P>

      <P>I just want to clarify this.  I accept the Minister's argument on this.  There is a need to change the numbers in a Bill like this, by whatever means, when it becomes law.  I was more worried about the way it might be varied for an individual company.  Paragraph (c) of it includes the phrase &ldquo;contains such supplemental and transitional provisions&rdquo;. I do not mind &ldquo;supplemental&rdquo; because it has to imply in addition to the ones that are there already, but &ldquo;transitional&rdquo; worries me because it seems that the Minister may, as he thinks appropriate, make different provision for different cases.  I want to be reassured that that cannot be used for individual companies.  What does &ldquo;transitional&rdquo; mean in this sense?  If it just means from the old to the new I do not mind that either.  The difficulty I have condenses or distils itself to the line &ldquo;make different provision for different cases&rdquo;.  Could I have that expanded on?  At what stage or when will the Minister see fit to make different provision for different cases? Does &ldquo;cases&rdquo; in that sense mean a company or does it mean a type of company, or does it mean a generalised bit of legislation to deal with new circumstances as opposed to an individual company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;transitional&rdquo; would be where the Minister decided to increase the figure and decided that that would not come into effect, say, for three months.  There may be some transitional arrangements in getting from the old to the new and the Senator says he is satisfied with that.  That would be <Col N="2503" /> a typical transitional provision.  There is nothing deeper involved in it.  Incidentally, the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983 has, in section 19 (c), precisely the same wording as we have now in here so we have used section 19 (c) of that Act in the Bill.  That in itself does not make the case, but it is just to say that it is a reasonably standard sweeping-up clause. If it comes to the Minister's attention that there are difficulties in certain areas he can make an order to amend them.  The business of making orders is an old debate as to how much power it gives the Government of the day, but the orders must come to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is the standard response when a fear is expressed about what a Minister may put in an order, that it must come before the House for approval.</P>

      <P>We now come to deal with amendment No. 179.  Amendment No. 184 is consequential on amendment No. 179 and amendment No. 188 <Col N="2504" /> is related.  All three may be discussed together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 179:</P>
      <P>In page 104, to delete lines 36 and 37, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;disqualification order&rsquo; means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  an order under this Part that the person against whom the order is made shall not be appointed or act as an auditor, director or other officer, receiver, liquidator or examiner or be in any way, whether directly or indirectly, concerned or take part in the promotion, formation or management of any company, or</P>
      <P>(b)  an order under section 184 of the Principal Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of amendments Nos. 179 and 184 would simply be to shift the actual definition of &ldquo;disqualification order&rdquo; from section 125 (4) to section 124.  Section 124 is the definition section for Chapters 2 and 3 of Part VII and would seem to be the more appropriate section for fully defining what a &ldquo;disqualification order&rdquo; is.  We think that an amendment to section 125 (4) would have been required anyway because the definition contained in that subsection at present is expressed to apply for the purpose of section 125 only, whereas disqualification orders can be made under other sections also, for example, section 126 (4).  The third amendment, amendment No. 188, is related to amendments Nos. 179 and 184. It is not correct for section 125 (9) to refer to a disqualification order by virtue of this section since other sections in Part VII also allow such orders to be made, for example, section 126 (4).  The right expression therefore in section 125 (9) seems to be &ldquo;by virtue of this Part&rdquo; and amendment No. 188 makes this technical correction.  Therefore, what we are doing here is shifting it to where it belongs in the definition section.  It is a technical amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment and it arises in connection with the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in section 124.  The words we propose to delete here are a relic of an earlier draft of the Bill. We had not at that stage conceived the notion of mentioning &ldquo;shadow directors&rdquo; specifically throughout the Bill.  Therefore, our definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in section 124 of the earlier draft did not mention &ldquo;shadow directors&rdquo; specifically. However, the current text of section 124 does refer to &ldquo;shadow directors&rdquo; specifically so that the words &ldquo;or any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the company have been accustomed to act&rdquo; now appear to be tautological and should be removed.  That is what we are doing here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just wondering if it is tautological.  I remember asking on Second Stage what the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; was.  I asked a number of people what the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; was before coming across it in the legislation. I do not believe that the definition is contained in the Principal Act.  Perhaps it is but I could not find it.  I certainly would not be in favour of inserting additional words which might be totally unnecessary.  If I knew what was intended originally, perhaps I would understand better what we are now getting rid of. This is a very critical definition because the legislation refers to the officers of a company and if we go wrong in this particular one we will be found out in a very short space of time indeed when people will be able to insinuate themselves into a company without holding any of the officerships mentioned.  I am not clear on what is meant by a &ldquo;shadow <Col N="2506" /> director&rdquo; as it applies here.  Is this term defined earlier in the Bill as I am getting confused at this stage?  If it is not, what are we getting rid of in this section?  Who did this apply to before we began to use the term &ldquo;shadow director&rdquo; and what precisely does the term &ldquo;shadow director&rdquo; mean?  I know how it is used but does it have a legal definition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time we have used the term in legislation.  We cannot approach the reform of company law without bringing this concept into play because very often the people who would appear to control a company are not the ones who control the company. They are operating on someone's instructions. If the Senator looks at page 12 of the Bill he will see that the term &ldquo;shadow director&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 26 and if he moves on from there to section 26, on page 27, he will see that a shadow director is defined, subject to subsection (2), as a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of a company are accustomed to act shall be treated for the purposes of this Part as a director of the company unless the directors are accustomed so to act by reason only that they do so on advice given by him in a professional capacity.  This concept has been around since the 1963 Act.  It is just that we did not call them shadow directors.  This concept of someone behind the scenes issuing instructions has been around since the 1963 Act &mdash; somebody who was not obvious &mdash; but this is the first time we have put a title on them. The term is defined in section 26 of the Bill.  It did not seem necessary to mention it a second time in the section which we are now dealing with.</P>

Is there a possibility that the phrase was used to describe a shadow director and when we came to use the term &ldquo;shadow director&rdquo; we then got rid of the phrase?  If that is the case, we have covered it completely and I agree there is no point in retaining it.  Is that <Col N="2507" /> the logic behind it?  Can the Minister of State tell me whether there is any way of getting around it?  It seems to be very clear.  From reading what is stated on page 27 I can see what we are now deleting. In effect, we are not deleting it at all as it is contained in the legislation further back.  I accept that.</P>

      <P>While amendment No. 181 on the face of it, is straightforward, the background is a little complicated. Once a person has been disqualified under section 125 he is, under the present text of subsection (1) (a) disqualified from being a director of not only a company as defined in section 124 but of any body corporate; in other words, Companies Act companies, building societies and industrial and provident societies but not friendly societies.  There are inconsistencies in this approach and that is the reason for this amendment.</P>
      <P>The main inconsistency is that where a person is disqualified from being a director of a company he would also be disqualified from being a director of a building society or an industrial and provident society: for example, a cooperative or a credit union.  Building society legislation has its own disqualification provisions and I feel we should not overlap that legislation and section 125 of this Bill.  Amendment No. 181, therefore, makes it clear that an order under section 125 will disqualify the person concerned from being a director of any company or industrial and provident society.</P>

It says that it may make a disqualification order against a person for such period as it sees fit.</P>
    <P>I see the phrasing of the amendment as being somewhat clumsy but I am still proposing it.  In this amendment I am suggesting not only would the court see fit to propose a period of disqualification but that the person discredited would be liable for the outstanding debts in a new business venture or company he would set up.  I put the amendment forward as an excuse to debate a point.  I think the question of discharging one's debts or meeting one's liabilities is important.  I would like the court to have the discretion to make any person who is going to set up anew to be responsible for previous debts incurred and, therefore to be made liable for the discharge of those debts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand entirely the reasons behind the tabling of Senator O'Toole's amendment.  I know he feels strongly about this.  I am afraid, however, I have a basic problem with the amendment, both in principle and in practical terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To begin with, amendment No. 182 is clearly based on the philosophy that a person who has been involved in an insolvent company should repay the debts his company incurred before being allowed to start again.  However, it seems the underlying principle here is already provided for in those sections of the Bill which provide that a company director may be made personally liable for the company's debts in a whole range of circumstances. Thus, we have section 107 which allows for personal liability where a director has been a party to fraudulent or indeed reckless trading.  That section will allow a liquidator, creditor and so on <Col N="2510" /> to pursue a director personally for his company's debts in certain cases.  Indeed, where a director has been made personally liable in this way, the court can go on to make a disqualification order against him also.</P>
    <P>Section 117 of the Bill &mdash; which we have just dealt with &mdash; will apply to the type of case the Senator had in mind. Section 117 (7) refers to where the liquidator of an insolvent company thinks that the involvement of one of the directors concerned in another company, whether this is a new company or not, may put the interests of his creditors in jeopardy he must inform the court about this and the court can then make whatever order it thinks fit.  That provision is pitched in a deliberately wide way to allow flexibility to the court.  We are not restricting in any way the kind of order the court can make. I am not saying the court would make an order of personal liability against the director concerned under section 117 (7) but I could not rule it out either.</P>
    <P>A further problem with Senator O'Toole's amendment is that if a person were to automatically carry previous debts to a new company I would expect the creditors of the old company to go after the new one immediately.  The effect of this probably would plunge the new company into insolvency also.  There is also the problem that there would usually be more than one director of the old company involved here who might become involved in several different companies subsequently.  There would be considerable uncertainty as to which of these companies should carry the debts involved.</P>
    <P>I have stressed all through this debate that what I am after is balanced legislation, one that responds to the abuses we all know exist but in a considered and measured way.  This is true of Part VII as it is of other Parts of the Bill.  Thus, on the one hand we have section 117 which will restrict the right of anyone concerned in an insolvency to start up in business again without meeting a certain number of conditions.  This will ensure a degree of protection for the creditors of any new <Col N="2511" /> company the person concerned becomes involved with.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we have the strong measures in Chapters 2 and 3 of this Part which will deal severely with anyone who is disqualified by the courts from being a director and so on.  A person who is disqualified will effectively lose his livelihood, at least as far as being involved in company management is concerned.  I feel strongly, therefore, that the range of provisions we have go as far as is necessary or as is sensible in countering the abuses which we set out to tackle in the first place.</P>
    <P>What we are doing in a general way in sections 124 and 125 &mdash; and I want to make this clear as I did a few moments ago &mdash; that if a person is a director of an insolvent company, the new company has to have £10,000 start-up capital.  Equally, I want to make clear under this section we are putting into legislation that the court can disqualify a person for any period of time from being a director of a company.  That is a very strong power indeed to put into this legislation and one which we should not underestimate.  A person can actually be disqualified from being a director of a company.  I thank the Senator for his amendment but, unfortunately, I am not in a position to consider it.</P>

      <P>I am still not absolutely clear about this.  I will be referring back to parts of this in the next amendment. At this point it seems there is no reason why this discretion should not be allowed.  As the Minister says, under section 117 (7) with notification to the court it might be possible for a court to make such an order.  Does that mean that a court could order a person to take the liability with them?  Are we back to the question of personal liability?  I am not sure what the Minister was referring to but I am saying that one cannot walk away from the responsibility.</P>

      <P>There is plenty of scope in the Bill to make a director personally liable for the debts.  We have gone as far as we should go in regard to this and if we go any further we might as well dump the whole notion of limited liability.  That is something we do not want to do because it is a privilege which if respected is very valuable in business life.  We want to ensure that people who abuse that privilege answer for it.</P>
      <P>The question of personal liability will hang around the neck of the individual concerned but the Senator, in his amendment, wants that liability carried to the new business venture.  I am not sure if that was deliberate.  I presume that the words &ldquo;new business venture&rdquo; mean the new company and in view of that I do not think it makes sense to carry the debt to the new company.  There is a lot to be said for adopting our attitude under which a director can be held personally liable for the debts of the old company in a whole range of circumstances.  To go another step and say that they would have to be carried into a new company would, frankly, make a nonsense of the limited liability privilege.  It would mean that the debt would be carried from company to company with the result that the difficulties of one company would be carried on into another.  If there is a case to be answered the director can be made personally liable by the courts.  If we adopted the amendment we would be delivering a death blow to the whole notion of limited liability.</P>

I appreciate the Senator's concern in regard to this but his proposal would inhibit entrepreneurs and legitimate businessmen from starting a second time.</P>

      <P>I tabled that amendment a long time ago and before the House accepted other amendments to the Bill.  At the time I was very concerned about the matter and not disposed towards the privilege of limited liability. I accept that the changes in sections 105, 106 and 117 have tightened up the Bill considerably.  When I prepared the amendment I was determined to provoke a discussion on the matter but at this stage I accept that the House has made major changes to the Bill and that the issue of personal liability has been made clearer.  I accept that the question of criminal and civil liability has been tightened up.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention to threaten the concept of limited liability.  I was endeavouring to protect it at all stages.

      <P>I move amendment No. 183:</P>
      <P>In page 105, between lines 33 and 34, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  A person having been an officer of a company, declared insolvent or wound up without fully discharging its debts during the previous ten years, shall be required to make application to the court for a certificate of fitness prior to becoming an officer of any other company.  The applicant must satisfy the court that his conduct as a company officer previously does not make him unfit to be concerned in the management of this different company.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see subsection (2) coming into operation automatically after the Bill has been passed by both Houses.  Those who do not comply with the provisions in <Col N="2514" /> that subsection should be automatically disqualified.  In my amendment I am proposing that a person having been an officer of a company &mdash; at the time of framing the amendment I was trying to decide what an officer of a company might be and I am glad that has been clarified since &mdash; declared insolvent or wound-up without fully discharging its debts during the previous ten years should be required to make an application to the court for a certificate of fitness prior to becoming an officer of any other company.  In other words, a director of a company that has not fully discharged its debts should be required to seek a certificate of fitness from the court prior to becoming an officer of any other company.  In my amendment I am suggesting that the applicant must satisfy the court that his conduct as a company officer previously does not make him unfit to be concerned with a different company.</P>
    <P>My amendment is seeking to protect limited liability.  I have listened intently to what Senator Mulroy said about the need not to exclude people who were directors of a company which due to market forces or the usual risk taking in commercial life went to the wall.  We have never attempted to prevent those people starting up afresh.  When we were dealing with section 2 I pointed out that to become a bookie one had to apply for a certificate of fitness.  For the same reason a person who is a director of a company that fails should have to go through a similar procedure.  By coincidence the Killanin Report which we discussed earlier outlines the conditions necessary for qualifying for a bookmaker's licence.  It states that any person can qualify for a bookmaker's licence by applying to the relevant authority and on production of a certificate and the appropriate duty that person would receive a certificate of fitness from the appropriate authority.  In the case of bookies the superintendent may refuse to issue a certificate following which the applicant can appeal to the courts.  I do not see any reason for not having a similar provision in this Bill.  We can delete &ldquo;superintendent&rdquo; and insert <Col N="2515" />&ldquo;registrar&rdquo; or the appropriate authority. There should be an appeal process to the District Court.  That would not impose a huge cost on the appellant.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister accepts that this will not be a restriction on the person starting a new company and that it does not hit the honest director.  In fact, it would protect the honest person who is not guilty of fraud or did not intend to defraud but was a director of a company that became insolvent due to market forces.  In such circumstances it is most appropriate that such a person should apply to the courts, or the relevant authority, for a certificate of fitness prior to becoming an officer of any other company. The procedure will be simple because all information concerning the previous company will be available.  It will be easy to prepare a model.  I commend my amendment to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My biggest problem with the amendment is that it implies that if a person has been involved in an insolvency he or she is somehow guilty of something because otherwise he or she would not have to demonstrate his or her fitness to be a director again.  The theory about the person applying for a certificate of fitness, as it were, to be a director is one with which I have difficulty.  I have always been at great pains in this debate to stress that we should not regard involvement in an insolvent company as a crime, necessitating some form of absolution or, indeed, restitution.  All we are saying in the Bill is that if a person is involved in an insolvent company, any company with which he subsequently becomes involved should have to meet a number of conditions, mainly to do with his capitalisation, and we have dealt with that.  I am talking here mainly, of course, about section 117 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, we have already provided in the Bill for the type of cases where the director concerned is guilty of, for example, some form of improper or dishonest behaviour.  I am thinking here, first of section 117 (7) and (8) which between them require the liquidator of <Col N="2516" /> an insolvent company to report to the court cases where he thinks the involvement of a director concerned in any other company might jeopardise the interests of that other company or their creditors. In such cases we are giving the court a very wide discretion to make whatever order it thinks fit to meet the circumstances of any particular case.</P>
    <P>Section 125 (2) allows the court to have regard to a person's conduct while a director and it will enable the court to make a disqualification order against him, where it thinks his conduct makes him unfit to be involved in a company.  I should point out here that the court will not have to wait for a specific application to be made to it before being able to consider this.  Subsection (2) clearly allows the court to make a judgment on the matter, of its own motion, in any proceedings before it.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands already contains provisions which would deal adequately with cases where a director of an insolvent company was in some way culpable in connection with the insolvency.  More importantly, however, the Bill does not regard involvement in an insolvency as something implying guilt in itself.  I particularly would not want that to be the case.  In those circumstances I know what the Senator is trying to get at but I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole often says he is on the side of the Minister and I am certainly on the side of the Minister on this occasion.  I suppose that comes as no surprise in this debate.  If the two amendments which Senator O'Toole has proposed under section 125 are accepted we would run the risk of seriously undermining limited liability and preventing directors and entrepreneurs of becoming involved again in a new company.  The Bill has to maintain a balance, as the Minister rightly pointed out, in outlawing or trying to repel the people who trade indiscriminately, fraudulently and recklessly, without at the same time inhibiting people in the future from becoming involved again in the formation of a company which would assist job creation.  I <Col N="2517" /> know that my colleague, Senator O'Toole, would not want that to happen. He would be on the side of the risk taker and the entrepreneur in creating employment. The explanation given by the Minister satisfies me that the amendment proposed would cause a director to think twice about involvement in a future company formation.  For that reason I am against that amendment.</P>
      <P>With a certificate of fitness, while it might be appropriate in certain professions, in the case of a bookmaker, to take the example given by Senator O'Toole, the danger would be that he would be running the risk of having an each way bet rather than betting on the nose, as it were, in relation to the success or failure of the company.  I will have to back the winner in this case and not the one who is placed second, third or maybe at the tail of the field.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's explanation is quite acceptable.  Somebody has to initiate this process and the disqualification has to be arrived at through a particular process.  What I am suggesting here is that it should become practice that somebody who wants to set up again in business should approach the court.  Far from being an indictment of a person, if he happens to be a director of a company who become insolvent or were unable to discharge their debts or meet their liabilities, quite the opposite is the case.  What I am saying here is that such a person would be able to clear his or her name, because there is a stigma attached. There is a stigma attached to an unemployed person and, similarly, to a director of a failed company, quite incorrectly, inappropriately and unjustly.  The cowboys are certainly in the minority, we are all agreed on that.  This procedure would be a very simple process.  I am not putting forward the proposal as a big deal for something that would have to go through a major court hearing.  It is a process that could be dealt with outside of court.  The initiative would have to be taken by the <Col N="2518" /> potential director of the new company and I have proposed in the amendment the process that should be followed in order to achieve that.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that the Bill does not address the problem; I accept that it does, but what concerns me is the direction and the perspective of the method of address. The potential director should make the move to be accepted.  The Minister would say that this happens within the process in which the person's qualifications are determined.  It is a matter of perspective but I feel that people could slip the net as the Bill is published.  It would be impossible to slip the net if what I have proposed is accepted because each case would have to be looked at <i>de rigueur.</i> What I am proposing would strengthen the Bill and would not threaten the concept of limited liability, as Senator Hogan said.  It would certainly not add to any perception of a director of a failed company being seen as criminal or anything negative like that.  It would be a very simple way of clearing the person's name so that he could go on to the next business venture.  Everybody would understand that the people who were not allowed to set up in business again were those whom the court had felt were not appropriate people to be given that privilege of limited liability again.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to have to disagree with my colleague again on this matter.  I hope that this Bill, when it is finally enacted, will encourage people, legitimate bona fide business men, to get involved in business and create jobs.  Just because an entrepreneur fails on the first occasion, perhaps for legitimate reasons, I do not think he should be inhibited in this way, as this amendment suggests.  We are looking to this type of person to create jobs, and God knows jobs need to be created at this time.  If the owner of a company fails in business the first or second time, for legitimate reasons, he should not be inhibited in such a way as to have to apply for a special licence <Col N="2519" /> to start again and give employment to people.  There are adequate provisions in the Bill in other areas to deal with people who are trading in a fraudulent manner but the amendment does not specifically deal with company directors who have been trading fraudulently and for that reason I could not support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say to Senator O'Toole that I have a problem with this amendment.  The way the Senator explained it sounds sensible &mdash; a routine matter which would be almost rubber-stamped.  That certainly is the way the Senator envisages it but when that is stripped away we are really looking at a situation where you would have to apply to the High Court so that it can say whether you are a fit person to be a director of a company.  The simple fact that you have to apply to the High Court for a certificate of fitness almost suggests that because you are seeking a certificate which states that you are a fit person to be a company director, without which certificate or bit of paper you could not be a director, you would be approaching the court on the basis that up to that point you were not fit to be a director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the situation because limited liability is still enshrined in our legislation and if a company get into difficulties and the directors behave honestly there will be unpaid creditors. That is what insolvency means; either it is a crime or it is not.  If it is something that we totally deplore, why have limited liability at all?  If we do not provide for insolvent companies and unpaid creditors as part of our system, why have limited liability at all and why not face that squarely and say &ldquo;Let us not have limited liability&rdquo;?  If we are taking a decision to keep the privilege of limited liability surely that means that companies who will close down and leave people unpaid will have their personal assets protected from having to make that good.  That is what will occur but it does not mean that <Col N="2520" /> an honest director cannot go on into other business ventures.</P>
    <P>We have taken this route to ensure that the new business ventures which they go into are properly capitalised to minimise the risk of it happening a second time to those people.  Perhaps it is the Senator's intention to make it sound like a routine rubber-stamping mechanism where one has only to get a certificate but the way it would work here is that a director whose company goes into liquidation and, as envisaged under the legislation, where limited liability applies will have to go to court so that it can tell him that he is a fit person when, in fact, he would not have been shown to be unfit by virtue of the previous closure.  It raises very fundamental differences and the routine way in which the Senator believes it will work could, in fact, turn out to be a major event for a person who will have to apply to a court, with all the implications that that has about his or her fitness or unfitness. I have a real difficulty with the amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 185 is a drafting amendment to accommodate amendment No. 187.  I have very strong feelings on amendment No. 187 and I have referred to this every day we have discussed the Bill.</P>
      <P>We have had much discussion about employment and Senator Mulroy in his last contribution mentioned the need to create jobs, etc.  We must remember that every time a company go to the wall a number of employees become unemployed. Because they are unemployed we direct our sympathy towards them, and quite rightly so, and some people have various interests in those who are unemployed. Under section 125 (2) of this legislation an application may be made to the court that a person has been guilty of fraud, guilty of a breach of duty, or guilty of some action which would make him unfit to be concerned with the management of a company and the court may then disqualify that person.  We have agreed to that section and I have no difficulty with it.  I put down an amendment to strengthen the section but it was not accepted.  Nevertheless that is the section which will be in operation and we are now referring to the people who can make an application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;Let us make this legislation work; let us not complicate it and let us work the procedures that are written into it&rdquo;.  There is a procedure written into the legislation which can be initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions, or by any member, contributory, officer, receiver, liquidator, examiner or creditor of any company in relation to which the person who is the subject of the application is acting or is <Col N="2522" /> proposing to or being proposed to act as a promoter.  In other words, when the application is made by a member, contributory or creditor of the company, the court may require security.  What I am saying is that one group of people &mdash; the workforce &mdash; have invested a whole lifetime, their working life, present, future and very often past as well in a company.  They are dependent on the company and they also have access to information.  There has been a growing openness in this area, particularly with the growth of worker-directors and also with the continuing education by the trade union movement of its members to take more of an interest in the financial position of their company.  If a workforce believe that a director who is joining their company might be inappropriate, for whatever reasons, I do not think there is any reason why the trade union representing those workers cannot make an application to the court like the other persons mentioned in the section.</P>
    <P>As is stated in the section, the court would require security for all or some of the costs of the application.  That is fair enough and is all the more reason why the trade union, rather than a member of the workforce, should represent the workers.  It would be totally unfair to ask a member of the workforce to guarantee the costs of the court hearing or the application. The workforce should have clearly defined rights under this section and should have the power to make an application under subsection (2) in the same way as the other people mentioned in section 125 (5) (a) and (b).  This would require a very simple addition to the subsection, which I believe would strengthen it.  It would not take from the section and would not create any further pressure.  It could not be used for any frivolous reasons because people would have to pay the cost of the hearing or the application. I do not think it would be abused. It would not allow the frivolity and it certainly would allow people to put forward their point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2523" /> In this day and age industrial relations go far beyond employer-employee relations.  Industrial relations means taking an interest in the workings of the company, examining the risks the company are taking and looking very carefully at the direction the company are taking.  This is a natural progression of that type of development.  I commend the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole is proposing that a trade union should be given the right to apply to the court for a disqualification order under subsection (2) of section 125.  Section 125 deals with disqualifications generally.  Subsection (2) provides that the court may make a disqualification order against a person in certain circumstances on the basis of an application by the persons mentioned in subsection (5).  The circumstances &mdash; as we all know already &mdash; in which the court can make an order are listed in subsection (2), for example, where a person has been guilty of fraud in relation to a company and so on.  The persons who have been given the right to apply to the court for disqualification order are, first, the Director of Public Prosecutions, secondly, any member, contributor, officer, receiver, liquidator, examiner or creditor of a company.  While this may be considered to be a long list of potential applicants, nevertheless, if we examine it it is quite a restricted one.  Only those who would have particular knowledge in relation to the company or in relation to the person concerned would be entitled to make an application to the court.  The DPP must be given a right of application because there would clearly be circumstances where information would come into his possession, in the course of an examination by him of the activities either of a company or its officers, which would lead the DPP to consider the disqualification order should be made against an officer of a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the persons listed at <Col N="2524" /> paragraph (b) of subsection (5) &mdash; that is the people I have mentioned &mdash; these are all persons who by virtue of their particular position may have information regarding the activities of a director or other officer which could form the basis for an application for disqualification. For example, a receiver or liquidator of a company would have access to the books and records of a company in the exercise of his functions and might thus become aware of information which would lead him to believe that a disqualification order should be made against a particular officer.  Similarly an officer of a company will have regular contact with his fellow officers and maybe aware of certain activities of those fellow officers which will make them unfit to act a directors of a company.  Here again it seems appropriate that such a person should have a right to apply to the court for a disqualification order.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty in accepting Senator O'Toole's proposal that a trade union should also have a right of application. There is no way in which it can be said that a trade union has been directly affected by the activities of a director. Clearly the members of the trade union, who are employees of the company, may have been affected and in the case of an insolvency will very often be badly affected.  However, the employees have a right to apply to the court by virtue of the fact that they are probably creditors of the company in which the director has been involved &mdash; that is for moneys due to them.  I do not know if Senator O'Toole is aware that this is actually the case but I would point out that subsection (5) of section 125 gives the creditor the right to apply to the court for a disqualification order and an employee would be a creditor for this purpose.  I consider that this is the right way of approaching the problem, that is by giving an employee a right to apply to the court for a disqualification order.  Furthermore, there is nothing to stop a trade union from giving financial and other assistance to an employee, or <Col N="2525" /> group of employees, who wish to take such an action.  I do not, however, agree that the trade union who will not have been dirctly affected should have a right to apply and therefore I have difficulty with the section.  I cannot accept it.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to Senator O'Toole that there is a parallel on the other side of the corporate fence as it were.  We have not put in here, for example, that the FUE, the CII or some manager type representative organisations would have a right to apply but the people they represent, if they come within these categories, certainly would have a right to apply.  We have not put in the organisation that would represent creditors, for example, the Irish Trade Protection Association or the Federation of Trades Association or all the bodies that represent persons who have an interest but rather we have put the people themselves in.  That is a better approach than putting in the representative bodies.  If we go down that road we would then have to look at the other side of the fence where the Irish Trade Protection Association, the CII or the various organisations that represent mangement would have a right to apply to the court.  It is better to deal with the people who were directly affected and let them get whatever assistance and support they needed from their representative organisations in whatever way that organisation wants to assist them.  They can hold their hand throughout the entire application if they wish. That is the function of a represenative organisation.  We have not, for example, put in banks, the Revenue Commissioners or other kinds of creditors either.  We have put in the individuals who are affected rather than the organisation of which they are members or the category to which they belong.  It is a very specific approach.  It is not that I do not want to put in trade unions but rather I want to put in the people who are directly affected.  A member of a trade union might be directly affected but the trade <Col N="2526" /> union itself would not be affected.  That is the principle I will be following here.</P>

      <P>That is the basic point. I have put in &ldquo;a trade union&rdquo; in my proposed amendment and the Minister's argument has dealt with the fact that a trade union represents employees and that employees can be considered to be creditors.  They can only be considered to be creditors if they are owed money or if money is owed to them at the particular time.  There are plenty of examples where people lose their employment and who are paid all their wages and everything else they are owed.  Therefore, they do not come under this category and it is grossly unfair of the Minister to say that they do.  They do not.  Under no circumstances can &ldquo;creditor&rdquo; there be extended to cover the rights of employees.  If on the other hand the Minister accepts that employees should have that right and that they will now only be covered under the term &ldquo;creditor&rdquo;, then if they are not covered under the term &ldquo;creditor&rdquo; they must be covered in some other way and the only other way they can be covered is by having them included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the record I want to stress what a union is about.  A trade union is about representing its members and it is <Col N="2527" /> licensed under legislation to do so.  I was not at all proposing that a trade union be included there because a trade union might in some way be financially at a loss. I do not see how that would work except that it might lose members and lose subscriptions. That was not and is not my intention.  I am saying they should be there with the interests of the workers at heart in the same way as the DPP is there with the interests of the State of heart.  I did not include trade union under paragraph (b) because they are a specific group of people but I put it in as a new paragraph &mdash; the new paragraph being &ldquo;a trade union&rdquo;.  It is grossly unfair of the Minister to say that even if workers were creditors of the company, if they were owed money, they would have to initiate that process in the sense of highlighting and taking a stand on an individual worker or workers and also having to be personally liable for the cost of the application.  That is what a trade union is for, to represent its members' interests.</P>
    <P>Before we get down to discussing that point I want to make the point very clearly that the interests of the workforce are not covered as the subsection is now drafted.  I do not think it can be adequately covered by adding anything to paragraph (b) which deals with creditors, etc.  If the employee happens to be a creditor who can invoke or initiate the procedure under that section that is fair enough.  If they are not owed any money but they still feel a sense of civil and civic responsibility that this company officer should not participate in another company or if they wish to make that point publicly they should be entitled to make it.  As I said, they cannot do it for any frivolous reasons.  It is going to cost them too much.  They are not going to walk into this without being sure of a result at the end of the day.  It does not in any sense restrict the legislation.</P>
    <P>In terms of the Minister's response on the question of information, with all due respect an employee in a company might <Col N="2528" /> very often know far more about the books etc. than would a fellow director.  In many a company in this State the managing director's private secretary might know more about the workings of the company than anybody else in the whole company. It does not mean one has to be a fellow director to have the information to initiate this.  Therefore, the information argument does not stand up and neither does the argument of regular contact. Nobody has more regular contact with a company than the people working in it day in and day out.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;creditor&rdquo; does not cover the best interests of the employees.  While they may not be owed money, in order to make sure that there cannot be a repeat of what happened previously, they would wish to have a person disqualified. That is not covered there and that is why I propose it in paragraph (c).  Secondly, the area of information is critically important. An employee might have far more information than any of the people listed under paragraph (b).  Thirdly, on the question of regular contact, an employee will have every bit as much regular contact with a company and far more so than most directors.  Fourthly, the trade union would have to act responsibly in the way this legislation is now drawn up.  They could not initiate the process for frivolous reasons because it would cost them too much.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is in the best interests of the employee of the new company and of this legislation generally that we include here the right of the employee and the representatives of the employee and that the employee be represented by a duly legally recognised and licensed trade union.  For those reasons, anybody on the right or left of the political spectrum would agree to that.  Very often what happens in terms of industrial disputes and aggravation within companies occurs because there is not legal redress.  There is not a remedy available within the law to pursue the views and feelings of the members of the trade union.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2529" /> This is something which I feel very strongly about and have dealt with in any legislation that has come in here.  I have tried to demonstrate the need for a very clear recognition of industrial relations to meet the needs of the next century.  It is important that legal redress be available. We want to get away from the old-fashioned response of demonstration, strike and aggravation in the workplace. Let us use the instruments laid down by law in the same way as they have been used over the ages.  I think this would strengthen this legislation.  I do not see that it could be abused.  I do not see that it would be in any sense a threat to either the limited liability privilege or to the workings of the legislation, or that it would lead to any frivolity or any abuse of that section.  I am very committed to pursuing this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty at all with the idea of an employee being able to take an application.  That wording is not in that format but I will certainly consider putting it in.  I cannot accept the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; in this section for the reasons I have given. The Senator mentioned, for example, an individual employee bearing the cost and so on.  If a trade union wishes to help the individual employee, to pay the bills and stand behind him, carry the cost and advise him, that is perfectly all right, it is fine.  In the same way if the FUE wishes to help an officer of the company to make an application, then that is a decision for the FUE, the CII or whoever to make. They are not just picked at random.  I have no difficulty in making it clear.</P>
      <P>I take the Senator's point.  The way it is worded would indicate that the employee would have a say only if he was a creditor. The employee would have to be owed money before he would come in under the present wording.  I have no difficulty in trying to tidy that up to make it clear that I could accept an employee making an application.  I will give that very strong consideration to make it clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2530" /> I could not accept the proposal about the trade union because I would then be faced with the difficulty of putting representative groups into it.  Then I would have to think about the Revenue Commissioners, banks and other organisations particularly the Irish Trade Protection Association, for example, who legitimately represent creditors.  I do not want to give a right in the legislation to representative group; I want to make sure that they are individuals.  All these people mentioned are individuals, an officer, a receiver, a liquidator, the DPP, a creditor, an examiner, and we will strongly consider putting in the word &ldquo;employee&rdquo;.  However, the whole nature of the section would be changed if I put in &ldquo;trade union&rdquo;.  I would have to go back and look at all the bodies that hold the hands of all the other people listed here and see whether they should be put in.  I do not think it would make sense.</P>
    <P>There is no attempt here at all to undermine the legitimate role of the trade union movement in this whole area.  They are quite entitled to provide their normal services to the employee who has the information to come forward with that information.  It is far better that an individual employee with the information comes forward than if a trade union comes forward with that information.  It would be far better legislation for all of us if some one who has the information &mdash; whether the person be the DPP, an officer, a receiver, a liquidator or a creditor &mdash; is prepared to stand there in his personal capacity and say &ldquo;I have information which indicates that this person should not be a director&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken up wrongly in this, but that is why I do not want any more anonymous group to have the right to do it.  It is far better that an individual is prepared to put his or her name to it. One is taking quite a serious step.  One is asking the High Court of the land to disqualify a person, perhaps for many years, from being director of a company. One could ruin that whole person's future <Col N="2531" /> prospects in the country by simply taking that step.  It is important that anyone who is prepared to do it be a person, an individual who is named and stands there and says &ldquo;I have the information on that person&rdquo;.  I do not think it would be correct to allow the representative organisations of management, creditors or employees to step between the person with the information and the taking on of a person in court.  It is an individual he would be taking on; I think it should be an individual who takes on an individual in these circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with a number of points.  I do not believe, though I cannot prove it just now, that groups like the FUE and the creditors association have the same status and recognition as trade unions.  Trade unions are very closely and carefully licensed and there is legislation dealing with them from the 1906 Act through to the various industrial relations Acts of 1946 and 1947 to legislation through the early seventies. Their role is very clearly defined.  I make that point because it is not correct to say that the Director of Public Prosecutions is there as a person.  He is not there as a person.  He is there by virture of office and if another person were to be appointed in his place tomorrow, it would not effect the taking of the case.</P>
      <P>The other point that I would like to make very forcibly is that it is fine to say that somebody seeking the disqualification of an individual could ruin the person's future.  I accept that point, which is why I support the idea that the cost of the application has to be up front. It is a serious step that people should not lightly be allowed to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am regularly in the courts in my capacity in the trade union movement, with members of my teachers' union who are daily nominated in cases of schoolyard or school accidents by virtue of the fact that the lawyer wishes to tie in the teacher, the principal and everybody <Col N="2532" /> else.  There is nothing as threatening to an ordinary member of the public as to be at the centre of a court action.  That is so for two reasons.  First, I recognise that a person's future can be ruined.  I know of instances of people having nervous breakdowns simply because they were named in a court action.  They are named only by virtue of their office.  They happened to be teachers.  They were not being held personally responsible but legally they were the persons named.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for an individual to initiate this type of action.  It is not something that people are comfortable with. Therefore, it is something which will be done with more consideration by a trade union.  Trade unions are not going to rush into court; they will go to court only if it is necessary.  Conversely, if we are worried about somebody being taken to court whose future could be threatened, an individual with a grudge, or a gripe, someone who is prepared to lose all in order to try to ruin somebody else, is far more likely to initiate such an action than a trade union which have to get the agreement of their national executive before taking such a step.  The fail-safes that I am talking about here are important. They are important from the point of view of the Minister's argument.</P>
    <P>I want to hear more about his view that he could include &ldquo;employee&rdquo; in the list in paragraph (b).  It is my view that it does not fit in with that paragraph.  The other people listed there are in a particular category.  I did not amend this section for the reason that I felt it would be more appropriate somewhere else. However, there is no reason why &ldquo;employee&rdquo; could not be included there, although it is somebody with a somewhat different interest.  If the Minister were prepared to say that it was his view that &ldquo;employee&rdquo; might be included on Report Stage, subject to an examination between now and then, I would certainly accept that point.  At that point I will have done a much more detailed examination of the <Col N="2533" /> role and recognition of the various other groups that he talked about.</P>
    <P>It would be totally unnecessary to mention, for instance, banks and various other groups.  They are definitely covered by &ldquo;creditor&rdquo;.  What I will be looking at is whether or not it would mean the inclusion of the FUE.  I hold no brief for the FUE, but that does not mean that I disapprove of their existence; I do not.  I like to have strong people at the other side of the table.  It makes negotiation easier.</P>
    <P>We should look very closely at this. We can agree on a number of things. There is not going to be abuse of this section by representative groups whatever about individuals abusing it.  We have agreed now that employees have particular and genuine rights here.  The Minister, for two reasons, does not wish to include trade unions.  One reason is that he does not wish to include representative groups because the list might become too long.  That deserves looking at.  If it just makes the legislation cumbersome. I would be prepared to listen to that argument.  Paragraph (c) covers that and if it means the inclusion of the FUE, so be it.  I do not think the FUE will run madly into court cases in order to seek the disqualification of directors at major cost to themselves if they do not have a very strong case to put forward.</P>
    <P>I cannot see anybody's interest being served by the abuse of this section.  Anybody who abuses it will pay the price, will look a fool for having lost it and will have to pay the costs.  There is far less danger of its being abused by a representative group or somebody with some kind of administrative or representative role.  I add that to my previous arguments that employees will have information about the company, will know the workings and the interaction between themselves and the director, between the director and the company, or whatever.  This does strengthen the legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a need to start building up a body of what I would call industrial <Col N="2534" /> relations law.  Instead of people taking measures like industrial action, demonstrations and sit-ins and all the other things people do by virtue of frustration, we should be presenting remedies in law for people who have a clear grievance and that grievance should be processed through a process of law which is acceptable all round.  It would show commitment to sorting it out from a new perspective.  I am not in any sense doubting the Minister's commitment to good legislation.  I do not for a moment think that this objection to my proposal is to protect any particular group.  His argument has been that it would make the legislation more cumbersome, but I cannot accept that argument.  I believe that there is a very strong case for the point that I make.  I ask the Minister to reconsider and to respond on the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make a brief contribution. My personal hope is that, when this legislation goes through both Houses of the Oireachtas, it will act as an instrument which will encourage people to become involved in setting up new businesses and creating jobs.  I accept that we in Ireland are very lucky that our trade union movement is a very responsible organisation.  We must bear in mind that the first thing any prospective international company thinking of setting up here will request from the IDA is a copy of this legislation.  The case could be made that in other countries the trade union movement is not as responsbile as it is in Ireland.  I am afraid that, if we go along with this amendment, it might in some way inhibit international companies from coming here, companies that perhaps have had bad experiences in their own countries and that do not realise that we have here such a responsible trade union movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make something clear to Senator O'Toole.  My argument is not that it is cumbersome.  There <Col N="2535" /> would not be this difference between us if it were as simple as that, because that is something that one could tidy up.  The argument here is that we are giving this privilege to specific people who have a direct interface with the area.  It is a deliberate decision not to extend that net to the represenatitive associations of which these particular individuals might be members It is not law designed to promote industrial relations.  It is law to reform company legislation and the people who deal with the companies, the usual people like creditors, the officers of the company, the employees and the individuals who deal with the companies. If this was legislation dealing with industrial relations I would have an entirely different argument and could readily accept the legitimate role of representative organisations in industrial relations legislation but in company legislation it is not needed.</P>
      <P>There is a principle involved here, that if an individual is taken to the High Court with the proposition being put to the court that he or she be disqualified for being a director of a company in the future, it is important that there is a named person. In that context the DPP is a person you can put a name on, albeit an office holder, but you can still put a name on him so that the person on the other side of the charge is not a representative association who can hide behind that representative association cloak.  It is far healthier that if an individual is being taken in, that an individual faces them.  I could not really accept the argument that that is difficult for an individual.  If it is difficult for the individual taking the case, think how much more difficult it must be for the person who is being charged with the fact that he or she should be disqualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Senator is interested in putting down an amendment on Report Stage to include in a neat way the point he wants to make about employees being in the list, I will certainly have a very close look at it but I have to hold the line on the <Col N="2536" /> inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; purely for the reasons that I have outlined to the Senator.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for what he said and it would probably be more appropriate for me to put down an amendment on Report Stage encompassing the ideas we have just discussed. I want to clarify one point.  Of course I am quite clear that it is not industrial relations legislation and I do not intend it to be that.  I said from the very beginning that one of the interested parties &mdash; I have been quite consistent on this issue from Second Stage &mdash; the employees, were interested parties right the way through.  If you accept the employees being the interested parties and if you would be well disposed towards accepting that, I would have to be disposed to withdrawing the proposal that it should be a trade union and to go along with the view that it should be the employee.  I take the argument that there should be a named person on both sides and that people should not be able to hide.  That was never my intention.  I will table an amendment on Report Stage and I hope I do not have to go through all these arguments in late September.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response and hope that the legislation, if passed, will be useful to the trade union movement and will help the setting up of companies in the future.  We need precise legislation which works in everybody's interest.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 186:</P>
      <P>In page 106, lines 4 to 8, to delete paragraph (b), and substitute the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) any member, contributory, officer, receiver, liquidator, examiner or creditor of any company in relation to which the person who is the subject of the application&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 186 makes two distinct changes to the existing text of section 125, (5) (b).  The wording of the existing section 125 (5) (b) is incomplete since it makes no mention of a person who is, in the words of section 125 (1) (a), concerned or taking part in the formation or management of a company. The amendment would rectify this by including these words in the subsection. The effect will be that, where a person was proposing to be involved in the formation or management of a company, any member, creditor and so on of the company concerned could apply to the court for a disqualification order in respect of that person.</P>
      <P>The second problem with subsection (5) (b) is that the various people mentioned in it who could apply for a disqualification order can only do so on the basis that the person concerned was already acting in a company of which they were members, creditors or otherwise. Subsection (5) (b) as drafted takes no account of cases where a creditor might want to apply to the court to have a person disqualified on the basis of his previous conduct in a company even if he was no longer acting in relation to that company.  The amendment would rectify this particular problem too by making a person's previous involvement with the company a ground for making the application to the court under subsection (5) (b).</P>

    <P>&ldquo;126.&mdash;(1)  Any person who, in relation to any company, acts in a manner or capacity which, by virtue of being a person to whom section 117 applies or being subject or deemed to be subject to a disqualification order, he is prohibited from doing shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a person is convicted of an offence under subsection (1) he shall be deemed to be subject to a disqualification order from the date of such conviction if he was not, or was not deemed to be, subject to such an order on that date.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a person convicted of an offence under subsection (1) was subject, or deemed to be subject, to a disqualification order immediately prior to the date of such conviction, the period for which he was disqualified shall be extended for a further period of ten years from such date, or such other further period as the court, on the application of the prosecutor and having regard to all the circumstances of the case, may order.</P>

    <P>(b)  it appears to the liquidator of the first-mentioned company that that company is, at the date of commencement of its winding-up or at any time during the course of its winding-up, unable to pay its debts; the liquidator shall report those matters to the court and the court, on receiving the report and if it considers it proper to do so, may make a disqualification order against that person for such period as it thinks fit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of problems with section 126 and amendment No. 189 takes the approach of solving them by replacing the entire section rather than by making several piecemeal amendments.  It might be more convenient if I took each subsection of the proposed new section, one by one, and explained the changes.  There is no problem in relation to subsections (1) and (2). These are the same as section 126 (1) and (2) respectively of the Bill as it stands. Subsection (3) of the amendment is new and this would fill a gap which seems to exist in the current text of section 126. The present subsection (2) provides that where a person to whom section 117 applies, in other words a restricted person, acts while restricted, he will then become subject to an outright disqualification order.  However, we have no such further sanction where a person who has already been disqualified under Part VII acts while disqualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2540" /> The new subsection (3) will provide that, in such a case, the person concerned will have his existing disqualification order extended for a further ten years or whatever other period the prosecutor in the case applied for.  Subsection (4) would replace the existing subsection (3) and solve the following problems with that subsection.  First and most important, subsection (3) bars a person convicted of an offence under subsection (1) from seeking relief for ten years after the conviction. However, the court might, in some cases, disqualify a person for only five years.  In such a case barring him from looking for relief for ten years seems meaningless.  So it seems preferable simply to bar a person convicted under section 126 (1) of acting while disqualified from looking for relief for the duration of this disqualification order and that is what subsection (4) of the amendment does.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) would replace the present section 126 (4) and make two amendments.  The first of these amendments is to the last two lines of the subsection. The problem with the existing provision is that, while it allows the court to make a disqualification order in the circumstances described in the subsection, it makes no reference to the period for which the court may make the order.  The new subsection (5) would rectify this by allowing the court to decide on the period of disqualification in this case.  The second amendment in subsection (5) is also a simple one.  Paragraph (a) of the subsection currently provides that where a person to whom section 117 applies becomes involved in a second company insolvency within 20 years after the first one, the liquidator must report the matter of the court which can them make an outright disqualification order against him.  It is this period of 20 years that is the problem.</P>
    <P>First, it would be very difficult for a liquidator to go back this far to establish whether any director of a company through a liquidation was involved in the <Col N="2541" /> previous insolvency up to 20 years before. More important, however, our view on whether being involved in two insolvencies in 20 years was a matter which ought to expose the person concerned to disqualification from being a director is that it should not.  What we are after in the Bill is some balance.  On the one hand, we have section 117 which imposes certain modest conditions on a person who has been involved in an insolvent company and, on the other hand, we have the severe sanction of outright disqualification under section 125 where a person is being shown to a court to be unfit to be a company director.</P>
    <P>The problem is that, with the best will in the world, a person could still be involved in two insolvencies over a lengthy period like 20 years and I do not think that should lead to him being disqualified. For that reason, we are putting forward this figure of five years.  In subsection (6) of the new section we will be making one minor consequential amendment because we will be adding an extra subsection to the section.  The correct reference in the first line of the subsection will be to subsection (5).</P>
    <P>To summarise, what we are saying is that we have identified certain problems with the practicalities of section 126. Rather than take care of them by making piecemeal amendments to the section, we thought it was preferable to replace the whole section with what we think is a more complete and workable provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this as an improvement.  The wording of the original Bill was very weak and people who acted in blatant contravention of the law seemed to be getting off very lightly.  I welcome this as a tightening up of that arrangement.  One of the difficulties about keeping lists is that we look upon them as being very difficult to trace.  A computer does not age, and if lists are fed into a computer, it does not matter how much time has elapsed &mdash; whether it is 20 years, 100 years, one year or six <Col N="2542" /> months &mdash; because the computer will give the name if somebody asks if a certain person was involved in insolvencies.  I do not see any great difficulty there but that is not central to this legislation.</P>
      <P>Where a person is convicted of an offence under subsection (1) the period of disqualification shall be extended &mdash; I wonder if that is enough.  Should there be a fine as well?  It seems weak following the other issues we have been discussing and I am not sure that it follows naturally. What happens if the person involved refuses to take any notice, is in contravention of the legislation and does not fulfil the requirments?  One could keep extending the period of disqualification to 100 years.</P>

      <P>The fine could apply because section 184 deals with offences. Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>(a)  On summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both, or</P>
      <P>(b)  On conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.</P>
      <P>If there was an offence under this legislation, this would be applicable because it would be an offence.  The fine is there if there is an offence.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;128.&mdash;Where a person is, as a <Col N="2543" /> consequence of his conviction of an offence under this Chapter, deemed to be subject to a disqualification order, he shall be deemed to be so subject for a period of five years from the date of such conviction or such other period as the court, on the application of the prosecutor and having regard to all the circumstances of the case, may order&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new section which will fill a gap which seems to exist in Chapter 3 of Part VII.  There seems to be the difficulty where a person is, following conviction of certain offences under Chapter 3, deemed to be subject to a disqualification order, and no provision exists for determining how long the order should run.  The sections of Chapter 3 involved are section 126 (2) and section 129 (2) which we are introducing by way of amendment No. 189, and section 133 (2) which we are introducing by way of amendment No. 196.  The new section 129 we are proposing to insert will fill this gap by providing that the period of disqualification in such cases should be five years from the date of the conviction which resulted in his being deemed to be subject to an order, or such other period as the court, on the application of the prosecutor and having regard to all the circumstances of the case, may order. This idea is already contained in section 125 (1) and all we are doing here is extending it to cases where, by virtue of certain provisions in Part VII a person would be deemed to be subject to a disqualification order.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 191:</P>
    <P>In page 108, between lines 33 and 34, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) Where a company which has received a notification under section 119 (6) and which carries on business following such notification without the requirements of section 117 (5) being fulfilled within a reasonable period&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  is subsequently wound up, and</P>
    <P>(b)  is at the time of the commencement of the winding-up unable to pay its debts (taking into account the contingent and prospective liabilities),</P>
    <P>the court may, on the application of the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of the company, declare that any person who was an officer of the company while the company so carried on business and who knew or ought to have known that the company had been so notified shall be personally responsible, without any limitation of liability, for all or any part of the debts <Col N="2545" /> or other liabilities of the company as the court may direct.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to close what I see as a gap in the operation of section 117 which provides that a person who has been a director of an insolvent company cannot be involved in the management, etc. of another company, unless that company has the minimum paid up share capital of £10,000 as a private company, or £50,000 as a public company.  That is laid down in section 117 (5).  If a person acts in contravention of these requirements he commits an offence under section 126.  There is, however, nothing in the Bill at present which prevents the company, as opposed to the person, from carrying on business without the capitalisation requirements of section 117 (5) being fulfilled, although failure by a company to comply with the further requirements of section 119 is an offence under the relevant 1983 legislation, provided the company has been notified by the director of his status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On reflection, I considered that if a company has been informed by one of its directors that he was previously involved in a company which went into liquidation, the capitalisation requirements of section 117 therefore apply, and that the company should be subject to strict sanctions if it continues to trade without being properly capitalised.  What I am proposing in amendment No. 191 is that where a company has been informed, as required, by the director but continues to trade regardless, if the company subsequently goes into insolvent liquidation, any officer of the company who knew, or should have known, that the company had been notified, will be held personally liable for the debts of the company to the extent determined by the court.  We are proposing the aplication for the imposition of liability may be made to the court by the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of the company.  This amendment plugs a gap which we have identified with the enforcement of section <Col N="2546" /> 117 of the Bill, which is to ensure that companies are properly capitalised if they involve directors who have previously been involved in a company which became insolvent.</P>

      <P>I certainly welcome this.  It very definitely tightens up on section 117.  I particularly welcome the reiteration on the question of personal responsibility and liability for debts incurred.  It makes it much stronger and closes a very clear loophole.  I have some difficulty with the section which I will refer to when we discuss it but I certainly support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 128 (2) refers to a person convicted of an offence under section 126, that is a person who is continuing to be an officer of a company, despite the fact that he or she should not be.  The section very worthily proposes that in that case the person so acting <i>ultra vires</i> the law would be personally liable for the debts of the company incurred in the period in question.  I am not sure how that can be implemented.  Does it mean the debts of a company which cannot be met or discharged?  As drafted, it means that a person can now be a director of a company which was trading profitably, correctly and legally in every way except for the fact that a director who should not be a director because he is in fact disqualified is acting as such. During that period certain debts could be incurred which would not throw the company into jeopardy or threaten it. In what way is that director to be held responsible for debts incurred during, that period?  How are those debts measured? Is the day to day trading of a company taken into account?  Would bills be considered to be debts during the normal period that elapses before they are paid <Col N="2547" /> in this particular case?  Are we talking about any particular liabilities, and does it refer to the discharge of any particular debts?  How, in fact, will that operate in a company situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very strong clause.  Normally if somebody is owned money by a company, they would have the option of suing the company because one could not sue an individual director in the present situation, but if somebody in that company who is disqualified from doing so is acting as a director, one could also sue that individual for all the debts of that company.  In other words, it removes limited liability from the company to the extent that that director who should not be acting is involved.  He is, in effect, ignoring the legislation and, perhaps, the wishes of the court.  Whereas at the moment one could just sue the company for a debt but not an individual director one could in this case sue both the company and the individual who would not have limited liability.  That is how it would work in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, it only applies to debts which are not discharged. It need not necessarily be an imposition on the person who acted <i>ultra vires</i> the regulations.  If, in effect, the company was trading legally, profitably and without problems in fact it would not then create any problems for that particular person.  I want to establish that point first it is a pity, but it may well be the case. Perhaps the Minister would explain that. I am wondering if there is any difference between a debt and a liability.  I am sorry to have to raise this issue again.  Let us take for instance, a case where there is court action for negligence or public liability or something of that sort against a company.  Would it mean something then?  For instance, if a company director were then to be operating totally without a net, could we charge not just the company but those directors who should not <Col N="2548" /> be acting as directors or who were subject to disqualification?  How would that work?  Let us say that the period about which we are talking is a period during the year 1987 during which time an accident takes place in the work place, and the case comes to court in 1990.  At that particular period everything has been put in order and we are back in operation again.  Where does that leave us?  Let me underline what I am saying.  Let us say an accident takes place during a time when a director who was, in fact, disqualified from doing so was acting as a director but the case does not come to court until three years later, by which time the whole issue has been regularised. Could the case be taken against the person who was acting as director at that time?  Would he be personally liable at the time the case is heard?  That is one point.  I recognise there are other sections under which such a person would be caught, but am I right in saying that if a company did not run into difficulty under this section the director would be home free?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me start by saying that the Senator has raised something here that leads me to the conclusion that I am not happy with our own drafting.  I do not think it captures precisely what I want to capture.  We will certainly look very closely at a redrafting of that.  What I want to do is to make sure that anybody who flouts the law we have here and acts, either as a disqualified director or having been involved in an insolvent company previously, without the necessary capitalisation, is discouraged from disobeying this piece of legislation.  That is what I want to get at, and a great way to do that is to make sure that if they start to operate again in a limited liability circumstance, that is removed from them without necessarily removing it from the company. That person who starts to do business again does not have the cover of legal liability and they personally can be <Col N="2549" /> taken to court for the continuing outstanding debts.  The best way to crystalise that is to put oneself in the position of a creditor who might want to sue the company for his or her money.  Under this they would be able to sue the individual for money which the company owes them, because that individual should not be there in the first place and, therefore, does not have the protection of limited liability.  That is a long way of saying it but that is what I want to achieve. I think the Senator is right and I thank him for highlighting it.  The wording as it is there does not quite get that and we will certainly try to get a better wording for it as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I think that is covered in section 122 to the extent that if there is a section 117 person involved in a new company without the company knowing it, the company could go to court and get relief from that.  But then there are other sections which cover the area where the company would not be aware.  In general the company can get relief if they take on board a person who should not be there because of section 117.  I think that covers the point about which the Senator is worried.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given an indication, and I agree totally with his thinking on this, that what we are talking about is removing the concept and privilege of limited liability from those who are flouting the law, who are acting <i>ultra vires</i> and who should be disqualified.  It is not very elegantly put in the section and it is not clear.  I presume that what the Minister of State is saying is that he will redraft the section before Report <Col N="2550" /> Stage.

      <P>I received notice from Senator Murphy that he proposes to raise the following matter on the Adjournment of the House:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clarify the Government's attitude to the Mawhinney proposals on integrated education in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Senator has 20 minutes to make his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The proper title of the Mawhinney document is &ldquo;Education in Northern Ireland &mdash; Proposals for Reform&rdquo; and it was published by the Northern Ireland Department of Education in March.  It is a Green Paper effectively, a discussion paper for various reform proposals in the Northern Ireland education system, and indeed it forms part of the Education Reform Bill in the United Kingdom as a whole &mdash; certainly in England and Wales.  The Northern Ireland section contains certain different distinct proposals geared to the situation in Northern Ireland.  As I understand it, the discussion was to have terminated by 10 June at which stage the British Government would take up as it were the various suggestions made on the basis of the Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2551" /> To the extent that it proposes curricular reform in the system, it really is not directly any business of ours.  I pause here to note that some of the proposals are excessively utilitarian in tone.  Like so much of educational obsession today, the Green Paper is somewhat over-concerned in my view with science and technology to the detriment of the humanities but that is really neither here nor there.</P>
    <P>However, other proposals in the document do bear directly on our business and relate to the business of the Inter-governmental Conference.  Ultimately, they bear on the prospects for peace and reconciliation between the communities in Northern Ireland and, therefore, in Ireland as a whole.  The Green Paper &mdash; if I may call it that &mdash; puts forward as an objective, and I quote from page 6 of the document:</P>
    <P>To act positively to facilitate the development of integrated education where there is sufficient parental demand to support a viable school.</P>
    <P>In part at least the objective of the Mawhinney proposals is to promote the principle and practice of integrated education. To that extent the document spells out in detail further on the ways in which parents may be mobilised to change the nature of a school, whereby a school may change its standing from a voluntary school to a grant maintained school.  Indeed there is a further category savoured by the British Government, a grant maintained integrated school, which is given special incentives in the context, once again, of furthering educational integration in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The document also &mdash; and this is very interesting &mdash; emphasises parental choice, parental control and parental power.  It envisages a situation where a school may move to a grant maintained integrated status if, for example, 20 per cent of the parents in any school look for a referendum of the total number of parents.  Then a simple majority of the <Col N="2552" /> parental body could transform the status of the school.  Here is a real formula for real parental democracy, not just paying lip-service to it as is the case sometimes in our own Constitution, for example, where an ecclesiastical body has the real power but only pays lip-service to parental democracy.  I think the real objection of the Northern Ireland Catholic bishops to this proposal is precisely this point, that this is power to the parents, power to the parents, away from the Episcopal trustees.</P>
    <P>None of us in this Chamber is so naive as to think that integrated education is the panacea for the social and political ills of Northern Ireland.  None of us believes that if you assemble Protestants and Catholics and mix them up in the schools tomorrow, within a short period you will have community harmony.  Of course not.  Let us not be put in the false position, by those who favour segregation, of having to defend the impossible.  Of course not but at the same time this is a taboo subject, be it noted.  It is quite extraordinary that in the civil rights movement of 20 years ago and in the Forum for a New Ireland some years back, virtually little or nothing was said about education as if somehow there was a conspiracy that this was a preserved area not to be discussed &mdash; a thunderous silence one might call it.  In effect, we have to face up to the fact that segregated education may well be only a symptom of division.  It may not be anything like a contributory cause of division but at the same time commonsense would dictate to us that if you have only 800 pupils in integrated schools out of a total pupil body of 340,000 that cannot be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>At the back of all of this of course is the fact that the Catholic Church throughout the 19th and 20th centuries has consistently pursued the aim of control of schools.  In a forgotten chapter of Irish history in 1919-20, one of the reasons the Catholic bishops supported the transfer of power from the Parliamentary Party to <Col N="2553" /> Sinn Féin was that the Sinn Féin organisation were willing to toe the Episcopal line on educational policy.  It has not changed from the time 120 years ago when Cardinal Cullen said &ldquo;There is nothing that so concerns us as education, nothing that is so much our business&rdquo;&mdash; meaning Catholic business.  The position has not changed today where Bishop Cathal Daly, for all his impassioned and no doubt sincere protestations of peace and reconciliation at the New Ireland Forum, refuses to appoint a chaplain to Lagan College which recently was rightly described as the flagship of integrated education.  Fr. Denis Faul, an honest man indeed, said in his honesty, quite recently, &ldquo;we will give up our Churches before we give up our schools.&rdquo;  We know, then, where the Catholic Church stands on this matter.</P>
    <P>Let it be said, that the Protestants have a similar attitude, that they have no enthusiasm for integrated education and that the Stormont Government from its inception down to its abolition also tacitly or otherwise favoured what I might call educational apartheid.  I have very grave doubts about what is meant by the Catholic ethos or the Protestant ethos.  When you strip it down it simply means each tribe controls its own schools.  A poll in <i>Fortnight</i> magazine however shows a different picture.  In the July-August 1988 issue of <i>Fortnight</i>, there is a detailed poll which shows that there is substantial parental support for the idea that Government should promote integrated schools.</P>
    <P>We have heard over the past few months objections to the Mawhinney proposals.  Some of the objections are reasonable indeed, for example, that the Irish language may well be downgraded if they are implemented.  I certainly would hope that our Government in the Inter-governmental Conference and elsewhere will continue the difficult but essential task of educating British governors in the importance of the Irish language as an integral part of Ulster cultural heritage and the need moreover not to let the <Col N="2554" /> language go by default to the Provos. One of the most basic requirements of our time is that the Irish language must not become the bloodstained cultural uniform of the IRA.  Let our Government plead that cause but our Government's stance, as reported in the newspapers, makes me uneasy in other regards, and this is why I brought this matter up tonight.</P>
    <P>Do the Government oppose the essential thrust of these proposals which is towards encouraging integrated education? Do the Government really believe the line that these proposals should not be accepted in case the Provisionals take over some schools, in case they can mobilise 20 per cent of the parents and then a contrived majority? That strikes me as the most unbelievably weak argument against the proposals. Moreover, it smacks of blackmail on the part of the SDLP and the bishops.  What they are saying is: &ldquo;Look, you do not want the schools taken over by terrorists, do you?  If you do not, then you cannot trust the parents; you will have to accept the <i>status quo</i>&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like to know where our Government stand really on that basic matter.  Do they uphold the <i>status quo</i> of educational apartheid?  As I said already, allowing for all the simplifications and so on, there is no doubt that integrated education is a step towards community harmony.  It is important to know where this Government, particularly Fianna Fáil, the Republican Party Government stand in this matter.  Do they stand for Catholic nationalism or for a common Irishness or Republican Irishness, or even indeed a common Ulsterness transcending atavistic tribal animosities?</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Murphy for the opportunity of clarifying at least some of the points that he has raised.  He will agree that not since the Chilver proposals for teacher training in 1981 has any set of education proposals <Col N="2555" /> aroused such a reaction among diverse groups in Northern Ireland as the present consultative document of the UnderSecretary of State for Education, Dr. Brian Mawhinney.</P>
      <P>The motion today focuses on only one aspect of the Education reform package, namely integrated education.  This was covered in only a few of the over 70 paragraphs of the entire consultative paper launched last March.  Other equally important aspects of the proposals are &mdash; and Senator Murphy referred to some of them &mdash; a common curriculum consisting of eight essential (&ldquo;foundation&rdquo;) areas of study; new means of assessment (which could augur an end to the Eleven Plus); greater freedom of choice for parents; delegation of financial management and the down grading of the status of Irish &mdash; a point which Senator Murphy stressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I think it is important to elucidate the exact nature of the new education reform proposals which are contained in the consultative paper published by the Northern Ireland Department of Education last March.  The proposals are basically an adaptation of the Bill introduced earlier in the House of Commons at Westminster by the Education Secretary Mr. Baker.  The overall purpose of that Bill is to improve the standard of education generally in England and Wales and to introduce a concept of three core subjects, namely English, Mathematics and Science, as well as a number of other subjects which have been termed &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; subjects. These proposals are partially aimed at taking account of educational problems which are specific to England and Wales. In Northren Ireland, there will be no core subjects as such but it is proposed that all pupils throughout the compulsory ages of education should engage in the following &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; subjects: English, mathematics, science, history/geography/ environmental studies, technology, <Col N="2556" /> music/art/drama, physical education, a modern foreign language.</P>
    <P>Some people have raised objections in relation to the curricular rigidity created by this list of &ldquo;foundations&rdquo; subjects and the type of assessment procedures envisaged. That, however, is essentially a matter for educational experts and I do not propose to dwell on the matter here. What is of concern to us as a Government and is of particular importance to many people, both North and South of the Border, is the absence of any reference to the Irish language among this list of &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; subjects.  We have put certain proposals to the Northern authorities in this regard which we hope will be taken account of in the eventual legislation which will be produced, perhaps in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I shall now turn to another aspect of the Mawhinney proposals and one which is envisaged in the motion tonight, namely the encouragement of schools to move towards integrated education.  To put the matter in context, integrated schools are currently few in number in Northern Ireland and operate in places relatively untouched by the present troubles.  Out of a total schoolgoing population of one-third of a million, only some 800 pupils attend integrated schools.</P>
    <P>At present in the North, most Catholic schools &mdash; and a few prominent schools whose pupil intake is mainly Protestant &mdash; have the status of voluntary or maintained schools.  This means that they are owned and controlled privately by a board of governors or trustees.  Only 85 per cent of their capital funding is provided by the state compared with controlled schools which receive 100 per cent funding.  It is now proposed that at such voluntary schools, 20 per cent of parents may initiate a referendum of all the parents; a simple majority of those voting may then choose a new, grant-maintained status for the school.</P>
    <P>Upon the approval by the Department of Education of the application for grant-maintained status, such a school would <Col N="2557" /> be constituted as a body corporate and would be funded by grants paid directly by the Department.  Grants on approved expenditure, both recurrent and capital, would be at the rate of 100 per cent. A school could subsequently apply for grant-maintained integrated status where at least 20-25 per cent of the total enrolment was of a different religion from the majority of pupils.  A school with grant-maintained integrated status would have additional advantages; enrolments would not necessarily be constrained by a school's existing physical capacity and priority would be given to the provision of additional pupil places in such schools.</P>
    <P>Although the proposals are clearly at an early stage, it could not be expected that moves towards the establishment of such integrated schools would occur at a quick pace, and indeed there is doubt in some circles that there would be any significant move in that direction given the nature of the present proposals.  Furthermore, opposition to these proposals has come not just from those groups who might fear integrated education but also from those who believe that the present structures of school ownership and control could be irretrievably damaged.  For instance, it might be possible for extremist group's as mentioned by Senator Murphy, in certain parts of Belfast to induce 50 per cent of those parents voting in a ballot to hand over control of a school to people with a direct or indirect link with subversive groups.  Obviously such a scenario would be undesirable from many points of view.</P>
    <P>Other critics of the proposals underline the fact that integration in the true sense is not just about filling school buildings with a given ratio between Protestant and Catholic pupils.  There are some very genuine doubts in certain quarters that integration might not in truth be a two-way process but rather a possible absorption of the cultural aspirations of one community.  Were this to be the case, <Col N="2558" /> such integration would hardly be conducive to community harmony in Northern Ireland.  Integration in its most fruitful sense would rather have to do with learning about what is held in common between the two communities and what aspects are quite different.  Such open learning would engender the kind of mutual respect which would have a multiplier effect in the community at large.  If the new proposals were to contain a healty respect and recognition for the minority culture, including the Irish language, it might be easier for Northern Nationalists to be sanguine about the reform of their educational system.</P>
    <P>Many Senators will be aware that a Sunday newspaper on 3 July published a story &mdash; this may be the reason Senator Murphy raised this matter &mdash; in which Dr. Brian Mawhinney is reported as saying that the Irish Government were opposed to his proposals for integrated Education.  I can categorically state that this is incorrect and that the Government have not made any statement publicly or privately in relation to integrated education in Northern Ireland.  I can also inform the House that Dr. Mawhinney's office the following day issued a statement as follows:</P>
    <P>The article was inaccurate.  What Dr. Mawhinney said to the journalist at the that the South had reflected, at the Anglo-Irish Conference on 17 June, the Nationalist concerns about the position of the Irish language under the new proposals.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I have attempted in my comments to-night to draw attention to the many concerns which have been expressed to me by those groups and individuals involved in schools and education in Northern Ireland.  I would like to stress, however, that the present proposals are of a consultative nature and I am hopeful that the education authorities will take account of the representations that have been made to them.  The next step, I understand, will be the placing of <Col N="2559" /> a draft order in council which will provide a further opportunity for consultation with all the interested parties.  I hope also that I have allayed in some respects Senator Murphy's fears on the consultations the Government have had.</P>

      <P>A brief comment, I just want to say that I am totally unconvinced by the argument that proposals have to be rejected because of the fear that democracy might take over.  That is really what is meant by the fear that parents can be manoeuvred into giving over the control of their school to subversives. If that is the case in west Belfast, what is stopping the SDLP and other interested parties from mobilising their own sides, as it were?  That strikes me as a ludicrously weak argument.  I do agree, however, that any proposals towards integration must contain and recognise a healthy respect for the minority culture and the Minister does not have to know where I stand with regard to the Irish language.  It is important that British <Col N="2560" /> Ministers should know how important the Irish language is and how important it is that it is not hijacked by the Provos. Having said all that I do recognise that the matter is at a very early stage.</P>

      <P>I do not have a question, I hope it is an answer I am giving.  I do hope that the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs, recognise that it is in the best interests of the Irish people and, in the historical context, in the best traditions of republicanism that in principle our Government at the Inter-Governmental Conference look favourably on the principle of integrated education.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister because essentially what I set out to get tonight was clarification.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 13 July 1988.</P>
