      <P>I have notice from Senator Paul Bradford that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The proposed extension to the Patrician Academy Secondary School, Mallow, County Cork.</P>
      <P>I regard this matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment of the House and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Leader of the House if he proposes to make Government time available in the coming weeks to discuss Item No. 63?  It is a very important motion and I think all parties would agree to have it discussed.  Secondly, I am curious about Item No. 7 on the Order Paper.  Has the Leader of the House any more clear idea at this stage as to when he will be ordering this motion?</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question that the Bill be received for final consideration, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendments made by the Dáil. For the convenience of Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be back in the Seanad again to add the final touches to this Bill which was very excellently debated here.  We have four different amendments.  I will go through them for Senators.  Senators will recall our lengthy and detailed discussions about the powers in respect of drugs set out in section 2 of the Bill.  If I might remind the House, section 2 assigns power of search without warrant for drugs to customs officers at or in the vicinity of any port, airport or land frontier.</P>
      <P>Since the customs service already enjoys powers of search without warrant in respect of travellers, the net effect of this provision is to facilitate customs searches of &mdash; not travellers &mdash; but meeters and greeters who, as the law now stands, are immune from search by the customs service.  This plugs a real gap in the existing law because, once a consignment of smuggled drugs has been passed, for example, at a port or airport reception area or, indeed, at a land frontier from the person who actually smuggles in the drugs to a meeter or greeter, the customs service cannot yet, under present law, search that meeter or greeter even where certainty exists that the meeter or greeter is in illegal possession of prohibited drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate in the Seanad focused on two aspects of these proposed powers: first, the nature of the person searched, and secondly, the need for possible safeguards for persons searched.  As I have made clear, compulsory, intrusive or internal body searches are regarded by the State as an invasion of personal rights, specifically of the right to bodily integrity which is held by the courts to be one of the rights implicitly guaranteed by Article 40 of the Constitution.  I was very happy to accept the amendment of the Seanad to section 2 of the Bill which added provisos (a) to (d) in respect of personal searches. After a very full and detailed exchange of views across the floor of this House, proviso (d) as passed by this House stated that a search of the person carried out in <Col N="820" /> accordance with section 2 may be carried out by a medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 now before the House which emerged in Committee in the Dáil expands on the central idea behind the original Seanad proviso and makes explicit the right of the person being searched to request a search by a medical practitioner.  The amendment also assigns the right of search by a medical practitioner to the customs service and makes explicit the proposition that a search may include an intimate body search.  This will not mean that the customs service or a medical practitioner designated by them would be able to violate any individual's rights to bodily integrity but clarifies the matter in a way which I hope the Seanad will welcome.</P>
    <P>This amendment is a very worthwhile step forward in our search for balance between the needs of the State, the rights of the community to protection and the personal rights of the individual traveller and or meeter or greeter.  Amendment No. 2 raises the level of maximum penalty in relation to failure to comply with any specified requirement in respect of a search under section 2 from a penalty of £200 to a proposed new penalty, subject to the sanction of this House, of £500 something which, if I recall correctly, this House would welcome.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 clears up a possible ambiguity about what precisely constitutes an aircraft.  The amendment makes it explicit that an aircraft for the purpose of a search for drugs under section 2 includes a glider, balloon or model aircraft.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 clears up an inconsistency between the powers of personal search without warrant as set out in section 2 as against those set out in section 3.  The proviso or safeguards in respect of personal search added by Seanad Éireann to section 2 ought, all things being equal to be applied to personal searches carried out under section 3.  I was happy, therefore, to propose in the Dáil a variant to an Opposition amendment giving effect to this.  I consider these amendments to be a material improvement in one degree or another to the Bill. <Col N="821" /> After a long debate in both Houses, I therefore commend these amendments to this House for your approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister back into the House.  I have very clear memory of the robust debate we had in the course of the passage of this Bill through the House.  The debate in the other House was equally robust.  I would like to compliment the Minister for the attitude he adopted in introducing this legislation and the open-minded approach to comment he exhibited at all times.  This is the very essence of what parliamentary democracy is about.  The net effect of it is the bringing forward of an effective, good piece of legislation into which input had been welcomed and allowed.  The amendments before us this morning do materially strengthen the Bill although I have some questions to ask in relation to them.  I hope the procedure will allow the Minister to respond in some way.</P>
      <P>We had a lengthy debate here about the conflict between the right to bodily integrity which is part and parcel of the constitutional rights afforded to people in this country.  I am interested to hear him say, in amendment No. 1, the expansion of the Seanad amendment, that the intimate body search is non-compulsory. The question I have to ask about this is: if it is non-compulsory how are we sure that it will ever take place because anybody guilty of importing forbidden substances such as drugs in bodily orifices is hardly going to ask for an intimate body search whereas I could imagine somebody who was innocent of that style of importation being happy to get themselves out of a difficult situation by asking for an intimate body search which would put an end to the feelings of suspicion and would probably release them from detention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see it as something that would assist the innocent in proving their innocence but which would not, since it is a voluntary exercise, ensure that the guilty would be caught or found out.  I see a difficulty there in that, though at the same time I see the Minister's difficulty in <Col N="822" /> keeping the constitutional right to bodily integrity firmly in place.  I am not too sure about the actual adequacy of the measure although it does go a long way towards admitting the reality of one of the ways in which drugs are imported into this country.</P>
    <P>The use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the amendment &mdash;&ldquo;a search of the person may at the request of the person to be searched&rdquo;&mdash; begs a question of whether this is an option.  Does the legal word &ldquo;may&rdquo; confirm &mdash; I feel it does &mdash; that it is an option and it does not say &ldquo;must&rdquo;? I am happy about that.  The Customs and Excise officer can designate the general practitioner or the medical practitioner. Something I am a little unhappy about is the absence of the use of the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; medical practitioner.  The words &ldquo;registered medical practitioner&rdquo; occur in the Road Traffic Act.  I fail to see why the wording in this legislation does not mirror wording in other legislation.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the medical council is the body which registers doctors and that doctors are governed by the Medical Practitioners Act of 1978.  For any report of a medical practitioner to have legal validity the medical practitioner must be registered by the medical council.  For the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; to be omitted in this legislation could allow for a non-registered medical practitioner being involved in an intimate body search and in a situation where he or she had to give legal evidence in connection with the prosecution of somebody for a drug importation offence.  I think we leave a loophole there in omitting the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; medical practitioner.  I do not understand why this is so.  I think the Minister should address himself to that fact in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>There are charlatans in the medical profession as there are in all professions. The possibility does exist that somebody who is not registered could be called in in a situation like this and an intimate body search could be conducted.  But the whole thing could have no legal validity <Col N="823" /> if the medical practitioner was not registered. I do not think in the context of legislation that it is good enough just to assume that the medical practitioner will be registered.  I think the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; should have been and should be at this stage if it is possible, included in the amendment to strengthen it and to give the activities of such a practitioner the legal validity which the situation warrants.</P>
    <P>I approve of the increase of the fine in amendment No. 2.  My party sought a maximum fine of £1,000 in the other House.  This represents some haggling or bartering which occurred over the fine to be imposed.  Most people in the country agree that levels of fines are very often derisory and do not reflect the seriousness of the crime involved.  Everybody who participated in the debate on this Bill agreed that drug importation and drug offences were a heinous crime and that we must all combine our forces to combat drugs, drug dealing and drug importation. It was amusing to read in the Official Report of the Dáil debates on this measure that my colleague in Fine Gael, Deputy Michael Noonan, in the haggling situation when the Minister graciously accepted the mean of £500 said that perhaps they should spit and shake hands on this one.  That, however, is an aside.  The increase in the fine does underline the seriousness of the offence and is a welcome compromise from the Minister although I am afraid I take a fairly hard line on this and would have preferred to have seen a £1,000 fine.  I think no sum of money is too big in order to act as an efficacious deterrent.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3, the amplifying of what includes by definition an aircraft, seems a sensible measure and plugs a loophole that could have existed in the wording as originally drafted.  The expansion of the definition to include glider, balloon and model aircraft is welcome.  I am pleased about that.  Given the size of this country, gliders, balloons and model aircraft could be used by people intent on moving drugs from one place to another and these devices have the added <Col N="824" /> advantage of being without any sound which makes them less amenable to detection.</P>
    <P>In section 3, amendment No. 4 is one that clears up an ambiguity.  It is quite intelligible and is welcomed by this side. To sum up, the one outstanding query I have is the absence of the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; in relation to medical practitioner. I cannot see why it was omitted.  I do not think it is good enough to take it as being meant.  I think it admits the possibility, however slim, of a charlatan being involved in an intimate body search situation and the evidence as such being discounted and lacking legal validity and I hope the Minister can address himself to that and see even at this stage if he thinks fit to consider inserting &ldquo;registered&rdquo; into this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to congratulate the Minister for bringing forward the Bill again to the Seanad where it received a very positive airing at Second Stage and Committee Stage.  Subsequently in the Dáil it was debated at length and, as the previous Senator said, with a lot of gusto.  I am sure new ideas were brought forward from both Houses and have given us a better Bill.  I certainly believe that to be the case.  The amendments that are being discussed this morning are necessary.  Senator Bulbulia referred to amendment No. 2 which increases the fine to £500.  It is something all of us would welcome.  Obviously, as the Senator indicated, her party might have wished for something higher but nonetheless it is a compromise that was agreed at Dáil level.  There has been ambiguity about what constitutes an aircraft. That, too, has been cleared up in amendment No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 clears up any inconsistency in the powers of personal search without warrant previously referred to at length in this House.  Amendment No. 1 caused most of the concern in this House and understandably so.  I am sure it was the same in the Dáil.  I can understand that there is a reason for Senator Bulbulia's concern regarding medical practitioner or &ldquo;registered&rdquo; medical <Col N="825" /> practitioner.  I am sure that will be answered by the Minister.  This amendment also must be seen as a very worthwhile movement forward.  I think the amendments and the Bill are seen as a very important part of legislation.  It is certainly, as I see it now, a better Bill as a result of the long debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We have a role in combating drugs importation.  We know that drugs are being smuggled through airports, ports or land frontiers.  We have a real duty to effect legislation which will eliminate, as far as possible, the importation of these drugs.  I believe that drugs in this country have been allowed to operate quite easily.  Certainly I think it is necessary to make every effort to block the loopholes. This Bill will help in a big way in doing that.  The Minister is correct in taking on board the concerns of this House and the Dáil and putting them in the form of these amendments.  As a result, there has been a material improvement in the Bill as it was originally drafted and it is one that we all welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, in response to the contributions this morning I want to pay particular tribute to both Senator Bulbulia and Senator Fallon for their very excellent individual contributions right throughout the debate since we brought the Bill into the House and to all the Members of the Seanad who made a very positive detailed and worthwhile contribution but in particular to Senators Bulbulia and Fallon as they are respective spokespersons for their parties and they made a very significant contribution and I want to thank them for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points were raised this morning.  I would like to respond to them as quickly as possible.  An intimate body search which does not violate individual bodily integrity can be carried out and be required to be carried out.  An internal or intrusive body search is, however, not contemplated.  We can undertake an intimate search which does not involve an internal search.  Intimate searches for <Col N="826" /> example, a patdown search at an airport, already take place and under this Bill intimate searches will take place which do not violate bodily integrity.  A search involving the removal of clothing can take place, therefore, provided that the search is not internal or intrusive.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia and Senator Fallon also referred to the situation pertaining to the medical practitioner.  As you know, this Bill has operated in tandem with and is based on similar provisions already existing in the Misuse of Drugs Act so the interpretation of this Bill would be in line with the bona fide interpretation of the misuse of Drugs Act and the similar situation would apply <i>via-á-vis</i> a medical practitioner.  Therefore, we can take it that the medical practitioner is a person who is a bona fide medical practitioner. I want to assure the House on that.  If a person to be searched seeks a medical practitioner to carry out the search he or she will be entitled to be assured that this doctor is a legitimate doctor.  I would ask the House to accept these assurances that this situation will not be abused.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; would not have the effect Senator Bulbulia presumes since this would be no definition of what &ldquo;registered&rdquo; means precisely.  Does it mean a registered citizen of this country?  Does it mean registered with a health board?  Does it mean registered with the Irish Medical Council? Does it mean registered &mdash; for a foreign person &mdash; with the Department of Justice.  It has various connotations.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that a medical practitioner will be one designated by the customs officers, will be a bona fide medical doctor. Assurances on that will be given to the person concerned and I want to assure the House that if there were to be any confict in the situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the medical person involved, of course the courts would have to interpret that in any case that may be taken to the courts for adjudication.  I am quite satisfied and I am sure the House will accept the assurances that we give.</P>
    <P>Finally, I thank the House for the very excellent contributions and for the <Col N="827" /> tremendous amount of time and interest shown.  I am confident that, when we have passed these amendments, we will have put into position very important legislation which will help to protect the people of this country and, indeed, we hope also the people of other countries against the terrible ravages and scourge of drugs and drug peddling.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on Government amendment No. 130:</P>
    <P>In page 83, before section 94, but in Part V of the Bill, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;99. &mdash; (1)  In this section, &lsquo;authorised person&rsquo; means a person authorised in writing by a relevant authority of a recognised stock exchange and approved by the Minister for the purposes of this Part.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purpose of obtaining any information necessary for the exercise by a relevant authority of such exchange of the function referred to in section 98, an authorised person may, on production of his authorisation if so required, require any person whom he or such relevant authority has reasonable cause to believe to have dealt in securities, or to have any information about such dealings, to give the authorised person any information which he may reasonably require in regard to &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the securities concerned,</P>
    <P>(b)  the company which issued the securities,</P>
    <P>(c)  his dealings in such securities, or</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> (d)  any other information the authorised person reasonably requires in relation to such securities or such dealings,</P>
    <P>and give him such access to and facilities for inspecting and taking copies of any documents relating to the matter as he reasonably requires.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every document purporting to be a warrant or authorisation and to be signed or authenticated by or on behalf of a relevant authority shall be received in evidence and shall be deemed to be such warrant or authorisation without further proof until the contrary is shown.</P>
    <P>(4)  An authorised person, or any person on whom he has made a requirement under this section, may apply to the court for a declaration under this section.</P>
    <P>(5)  The court, having heard such evidence as may be adduced and any representations that may be made by the authorised person and a person referred to in subsection (4), may at its discretion declare&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that the exigencies of the common good do not warrant the exercise by the authorised person of the powers conferred on him by this section, or</P>
    <P>(b)  that the exigencies of the common good do so warrant.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where the court makes a declaration under subsection (5) (a), the authorised person shall, as soon as may be, withdraw the relevant requirement under this section.</P>
    <P>(7)  Where the court makes a declaration under subsection (5) (b), the person on whom the requirement was imposed shall, as soon as may be, furnish the required information to the authorised person.</P>
    <P>(8)  Where, in contravention of subsection (7), a person refuses, or fails within a reasonable time, to comply with a requirement of an authorised <Col N="829" /> person, the authorised person may certify the refusal under his hand to the court, and the court may, after hearing any statement which may be offered in defence, punish the offender in like manner as if he had been guilty of contempt of court.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I understand we reported progress on amendment No. 130 to section 94 of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987.  I am not too sure whether the Minister was speaking at the point at which we decided to break it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not.  I had explained the meaning of amendment No. 130 and a number of questions were being put to us by Senator Robinson when we finished yesterday. That is my understanding.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross had also put some questions about authorised persons.  Perhaps I will deal with those very briefly. Amendment No. 130 relates to the question of authorised persons, defining authorised persons and how they may be appointed.  Senator Ross asked me to ensure that these people will be totally independent of the stock exchange and independent of the company concerned. I had explained to Senator Ross that the Bill is quite clear that the person must be approved by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Just to refresh Senators' memories, what is involved is that the Stock Exchange, if it has reason to be suspicious about a deal, will appoint what is called an authorised person and will appoint that person in writing.  In other words, it will formally lay out the terms and conditions of the appointment of the authorised person.  That authorised person will investigate the deal concerned and will then decide to report back to the Stock Exchange on their findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators were rightly putting the point that if the Stock Exchange is going to appoint an authorised person to investigate a deal, it is important that that person should be independent and be seen to be independent.  I am happy that <Col N="830" /> is dealt with by the section in the Bill which says that the person has to be approved by the Minister.  If the person is approved by the Minister, we can take it that the Minister of the day will be looking at the independence of that person to ensure that person is not just there to avoid questions being asked.</P>
    <P>Another question was raised about the ability of the authorised person to go to court, and in what circumstances an authorised person might go to court for a declaration.  It was Senator Robinson who asked me these questions.  She asked me in what circumstances would an authorised person apply to the court.  Is it if a person refused to co-operate?  That actually is the case.  The authorised person is there to investigate.  If the authorised person's attempts to get information are frustrated, he or she will be able to seek a declaration from the courts that the information he or she was seeking should be provided.  My reply to the question is that I am happy that an authorised person will be independent because the Minister has to approve such an appointment.  We have built in an additional safeguard, that is, that the authorised person or any person or company being investigated may go to the court, if they feel they are being frustrated by the blocking of information.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson asked me if it was necessary for the Minister to have statutory powers to describe the conditions under which the authorised officer may be employed.  The Senator's point may be met by the proposed amendment No. 132 which will give the Minister power to make regulations.  I am happy in any case that, because of the fact that the authorised person has to be approved by the Minister, that is a safeguard which will ensure the independence of the authorised person to investigate any suspicious dealing.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 131:</P>
    <P>In page 83, before section 94, but in <Col N="831" /> Part V of the Bill, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;100. &mdash; An annual report shall be presented to the Minister on behalf of every recognised stock exchange on the exercise of the functions of a relevant authority of the exchange concerned under this Part and, in particular, the report shall include &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the number of written complaints received suggesting possible contraventions of this Part,</P>
    <P>(b)  the number of reports made to the Director of Public Prosecutions under this Part,</P>
    <P>(c)  the number of instances in which, following the exercise of powers by authorised persons under this Part, reports were not made to the Director of Public Prosecutions, and</P>
    <P>(d)  such other information as may be prescribed.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This involves the Stock Exchange in making an annual report to the Minister.  It is a new section 100.  I want to tell Senators that this is the seventh of the new sections I am proposing to include in Part V.  It is largely self-explanatory, but I will just say a few words about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section recognises the fact that we are devolving certain powers and functions on the Stock Exchange under the previous two new sections.  In a sense, a kind of counterbalance is required.  This new section will therefore require the exchange to submit an annual report to the Minister containing certain information in regard to the discharge by the Stock Exchange of its functions under this Part.  This should not alone nail down the magnitude of the problem but it should also act as a kind of a check to make sure the exchange carries out its new functions diligently and effectively. I am very keen that the exchange should take this very seriously.  The annual report will enable the Minister to be aware of the scale of the problem and <Col N="832" /> also any difficulties which are faced by the exchange in implementing its powers.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (d) the Minister will be able to prescribe additional information which, in the light of experience gained in the operation of this scheme, he considers should be included in such annual reports.  This will also permit other corrective action to be taken.  For instance, by enacting supplementary regulations under the next new sections or, indeed, over time as the annual reports are studied by Ministers, the need may even arise for amendments to legislation but that will become obvious as the annual reports are made to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 132:</P>
    <P>In page 83, before section 94, but in Part V of the Bill, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;101. &mdash; (1)  Where the Minister considers it necessary or expedient to do so for the proper and effective administration of sections 98 and 99, he may make such regulations as he thinks appropriate in relation to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the powers of authorised persons, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the matters in respect of which, or the persons from whom, authorised persons may require information under this Part.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every regulation made by the Minister under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment <Col N="833" /> allows the Minister to make regulations in connection with authorised persons. This is the final new section which I am proposing to include in Part V.  It is largely self-explanatory.</P>
      <P>As we are breaking new ground in introducing a novel function for the Stock Exchange we cannot be sure that the procedures we are proposing will cover all the cases which should be covered or as effectively as they should be.  This section, therefore, will allow the Minister and the exchange to learn from experience and adapt the procedures we are laying down here in the light of experience of operating the new system.  In the section we have just agreed we have been laying down procedures for an annual report to be made to the Minister.  That is very important because when the Minister gets the annual report and sees what the Stock Exchange has been doing in this area for the previous 12 months, the Minister will then be able to decide whether any new regulations are needed to improve or clarify the powers of the authorised person, or the manner in respect of which the authorised person may require information from the company or the person being investigated. This is part of a number of amendments. Senators will remember that yesterday we dealt with the penalties on insider trading which were £200,000 maximum or a ten year prison sentence.  With those very severe penalties, it is important that there be some safeguards on both sides. One of the safeguards we have built in here is that an annual report should be made which will lay out the details of the number of cases investigated, how many cases were investigated and not proceeded with, and how many prosecutions were taken etc.</P>
      <P>This section will allow the Minister to amend the regulations covering what the authorised person may do.  That is very important, particularly with such stiff penalties.  I am very concerned that we get a balance because the penalties are quite severe.</P>

      <P>The fact that an annual report shall be presented to the Minister <Col N="834" /> is very good.  However, is the frequency of the annual report sufficient?  Take the case of insolvency problems that cannot be effectively dealt with by the end of the year but could be dealt with in a report in the middle of the year, if there was a half yearly report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair point. One could argue about the time scale but in practical terms, as there is so much paper work involved in this, it will be seen that many of our State companies that are supposed to give us an annual report, run many months behind.  It seems to take them all their time to get the annual report out through the Auditor General and published.  One of the regrets I have always had in regard to State companies is that they have not been able to get their accounts out quickly.  Some of them are very good but some of them are falling seriously behind and they are not getting their company accounts out as quickly as a company in the Stock Exchange would get its accounts out.  With the realisation of what actually happens in the market-place in terms of producing accounts and facts and figures, a yearly report is enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To refresh our minds on this, the annual report would include the number of written complaints received suggesting possible contraventions of this part of the Act, the number of reports made to the Director of Public Prosecutions under the part, the number of incidents in which following the exercise of powers by authorised person reports were not made to the Director of Public Prosecutions, and such other information as may be prescribed. I do not want to be too specific on this but I could not envisage a huge number of prosecutions and therefore if you get the information on an annual basis it will be enough to plan ahead.  If we find a need for it later on, we can talk <Col N="835" /> about a twice-yearly report.  We want to keep the Minister also at arm's length.  I do not want the Minister to be looking down their throat every few months.  If we are going to give them the job to do and put in heavy penalties, we should let them get on and do it and check them on an annual basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

      <P>I welcome the amendment. I am surprised that such an important institution of State does not prepare some form of annual report.  When you consider that all the companies listed on the Stock Exchange prepare a report on the financial and other aspects of their business, it is right that the Minister receives an annual report.  I accept there can be problems with a six monthly report, but it is right that the Minister should be asking them for an annual report.</P>

      <P>I will just reiterate what the Taoiseach has said in the Dáil, which is that this Bill is a priority and all the resources available to me are being put into it.  We will move it as quickly as possible.  I can assure the Senator that there is enormous pressure both from Government and from the Seanad to get this Bill moving.  I will have it back here as quickly as I can.  I also want to try to give Senators as much notice of amendments as I can.  I could rush in a few amendments in the next few hours but I do not want to do that.  That would be unfair to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister. If it is possible for the Minister to give us notice of the amendments earlier than we are getting them, we would have the benefit of hearing the views of other interested groups in relation to the important sections we are coming up with, particularly in relation to solvency and the winding up of a business.  I would like to be very much aware of the Government's intentions before I come in here the next day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give an undertaking that we will give as much notice as possible.  Sometimes it is not that easy, because there are areas which one should amend which one only spots very close to the line.  However, that is a practical difficulty.  We will certainly give as much notice as we possibly can.  I want to explain to Senators that one of the reasons for the logjam in the Bill was the decision taken to criminalise insider <Col N="837" /> trading, which was not taken originally in the Bill.  This was a civil remedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out first that this Bill has been around for many years and did not move anywhere until 12 months ago.  In the past 12 months it has moved dramatically and it is now moving at a very solid pace.  The work which is being done is very good.  We are getting good legislation through.  The officials are working flat-out on the Bill. I can assure the House of that.</P>
      <P>The reality is that a decision was taken to criminalise insider trading which involved a whole new section of the Bill. This is, arguably, the longest, most complicated, most difficult legislation that will come before this House for the next decade.  It is important that we get it right.  The decision to criminalise insider trading meant, in effect, the writing of a large portion of a Bill.  That decision was taken some two or three months ago and since then the Department have been involved in writing the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the Cathaoirleach raised the point because I was about to raise it.  The Taoiseach said in the Dáil that the Bill was delayed in the Seanad.  That was grossly unfair and I think the Minister should accept the fact that it was unfair.  Everybody accepts that this is complicated legislation.  Somebody said it took five or six years for the previous companies legislation to get through the Oireachtas.  There is no doubt about the work that has gone into the Bill.  But we in this House feel that it was unfair of the Leader of the other House to say that this Bill was delayed in the Seanad, when it was actually being delayed in the Minister's Department for extremely good reasons.  Nobody is arguing about the reasons.  We welcomed it. Somebody spoke in favour of the criminalisation of insider trading.  There is no doubt that that is a positive, progressive <Col N="838" /> thing to do.  It was unfair that this House should be lumped with a difficulty which is not of its making.</P>
      <P>The level of annoyance about the lack of progress in the Bill has been a problem of long gaps between dealing with it.  It would be a far more efficient method of dealing with this, if we were to take two or three hours a week on this Bill and do a number of sections, rather than trying to finish it in a day.  I would prefer the Minister to say that the next time we meet we will take sections 93 to 120, that we will do that within the next fortnight or whatever it happens to be, and that we will circulate the amendments beforehand. So we will know, coming in on that day, what sections will be dealt with and that they will be dealt with properly.</P>
      <P>I would like to compliment both the Department and the Minister on the manner in which they are dealing with this Bill.  The Minister has been absolutely aware of the problems that have been raised by many different groups and he has listened to argument and accepted amendments.  It is a copybook exercise in how legislation and the legislative process should work.  Therefore, I want to make it clear that I am not standing in a critical manner, I am just putting forward a suggestion that would allow this legislation to get the fullest possible consideration. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to consider that the next time we meet we will take a set number of sections, and we will have had the amendments, as Senator Hogan suggested, in good time.  Then we can deal with it in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur totally with the remarks of Senator O'Toole.  I am not an expert on this.  I know the Minister wants to get the legislation right.  In order that we have the opportunity to assist the Minister I appeal to him to note that the normal practice of Government amendments arriving the day before the legislation comes into the House does not give adequate time for people to give mature consideration to and to reflect on the amendments being proposed.  Perhaps we could be given the amendments on the <Col N="839" /> Friday prior to the Seanad sitting on the following Wednesday.  This would be more appropriate in order to give due consideration to the many issues that are about to be raised, as well as the issues that have been raised.</P>

      <P>This is the most comprehensive legislation to come before this House for many years.  It is an update of the 1963 Act which was based on the UK Act, 1948.  We are endeavouring to update 40 years of company law.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his approach to this Bill.  He has taken on amendments from all parties and he has given them careful consideration.  Having sat through all of the debate on this Companies Bill so far, I believe the legislation has been greatly improved since the Bill first came into this House.  The time spent in the Seanad debating this legislation will be time saved in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Businessmen generally recognise the need for this legislation and they are anxious that it should be concluded quickly.  But we are also very anxious that when it is finalised it should be good legislation.  I am confident that will happen.</P>

      <P>Before we adjourn on this Bill I would like to compliment the press coverage of this issue for the last two days.  <i>The Irish Times, The Cork Examiner</i> and RTE have really reflected the importance of this legislation.  It is important that this work should get detailed consideration by the public and that the public should know what is going on.  We all have different viewpoints on it.  The previous speaker spoke from the viewpoint of the business person.  I would speak from the point of view of the worker, but we all have a vested interest in proper responsible legislation.  I thank the media for their interest in it.  It has been very positive.  Apart from projecting the image of this House, it has also shown the complexity of the legislation.</P>

      <P>If the Seanad feels that it would like to do some work on this <Col N="840" /> Bill, I could make one suggestion.  First, I should like to comment on some of the things said.  In fairness, the Taoiseach said in the Dáil that the Bill was with the Seanad.  I do not recall him saying that it was delayed by the Seanad, but the Official Report will show that.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Toole for his compliments which I value very much. Senator Hogan raised the point regarding the time to study the amendments.  We will certainly try to give as much time as possible.</P>
      <P>The Government may have some amendments to the sections as they are laid out in the Bill, (1), when we get time to consider some public comments on them, (2), to restudy some of the submissions and, (3), to take on board some comments made during this debate already on the general Companies Bill which may refer to later sections.  We had intended to take all of those on board and then, if necessary, to introduce Government amendments, giving the Senators time to submit their amendments. There is one other way we could do this, that is to go ahead and debate the section in the absence of the amendments. That is not a course I would normally propose to Senators, unless they felt they really needed to.  We could take on board the points made and come back with amendments but I do not think that is the way to do it.</P>

      <P>It is with a sense of deep regret that I ask the Seanad to adjourn as a mark of respect to our colleague, Senator Jackie Daly who died today. Senator Daly who was present in the <Col N="841" /> House this morning has died due to heart failure.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackie Daly was a credit to this House.  He was in good standing with all the Members.  Indeed I had a personal regard for him for many years even before I came into the Seanad because he was associated with me in the Irish Motor Industry.  As a council member of the Irish Motor Industry he fulfilled his role as a nominee of that body, never losing an opportunity to fulfil the obligations that were put on him by that industry.</P>
      <P>The magazine of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry was issued yesterday. It dealt with ten years of problems associated with the industry but it was fulsome in its praise of the work that Jackie Daly did on every occasion that an issue had to be raised on behalf of the industry.</P>
      <P>As the Whip of the Fine Gael group, Senator Daly was always approachable. He never created problems when problems should not arise.  He will be missed by his party but he will also be missed by those of us who serve in this House.  I would like to pass a vote of sympathy to his family and I suggest that the House adjourn as a mark of respect to the Senator.</P>

I do so with feelings of deep sorrow at the loss of our Fine Gael Senator, Jackie Daly, who adorned this House and gave it sterling service during all the years he was a Member.  Jackie Daly served this House with diligence and with enthusiasm and we, on the Fine Gael side, are bereaved and we are in fact stunned by the suddeness of this event.</P>

    <P>He was with us this morning.  He was busy with his work as Whip to the Fine Gael group.  He spoke to many of us this morning and it is very hard indeed to think that he is not with us.  We extend <Col N="842" /> our very deep sympathy to his daughter, Fidelma, about whom he spoke very frequently and with deep affection and to his two sons who loved him dearly and whom he loved in return.  We would welcome the opportunity, when we have had time to consider the work of Jackie Daly to pay full tributes to him next Wednesday.  For now I would like to once again express the deep sorrow and regret of the Fine Gael Group and our feelings of sympathy to his family who have been so suddenly and so sadly bereaved.</P>

He lived in Castleisland before he went to Killarney to do business.  Indeed, I will say about Jackie Daly that he was a very approachable fellow.  He was a very gentlemanly fellow.  Indeed, it was always very pleasant to have a chat with Jackie Daly here in the House.  I would count him as a very good friend of mine.

We were all with him this morning. We were all with him actually just when he left for the hospital.  He joked with us.  We felt he was going to be all right because he expressed the wish that we would stop worrying.  He expressed the wish that we would continue with the business we were to be dealing with today, which he had an interest in.  It is appropriate that we should adjourn.</P>

    <P>I was elected with Jackie the first time we came in here.  I came in with him <Col N="843" /> in April 1975.  It is appropriate that we should speak about him at greater length. It is a great shock to all of us.  He was a friend of all of us and it is unbelievable, having spoken to him less than an hour ago, to find him gone from us now.
