      <P>I have notice from Senator Brian O'Shea that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The problems arising for a certain company in proposals of the Department for the Environment in relation to the EC Directive on Containers for Beverages.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Philip Hogan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to examine the serious consequences that her proposed change in the pupil-teacher ratio will have on the pupils and staff of Tullow community school, County Carlow.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for funding to be provided from the national lottery to the community development association, Muintir na Tíre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators O'Shea, Hogan and Bradford as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator O'Shea's motion <Col N="1554" /> and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Hogan and Bradford may give notice for another day of the matter they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>So enthusiastic was I about this particular measure that I rose a little early on the Order of Business to welcome it.  I think it is tremendously significant and historic that we should welcome the President of the French Republic, Francois Mitterrand, to Ireland and to honour him with a joint sitting of both Houses of the Oireachtas. <i>Le President Mitterrand, sera bienvenue chez nous.</i>  I am particularly pleased because I know that this visit will be received with tremendous enthusiasm by the general public.  There are many historic ties between Ireland and France.</P>
      <P>Indeed, looking around this Chamber it strikes me that the two portraits we have are of Tone and Emmet resplendent in full military uniform of the French forces.  That is a very pleasing coincidence. I also note the fact that the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad will make the speech of thanks.  That confers a signal honour on this House, that our Cathaoirleach is to take such a pre-eminent part in the visit.  I would like to express my warm welcome for it.</P>

It gives me particular pleasure because Mr. Mitterrand is a socialist.  The last guest we had in the Houses of the Oireachtas, Bob Hawke, was also a socialist.  Perhaps it augurs well for the future that our international guests are all of the same philosophy as the group on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I think it is appropriate to record the fact that His Excellency is a socialist.  It is a fact.  He is part of the socialist international group with which the Labour Party in Ireland are associated and affiliated.  It gives me particular pleasure to be able to identify with the motion from the Leader of the House that he should be afforded the signal honour of addressing both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I join with my colleague, Senator Bulbulia, in recording the fact that the Cathaoirleach of this House will be associated with that formal address of welcome and thanks.  That is an honour for us and it is appropriate that as one of the Houses of the Oireachtas we should be associated with what is, in fact, a historic visit to this country.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an rún seo ar Riar na hOibre.  May I say that it will be a particular pleasure to have a Head of State visiting us who is a man of some culture, a man of some compassion, a man of considerable intelligence and a man who has a capacity to think in global terms about the problems of the world? I welcome his visit.  I welcome the opportunity we will all have to welcome him. I welcome in particular the extremely profound contrast between this visitor <Col N="1557" /> and the previous occasion on which we were asked to welcome a Head of State.</P>
      <P>I emphasise again the qualities of intelligence, culture and vision this Head of State has and contrast them with those of a Head of State of another great power who visited us.  In this case I am happy to welcome the visit of a Head of State of some dignity and some culture.</P>

I would like to welcome the fact that it is becoming almost a habit that when Heads of State or Prime Ministers come here they get an opportunity to address both Houses and we get an opportunity to listen to them. President Mitterrand, is an man of enormous distinction over many years in the politics of France and it is a great honour that we should have an opportunity to welcome him.</P>

I agree, of course, that we should not go into details about personality and policies.  France is no more perfect than any other country. Indeed, in terms of its attitude to nuclear power and the use thereof its policies are very far from being enlightened.  Ach ní <Col N="1558" /> hé sin an cheist.

The visit will mean that we will have to have a further motion here next week so that there can be a proper recording of the speech of the President.  The speech must be officially recorded.  It would normally be in English and Irish but because the President will be speaking in French there has to be a change to allow that to happen.</P>

    <Title>Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984 (Amendment Order) Order, 1988: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984 (Amendment Order) Order, 1988,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on 27th January, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act is to preserve certain statutory and other contractual entitlements of employees which are unpaid because their employers have become legally insolvent. The Act enables these, existing entitlements to be paid from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund; it does not confer any new or additional benefits on employees.</P>
      <P>In the administration of the 1984 Act one anomaly has been identified which I consider should be modified.  This anomaly arises from the provisions of section 3 of the Act which limits payments from the fund to employees who are employed in employment which is &ldquo;insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, 1981 to 1984&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> That definition is generally satisfactory but it has one effect which was unintended or at least which was not adverted to when the section was being drafted. That is that the benefits of the Act are denied to older employees, specifically those who are over the age of 66 years solely because they are not fully insurable due to their age.  This exclusion operates unfairly for over 66s because it deprives them of access to the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund even for payment of basic benefits directly related to their employment which are not dependent in any way on insurable status. I consider that they should be entitled to payment of those benefits and the order now before the House is designed to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The unpaid entitlements of persons over the insurable age limit which it is proposed to protect are as follows: wages, holiday pay, sick pay, awards under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, entitlements under the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, entitlements under the Employment Equality Act, statutory minimum wages under the Employment Regulation Order, court awards for wrongful dismissal at common law, and unpaid pension contributions.</P>
    <P>As with the original 1984 Act, the order will not confer new entitlements on workers.  It will merely ensure that existing entitlements not themselves dependent on the insurable status of workers are honoured.  The proposed order will have retrospective effect to insolvencies of employers which occurred on or after 22 October 1983, which is the effective date of application of the Act.</P>
    <P>The change which I am proposing, though beneficial, will affect only a small number of persons.  The number of potential beneficiaries will be limited because these will be confined to employees over the age of 66 years who happen to have been in employment where the employer has become insolvent. These are persons who would normally have been long standing contributors to social insurance during a life time of work and it is fair and <Col N="1560" /> reasonable that they should not be deprived of basic benefits under the Act solely on age grounds.  The costs or potential disadvantages of the extension will be minimal.</P>
    <P>The extension of the scope of the Act envisaged in the order was agreed with the social partners in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and I am sure that the House will also agree that if it is fully justified.  I commend the order to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome and support this measure.  In ordinary justice and fairness it is something which should have been rectified some time ago.  It is only right and proper that everybody, regardless of age, who is paying social welfare contributions should be protected in all areas in the event of an employer going out of business and leaving them high and dry without jobs.  One has to say that while the conditions in this country are not ideal, the provisions which are in existence for employees in the event of employers' insolvency certainly take the blunt edge off losing one's job and enable some cushioning to be given to workers until such time as they get other jobs.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister did not tell us how many people we are talking about in this.  He mentioned that it is not a large number and I am quite sure it is not.  It is possibly related to those people who are over the retirement age but who cannot afford to retire, who need to and must go on working because the provisions they have made themselves are not sufficient.  However small it is, we are looking into a future in which that number will get even smaller.  I look back in my time over a period when there were older people in jobs.  We did not have a crisis; we did not have the difficulties of unemployment we have at present and the pressures that are bringing about a revolution in the workplace.  People stayed in jobs and kept in those jobs all the experience, the wisdom and the skills they acquired over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us regret that that time has passed and that we have had this revolution which is forcing workers to give <Col N="1561" /> up their work at an earlier age.  I am one of those who believe that, if people want to work and are capable of it, it would be ideal if provision was made for them to stay on in their jobs.  The emphasis in recent years has been to get people to retire earlier.  We have had social policy and propaganda telling people that it is better for them to retire early and enjoy their money and their old age.  There are pre-retirement courses and so on.  I am not of the school of thinking which says that you can suddenly switch at 60 years of age from being an active, motivated worker one day to retirement the next day, with all the connotations it still holds.  I certainly regret that but one must also accept that we are in a very difficult time in this country and the same applies to other countries.</P>
    <P>We have a huge youth unemployment problem and we have to debate whose rights and whose needs are greatest.  Is it the needs of the young people who may never have had jobs, the young people who may be trying to establish families? Their need, in the long run, has to come before the need of people who have had a fulfilling and worthwhile work-life and who can maintain themselves through pensions and opt out of the workforce.  I still think we have a lot to do to change that twilight time, between the time when we all have very busy lives, highly committed regular days and weeks into the kind of nothingness you can have walking the dog and playing golf.  We have to approach that and do a bit more work on it to get people to understand that if it is essential to cut off the work era early then we have to put something else in its place.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should look at what is happening in Japan and in China where there is a very interesting movement towards voluntary work by people who are older and who can bring the skills and experience of their work into the training area. It is voluntary work on an unpaid basis. Maybe this is something we should look at.  I think we are going to have trouble in the future.  I am particularly concerned, given the new emphasis on this voluntary redundancy.  This is the new paradise. <Col N="1562" /> People are now being offered substantial sums of money, and a pension in some instances, on which they can just about live.  It is very attractive in the short term.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister at the moment is engaged in seeking up to 10,000 voluntary redundancies in the public sector.  I worry about this a little because I do not think we have looked at the social policy involved in all of this.  If you get 10,000 voluntary redundancies of a young age group &mdash; I know very young people are taking voluntary redundancy and going into semi-retirement &mdash; I wonder what are the implications down the line?  Have we any indications as a result of surveys or studies done elsewhere as to what happens to such a group of people?  What happens to their family life?  What happens to their sense of purpose and sense of self-esteem?  Do they go back into the workforce?  After two or three years do they join the tail end of the unemployment list again?  There is nothing to say that they cannot do this.  I am not convinced about this policy.</P>
    <P>I am particularly not convinced about it with regard to women workers.  This is something which came up when the Irish Congress of Trade Unions Women's Committee were addressing the all-party Committee on Womens' Rights.  There is a very disturbing ratio developing in this whole area of voluntary redundancy.  Of the workers, who have opted for voluntary redundancy the ratio is nine to one in favour of women.  Seventy per cent of the women who jumped at the offer were women with young children.  We have a huge number of working women in the age group where they would have young children.  They are probably having great difficulties with domestic responsibilities and with child care and they are opting for redundancy as a way out of their problems.  I will quote from a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday, 15 February, from a woman who has taken voluntary redundancy.  She writes to warn other women.  She says:</P>
    <P>I am very concerned that with apparently attractive lump sums on offer women who find the strain of working <Col N="1563" /> full-time and taking the lioness's share of domestic responsibilities, are opting for the short-term gain and paying the price of long term dependence.</P>
    <P>I believe passionately that women will never achieve true independence and freedom, unless we are economically independent.</P>
    <P>A word of warning to the thousands of women in the State sector who are currently considering redundancy &mdash; they might be tapping their calculators to the tune of &ldquo;They're playing our Dream&rdquo;, but should consider the lump sum in the context of an annual salary and not accept it unless they have definite possibilities for future employment.</P>
    <P>That is a realistic marker for women. Maybe the temptation is too great but it is something women should look at and examine right down the line because it is short-term gain but long-term dependency.</P>
    <P>Not a lot needs to be said on this.  We support the motion.  We agree with it.  I hope that sometime we might have a debate or discussion on the implications of people retiring or taking early redundancy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The vulnerability of employees in insolvencies is all too obvious. This enlightened Act to which the Order refers is concerned with protecting employment-related conditions in the case of legal redundancies.  The Act ensures that entitlements like unpaid wages or holidays which are due or other conditions are actually met from the central fund where there is a legal insolvency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make two points, on the basis that prevention is better than cure. Employers, generally, want to keep their businesses going.  Employees also want to see the companies thriving.  There are fly-by-nights in existence and the Companies Bill, which is at present before the Seanad, should help to correct that type of situation but, of course, no matter how employers and employees try some <Col N="1564" /> companies fail.  I want to make two points in connection with prevention.</P>
    <P>One is that unpaid taxes such as PAYE and PRSI can be the very first signal that a company is in trouble and ultimately may end up insolvent.  I know from studying experience that the Revenue Commissioners would be doing a favour to employers and to employees and to other stakeholders in companies if they moved for the prompt payment of taxes; in other words, take on the problem much earlier rather than leaving it much later when perhaps companies become insolvent. Then taxes remain unpaid as well as, tragically, people are out of jobs.</P>
    <P>My second point is related to another Bill the Minister has before the House at present: it has to do with information disclosure.  I want to return to this as a preventive measure as well.  Employees, who are the people who end up without jobs when companies close down due to insolvencies, are key stakeholders in any company.  They earn their livelihoods from these companies.  Almost invariably, they possess expertise which, if called upon by management when they are facing difficulties, could help to rescue the company.  After all, who are better positioned to make that type of contribution, even in the narrower sense of saving their jobs?  I think that the Worker Participation Bill, which is at present before the Seanad, and subsequently will go to the Dáil, will actually contribute to more involvement by employees in the running of the companies and will lead to greater information disclosure, albeit confined to certain State-sponsored bodies.  It is very much a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>While I am talking about State-sponsored bodies, it seems to me that if employees of Irish Shipping knew the score about that troubled company they could have contributed valuable insights into how the company might have been saved.  I recall at the time that company went into liquidation speaking to a staff representative in Irish Shipping who was in the dark about the charters that had been entered into, and felt that he, in <Col N="1565" /> common with many other employees, could have come up with a range of ideas to help rescue the company and keep it open.  Today's order has a much narrower focus.  I welcome this extension of the provisions of the main Act to this small number of people.  The cost will be minimal, and the order corrects an anomaly that was there up to the present time.  I warmly welcome the order and support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's return to this House with a second piece of progressive legislation.  This order deals with previous progressive legislation which was initiated by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, following a directive from the Community to legislate in this area where people were disadvantaged in the event of their employers, whether by accident or otherwise, getting into financial difficulties, being declared bankrupt, or being taken over by liquidators or receivers.  We extended a welcome to that legislation which ensured that the most vulnerable people in the closure of a company, the employees, were protected.  I agree with Senator Hillery who said they are usually the biggest losers in a situation like this and that if they were afforded the opportunity they probably could make a major contribution by way of sacrifices and giving advice to ensure that the company remain in business.</P>
      <P>However, the Act conferred on employees the first choice of compensation in the event of a company going to the wall.  Heretofore, agencies like Fóir Teoranta, the financial institutions, the banks, the Revenue Commissioners and all other vested interests were always the first to benefit but this legislation thankfully, put workers in their rightful place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the experience I have had in having the Act applied to certain employees who found themselves in this predicament, I am glad to say the liquidators and receivers used the Act very efficiently and fairly, and the fullest cooperation was always forthcoming from <Col N="1566" /> the Department of Labour, the co-ordinating Department which paid the cheques through the receiver or liquidator to the employees and later realised whatever assets were available.  That was a tremendous plus for the employees who had contributed to their company by their work, the sweat of their brow, who paid their taxes, PRSI and other funding, which were not always handed over to the Department of Social Welfare, the Revenue Commissioners, or the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>The Minister's order addresses one of the anomalies in this area, that is, private pension rights.  Some employees paid into pension funds but, unfortunately, at the date of liquidation some employers, I would suggest, absconded with those funds or used them for cashflow purposes instead of investing them in pension funds.  Perhaps the Minister would confirm that employees' unpaid pension contributions &mdash; covered in the additional list of categories &mdash; are private pension arrangements with companies and if a company goes into liquidation those pension rights will still be the employees' legal entitlement.  I am aware of at least two companies which, since this Act was introduced, used the employees' pension funds for other purposes, and we had the greatest difficulty in trying to ensure that the employees got their fair entitlement.</P>
    <P>The Minister is extending this order to people over the age of 66.  This, of course, applies in the private sector because only the private sector retain people of this age, and older.  These people could no longer be insurably employed, but they can and do make a major contribution to some companies.  It is a welcome fact that many companies request such people to stay on because of their wealth of experience and knowledge.  Anything which ensures that those type of employees are covered is to be welcomed.  I also welcome the fact that the Minister thought fit to bring this order before the Houses of the Oireachtas as to ensure that people in this category, a limited number but still with rights, are protected.  If I have any worry about the operation of the Act &mdash; and I make this comment from <Col N="1567" /> experience &mdash; as is it when the Act is applied to companies.</P>
    <P>To give the Minister an idea of the problem that can arise I give the example of Ballingarry Mines.  Their fortunes have fluctuated over a number of years.  They were bankrupt or went into receivership or liquidation despite the assistance given by Fóir Teoranta and others.  On the last occasion I was involved in negotiations to ensure that the employees received their rights under this Act.  The moment the employees got their rights a new operator of Ballingarry Mines could treat the coalfield as a green field and would have no obligation to the redundant employees who are experts.  These employees have given all their lives to the company and, in many cases, their health has suffered. They have been excluded from compensation retrospectively for diseases contracted underground.  I am worried that, in the event of new operators coming into the field they may not employ any of the local experts because, to all intents and purposes, legal and labour law, etc., there is no obligation on them to use the experts who are out there waiting in the knowledge that £30 million worth of assets are under the ground and capable of being mined successfully to the advantage of the economy, and definitely to the advantage of the Ballingarry coalfield area, which is decimated as a result of the closure of the mines.</P>
    <P>The only problem I have is that the legislation removes any obligation from any new employer to consider employing local experts.  There would be nothing to stop them importing expertise from Wales, South America, or any other part of the world to carry out the expert work in Ballingarry simply because the employees had all their rights met.  There would be no moral or legal obligation on them to take account of that.  However, that is for another day.</P>
    <P>Hopefully an employer will soon appear on the horizon and we will be able to convince him that there is a case to be made for the re-employment of the experts who live in the mining area, <Col N="1568" /> people who know nothing else but mining, and who are prepared &mdash; and were prepared on the last occasion &mdash; to make sacrifices, to work for nothing, in the interests of the mine owner.  Hopefully a new mine operator will take that into account and will not let the workings of this Act preclude him for employing local people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister thought it necessary, even for a limited number of people, in justice to extend the order to ensure that these people are covered.  Hopefully, too many people will not have to avail of this Act to ensure that their entitlements are protected.  In other words, I hope we do not have too many more liquidations, voluntary or otherwise, and that companies in this area, particularly with the National Development Corporation, will have an opportunity to survive in the economic climate the Government are trying to survive in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome and support this Order known as the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984 (Amendment) Order, 1988.  When the principal Act was enacted it received broad support and was welcomed at the time, and rightly so, as a very necessary protection for employees in the cases of company insolvencies. The Bill was introduced to comply with an October 1983 EC Directive. It was designed to give workers protection in the event of companies being wound up or going into liquidation in regard to the payment of wages, arrears of statutory minimum wages, holiday pay, payments on foot of company sick pay schemes, entitlement under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, the Employment Equality Act, 1977, the Unfair Dismissals Act and outstanding contributions to companies' pension schemes.  The payments, I understand, are restricted to eight weeks in the case of wages, holiday pay and amounts due under sick pay schemes.  This is in line with the EC Directive.  I believe it is correct and right that this protection <Col N="1569" /> should be extended to employees who have reached the age of 66 years and are still in employment.</P>
      <P>In view of the large number of insolvencies in the past five or six years, this legislation was most opportune and went a long way to alleviate the traumatic experience of individuals being made redundant, not alone for the worker but also for the family.  All too often in the past, workers were not provided for in the event of companies going into liquidation, many of the companies having failed in their basic responsibility to make the necessary PRSI and pension payments on behalf of their employees. Many of these companies which I would refer to as fly-by-night operators, all too often fold their tents and disappear overnight leaving behind a trail of unpaid creditors, broken investors and disenfranchised workers, only to appear a short time later flying a different flag and often operating out of the same building.</P>
      <P>The Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, which is at present in Committee Stage in the Seanad, will deal adequately with fraudulent operators and will give the necessary protection to employees.  This is to be welcomed.  In regard to insolvency generally, it is my belief that the whole area of preferential status should be carefully examined and consideration given to small companies.  I am not suggesting that they be given preferential status but that preferential status, as we know it, should be downgraded.  I would pose the question: why should the Revenue Commissioners who have a public duty to collect unpaid taxes within a reasonable time, be given this preferential status in the event of all outstanding taxes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a company get into trouble the first thing they usually do is to stop paying and making the necessary tax returns. They use these taxes as cashflow to continue to finance the company.  In many cases they are trading fraudulently &mdash; sometimes for five or six years.  When eventually the Revenue Commissioners put them into liquidation and a receiver is appointed, there is very little left for the unsecured creditors.  They get <Col N="1570" /> nothing.  Yet the Revenue Commissioners have this preferential status and they are looking for all the outstanding taxes.  I believe &mdash; and we should address this in the Companies (No. 2) Bill &mdash; that this preferential status for the Revenue Commissioners should be restricted to, say, two or three tax periods retrospective to the date of liquidation. Any outstanding taxes apart from that should be made accountable.  If they allow the company to trade fraudulently for four or five years they should be made accountable and there should be an investigation as to why the taxes were not collected.</P>
    <P>I believe also that we have to address ourselves to the great problem of unemployment. PRSI, as we know it, is a tax on employment.  An employer who gives somebody a job at £200 per week has to pay the Government £25 PRSI for the privilege of giving that person a job.  That was fine in good times, when price was not a factor, when it was a case of supply and delivery, and there was plenty of opportunity, but in these days that is a very important factor in the case of competitiveness. It is not helping to create the environment for investment that is so necessary if we are to tackle this problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Government have gone a long way in the past year in addressing the situation generally.  Inflation is at an all time low and interest rates have been reduced substantially. This is a help to investors, to people generally and to people who are repaying mortgages.  It is going some way to creating the necessary environment for investors.  All concerned must play their part, and that includes the Revenue Commissioners who have preferential status.  I include also the banks because they very often circumvent this preferential status by insisting on personal guarantees.  If you go to a bank now for a loan you will get nothing unless you have collateral.  Small investors and small employers often put up their houses as collateral.  Banks are making massive profits and, in these difficult times, they <Col N="1571" /> should be called on to make a contribution towards the environment that is so necessary for investors.</P>
    <P>I would also like to touch briefly on liquidations and receivers.  I question the qualification of receivers.  Certainly, they are excellent accountants.  They can prove anything on paper.  They can do cashflow projections, interim accounts, case studies and reports, but I often wonder have they got the necessary technical expertise when it comes to disposing of the assets of a company, which may have very high technical aspects.  Very often liquidators sell off massive technical assets in the field of mechanical and electrical engineering for a pittance without evaluating whether it would be better to retain these assets, taking into account that the IDA have made a massive investment in them, or if it would be better to retain these assets and bring in a firm of specialist consultants who would evaluate how they could be adapted to a future user of that factory.  In the Companies Act a case could be made for a Government receiver who would not depend on disposing of the assets, his first thoughts being to pay his own fees.  A case could be made for a Government liquidator who would go in and do a proper evaluation of the assets and not quickly dispose of them without doing a proper evaluation.</P>
    <P>I welcome this order.  The provisions should be extended to people who have reached the age of 66.  These people who have contributed all their lives to the social welfare system, are more entitled to this added privilege than anybody else. I am pleased to welcome and support the order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. As I said at the outset since we have no statistics it is difficult to know the number of employees over 66 years of age whose of employers have become insolvent.  I think we are talking about a very small number of people.  Nevertheless, that should not take away from the rights of these people who would normally have worked their <Col N="1572" /> entire lives and have been full contributors to the social welfare system.  If we did not pass this order they would be excluded from the benefits I outlined at the start.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris asked about employers' insolvency funds generally.  This is financed solely by employers' contributions which are collected as part of the employers' PRSI.  The current contribution rate is 0.6 per cent of employees' earnings up to a ceiling of £15,500 and the ceiling was increased in the budget from £15,500 to £16,200 effective from next April.  The fund is used to pay statutory redundancy and insolvency entitlements.  I was asked what was the expenditure for 1987.  In 1987 £4,034,396 was paid to 4,500 employees and 320 employments.  As Senators can see, that is a fairly substantial figure.  The last speaker mentioned redundancies and in that case the figure would be far greater.</P>
      <P>The Act protects outstanding pension contributions both for employers and employees for up to one year prior to the insolvency.  The question of employee entitlements would be a matter for the employees, their unions and the trustees of the pension fund.  I would agree that it is necessary for people to be vigilant. What Senator Hillery said was true.  If people had been more on the ball and had been more aware of the facts over the years some of these disasters might not have happened.  Nowadays trade unions, companies and trustees are more vigilant and are using more outside professional expertise to ensure that their investments in their pension funds are properly funded.  I know that creates a lot of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This anomaly was highlighted by the people involved in the Department monitoring this Act.  While the Act only affects a small number of people &mdash; and the section dealing with them is extremely busy &mdash; it was still thought desirable that we should pass this order to cover people who were being wrongfully deprived of benefits they had paid for under the 1983 Act.  Normally these people would be dealt with when the legislation was being <Col N="1573" /> amended but many small anomalies outstanding in various Bills are never dealt with.  Everybody accepts that these anomalies should be corrected.  We have all seen several examples of that over the years and the Department of Labour felt that it would be unfair if these people had to wait until then.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for its support on this order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is some time since we had an opportunity to discuss matters relating to the EC.  It is unfortunate that the last report we have from the EC, the 29th report dated January 1987, shows that even though we are a bit tardy about deliberating on matters relating to Europe, equally the Community is a little tardy in sending out reports.  It is disgraceful that the latest EC report available in the Library is dated January 1987. Somebody should look into this to ensure that in future the reports from the Community will be available to Members sooner than has been the case in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is opportune that we should discuss matters relating to Europe because for the first time, there seems to have been a very serious attempt made last week at the Heads of State meeting to address the various problems that have been besetting us in attaining the objectives of European union both on a political and financial base.  It is heartening to see that <Col N="1574" /> success has been reached in the financial area and that there is a chance within the next few years, that the finances of the Community will be brought to what they should be.  It is also heartening to see that there will be benefits for Ireland and for the other smaller nations of the Community in that there will be a change in how the contributions towards the European finances are gauged.  It is a major breakthrough that we are getting a straightforward changeover from the largely VAT-based contributions to contributions based on GNP.  There will be extra funds available to Ireland because of this and that.</P>
    <P>For many people the EC has been far less than a success.  When one sees the huge increase in unemployment that has beset the nations of Europe over the past number of years, it can be said that the European ideal has not been a successful one, particularly for the young in our society and, indeed, for those who have been working in traditional industries. The loss of jobs in every European country has been enormous.  Unfortunately, the loss of jobs in smaller countries, like Ireland, has been much greater than in the stronger economies, such as Germany. One of the reasons for our entry into the EC was to avail of the markets in Europe to increase our job potential and to improve the standard of living of our people.  We have a market of 320 million people.  As a group of countries we are the biggest importers in the world but the benefits of this huge market have not yet been attained by the people, particularly in this country and in other smaller countries.</P>
    <P>I hope, as a result of the meeting last week, and because the finances of the Community are being addressed in a sensible way for the first time, that this country will benefit to the extent of providing jobs for our very large number of young people.  This will be of benefit to the people and the nation in general.  At present we educate people to the highest level and unfortunately because of the lack of cohesion in the European market a large number of these people have to go outside the market to get jobs.  First, <Col N="1575" /> they have to go outside their country; secondly, they have to go outside the EC; and they end up benefiting stronger economies outside the European scene.</P>
    <P>Since we last discussed European matters the Single European Act has come into force and this will have a bearing on the progress of the Community.  It will have benefits which will accrue to Ireland but, equally, there are challenges to be faced in that the cross-country barriers will disappear in many areas of business and there will be extra competition.  This will be very good in certain areas, but it will be detrimental in others.  It is about time there was real competition in the area of finance.  Mention was made during the discussions on the previous legislation which went through of the huge profits the banks are making in this country, often to the detriment of business people and to the detriment of job creation.  It is time that banking became genuinely competitive.  I welcome the fact that there are indications that we will have international banking with real competition and that the present banking cartel will be broken up and that people will be able to get money at a reasonable price.  This should be of benefit not alone to the banks but to everybody.</P>
    <P>Another area that has been of major concern for a number of years has been the insurance industry.  Again, there has not been real competition in the insurance industry in Ireland.  The cost of insurance is diabolical.  When persons have claims they find that the small print is so small that it cannot really be read but it has a huge effect on the claimant's rights under a number of policies.  The cost to business of public liability, the cost to business of motor insurance and the cost of insurance for young people is horrendous.  The profits, it is said, in insurance are very small but the profits which insurance companies make on the investment of the funding from premiums are quite large.  It could be said that the insurance businesses are more involved in banking more than they are in insuring people.</P>
    <P>The completion of the internal market <Col N="1576" /> over the next number of years is an important element in the chance of progress. For too long we have had a fragmented market in Europe.  We have not been able, as they have in the United States and Japan, to use the huge market we have to the best advantage because of the problems associated with a fragmented market, with fragmented tax regimes and with border controls for goods travelling from country to country. We can only achieve the aims of an integrated Community when border controls &mdash; frontier controls &mdash; disappear and when the tax regimes within the Community are brought to a reasonable similarity.</P>
    <P>Since we last discussed a similar motion we have had a breakdown in financial markets which seemed to many people to be of a horrendous nature and we have heard of the huge losses made by individuals and companies because of the failure in financial markets but, of course, these failures were to a large degree failures on paper.  The price of shares had reached heights to which they were not entitled to go, and which had no bearing on the value of the companies in which the shares were being traded.  Paper changed hands, at enormous profits to certain individuals but, again, this was of little value to businesses or workers in the financial markets.  The computer seemed to take over and, thankfully, the computer seemed to have got it wrong. People in the financial markets, as in other markets, are now getting back to dealing with matters relating to finance as they should have been dealt with all the time.</P>
    <P>Since we last discussed this matter we have had huge threats to our environment within Europe.  In particular, we have had the threat to our environment, which is a very serious threat and which will continue for many years, as a result of the horrific accident at Chernobyl.  This has proved that, whether they be inside or outside the market, countries do not stand alone when they are addressing themselves to energy production, or to the production of elements which can be <Col N="1577" /> harmful to the environment.  The accident at Chernobyl was a preventable accident and we must ensure that we have every control over what happens in the production of energy, or in the production of elements which can be harmful to the environment.</P>
    <P>The co-operation we are getting from Britain in this area is not what it should be, as instanced by the Trawsfynydd and other experiments.  We have a situation where Britain seems to cock a snook at the rest of Europe and in particular at us when it comes to nuclear production of energy from old fashioned outdated nuclear reactors.  The EC on a Community basis will have to ensure that within any country in Europe the Community has the right to check everything that goes on in that area.  If they do not have that right we could have a major catastrophe such as that which befell Europe as a result of the Chernobyl incident.</P>
    <P>The spread of AIDS in the past couple of years has been one of the greatest epidemics to hit both Europe and the rest of the world.  This disease presents a great danger to humanity within the Community.  This is a matter to which the Community has not addressed itself.  It may be that certain people do not want to admit that this is a threat of enormous magnitude but the Community must address itself to the problem with more diligence than it has done in the past.  It is something that will not go away.  It has enormous potential for death and also in terms of personal relationships.</P>
    <P>Apart from being the biggest market in the world the Community is the largest contributor of aid to world bodies. Member governments should be complimented that they have always addressed themselves to aid on the basis of need and not on the basis of political implications.  One of the reasons certain major traders and major countries do not get involved in sending aid to particular countries is because of the political situations in these countries.  Unfortunately poverty does not recognise politics. Because certain countries do not agree with the politics of countries which are in <Col N="1578" /> dire need sometimes the aid is not as heartily given as it should be.  The European countries in general have been very good in this area.</P>
    <P>However, the delivery of aid should be addressed more realistically.  There is not much point in sending grain to Ethiopia if it affects the small farmers there when they do have a harvest and suddenly find they cannot sell the only cash crop they have because food is coming in totally free.  This eliminates from the budget of the small indigenous farmer any hope he had of a cash flow.  The objectives of organisations like Gorta should be the objectives we should have in terms of our aid, that is, to provide the means for people to provide for themselves.  At times there will be the need to send food urgently but we must address ourselves to the realities of small farming in these donee countries.</P>
    <P>The increase in technology and technological transfers has not been addressed on a Community-wide basis.  I am glad that we set up a ministry to deal with technology immediately after the last election, developments in that area are being seen already.  That is another area that has not been addressed significantly by the EC.</P>
    <P>In Ireland there is quite an amount of emigration at present, there is a lot of immigration into the EC as well.  This immigration to a large degree is from Third World countries and the people coming in unfortunately are not treated within the EC as having equal status. One only has to go to cities like Paris or Brussels or to cities in Germany to see the huge numbers of people from Third World countries working in very menial and lowly paid jobs who live in Third World conditions.  They are being ripped off by landlords in the EC countries.  They are a group of people who must be looked after because not alone is it in the interests of the people who come in for these jobs but it is equally in the interests of the European Community that these people have a proper place to live and that their working conditions should improve.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons we should address <Col N="1579" /> this matter is that the numbers of people coming in are growing at an enormous rate, their birth rate is much higher than the European average and it is true that there is one <i>arrondissement</i> of Brussels at present which has a total Muslim representation on the city council there.  The same would apply in certain areas in Paris.  This is a growing European problem. It does not affect us that much but on a matter of common humanity it is something the EC should address.  The EC has a number of agreements which are made with countries outside the EC. We must ensure that if we are trading with countries from outside the EC, these countries obey the rules of association with the EC.</P>
    <P>I must address myself particularly to problems associated with trade with Israel.  The Israelis have a very good co-operation convention with the EC from which they benefit enormously.  It is very hard to quantify it except to say that every night, for five months of the year a Boeing 727 leaves Tel Aviv with nothing but cut flowers.  The level of trade with Israel is enormous but unfortunately we are dealing with a country which does not give to people who are under their control any degree of support.</P>
    <P>In recent months the EC Commission made an agreement with Israel that goods which were manufactured or produced in the West Bank and Gaza could be brought into the EC without going through the Agresco, the Israeli agricultural co-op on the one hand, or through any trading group in Israel for manufactured goods.  The agreement was that 12 of the chambers of commerce in the West Bank and Gaza would have rights to stamp certificates of origin and the certificate of origin would state that the goods came from the West Bank or Gaza and would be signed by one or other of the 12 chambers of trade.  This would have meant a big boost to the people in the occupied territories as they would have been able to get their goods into Europe without going through Israel and They would not have to pay Israeli merchants for the right to export.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1580" /> As an indication of the goodwill of Israel &mdash; and this is the reason I raise it &mdash; the Gazan fruit company decided to send four crates of oranges as a commercial present to Claude Chasson, the EC Commissioner, as an initial test case. Two were to go by air and two were to go by sea.  Seven weeks later the oranges were still sitting in Gaza because the Israelis would not allow them to go through. The week before last the Israeli Minister to the EC was called in as a result of a problem which arose with goods imported from Ramallah in the West Bank into England.  The stamp of the Ramallah chamber of commerce was on the certificates of origin and the country of origin was down as the West Bank.</P>
    <P>The goods arrived in England but luckily somebody at import control checked the documentation and found that the documents had been forged.  The documentation had been changed from Ramallah to Israel and the country of origin was stated as Israel.  The EC made an agreement in good faith with Israel but the Israelis would not abide by the agreement.  The two incidents are actual facts and they can be confirmed through the EC Commission, through Mr. Morgan who is the EC Commission representative in Tel Aviv.</P>
    <P>As Europeans we must address ourselves to the plight of the Palestinians who are living in such horrific conditions. Some are daily being beaten to death. Some are being shot and others are being subjected to the most horrific treatment &mdash; I will not call it genocide &mdash; they are being treated as inhuman by an Israeli Army.  This is the army of a country which is supposed to be a friendly country towards Europe.  When I say people are being beaten to death I mean they are being beaten to death.  I have medical certificates here which are horrific, showing the numbers of deaths and the numbers injured.</P>
    <P>Israel must be brought before the table of international justice.  We in Europe have a part to play in this.  The Europeans played a major part in the setting up of the State of Israel.  European countries, apart from Ireland, raped and ravaged <Col N="1581" /> the Middle East for many hundreds of years.  The problems in Israel are to a large degree the responsibility of Europe. Europe can play a major part in trying to resolve the problems in that area.  There is only one way the problems can be resolved and, that is, to ensure that the Palestinians get a State of their own.  This is admitted by everybody in the world apart from the Israelis and to a lesser degree by the United States of America. The Israelis say that they will not talk to the PLO because they are terrorists. There will be no peace in that area until the Israelis get down to talking to the Palestinians and until a Palestinian State emerges.  Europe can play a major role in this.  An international conference should be convened.  Over the past number of years the EC have supported that notion.</P>
    <P>The best way to resolve any problem is for the two protagonists to sit down face to face.  It must happen sooner or later.  The reason an international conference is possibly the best way at present is that the Israeli Government will not take any steps towards the resolution of the problem.  In the Knesset &mdash; the Israeli Parliament &mdash; there is an inept parliament who cannot make decisions and who have to be spurred on by some outside influence.  The major outside influence in the past has been the United States.  The only decision of any major importance made by Israel over the past number of years since 1948, was the reduction in the level of inflation which was forced upon them by the United States because of the huge inflation rates caused by the devaluation of the shekel in Israel.</P>
    <P>The Camp David accords were at the instigation of America and the Egyptian-Israeli accord again, was at the instigation of the USA.  Israel on their own will do nothing.  They must have outside influence and, in the end, the problem can only be resolved by the Israelis sitting down at some stage face to face with the terrorists.  In the past there have been terrorists on the one side and freedom fighters or patriots on the other.</P>
    <P>There is not a country in the world that did not have to sit down and resolve <Col N="1582" /> its problems, France had to do it with Algiers.  Britain has had to do it with many countries, including Ireland.  The European Community must sit down and resolve their problems.  One might wonder why we should spend so much time speaking on this issue which is of importance not only to the Middle East region but to those of us in Europe.  It is the near east; it is very close to us and a number of countries in that area have developed a nuclear potential.  There is a certain amount of instability in many countries and what happens in that area could very well break across the boundaries into Europe and Europeans could find themselves engulfed in a major conflict in that area.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that all the conflicts in the area will be resolved if the Israeli-Palestian conflict is resolved but at least it would be one element in the equation which would have a stabilising effect, which would be of strategic importance in terms of world strategy and of major importance to the people of the major religions in the world, when one considers that the three major religions in the world have their origins in that area. Europe is going through a period of relative political stability and because of this stability it can address itself to instabilities in areas outside the Community where it has connections.</P>
    <P>The report before us is the 29th report: I hope we get the 30th report before January 1992.  By that stage the internal market, as planned, will be complete.  I hope what was started in Brussels last week will continue, that the arrangements that are being made in terms of the financing of the Community will bear fruit and that the disproportionate amount of money and the good things in life which are held by the central Europeans will be spread out and that as a result we, on the periphery of Europe, will be able to benefit as was originally intended.  I welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion and I sincerely hope that in the future we will be able to deal with European matters more quickly than we have been able to in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to join with the Leader of the House in addressing this motion which takes note of developments in the Community. While being as brief as possible, I want to structure my contribution, under the following areas: the agreement between the Heads of State and its implications for Ireland, particularly in regard to cereals and milk production; the implications of the new dimension to the milk quota system; the possible extension of the disadvantaged areas; regional policy and how it will affect Ireland; unemployment in this country and throughout Europe and how we compare with our neighbours; and the definition of neutrality as accepted by our Community partners, as espoused at the recent Stockholm Conference. This deals with the last subject mentioned by Senator Lanigan in regard to the problems in the Middle East, the problems of the Palestinians, the workings of UNWRA and the contribution that we, as a small nation involved in peace-keeping duties with UNIFIL in Lebanon, can make in this area of international tension.  This country has a clear and unambiguous policy in regard to the resettlement of the Palestinians and indeed the rights of Israel to secure, safe borders and a state of its own.</P>
      <P>Last week we welcomed the fact that the Heads of State achieved a settlement, temporary or otherwise, which I believe was the best that could have been achieved from our point of view in very difficult circumstances.  It required a step backwards on the part of the Prime Minister of our nearest neighbour for their settlement to be achieved and, fortunately for us on this occasion, the Single European Act stood in our favour.  Those who supported the Single European Act as the basic treaty governing the future development of the Community were satisfied that it would establish a balance between the creation of a single market, involving internal free trade, the free movement of people and capital, the development of the poorer regions and a reduction in regional disparities within the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This second objective is referred to as <Col N="1584" />&ldquo;Economic and Social Cohesion&rdquo;.  Many of us felt that if there was not cohesion in a European context that small and poorer nations such as Ireland would suffer within the large club of the powerful European nations.  This can be seen if one looks at figures quoted by the OECD in a report issued this month dealing with GDP/GNP in the OECD area.  The report stated that in worldwide terms the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Canada are among the top performers.  For instance the United States' share in 1982 was 40.6 per cent.  It had increased by 2.9 per cent in 1986, 2.75 per cent in 1987 and 2.5 per cent in 1988.  Those are the figures for the United States and yet they are experiencing difficulties.</P>
    <P>Let us compare those figures with the Irish figures.  The figures for Ireland in 1982 was 0.2 per cent, in 1986, it was - 1.6 per cent; in 1987, it was 2 per cent; this year it is expected to be -.25 per cent and in 1989 it is expected that it will be at zero.  Those figures put in context the importance of being a member of a club which is fairly powerful.  Dealing under the conventions of the GATT with powerful nations throughout the world this cohesion and the Single European Act gives us some assurances that we can survive and perform to the best of our ability among that company in spite of our massive unemployment figures and the massive emigration we have to contend with.</P>
    <P>Under the title &ldquo;Economic and Social Cohesion&rdquo;, the Single European Act states, and I quote:</P>
    <P>In order to promote its overall harmonious development, the Community shall develop and pursue its actions leading to the strengthening of its economic and social cohesion.  In particular, the Community shall aim at reducing disparities between the various regions and the backwardness of the least-favoured regions.</P>
    <P>None of us will argue with that aspiration. We live in one of the disadvantaged areas within the Community and we are disadvantaged in many respects.  We live on <Col N="1585" /> a small island, very far away from the golden triangle centred around the headquarters in Brussels and the nations of Germany and Britain who are major contributors to the Community.  We have in the past been excellent Europeans: at times we have been accused of being too good.  When you join a group you must be prepared to carry out your responsibilities but we must never be afraid to argue our case based on justice and equality.</P>
    <P>We were forced to accept a milk quota regime which initially proved difficult. However, under the terms of that regime many of the major milk producers in the country were able to survive and indeed increased production in some cases.  That has now changed.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food in the middle of last year announced a further imposition in the quota regime which required that in the second phase of the milk cessation scheme people would have to voluntarily opt out of milk production.  Unfortunately, most of those who voluntarily opted out of milk production in the second phase of the cessation scheme were from the West.  The Minister, in consultation with ICOS, decided that he would not accept some of these voluntary applications on the basis that if he were to do so it would prove detrimental for the co-operative movement in the west.  To reach his overall target the Minister imposed a penalty on other milk producing areas.  I am particularly concerned about my own area in Munster which traditionally is a milk producing area.  All the co-operatives in Munster, such as Mitchelstown and Tipperary, have objected to the introduction of this penalty even though some of their members have decided to opt out of milk production.  If this philosophy is followed through those involved in milk production in Munster, and in my own county of Tipperary in particular, will be forced out of production because they have exceeded the quota and because of the penalties imposed by the Minister. As a consequence, co-operatives which have expanded and improved their milk processing capabilities will have very <Col N="1586" /> little, if any, milk to process and the consequence of this for employment will be disastrous.  Under this new milk regime, I ask the Minister to look again at the concept that people must, in addition to their other efforts, get out of milk production.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the backwardness of the least favoured regions as referred to under the heading &ldquo;Reform of EEC Regional Policy and Implications for Ireland&rdquo;.  These are commonly known as disadvantaged areas.  Many parts of this country are classified under different categories such as, most severely disadvantaged, less severely disadvantaged, disadvantaged for certain animal and other products.  Parts of Ireland are designated as being in need of special assistance. This Government and the previous Government admitted that following the major review, and increase in acreage, that took place after the first application, certain anomalies remained in areas, which, having regard to the criteria laid down, should have qualified for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas and that other areas which had already been classified would now be classified upwards by one category.  The consensus before the last general election was that this would take place.  The outgoing Government submitted an application along these lines which included areas which had previously been left out in error or otherwise, so that these areas could be reclassified.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister as to how far down the road this Government have gone under that heading. Have we formally applied to the Community to have some areas redesignated and for other areas, which had been excluded, included?  If so, have we lodged the application with the Community and have the Commission accepted our application? Has it been successful?  If so, what contribution will the Community make and what contribution will be expected from the Exchequer?  When will additional grants be paid to people in these areas?  I ask those questions on the basis of the importance of maintaining family farms, not large ranch holdings or <Col N="1587" /> large milk producing farms in the deluxe lands of the Golden Vale or elsewhere. We should remember the family farms on the mountains of Gleann Cois a Binne, Slievenamon and Gleann a Sceach and those areas which have been left out in the past, such as north of Cappawhite and Hollyford which are areas we know from the criteria laid down should qualify under these new categories.  Perhaps the Minister, either now or at some future time, might communicate with me as to the progress he is making in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that as many people as possible remain on the land, on family farms and stay in an occupation in which they are happy, particularly, since industrial employment or employment in service industries is totally alien to the kind of livelihood they are accustomed to. Remote areas are home for them and they are places in which they have managed to bring up families in peace and happiness.  The least we owe them is the redesignation of disadvantaged areas. Prior to the last general election the present Government gave a commitment that they would do this.</P>
    <P>With regard to the share out of resources between the three Structural Funds, the broad outline of the Commission is that 80 per cent of the Regional Fund will be allocated to objective (i) of the five priority objectives they have proposed in regard to reform of the Structural Funds which is the achieving of and the growth and adaptation of structurally backward regional economies so that they can be fully integrated into the Community. We also know that objective (ii) will be financed mainly from the Social Fund.  This objective reads as follows: &ldquo;Converting declining industrial regions by helping them to develop new activities&rdquo;. This is a very laudable aspiration for the Commission and the Community to hold.  The bulk of assistance of objective (v) will be from the FEOGA Guidance Section but the ERDF and the ESF will also make contributions.  Objective (v) reads as follows: &ldquo;Assisting the adjustment of agricultural structures and <Col N="1588" /> the development of rural areas&rdquo;.  That is in line with the case I have made in regard to the milk quota and what I feel the Minister should be doing as regards the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The unemployment figure at present is unacceptable to the Government, the Opposition and to the community at large.  It does not compare very favourably with the figure in any of the other member states of the Community with the exception of Spain.  On page 38 of the OECD report I mentioned earlier the question of the unemployment figure for Ireland is dealt with.  This is one of the reasons I am anxious to ensure that as many people as possible remain on the land.  According to the OECD the unemployment rate in Ireland in 1986 was 17.4 per cent; in 1987, it was 18.25 per cent; in 1988, it is expected to be 19.5 per cent and next year it is predicted that it will be 19.75 per cent which, in fact, will then be higher than the Spanish rate of unemployment.  If we compare that figure with the figure, for example, in Austria which is outside the Community or with Belgium, which is within the Community, we can see that Ireland is certainly a least-favoured area.  We have a major role to play in trying to maintain people on small holdings and in generating new employment in the industrial sector.  If we fail to do so we will be at a severe disadvantage. There will be nothing left for our people except the emigration boat.  In towns and villages all over the country people who were committed to this country are being forced out because there is no future for them here.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me deal with the point raised by Senator Lanigan who is a committed parliamentarian and who has taken part in many Middle-East peace initiatives over the past ten or 12 years. He has never allowed himself to be deterred from what he has considered to be a just cause &mdash; the extension of rights to the Palestinians.  In this context I would like to quote from the &ldquo;Document of the Stockholm Conference&rdquo; which was printed in September 1986, a conference <Col N="1589" /> at which Ireland was represented.  Under the heading &ldquo;Refraining from the Threat or use of Force,&rdquo; on page 2, at paragraph 9, it states:</P>
    <P>The participating States, recalling their obligation to refrain, in their mutual relations as well as in their international relations in general, from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, accordingly reaffirm their commitment to respect and put into practice the principle of refraining from the threat or use of force, as laid down in the Final Act.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 10 states:</P>
    <P>No consideration may be invoked to serve to warrant resort to the threat or use of force in contravention of this principle.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 11 states:</P>
    <P>They recall the inherent right of an individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs, as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 12 states:</P>
    <P>They will refrain from any manifestation of force for the purpose of inducing any other State to renounce the full exercise of its sovereign rights.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 13 states:</P>
    <P>As set forth in the Final Act, no occupation or acquisition of territory resulting from the threat or use of force in contravention of international law, will be recognised as legal.</P>
    <P>That is the position of the United Nations and the position of the Stockholm Conference at which we were represented. It is totally contrary to what the Israeli Government are now doing in the occupied territories.  The United Nations in Resolution 607 in January, instructed Israel that they had no legal or international right to expel civilians from the <Col N="1590" /> occupied territories.  Yet, innocent people have been deported and people have been tried in courts on flimsy evidence. People who have been arrested and not tried have been deported from their homeland.  Tragically, they all happen to be Palestinians.  I am struggling that we as a nation which provides troops for the UNIFIL forces and which participates to the full in the United Nations, must exercise all our influence &mdash; because we are respected worldwide &mdash; to bring forward, with our colleagues in the European Community, the concept of an international peace conference which will address itself to the problems of the Middle East.</P>
    <P>Last week in a European capital I was honoured to be asked to be an observer on a peace mission which was considered to be in compliance with the Resolution of the United Nations of 5 January.  I, together with other international observers and witnesses from countries throughout Europe, including Ireland, England, Italy, Malta, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, the Scandinavian countries, Czechoslovakia, the United States of America as well as Arabs, members of the Israeli Parliament and other concerned people, joined together in solidarity with these refugees and deportees who were making an effort &mdash; as a token gesture of peace &mdash; to return to their homeland by ship.  Unfortunately, the Israeli Government made every effort in a European capital to obstruct what was recognised as being an international peace mission.  They used bribes, ultimatums, and their trade union movement to intimidate other ship workers, who were told that if they sailed on this boat or on any other boat they would never again be allowed to sail on a boat servicing Haifa or any other Israeli town. Finally, when another friendly nation provided a boat and before the peacekeepers could board it, the Israelis bombed the boat.  They blew a hole in it to prevent the peacekeepers from setting sail in it.</P>
    <P>This boat of peace was intended to provide a facility for Palestinian people <Col N="1591" /> to return to their own homeland to where they could live in peace without threat of exile.  All of us in this House and all of those international observers uphold international law.  We all uphold the Resolutions of the United Nations in regard to the rights of the Palestinians, which were espoused by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in this House before Christmas.  Therefore, many of us consider that that voyage of peace was within the context of the United Nations Charter.  This is a historic turning point in the question of the occupied territories and the Palestinian people.  I would like to think that Ireland, as part of the Community, would express solidarity with them when they make sacrifices, which Senator Lanigan has seen at first hand, in the uprising of civilian revolt against intimidation.  All they are trying to do is to liberate their occupied territories.  I would like to think that we would reaffirm our solidarity with them as to their right to national self-determination.</P>
    <P>Lest some of the reports as to the type of people on the boat coming from the Israeli Government might gain credence, let me say that included among them were some of the most eminent civil leaders such as the deported Mayor of Hebron, and some of the most eminent religious leaders whose only offence was to defend the rights of their Palestinian brothers and sisters.  Let me give a short list of those, particularly the religious leaders, who endeavoured to sail on this boat with the deportees and refugees. They included His Eminence, Sheikh Abdul Hamid Al Sayyaye, the most important religious Muslim leader ever to tread the sacred ground of Palestine; His Grace Archbishop Hilarian Capucci, a Greek Catholic deported by the Israeli authorities and given refuge by His Holiness the Pope and given a special responsibility by the Holy Father to ensure that he would maintain a religious link with his people; Dr. Alfred Lilienthal, one of the foremost American Jewish Rabbis who participated in an ecumenical prayer service.  If Jews and <Col N="1592" /> people of other religions can participate in a religious ceremony together, why can they not live together?</P>
    <P>Also on board was His Grace Bishop Kouri of Jerusalem; Monsignor Jacques Gaillot, who is one of the foremost liberal thinkers in the Catholic Church and Bishop of Normandy; and Dom Bernard O'Dea from the Order of St. Benedict in Glenstal Abbey, whom I was privileged to accompany.  Glenstal is the home of ecumenism and it was appropriate that Father Bernard was with us.  He also participated in the religious ceremony.  Also on board were Revenued Tony Crowe, an Anglican missionary from England, Reverend Fr. Mintoff, the Catholic founder of the peace movement of Malta and brother of the previous Socialist Prime Minister of Malta.  They were assisted by Fr. Briot. O.P. of Lyons in France, Fr. Barth O.P. of Paris, with many other great religious people.  They were the people who were on this boat trying to identify in solidarity and to supervise the type of project we were doing, which is part of a community problem to help with the Palestinians.</P>
    <P>We all want this cycle of violence to be stopped.  I know, and Senator Lanigan is aware, that the Palestinians want a just and honourable peace.  I know from talking to Jewish and Israeli people that the people of Israel want peace and security, and none of us would deny them that. We have to insist that in any peace conference this should be emphasised so that there will be an incentive for them to sit down at an international conference.  We were hoping this mission of peace would bring a sign of hope to the Palestinians that they could live in peace with one another.  An international peace conference is essential.  Negotiations and guarantees under international law are essential for any peace-making process, but a just and lasting peace is the only real guarantee to ensure the security of the Israeli people.</P>
    <P>That is why we were involved in the mission.  That is why I was honoured to be chosen as one of the observers.  That is why thinkers and religious professors, scholars, artists and the international <Col N="1593" /> media were part of this process, not as trouble-makers but as people involved in this process of bringing people together to live within the United Nations Charter in that area.  I commend Senator Lanigan for his efforts and the information he has brought back from his visit to Gaza, the West Bank, Hebron and Jerusalem and outlying villages.</P>
    <P>Ireland as part of the EC can play a major role, can be a catalyst in this, because we have our problems where religious beliefs have devided us.  We have problems that became political though initially they were religious.  We must know the implications of religious strife which leads to political tragedy and loss of life of innocent civilians and so we have a major role within the development of the European Communities to stimulate every effort in this area, I commend the Minister for his interest in this.  I hope sincerely that he will listen to the plea I made to him privately about the funding of UNRAWA, the United Nations Relief and Work Agency, which is working under the United Nations Charter which helps the fund, a Government in exile, almost, in Palestine, to ensure that people have schools to go to, that they have social services, that they have hospitalisation and health clinics and some semblance of humanity within refugee camps which, as Fr. Bernard said, Palestinians have been born into, have been gestated in, married in, got sick in, had problems of violence and violation of all their human dignity, and have died in. People outside know nothing of a refugee camp.</P>
    <P>How can we in our small way sit back and take no interest in what is happening in that tragic land?  Surely we have an obligation within the EC framework to stimulate any and every initiative which will bring the great powers together, the United States, the Russians, the Israelis, the PLO and the Syrians who have a major input to make in this whole process. That is a challenge and, while it might be slightly outside the inward looking European countries, we trade with those people, we have an interest in them, we support them financially.  Let <Col N="1594" /> us now follow it through with the political initiative at EC level and at United Nations level to ensure that an international peace conference will take place.</P>
    <P>I commend the efforts of the Minister in his capacity as Minister of State in this area and look forward to working with him, but the UNRAWA must not be neglected because of the financial restrictions in this country at the moment.  The demands being made on them since before Christmas have increased twofold from what was the normal unacceptable level of camp life.  Now that there are curfews and everything else applied in many of these little villages and towns, UNRAWA's survival and their proper funding by us, by the EC and by all other nations and the United Nations is more essential than ever before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The fairly lengthy period under discussion in the motion before the House today covers a significant time in the evolvement of the European Community.  Perhaps I could be accused of repetition when I say that it is regrettable we must discuss three or four six-monthly statutory reports all together.  However, the Minister very kindly came into the House to open this debate on 19 November last.  Nevertheless we still have quite a bit to catch upon.</P>
      <P>I am very happy to see that our distinguished Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, is back working again and we all rejoice in that.  We must look at the remarkable progress which has been achieved in the EC in the past two years and cast our minds back and remember that, among the main milestones during that period, going back to the London Council meeting in 1986, were the progress then reported, the achievement of a consensus on the convergence of economic and technical policies, the accession of the two new member states, Spain and Portugal, which brought us up to a Community of 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adoption of the Common Fisheries Policy must be making reasonable progress or we would certainly be hearing <Col N="1595" /> more about it in the press.  Of course, the main thing was the agreement and the decision of the people in the Community to adopt a Single European Act.  While some people may legitimately hold the view that last week's summit meeting may not have been as successful as some would have liked, the fact still remains that last week's summit succeeded in putting the flesh by the European Council on the Single European Act, because it has provided the means whereby the aspirations and the terms of the Single European Act will be and can be implemented over the next five or six years and indeed more.</P>
    <P>That is something on which we have a great obligation, and as the Seanad we should avail of every opportunity to encourage the people of Ireland to use the next four years, between now and the extraordinarily important date of 1992, when the internal market, we hope, will be a reality.  This will certainly have benefits for this country if we put our backs and our minds to it and are prepared to reap those benefits.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if we just sit back and crib and complain and perhaps pray or look for derogations, I firmly believe our economy, or significant portions of it, will be swamped.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Government and both Houses of the Oireachtas will take every opportunity to emphasise that the main task of every person who is interested in the evolvement of the EC and in improving the living and working conditions of everyone in Ireland is to become preoccupied in ensuring that this country as a republic and as a full member of the European Communities will prepare and gear ourselves to the challenge of reaping whatever benefits there possibly can be by way of increased training opportunities and by way of freer access to the markets of the other 11 member states. We have only ourselves to blame if we fail in that task.  As a politician I feel that we in the Seanad must accept the burden of doing what we can to highlight the problem and to make the choices and the decisions as easy as possible for individual <Col N="1596" /> industries in our constituencies and in the country to assist them in gearing themselves for the great challenge that lies ahead.</P>
    <P>We all agree that with the Single European Act, the European Communities took a significant step forward and it could be described as the second great step in the whole history of the European Community after the original signing of the Treaty by the founding fathers.  While the success of enlargements of the Community were notable events, the ratification by the present 12 member states of the Single European Act which came into force last July must surely be the turning point in the fortunes of the Community. Last week's summit decision is of great importance and cannot be overstressed. The Single European Act enshrines in the Treaty of Rome the 1992 deadline for the achievement of the internal market, and the success that the heads of state achieved last weekend in reaching a consensus and agreement on the budget and on the funding of the provisions of the Act in the next number of years put us all on notice that we must do our part.</P>
    <P>It will be much easier for Ireland if we make an early start.  Might I suggest that as a start the Government should demonstrate their belief in the future after 1992.  George Orwell wrote his book on 1984.  People had been reading it for 30 or 40 years and 1984 came and went.  The Government, and especially the chief executives of each of the 120 or 130 semi-State organisations that we have should be brought together and a strategy should be designed and devised to ensure that every economic sector are aware of the possibilities and will ignore them at their peril.  I would like to see, for instance Coras Tráchtála, the IDA, SFADCo and the other development organisations at least holding a seminar initially to assist the productive sectors in embarking on whatever strategy we need in order to turn this magical date to our advantage.</P>
    <P>It will not come automatically.  Knowing Irish people as I do &mdash; and I am sure my colleagues will agree with me &mdash; unless they are badgered and pushed into <Col N="1597" /> it they will do nothing and they will be whistling past the graveyard in 1992 when this country will be swamped with merchandise and products from each of the other 11 member states and we will have the prospect then of increasing dole queues and greater unemployment.  On the other hand, if we prepare and devise an effective strategy we can completely turn that prospect not into increasing dole queues but increased job opportunities so that with quality Irish produce and merchandise we will be able to reap the benefit that the free internal market holds out for us.</P>
    <P>We should remember that almost coinciding with that date we may have access to Europe through the new Channel tunnel.  That should make the European market much more accessible to us. There will be only one short sea crossing and it will mean that our juggernauts or freezer lorries will be able to get to the main European markets considerably faster.  We must be prepared for this kind of eventuality.  It is not just sufficient any more for this country to send our Ministers and our senior civil servants across looking for derogations or enhanced grants and continuing on this traditional system of taking not only the begging bowls but our cáibíns as well.</P>
    <P>That must stop.  We have a challenge here and I believe the present generation of Irish entrepreneurs have it in them to turn this opportunity into a golden one for the country.  The success on the one hand that the heads of state achieved at the summit last weekend should overshadow the fact that there were a few areas about which many Irish people can justifiably feel peeved or aggrieved.  For instance, from an agricultural point of view I think the restrictions in the Common Agricultural Policy or the reform which is so important to our economy will be difficult enough to accept and to integrate.  The one aspect that I personally greatly regret is that the Commission of the European Communities for the very first time should have embarked on the very negative policy of encouraging farmers and producers to do nothing by offering this set-aside grant to <Col N="1598" /> people, especially in cereals, not to grow them.  The quota system as we got to know it over the last couple of years has crept into the milk sector and the sugar agreement and for the last couple of years it has been applied to cereals.</P>
    <P>The new policy of setting aside land and leaving it fallow is one that cannot endear itself or be attractive to Irish farmers, large or small.  The reason I say that is that, even if a landowner wants to avail of that, it will be almost impossible for the people who are adjoining him to carry on farming successfully if an acreage over the hedge is left to grow thistles and every type of noxious weed which will pollute the entire surroundings.  I would have thought the Commission would have come up with a more progressive policy, one of encouraging the farming community perhaps to grow energy crops, to change from producing agricultural commodities which are in over-supply and in intervention storage which is costing the European taxpayer considerable amounts of money.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that with the great advances made in technology over the past few years the Commission should have encouraged or placed greater emphasis on the production of energy crops.  For instance, they should have jazzed up the desirability of farmers going more into forestry.  The present position here is that people consider marginal land only as suitable for forestry. That tradition has grown here because it is the only good use one could put marginal land to, whether it was predominantly peatland or mountain land. Nevertheless, we must accept the fact that even the best of mineral soils will grow trees even better than marginal land.  I know the return is perhaps slower and the fact is quite evident across the country that there are very few hardwoods being sown.  This is an opportunity for the Commission to put in a realistic proposal for farmers to get into energy production.</P>
    <P>Similarly, new technology has meant that it would be profitable for Irish farmers to grow an energy crop such as rape seed &mdash; to produce rape seed oil as an <Col N="1599" /> energy crop.  This would not only mean that the land allocated to the growing of rape seed or sunflower oil would not be adding to the food mountain, whether in cereals or sugar beet, but would be an import substitution for fossil fuels which we are told will be in declining supply after 2015 or 2016.  Since the new technology now available here has provided automotive power which can more than compete with fossil fuels, I would have thought that the DG17 or the commission with responsibility for the environment or the commission with responsibility for transport in addition to the agricultural commission would have been anxious to embark on such a course of action.  Perhaps that can remain for the future.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the European Parliament in the past year, during the term which is the subject of the motion before the House, have been extremely active and they have adopted resolutions which embrace a tremendous area, all of which are of interest to the Irish people, an environmental policy.  We had last year passing through the Oireachtas the new legislation on clean air which has been implemented by most county councils, with very little results to date.  We have also had in the European Parliament significant debates on the problem of the &ldquo;glasshouse effect&rdquo; as a result of certain aerosol pollutants.  While the US Government have introduced legislation which bans some products, I think the EC as a whole have tended to ignore the dangers scientists and experts say exist if we continue to ignore the emissions of gas and pollutants from engines using hydrocarbon fuels.</P>
    <P>There is great scope in the years ahead, both in the short term and long term, for the Community to think very seriously about the environment.  Our present way of living is having a detrimental effect on the environment.  I do not think we can go on indefinitely ignoring the advice and warnings we have been getting from eminent scientists, particularly from the United States.</P>
    <P>Reading through the text adopted by <Col N="1600" /> the European Parliament in the last term, I regret that, although we on the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC have considered at great depth a number of aspects and have viewed all of the regulations adopted by the Council, sufficient time is not set aside in this House for a debate on these important topics.  I hope that, with our Committee on Procedure and Privileges we can endeavour to provide in this place a regular, perhaps monthly, spot so that on a continuing basis we can be able to focus some attention on the problems, opportunities, or possibilities which will present themselves to this country over the next four years.  That is vital.  This week the joint committee had a marvellous opportunity to hear the Irish Commissioner, Mr. Peter Sutherland, speak on the results, hopes and expectations after last week's summit.  His presentation to the joint committee was impressive, encouraging and informative and demonstrated great hope for the future of the Community.</P>

      <P>May I express my sincere thanks to all the Senators who have contributed to the debate since it first opened.  In particular, I would like to mention the point raised by Senator Lanigan and also touched on by Senator McDonald on the question of delay in taking the debate.  The facts are that the 29th report which is dated January 1987 is being discussed but the 30th report is now almost ready for publication and the 31st report is in the process of collation.  One of the reasons for the delay was the amount of time which had to be devoted by various Government Departments to the Single European Act and to the referendum in connection with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said at the conclusion of his opening speech, as a member state of the Community we are set to face challenges and, let it be said also, opportunities guaranteed to test our sense of commitment and determination as never before since joining the Community in 1973.  Therefore, I welcome the chance <Col N="1601" /> afforded by this debate to have the fullest discussion and airing of points of view on issues that are of immense importance to our people, our country and to the Community of 12 nations representing 320 million people, of which we are a full and committed member.</P>
    <P>This debate was opened on 19 November, it was continued on 2 December and it is no exaggeration to say that the main focus of our discussions has undergone an historic change as a result of the European Council meeting held on 11 and 12 February in Brussels.  That point was mentioned by three Senators who have spoken today.  On 8 February and EPC meeting was held at which the Ministers there issued the strongest statement that has been issued in relation to the question of the Middle East and, in particular, the points raised very strongly by Senator Lanigan and by Senator Ferris in relation to the problems of the Gaza Strip.</P>
    <P>That meeting was addressed by King Hassan and he also spoke very strongly of what he felt was the last opportunity that would be available and, in particular, he emphasised the importance of the peace conference which has been mentioned both by Senator Lanigan and Senator Ferris.  I attended that conference and put on record Ireland's abhorrence of the situation that exists in the Gaza Strip and set forth our policy as has been outlined by various Ministers, particularly by the present Minister, many years ago in relation to the situation on the Gaza Strip &mdash; the rights of the Palestinians to have a homeland and also, as was mentioned here today, the rights of Israel.</P>
    <P>All Senators will be aware that there was grave disappointment at the failure of the Copenhagen Council to resolve issues of critical importance to the future of the Community.  This Government, however, approached the Brussels Council with renewed determination to succeed and our efforts and optimistic approach were rewarded.</P>
    <P>In the course of the adjourned debate Senators expressed various concerns on the future of the CAP and the Structural Funds, etc.  In view of the fact that we <Col N="1602" /> would appear to have been very much overtaken by events, the best approach I can take to the issues raised is to review the results and achievements of the recent Brussels Council.  Let there be no mistake but that the success of this council represented a major and historic breakthrough for Europe and its people. The institutional and financial underpinning of the Delors plan set us firmly on course for achieving the completion of the internal market by the target year, 1992, a development which, because of greater market efficiency, could mean as much as £80 billion to £90 billion in gains to the member states.  The implications for Ireland are significant and far-reaching. This was a point raised by you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, in your contribution and also touched on by Senator Lanigan.</P>
    <P>Agreement was reached in three crucial areas, first, secure funding for the Community for the next five years; secondly, guarantees for the Common Agricultural Policy in a disciplined framework which will provide security for the farming community; and, thirdly, a doubling in real terms of the Structural Funds for the regions in greatest need.  In relation to the future financing of the Community between now and 1992 it was agreed that there would be an increase in our resources.  The overall ceiling of the Community budget is to be fixed at 1.2 per cent for payments and 1.3 per cent for commitments of Community GNP by 1992.</P>
    <P>These resources are to be provided through a change in the way in which member states' contributions are assessed. Heretofore, each country paid 1.4 per cent of its VAT base, in addition to agricultural levies and customs duties. However, since the VAT base varies between countries as a proportion of GNP, from 42 per cent in Italy, to 62.5 per cent in Ireland and 70 per cent in Portugal, it was agreed that while the 1.4 per cent VAT contribution will be retained the base on which it will be charged will be limited to 55 per cent of GNP.  Under this new system of assessment Ireland, because our VAT base will be reduced from 62 per cent to 55 per <Col N="1603" /> cent of GNP, will save about £20 million in the current year and about £25 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>In addition, a new fourth resource has been introduced to cover the gap between financing by VAT and the overall level of funding each year.  This extra resource will be charged on the basis of GNP. These charges will give a much more equitable distribution of the Community's financial burden in the years up to 1992.  A further improvement on the existing situation is that henceforth the correction of budgetary imbalances, primary the British abatement, will be carried out in such a way that the amount of own resources available for Community policy will not be reduced.</P>
    <P>On agriculture, our aim at the Council was to ensure that the Common Agricultural Policy would continue to function effectively in the interests of the Irish agricultural sector while, at the same time, not be seen to be opposing reasonable and necessary constraints on expenditures in this area.  The base figure for agricultural expenditure set at £27.5 billion ECUs in 1988 does, we believe, take reasonable account of current policy needs.  Given the possibility of an increase in expenditure in agriculture in future years at a rate equivalent of up to 80 per cent of the increase in Community GNP, this should provide a secure, even if tight, base for agricultural expenditure.</P>
    <P>This is particularly the case when account is taken of the fact that special and adequate provision has been made for the disposal of old stocks, the cost of which will fall outside the guideline figures.  A monetary reserve will also be set up to cover extra expenditure on agriculture due to dollar-ECU fluctuations and other exceptional circumstances involving difficulties as a result of developments in international trade and agriculture.  Negotiation on curbing production increases has been largely worked out in the agriculture Council but contentious product sectors, such as cereals, had to be dealt with by the European Council.  In the end agreement was <Col N="1604" /> reached on a community limit of 160 million tonnes for cereals for the next three market years as opposed to the 155 million tonnes proposed by the Commission and supported by some member states.</P>
    <P>Stabilisation measures were agreed in the event of the threshold figure being exceeded.  The agreement reached on cereals met Ireland's essential concern to avoid the application of a threshold or penalty system which would marginalise Irish cereal production.  The measures to contain production in the other sectors which were more or less in line with the majority view of the agricultural council will be deemed to have been adopted unless they are changed by qualified majority in the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs at their meeting next week.</P>
    <P>Another area in which agreement was reached and which is of importance to Irish agriculture is that of the set aside scheme which is intended to complement stabiliser mechanism and production, the point mentioned by Senator McDonald and Senator Lanigan.  Those farmers who opt to take a percentage of their land out of crop production will be compensated. This compensation will be available for farmers who withdraw at least 20 per cent of their arable land from production for not less than five years.  The land may be put into fallow grass or used for forestry or, and I would like to emphasise this, any other purpose not involving the output of products in surplus.  I would recommend that people who are thinking about doing this should consider forestry even through it is a long term investment.  In the case of the level of aid likely to apply in Ireland the Community would contribute 50 per cent of the cost of the programme.  In general terms it could be said that the negotiations covering agriculture on the Council took a satisfactory course from Ireland's point of view.  The important thing is that the viability of the Common Agricultural Policy has been secured for the foreseeable future.  The agreement reached on structural funds at the European Council also represented a favourable outcome for this country.  The funds will be doubled by 1993 in comparison <Col N="1605" /> with 1987 reaching a figure of 13 billion ECUs in 1992 in comparison with 7 billion ECUs in 1987.  Within the framework of this overall increased fund contributions to the less developed regions will be doubled by 1992 with a special effort being undertaken to aid the least prosperous regions including Ireland, the point that was raised by Senator Ferris, and while I have not got the details he required I will get in touch with him later.</P>
    <P>An important added dimension to emerge from the negotiations on the structural funds is that the percentage rate of assistance will be differentiated in favour of the less developed regions.  For Ireland this means that instead of matching community financing on the basis of pound to pound as heretofore future eligible national expenditure will be matched up by £1 to a £3 ratio of the funds. I stress that this will enable this country to take up the increased funding available while remaining within the parameters of the Government's programme to restore order to the public finances.</P>
    <P>While the success of the European Council was due in no small measure to the progress already made in Copenhagen, the splendid efforts of the German Presidency in facilitating the reaching of an overall agreement must be acknowledged.  In the final analysis the heads of Government took the constructive approach to the Delors plan and the outcome left no loser among the member states but rather a much strengthened and forward looking Europe.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate through the Tánaiste's opening speech and my remarks I hope that I have succeeded in imparting some additional information on developments in the Community in the period under review.  It is an area that is of fundamental importance to all of us in this country.  I would like to thank all of the Senators for their contributions.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of Report No. 33 of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities: Aquaculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the question of aquaculture and I would like to commend the work of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities for producing this report on aquaculture.  It is an indication of the dynamism of the aquaculture industry in Ireland that, in the relatively short time since the committee produced the report, there have been substantial changes in the industry itself and also in the arrangements at Government level for facilitating its development.</P>
      <P>By way of background, aquaculture in Ireland is a relatively new industry which has been making remarkable progress in recent years.  The particular beauty of fish farming is that it gives opportunities for development and job employment in areas which are often lacking in them, in areas along the seaboard where there are very few opportunities for any type of development and job creation.  In addition, it draws on a unique natural resource which is provided by our still relatively unpolluted coasts.  My concern at the Department of the Marine is to ensure by every means available to me that the development of the industry should be facilitated by a co-ordinated and properly planned approach at Government level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their report the committee identified a number of areas where it is considered there is a need for action.  These are identified in paragraph 44 of the report. The committee considered that there was a need for an overall plan for the industry, that the legislative basis for the industry <Col N="1607" /> needed attention and that we should look at the role of the European Community and at the fragmentary state of research and development.  Other considerations identified by the committee were the need to maintain the quality of the environment, shortages of supplies of juveniles in the salmon industry and the role of local communities amongst others.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report to the House that a development strategy for the aquaculture industry has been approved recently by the Government. This covers the allocation of functions and responsibilities of the various agencies involved in the development of aquaculture &mdash; my own Department, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Údarás na Gaeltachta, the reconstituted fisheries boards and, when established, the proposed Marine Institute.  In essence, the structure provides that my Department will have responsibility for overall policy, planning, licensing and the co-ordination of the activities of all other agencies through the establishment of effective committee procedures to those ends.</P>
    <P>A small management committee has already been established comprising representatives from my Department, an Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Údarás and Roinn na Gaeltachta and amongst its tasks will be the co-ordination of State funding for aquaculture projects with a view to getting the best return in terms of employment and output.  This committee will be chaired by a senior official from my Department.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the programme is the establishment of an advisory committee representing all major interests in the industry.  We hope this committee will be set up in the near future after consultation with the industry and the various interested parties.  I hope this will substantially improve communications and the flow of ideas on the best means to secure the development of the industry. As I indicated, the strategy places the overall responsibility for aquaculture <Col N="1608" /> development very firmly with my Department and this is very much in line with the thinking of the committee in this area.</P>
    <P>In relation particularly to the difficulties which the committee identified regarding the legislative basis for aquaculture, I can inform the House that to date 15 areas have been designated under the 1980 Fisheries Act as being suitable for aquaculture development.  The process provided for in the 1980 Act is designed to reconcile the needs of the various categories of water users and, where this is not possible, to allow the Minister for the Marine to decide where the balance of advantage lies.  I am particularly anxious to ensure that, before an area is designated, we make absolutely certain there is no interference with the traditional rights of the sea harvesters who have been using these waters for years.  We want to make sure that the livelihoods of fishermen and those who cut wrack along the western seaboard are not interfered with and that anchorages and many other amenities are not interfered with.</P>
    <P>The process to which I referred is detailed and very democratic.  It tries to bring various interests in tandem and so far in most cases it has succeeded in doing this.  Of course, after the Minister has designated an area, there is still a further opportunity for any individual if he is dissatisfied to bring his complaint to the High Court.  At the moment there is a case where the Minister designated an area and some people are unhappy about it and this case is now before the courts. My Department will be embarking on a new programme of designation hearings later this year and over ten new areas are already targeted.</P>
    <P>As to licensing in particular I accept that it is my Department's first responsibility in the development of aquaculture to provide a sound legal framework for the development of the industry by licencing bona fide operators.  My Department have on the stocks over 300 applications for licences.  Each one is examined from the point of view, for example, of environmental impact, the concern of the committee, disease risk to <Col N="1609" /> other producers, carrying capacity of the particular area and safety of navagation. Over 100 licences now have draft clearance and I hope to commence shortly with their issue.</P>
    <P>In the context of licensing, the committee identified the problem whereby potential operators had to be licensed by the then Department of Fisheries on one hand under the Fisheries Act, 1980, and then by the Department of Communications under the Foreshore Act, 1933.  I am glad to inform the House that as a first step in streamlining this situation, the administration of both statutes has been combined under one section in my Department.  I have consulted with the many interested parties in the industry and they have welcomed this.  It was much too cumbersome to apply first to the Department of Communications for a foreshore licence and subsequently to the Department of the Marine for the second licence.</P>
    <P>Now, these two are woven together and the problem is almost resolved for the many people who were anxious to pursue development in aquaculture.  I look forward also to streamlining the relevant legislation so that we can cut down on duplication which is costly both to persons in the industry and to the Department.  In the meantime, however, the existence of the two statutes has been useful in that a number of designations were secured on the basis that individual licence applications would come up for later public scrutiny through the mechanism of the Foreshore Act.</P>
    <P>On research and development, education and training, the Marine Institute, when established, will be able to take responsibility and order matters in a more structured way than perhaps has been the case heretofore.  In relation to the EC itself, December 1986 saw the adoption by the Council of Regulation 4028 on structural arrangements for aquaculture. As provided under the Directive, this Administration has submitted to the European Commission a multi-annual guidance programme covering the development of aquaculture in the period 1987 to 1991.  The document, which <Col N="1610" /> underpins Ireland's applications for FEOGA grant aid for aquaculture projects, give an account of our industry and its devleopment profile and makes projections up to 1991.  Officials of my Department are in close touch with the European Commission to ensure that the case for development assistance for aquaculture is put very convincingly.</P>
    <P>I wish to inform the House that I and the Minister, Deputy Daly, were, to say the least, unhappy with the grant aid made available by the EC to aquaculture this year.  At the last meeting of the Council of Ministers on 14 and 15 December we informed the Presidency in the Council of Ministers of our dissatisfaction at the outcome of some £1.4 million grant aid towards applications which were with the Commission.  It was disappointing in so far as eight applications were almost completed.  Many of these people have gone ahead on the assumption that grant aid would be available, and none of these applications was successful.  I contend that all the applications submitted by individuals or companies in this country were as good as any others submitted to the Commission.</P>
    <P>Of course, while we have been criticised as a Department for the reduction in grants to the aquaculture industry, I would like to remind the House that it is the prerogative of the Commission to decide where grants should go.  It is not a matter for the Council of Ministers, and there is no method whereby one can use the veto.  Many people are obviously unfamiliar with the process in Europe. They are critical, and I think it is wrong to be critical without knowing the facts. As late as last week senior officials from the Department of the Marine met officials of the Commission and I hope that future grant aid available to this country will be at least on a <i>pro rata</i> basis with other countries, providing of course all things are equal.  We have a short history in aquaculture, but I believe we have been very successful in aquaculture development.</P>
    <P>From a European point of view, I would like to see aquaculture being perceived as the ideal opportunity to get a <Col N="1611" /> return from Community moneys available for the development of any peripheral region.  It is important that we strive to develop our aquaculture industry to the full.  We have the right conditions along our long coastline of unpolluted waters.  There are other aspects of the fishing industry which we cannot develop as much as we would like because of the tax and quota system.  The most we can do is to ensure that we add value to these quota species and thus create further jobs.</P>
    <P>We have the opportunity of non-quota species &mdash; the pelagic species of blue whiting and horse mackerel.  While I might be deviating from aquaculture and from the report, I do believe that there are tremendous opportunities there.  I would like to pay tribute to the industry, both the processors and the producers who have been landing horse mackerel over the last number of years.  We have found a very successful market in Japan. While there is a vacuum during part of the year, I am convinced that this is a market which is still untapped.  There has been an increase in the non-quota species to 126,000 tonnes from 113,000 tonnes last year.  We must build up our historical performance there because there are opportunities in the pelagic species &mdash; horse mackerel and blue whiting &mdash; but we do not have the same opportunities in the other species, despite the fact that we are doing, and have done, our utmost.</P>
    <P>We have been successful this year in securing an increase in quotas, particularly in relation to white fish.  This increase is in the region of £7 million taking into account that there has been no increase in the quota of mackerel, but we have secured something which has never been secured since the signing of the Common Fisheries Policy on 1 January 1983.  There will be a review later in the year in relation to the mackerel quota.</P>
    <P>We have carried out numerous surveys along the west coast of Ireland and the west coast of Scotland and we are convinced that the catches there can be increased substantially without affecting <Col N="1612" /> the quotas.  This information is now being submitted to ICES.  The scientists in my Department and I believe we can convince ICES of this and they, in turn will advise the Commission, and hopefully we will get an increase.</P>
    <P>However, despite the fact that it is a quota species, there is an excellent arrangement with the industry &mdash; and a very sensible arrangement &mdash; that there is a quota per boat.  This has resulted in all these fish being taken ashore and processed ashore, apart from a few luggers which are there to take some of the overflow in the north-west.  While there might be 20 to 30 luggers in the Swilly, one may get the impression that we are shipping the mackerel to be processed abroad.  I would like to put it on record that any fish aboard those boats are not from Irish boats.  They are from the Scottish boats who are licensed to lie off the west coast of Ireland.  As I said, those boats are not processing the mackerel from Irish boats.  There are opportunities there both in the demersal and pelagic species which we must continue to develop.</P>
    <P>The most significant development is the one which we are referring to here today, and which is referred to in Report No. 33 of Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on Aquaculture produced in October 1986.  There are exciting opportunities there and we want to ensure that we can develop aquaculture to the full.  As to the future, the Government's development programme envisages increasing income generation and employment in coastal and inland communities principally through the expansion of salmon, trout, mussel and oyster farming.</P>
    <P>While we are some years behind the Norwegians and the Canadians in the development of salmon farming, we must look at the potential for the development of some of the white fish species.  There is a difficulty in this country because of our rugged coastline and the fact that we do not have any continuity of supply of white fish.  We must strive to entice the industry to take an interest in the farming <Col N="1613" /> of demersal species that can be farmed, thus ensuring a continuity.  Eight to ten years ago anyone in the salmon industry, in the processing and smoking of salmon, could only buy the wild salmon landed in this country.  Frozen salmon has to be stocked during June and July tying up a considerable amount of capital during those two months, and the smoking of salmon was carried on throughout the rest of the year.  The availability of farm salmon in the country at the moment ensures that there is a continuity of supply for the many fish smokers.  There is no question of capital being tied up for some ten months of the year.</P>
    <P>There is a comparison between wild salmon and farm salmon.  Our theory suggests that the more we develop farm salmon the greater effect it will have on the price of wild salmon.  We must be realists and realise that we are not the only country producing farm salmon.  If we were, we could control the price of farm salmon and its effect on wild salmon, but we produce only a small percentage of the farm salmon produced in the world.  If we do not take this opportunity others will.  I would entice as many small fish farmers as possible to get involved in this area.</P>
    <P>A substantial amount of capital is required to set up a fish farm.  We have a policy in relation to satellite farmers. We want to ensure that the small salmon farmer has every opportunity to work with the bigger companies who can provide the capital and expertise and who can assist them in marketing salmon.  The Government's development programme envisages increasing income generation and employment in coastal and inland communities, principally through the expansion of salmon, trout, mussel and oyster farming.  Targets and ambitions with annual output are projected to reach some £75 million at 1986 ex-farm prices by the end of the five year period to 1991. I assure the House of my commitment to this industry.</P>
    <P>I, again, commend the work of the joint committee.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not move the motion.  It was moved by the Fianna Fáil Party, by the acting Leader of the House.  If this had been a Government Bill, the Minister would have introduced it and then I would have called an Opposition speaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's response to this legislation.  I represent an area in Donegal.  Everybody from the west enthusiastically welcomes the response of the Department of the Marine.  This is a very important development for people who have earned their living down the years from fishing.  I would be negligent if I did not respond to this development in a very positive way.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has highlighted the very important aspects of the legislation and that he has very definite proposals on how to introduce new measures of control.  This is of vital importance.  In areas where unemployment is very high, people will be turning to the traditional sources of employment, such as fishing. There are families who were associated with fishing but they had given it up because the development in the industry had changed substantially from the old boats to the factory ship of today.  Many people living along our coastline had a very traditional approach to fishing.</P>
      <P>Aquaculture and fish farming can be carried out without a vast capital expenditure on boats.  For that reason I see this development as one which is ideally suited for local people who have not got vast resources to get involved in major fishing development.  This is an industry in which those who live in the more rugged areas can get involved in a very positive manner.  I am glad the Minister recognises that it is important to set up sound structures and guidelines which can be understood and respected by those who will be involved in acquaculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone who has seen where these <Col N="1615" /> developments have taken place has certain fears.  They fear that some well organised and well financed people will set up companies using local people to front their organisation.  This would result in a total rape of our rich harvest. Side by side with the development and the setting up of these very important structures is the success of the aquaculture. The Minister has recognised that we have fairly pollution free coastal waters.  If one is to recognise the reports coming out on a weekly basis of the dangers of pollution, it is only right and proper that the Minister and his Department must be ever conscious of the need to protect and preserve the area he rightly identifies as pollution free which is ideally suited for the development of aquaculture.</P>
    <P>Some of the fears of the people living along the coastline are, first, that outsiders with a lot of finance to invest will come in and reap the benefit and second that while we have fairly pollution free waters surrounding our coast, this may not be the case in the long term.  We have regular reports of other countries dumping waste, a matter over which we have no control.  This is vital: I urge the Minister side by side with this legislation, to ask for the full support of European technology to protect in the long term the fishing grounds that are of vital value to us.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is very important to recognise that the right structures are put in place, that the right people are put in charge and, above all, that the industry &mdash; and it is nothing less than an industry which is of great interest to those who live on the coast &mdash; is protected for the people.  On one occasion I had a helicopter trip with the Commissioner for Fisheries and he was quick to identify the rough terrain over which we were flying. He said that if we take the fishing industry from those people they have to eke out a living on that terrain then what can we expect?  We are actually committing those people to the dole and social security for the rest of their lives.  Here is an <Col N="1616" /> opportunity &mdash; it may not be the complete answer but it is a step in the right direction &mdash; to protect and provide a secure industry for people who have the technology and the tradition.  They can go out and earn a living for themselves and relieve the burden of paying social welfare to those areas which is now a common occurrence.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he has received up to 300 licence applications.  I support totally the need for caution and great care when licences are being granted.  Even though people may not have major resources and funds, I think local concern and local initiative must be first recognised.  I trust the Minister will give favourable consideration to people who are living close to ideally suited locations, whether it is sheltered bays or inlets, whether it is in Keel, Rathmullen or the Fanad Peninsula.  The local inhabitants must get a break and they must be encouraged to take part in utilising that valuable crop of aquaculture and fish farming which is right on their doorstep. I want to strongly emphasise that.  If I say the same thing in three different ways, but phrase it differently, it is because I want to get the message across.  I do not have to emphasise it to this Minister who is well aware of what is happening in the fishing areas.</P>
    <P>Pollution is possibly our greatest concern. Those of us who have an interest can see daily how lackadaisical outsiders are about our coastline.  I have noticed &mdash; the Minister referred briefly to it &mdash; that in the Lough Swilly estuary there are about 20 factory ships at present.  Those ships are receiving mackerel and other fish from all over Europe, especially from Scotland and England.  They are using the Lough Swilly estuary as a dumping place for the waste from the processing operation.  Their oil and scrap is dumped there and they are leaving the Swilly estuary as an area where aquaculture and fish farming will be difficult.  I use this occasion to encourage the Minister to take a special look at Lough Swilly and to say, in plain English, what the hell are they allowed in there for.  I do not think they should be there.  They are using a <Col N="1617" /> port of convenience and they are leaving a mess behind them.  They are leaving no revenue, no landing charges and no contribution to the State of any kind.  We are left with the dross and the dirt of factory ships that is dumped in our estuary. Now is an opportune time for the Minister to look at this dangerous development which can only harm the prospects of real development in aquaculture.</P>
    <P>This is the short contribution I would like to make.  I am one of those who believe very strongly that we have enough resources around our coast, whether it is fishing, farming, tourism or the tweed industry.  I always put those four industries together; you might change the tweed and tourism industries location by location.  If we cannot provide an economic living for the citizens of this country from those areas where raw material is readily available then there is not much hope for us as a country.  In many areas where we have potential for development and where we have natural resources we have been very late in developing them. This is understandable especially when it takes money to develop, to control and to set up structures.</P>
    <P>I again emphasise the need for the Minister to ensure that we get proper technical assistance and financial support to keep our waters free of pollution.  I welcome the introduction of this new measure, from which all of us can actually stand to benefit.  It is certainly an area which has great potential.  It must be done in a controlled fashion and I am glad that we are going about it in a proper way and that the proper structures will be put together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the response of the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gallagher, to this Joint Committee report on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, Report No. 33 on Aquaculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a few comments to make and questions to ask, some of which the Minister has referred to in his statement but on which I would like further clarification <Col N="1618" /> or information if that is possible.  The Minister in his speech said that: there have been substantial changes in the industry itself and also in the arrangements at Government level since this report came out.  That would be understandable because the report is dated 1 October 1986.  I submit that there should be many more substantial advancements since that report came out.  I fear we have fallen behind in that regard, perhaps due to overall planning or for some other reasons.  I will deal with those in the course of my comments on this report.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the mechanics of the operation: the report came out on 1 October 1986 and it is now coming before this House for discussion, two and a half years later.  I have studied the report. I note the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Charlie McDonald, was a member of the Joint Committee and also Senator Maurice Manning, the Fine Gael leader in the Seanad, was vice-Chairman of the committee and chaired many sessions of the committee which produced this report.  I note also in the report that aquaculture is used to describe both freshwater and seawater fish farming so it is in that context that we should deal with it.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State said, it is a recent but vastly expanding development in Ireland which has vast potential to change the whole concept of fishing and fish development.  The report correctly compares the current developments in aquaculture with the parallel developments in agriculture.  We realise, for example, the tremendous and far reaching developments that have taken place in agriculture from the point of view of producing new breeds and of feeding, both in the beef and dairy sector, over the last ten or 15 years.  There is vast potential for similar development in new scientific information on the breeding and development of fish suitable for fish farming and aquaculture developments.</P>
    <P>The new scientific knowledge has raised productivity enormously with new developments in feeding and this can and will apply over the next few years.  We are really only starting the development <Col N="1619" /> of fish farming.  The potential in this area is tremendous.</P>
    <P>Up to recently fishing was basically hunting or catching a fish in its natural habitat.  There were many uncertainties involved, for example, such factors as weather, location, dangers of over fishing and seasons of supply.</P>
    <P>When we get down to fish farming many of these problems can be reduced or eliminated altogether.  Controlled breeding can take place and the potential for new strains can be beneficial to fish farming interests all of which is only now being realised.  Weather is no longer a problem and production of fish can be increased eventually to meet all demands as outlined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Let us at this time take note of where we are going and where this can lead us to.  Of course there are difficulties in this comparatively new development.  Fish which live in the wild are often unsuitable for fish farming but with breeding techniques and correct feeding this problem can be overcome.  The example I have given in animal husbandry was only as an indication of what has happened in that field.  I have read the report of the salmon review group, a recently published document entitled, &ldquo;A Framework for the Development of Ireland's Salmon Fishery&rdquo;. Perhaps the Minister will indicate what steps he proposes to take on that report.</P>
    <P>Of the EC countries availing of EC Commission or FEOGA grants for fisheries and aquaculture in 1987, Ireland is left far behind and the Minister referred to that in his off-the-cuff reference to the small amount of grant we receive in comparison with other EC countries.  I note that in reply to a question from Deputy Avril Doyle the Minister of State, on 2 February 1988, said that Spain received 33 per cent approximately of total aid awarded, Portugal 11.53 per cent, France 12.81 per cent, Italy 18.56 per cent and the United Kingdom 10.56 per cent.  The Minister did not indicate the percentage in our case but I ascertained later that it was less than 2 per cent of the total budget.  That leaves us in <Col N="1620" /> a very disadvantaged situation compared with the other countries competing for funds for the development of aquaculture. I would like to ask the Minister why Ireland's share was so low.  He partly explained the reason but I am not satisfied with that explanation.  We must have fallen down somewhere; perhaps we did not have our schemes ready but I would like to get to the root of it.</P>
    <P>If Ireland, an island country within the EC, can only get less than 2 per cent of the budget allocated there must be some reason for it.  I would like to ask the Minister where did the Government slip up in not ensuring that Ireland got an adequate portion of this budget provided by the EC, for example, Spain got 33 per cent and Portugal got over 11 per cent; those are two new entrants to the EC. They joined the EC years after us, yet they appear to be years ahead of us in securing a far greater allocation of the grants available for fish farming and aquaculture development than we were able to receive.  We are slipping up somewhere and steps must be taken to redress that because if we continue to slip behind in 1988 or 1989 we will be just left out of the race altogether.  Had this very bad application anything to do with our case not being properly presented or prepared or did we not have enough schemes?  I would like to know the answer to that question and what we should be doing about it.  I should like to know also what are the regulations now governing applications for EC grants for fish farming developments.  The report states that:</P>
    <P>The main instrument of Community policy on aquaculture has been Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2908/83 which was in force for the three year period 1983-85.  Prior to its adoption the Community has relied on an interim Regulation which started in 1978 and was renewed annually up until 1982.  This state of affairs was most unsatisfactory. Great uncertainty existed as to whether the Regulation would be renewed in any given year, and if so, what level of funding would be available. No medium term planning was <Col N="1621" /> possible.  Council Regulation 2908/83 was therefore a great improvement in the Community arrangements for funding fish farming.  It specified two decision periods, when applications for grants would be considered.  These were in March and October of each year.  Further to this, Commission Regulation (EEC) No. 378/84 set out a detailed application form which had to be completed before funds were made available to an aquaculture venture. Applications had to be received six months prior to a decision date (e.g. before March in order to be considered in October).  When Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2908/83 lapsed at the end of 1985 it was decided to renew it for a further year.  It appears that this was because other structural measures in the fisheries sector would be terminating in 1986, by extending Regulation 2908/83 for one year all the policy instruments could be synchronlised, and at the same time, assessed.</P>
    <P>That brings us up to 1986.  Does that still apply or what are the regulations attaching to applications?</P>
    <P>At the beginning I referred to the difficulty in discussing this report which is more than two years old now.  A lot of water has run under the bridge since it was produced.  While many of its contents are useful and well researched they may be out of date.  The report states that in 1985 our fish imports amounted to £35 million.  It seems extraordinary to me that we, an island country, should have fish imports amounting to that figure.  If that figure is true it shows the vast potential we have even to cater for that.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect is that we must redress the situation where we are getting less than 2 per cent of the grants available.  In other words if we do not redress the problem we will be left so far behind the other countries that we will be trampled on.  Our fellow member states, for example, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and the UK will advance so far ahead of us that even if we increase our output by several hundreds per cent, <Col N="1622" /> we will be starting from such a low base that it will not be really effective.</P>
    <P>Recently I attended a fish conference in Renvyle in Connemara where there were representatives from all the EC countries.  It was a salmon fish farming conference.  From my observations of the representatives of the fish farming interests in these countries, we are only scratching the surface in Ireland as regards the advancements we have made. I was shocked to realise how advanced those countries were in their technology and in their development of fish farming and aquaculture generally.  It is estimated for example that Community production will grow by 70 per cent by 1990 with a total investment in aquaculture of about £323 million.  Overall the Commission will contribute £138 million in grants. This would be about seven or eight times greater than the grants allocated in the years 1979 to 1983.  If the expenditure and the grants are increased by £138 million it is no good if we are not in there, as the Minister correctly observed, getting our fair share of the grants available.</P>
    <P>My concern is that Ireland must be ready to avail of its fair share of grants or we will be left far behind.  Two per cent of the grants available could not be tolerated.  We must plan and be ready for this.  Paragraph 15 of the report states that:</P>
    <P>At a meeting on 25 June, 1986 the Council examined the above Communication.</P>
    <P>The above communication refers to the financial allocation for shorter but multi-annual periods and short-term modifications for specific regional situations.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the views expressed at that meeting, the experience gained with previous policies and the new situation created by enlargement, the Commission in a Communication of 15 September, 1986 has made proposals for a Council Regulation on the subject.  This provides a framework for Community measures to improve and adapt structures in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors over <Col N="1623" /> the next ten years (COM (86) 446 final).</P>
    <P>The main features of the proposal are similar to those introduced in 1983 except (a) the rules on the granting of Community aid are to be diversified and priority given to forms of financial assistance other than the payment of capital grants, such as interest rate subsidies, reimbursable advances, or guarantees on loans.  These forms of assistance are very important for fish farmers, particularly salmon producers, where costs of smolts and feed are very high and such investments are tied up for long periods; (b) the rules also specify that special incentives in aquaculture will be made available for the redeployment of fishermen linked to the scrapping of operational fishery vessels; and (c) to qualify for aid a programme must relate to investments totalling more than (£IR£76,000).</P>
    <P>That figure appears very high to me.</P>
    <P>The proposed Regulation is to be welcomed in that it indicates strong support by the Commission for the fish farming industry and an appreciation of the need for long term measures of financial support.</P>
    <P>That I believe is the crucial aspect.  We must plan for the long-term effects.  We must have a development plan, and the Minister in his speech referred to the establishment of an advisory committee representing all major interests in the industry.  He said he hoped this would substantially improve communications and the flow of ideas on the best means to secure development in the industry.  I welcome that.  It is past the time when we should have an overall development plan for Irish aquaculture.  The report outlines the need for an overall plan and lists the headings as follows:</P>
    <P>(i) The need for an overall plan for the industry;</P>
    <P>(ii) The legislative basis for aquaculture;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1624" /> (iii) The need for investment and the role of the European Community;</P>
    <P>(iv) The fragmentary state of research and development;</P>
    <P>(v) The importance of marketing and quality control;</P>
    <P>(vi) The role of training and advisory services;</P>
    <P>(vii) The need to maintain the quality of the environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to that important aspect in his address.</P>
    <P>(viii) The shortages of supplies of juveniles;</P>
    <P>(ix) The role of local communities.</P>
    <P>I presume we could include there also the role of local authorities and planning authorities.</P>
    <P>(x) Inadequate compilation of statistics.</P>
    <P>That indicates what the report saw as the need for overall planning.  The report also pointed out at the time that to date &mdash; this has been dealt with partly again by the Minister in his address &mdash; no agency had been given charge of the State role in aquaculture and that there was no steering committee.  Perhaps we are now going in that direction; maybe that is the idea that the Minister is developing in his address.  The report also stated that we started off with three designated areas and the Minister now refers to 15 areas being designated since.  The three designated areas in the west are (1), Blacksod, Eily, Broadhaven Bays in County Mayo; (2) Achill Sound, Finton Bay, Ballacragher Bay, County Mayo; and (3) Killary Harbour in Connemara.  The Minister of State now tells us we have 15 designated areas.  I would like to pose the question &mdash; and the Minister referred to this briefly in passing&mdash; how are we overcoming the obstacles to developing the industries in these designated areas?  The Minister of State dealt with the protection of amenities and the livelihoods of fishermen and these are very important aspects.  If we are unduly held up by <Col N="1625" /> obstacles such as these we will not be able to develop this industry, which is being developed by our counterparts within the EC.</P>
    <P>While we are developing aquaculture, for example through fish farming, the licensing and control of salmon fishing is in serious disarray.  Illegal drift netting is taking place, and this has serious consequences for salmon stock and there is also conflict between fishermen and the fishery protection service.  At this stage I refer to the report of the salmon review group and ask the Minister of State to give us views on that document and to say whether he proposes to take any action on foot of that report.</P>
    <P>The last time I spoke on matters related to this was when, with the Minister of State present on 18 December, the Fisheries (No. 2) Bill, which related to the introduction of rod fishing licenses, passed through the Seanad.  Under that legislation it is hoped to raise £500,000 in fees to offset the £1 million that has been taken out of the Estimate for the development of inland fisheries.  On that occasion I pointed out to the Minister of State that I felt this measure would be resisted.  The trout season opened on Lough Corrib in County Galway and on Lough Mask in County Mayo this week and the legislation is being resisted by trout anglers.  This is causing serious problems and I would like the Minister of State to tell us whether he is taking any steps to rescind this legislation in order to restore the goodwill of anglers and angling clubs throughout the country.</P>
    <P>To get back to the report, some of the questions raised have been answered by the Minister.  I would like him to tell us what other recommendations will be made on foot of the report and what action is being taken as regards overall planning for the future development of the aquaculture industry.</P>

      <P>I did not know that I was going to be in time for today's session and for that reason I do not have all the information that I might have liked to put before the Minister of State today but I would like to say that we all welcome anything that offers employment to the people of this country.  Having said that I ask the Minister of State to do his utmost to give the environment the protection it deserves. We are going to have problems in the near future with the fish farming industry if we are not careful about the way in which this particular development is carried out.  In the past we have allowed areas to be used for fish farming without first carrying out an ecological baseline survey and it is absolutely essential that we carry out an ecological baseline survey before any fish farming development is allowed to take place.  This survey applies only in the case of very major industrial developments.</P>
      <P>The particular area designated as being suitable for fish farming is researched but only from the fish farmer's point of view, in other words, to see if the farm fish will survive in that area or indeed if the cages are going to be blown away and disappear overnight during the first storm.  That particular base might be far more valuable as a tourist area and it might, in fact, bring far more money to the local community if the shoreline area did not have unsightly fish cages or polluted sea water with which to welcome the visitor, not to mention the damage to existing fishing practices.  I would like to quote some points from a report on legislation and practice in Norway:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fish farming industry might <Col N="1627" /> create serious pollution problems. Organic waste from a farm of 8,000 cubic metres may be close to 100 tons per year.  If this is expressed in terms of &ldquo;persons equivalents,&rdquo; ie. if we relate the pollution effected expects to those resulting from X number of persons, then this waste will be equal to 2,500 persons.</P>
    <P>Waste organic matter from the Norwegian fish farming industry as a whole, therefore, can be said to be equivalent to that resulting from about 1.8 million persons.</P>
    <P>Conflicting Use of the Coastal Zone.</P>
    <P>Fish farms also occupy a considerable area which has previously been freely available for traffic, fishing and leisure activities.</P>
    <P>The production of smolts or fingerlings requires large amounts of freshwater.  This water is drained out from rivers which used to flow freely. This draining out of water means that the anadromous fish, that is fish which migrate from freshwater to saltwater and back again, are prevented from returning to their native river areas for spawning.  The value of a watercourse to sports fishermen may therefore be ruined.</P>
    <P>Considering the fact that many rivers in Norway have already been utilised in the production of hydro-electric power it would appear that the present rate of expansion in hatchery units is disturbingly high.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Gene Pollution&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Fish can always escape from fish farms, due to holes in the nets, or storm damage.  Escaped fish can go up river systems and reproduce with the naturally occurring populations.  This will result in a mixing of the existing genepool with genes from the escaped farm fish, a sort of &ldquo;gene-pollution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Norwegian researchers today agree that the ability of wild salmonids to find their way back to their home streams after several years in the open oceans is based on genetical factors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1628" /> The mixing of genes between wild salmon and farmed fish will thus result in a reduction of the wild salmon's ability to return to its home stream.</P>
    <P>This ability has developed through natural selection over many hundreds of years and the &ldquo;gene-pollution&rdquo; which can occur is irreversible.</P>
    <P>In a fish farm, we press the fish to grow as fast as possible and the densities we work with are high.  In addition, the environment around a fish farm can be distinctly sub-optimal due to pollution.  These conditions encourage the spread of disease, which can then be spread further to the wild populations.</P>
    <P>The import of smolt has resulted in the introduction of diseases to Norway which did not exist here previously. One of these is furinculosis.  This disease is extremely infectious and can lead to high mortalities in fish.  We are afraid that this disease has now spread to our salmon rivers.</P>
    <P>We have seen that fish farming utilises and possibly ruins resources which were previously available to everyone. To put it simply, we can say that the needs of only a few people, restrict the possibilities of very many.</P>
    <P>Because of this, it seems obvious that society should take a stand on fish farming and that the fish farming industry itself should not be allowed to determine its own operation and development.</P>
    <P>Fish farming should be a profitable industry.  It costs both time and money to start up and to run a fish farm.  The investments made should be profitable on both a short and long term basis.</P>
    <P>The fish farming industry should be an industry primarily for the remote communities.  These are the communities with the greatest need for the opportunities the fish farming industry can provide, e.g. job creation.</P>
    <P>The Fish Farming Act includes expropriation rights.  This means that if an owner doesn't want his property to be used for fish farming, but he has no other valid use for it, then it can be taken away from him or her.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> The establishment of a fish farm should cause the least possible damage to its environment, and a fish farm must not be established if it prevents normal traffic or any important use of the area; leads to pollution problems, both because it affects the environment generally, but also because it affects the growth and health of the fish and results in reduced profits; results in a danger of disease spreading, also in this case to protect the environment, the fish farm itself and the fish farming industry generally.</P>
    <P>The environmental requirements listed under point 4 are absolute, and no exceptions can be made.</P>
    <P>As can be seen, the Fish Farming Act tries to ensure the positive effects and to restrict the disadvantages of an expanding fish farming industry.</P>
    <P>The absolute environmental requirements apply to all types of aquaculture, including smolt production.  For the production of salmon and trout for consumption (on-growing units) there are a number of additional requirements applicable.</P>
    <P>A certain number of new licences are made available in licensing rounds which have taken place more or less every second year.</P>
    <P>The reason for this is that we are trying to match production quantities to market opportunities.  An overproduction would result in a dumping of prices, which would further affect the profitability of the industry.</P>
    <P>Restriction of the availability of new licences has been very strongly supported by the Fish Farmers' Association itself and from the related sales/ export organisations.</P>

    <P>There is a requirement that new licences must be connected to the local community, and that no one person <Col N="1630" /> may have a majority of shares in more than one fish farm.

    <P>That is very important.</P>
    <P>The Act also makes it possible to make requirements as to the fish farmer's theoretical and practical qualifications.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment him on the tremendous work he has done since his appointment to the Department. I must say that he has an indepth knowledge of his brief and has been of great help to the fishing industry right across the country.  The most important point about aquaculture and fish farming here is that it is one of our natural resources and one of our new natural resources.  The Government are, and <Col N="1631" /> have been, totally committed to developing our natural resources, not alone fisheries but also the food industry, forestry and tourism in order that we may become self-dependent and create jobs from our own resources.  As a sign of this commitment the Government set up the Department of the Marine, a Department which co-ordinate all of the other Departments which dealt with the fish farming industry, either directly or indirectly, and which had led to huge problems for people who tried to set up their own companies in an effort to develop this industry.  The Government are also committed to the new Marine Institute which will play a most important role in increasing further the number of our fish species, shell fish, oysters and mussels.  This will ensure a proper grouping of oysters and mussels.</P>
    <P>However, many problems have come to light in recent times, these have been outlined by Senator de Buitléar and I agree with much of what he has said. At the same time, I know that this new Department will be totally committed to ensuring that our bays are pollution free. The bays of Connemara and the Gaeltacht area have been slightly polluted because, I maintain, of overcrowding of rafts.  However, recently the Taoiseach and the Minister signed a designation order in regard to Kilkieran Bay in Connemara to ensure that the oyster industry would be carried on in a proper manner and that there would be development of the scallop and mussel industry.  At times many of us can be very critical of fishermen but the fishermen in that area, due to the efforts of the local co-operative, were very responsible in their attitude towards the collection of oysters in the short season.  They all adhered to the time allowed and this ensured that the oysters survived there year after year and allowed a reseeding of the bay.  It also prevented some greedy people from coming in to clean out the bay which has happened quite a number of times in the past.</P>
    <P>Another problem which has arisen and which has been referred to recently is <Col N="1632" /> that while it is okay to develop our natural resources, such as the fish farms, the infrastructure of many fish farms is totally inadequate.  It was pointed out at a conference in Renvyle recently that it would cost almost £15 million in parts of Connemara to develop the road infrastructure into the bays or piers in order to get the fish in or out quickly.  Recently, the Government gave the go-ahead for large planes to land at Galway Airport and this will mean that people in west Galway will be able to take their oysters or fresh salmon out of the bays in the morning and have it on the tables of the best restaurants in Paris at 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock in the evening.  That move must be commended and marks an improvement in the infrastructure.  Getting back to the question of the road instructure I accept that is an old problem right along the west coast but if we are to be sincere about developing this industry we will have to ensure that the money is made available to develop the road infrastructure. Obviously, this money will have to come from the European Fund because the total cost will probably be in the region of £200 or £300 million, at a rough estimation.</P>
    <P>Recently, problems arose as a result of the bigger companies coming in and setting up.  Many local people were worried that these bigger companies would take over all the bays along the coast leaving them out of it.  However, I must thank the Minister of State for his personal intervention in this matter because he ensured local participation, especially for the small man who possibly might be on the dole 50 per cent of the time.  He was allowed to participate in these new satellite farms and to set up his own fish farm within the inner bays at no great cost to himself.</P>
    <P>It must also be pointed out that in Gaeltacht areas, Údarás na Gaeltachta in years gone by spearheaded the fish farm industry.  They made grants available and leased cages to local people to ensure that these farms would be developed.</P>
    <P>In recent times we have seen the Norwegians pushing in on the west coast. <Col N="1633" /> Some of them made attempts to park their large tankers out in the bay but, because of local objections and the objections of the local authorities, they were removed.  That was the realistic thing to do because I am sure the Norwegians were not coming here for our benefit. What worried me and what I could not understand was why they would not park these tankers in their own bays and not pollute our bays.</P>
    <P>When talking about pollution we are talking basically about the west coast. Having regard to the threat which nuclear plants in Britain pose and to how they would affect our seas I am not too sure how fish farms would work out on the east coast.  I am not sure whether some have been set up but I would like the Minister of State to comment on this matter if he has any information available to him.  It is very important that our bays should be kept clean and clear.</P>
    <P>Another problem in many coastal areas, including Rossaveel Bay, is the problem of untreated raw sewage.  I have been asking the local authority and Galway County Council to do something about the untreated raw sewage going into the bay from the local village of Carraroe, which is a fairly large village, and this has been going on for years.  I have asked the local authority several times whether it was their policy to have sewage running into the bay and I always got either a yes or a no answer and that due to financial problems they could not build a proper treatment plant.  The bay at Rossaveel has been badly polluted because factories have not conformed to the arrangements of the local authorities to ensure that no further effluent would run into Rossaveel Bay.</P>
    <P>I would like once again to thank the Minister of State for the work he has done, especially for the smaller fish farm. It is very important that local people should be given a chance to set up their own farms, rather than multinational companies, even multinational companies within our own State, so that they can develop these farms and ensure that they will be self-sufficient in years to come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I welcome this report and thank the committee who went into great detail in the report.  The development of mariculture or aquaculture in Ireland is a new idea.  Only in the past five years has it started to grow and it is now growing very rapidly.  Nevertheless, while not wanting to be parochial, I remember over 25 years ago the setting up of a fish farm in Dingle for the rearing of trout.  At that time we were all very wary and worried about the damage it might cause by way of pollution to rivers.  The fish farm still exists.  It is successful, providing jobs locally and expanding.  It was a fish farm set up to rear rainbow trout.</P>
      <P>As a fisherman, I was worried about salmon farming.  If a large amount of salmon farming takes place I wonder what will happen to the small boatman who sees his livelihood being eroded.  I believe there is room for both the fisherman and salmon farming.  At present most of the salmon farming is being carried out by companies or individuals who are not tied into fishing at all.  I would like to see fishermen getting involved in the rearing of salmon or in the growing of mussels and so on.  In Iceland, for example, fishermen have not been allowed to catch salmon for a number of years, but they have developed what they call salmon ranching. Fishermen form a co-operative and build hatcheries at the point where the river flows into the sea.  They rear the fish from smolts which go out to sea. Their natural instinct brings them back to that river where the fishermen trap and grade them.  By law they have to leave a certain amount upstream to ensure the continuation of salmon stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We really need good salmon fishing in our rivers from a tourist point of view.  In either 1981 or 1982 the Department of Fisheries bought the rights to an eight mile stretch of the river Erriff.  Three thousand five hundred salmon went up the river, of which 360 were caught by tourists and anglers.  To illustrate the point I am trying to make in regard to tourism let me say this: The value of 360 <Col N="1635" /> salmon caught by fishermen for commercial purposes would amount to something in the region of £9,000 whereas to catch the same number of fish visiting anglers, through the payment for gillies along the river and angling fees, would have to pay out an estimated £1.25 million. Therefore, one can see that this is quite a spin-off for the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Iceland have the ideal set up.  They have brought fishermen into this type of salmon fishing by way of ranching which does not really amount to salmon farming. As I have already explained, it is carried on at the mouth of a river where the smolt are protected.  They then go off to sea and grow naturally.  Their natural instinct brings them back again to the river.  Fishermen have objected to this idea of salmon farming.  I do not think they have grounds for objecting to salmon farming, designation orders and so on.  Not enough information was given to fishermen about salmon farming in the past.  With regard to any other type of fish farming, fishermen are quite happy with mussel farming which is a very lucrative business, scallop fishing and oyster fishing.  In Tralee Bay at the moment they have the biggest natural oyster fisheries in Europe.  It is run by a co-operative. The oysters are dredged by the fishermen and they get value out of it.  The co-operative handles all the buying and selling of the oysters.</P>
    <P>To come back to the other type of salmon farming, I would like to see the fishermen involved and I would like to see some effort being made by the Minister or his Department to bring in the salmon fishermen.  You really need to bring the two sides together, the regular fishermen particularly, because from 1975 until about 1985 many people got small boats, 32 to 36 foot boats, expecially for salmon fishing.</P>
    <P>I can see fish farming involving perhaps £50 million or £60 million worth of industrial fish farming.  It would probably increase the price of the Atlantic salmon but it would not be worth while for fishermen to go out and catch them.  That, <Col N="1636" /> in itself, might be a great advantage to the people who would like to conserve the wild salmon because it would ease the amount of illegal fishing.  The salmon would have a chance to come up the rivers and, therefore, we would be assured that salmon would not become extinct.</P>
    <P>The finance available for salmon and mussel farming and aquaculture generally is very good.  If somebody is interested in mussel farming he qualifies for a grant for a pilot scheme which covers nearly all the cost of investigation to see whether it would be worth while and profitable, if the mussels are growing well, if they are suitable and so on.  First, he gets a small grant for a pilot scheme which covers nearly all his costs.  After that he can qualify in certain areas for up to a 40 per cent FEOGA grant; if he is in a Gaeltacht area he would probably get an Údarás na Gaeltachta grant of maybe another 10 per cent, and perhaps a BIM grant as well.  He would also have the facilities that are at our disposal in the line of research and so on.</P>
    <P>I must say in fairness to the Department over the years everything is there to encourage people to go into every aspect of aquaculture from salmon, trout and so on.  We have to move along in the world and I cannot see why an acre of sea would not be just as valuable as an acre of land.  You can sow a crop in the sea as valuable as a crop you would sow on land.  There are thousands of places with quiet waters and so on where people could start small industries.  We should welcome this.  It is not the Government's fault or anybody's fault that it is not going ahead.</P>
    <P>We have to educate the fishermen because they have a genuine fear.  As a fisherman I had that same fear one time, but when they are faced with the reality, if salmon farmers start locally they automatically reject it and object to it.  I can see the reason.  If somebody in a restaurant wants to get a 106lb. salmon he has only to ring up the salmon farm and he will get exactly a 106lb. salmon.  If a fisherman going out to sea is told to bring in a 106lb. salmon he cannot make the <Col N="1637" /> delivery because he has salmon coming in from maybe 6lb. to maybe 20lb.  From the restaurants' and hoteliers' point of view salmon farms are ideal because they can get exactly what they want when they want it.  The fisherman has a particular season for fishing and the season will end at a certain time of the year and anybody who want salmon will have to be satisfied with frozen or whatever type of salmon is available.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister for his views on salmon ranching.  Could we arrange to meet fishermen in different areas to tell them about the ranching because if salmon farming goes on as much as it has in the past five years there is no doubt that it will become a waste of time for the small fishermen to go out catching salmon?  The only advantage he will have is that he can always say that his salmon are wild Atlantic salmon and possibly they might fetch a better price than the farmed salmon.  But even though they are wild they are reared in the same waters and at the end of the day the salmon fishermen are at a disadvantage. The only thing we can do is to try and form salmon co-operatives in all these places, if necessary organised by BIM or the Department of the Marine, to take a few fishermen to Iceland and let them see what is happening there and how lucrative two concerns are there.  One is the salmon ranching from which the money goes straight into the fishermen's pockets and the second is that enough salmon escape up the rivers to keep the tourist side happy.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing I want to say with regard to aquaculture which in the past few years I pressed for and did not get.  There are several inlets and bays that have natural scallop beds, mussel beds and oyster beds.  They are very easily fished out.  One I fished myself was Ventry where there is a small bed.  It is easy to fish it out.  If you had eight or nine boats there for a season you might not be able to go back there to get good fishing for three to four or maybe five years.</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity in inlets like that around the coast that have small beds.  The Department or BIM might <Col N="1638" /> help local fishermen; with the aid of small grants at particular times of the year they could go out and dredge those places because an enemy of shellfish is the starfish. There is a great number of starfish in these places and, first, they could voluntarily go out and dredge the place and get rid of the starfish and secondly, they could try to expand the bed by reseeding with new spats.  There are successful oyster and scallop farms and even mussel farms and the spat could be bought from these farms.  What you would be doing would be the same as what happened in Fenit.  Six or seven years ago fishermen in Fenit were at each other's throats and boats were being sunk.  Every kind of war was going on there.  I was a member of the steering committee &mdash; we have a county committee of fisheries in Kerry &mdash; and they were told by the then Minister to come up with a solution to the problem. There was over-fishing, there was illegal fishing.  It looked like a problem that could never be solved, yet today it is solved and they had very good fishing down there this year.</P>
    <P>What it provides is control over oyster fishing when the season opens in October until the end of March.  When it was not controlled you had people bringing in small oysters.  They were absolutely destroying the beds, and they got about six weeks of lucrative oyster fishing. What has happened now is that it is controlled, there is a quota for each boat depending on the size of the boat.  If there are two men on the boat they are allowed to catch X number of oysters and if there are three men on the boat they are allowed to catch a bigger number.  In that way, at the end of their week's work, each boat regardless of its size and numbers of crew more or less earns the same amount of money.  They have that fishery going on now until the season closes in March. There are nearly 100 boats and multiplied by the two or three fishermen on board, you have 200 to 300 people in good employment.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look into the possibility, through the Central Fisheries Board or BIM or whatever to try to introduce ranching and to try to get the <Col N="1639" /> fishermen involved in salmon farming. As I see it at the moment, you have companies or individuals with money and they are the people who are doing the salmon farming.  Admittedly they will give good solid employment as long as there are people who want to eat fish. That is the beauty of it.  The Minister should look into getting the fishermen more involved in the whole aquacultural side, especially in salmon ranching.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions on this important debate on Report 33 on aquaculture by the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, published in October 1986.  I shall try to reply to the various points raised by Senators during the course of the debate.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator McGowan for his comment that our Department in the short time that we are in existence have responded in a positive way.  I feel that we have done that and that we will continue to respond in this positive way.  He referred to control and I will deal with that &mdash; a number of other Senators referred to it also.</P>
      <P>The importance of aquaculture in coastal areas is vitally important in that it is a natural resource, achmhainn nádúrtha, as Senator de Buitléar referred to it, in the areas where there are few other sources of employment and where the unemployment rate is twice the national average.  We appreciate this and we realise the importance of subsisting those who are anxious to become involved in the development of aquaculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGowan referred to the assurance that there should not be any foreign involvement, that all locals should be catered for.  Certainly there is a mix in so far as foreign investment at the initial stages was important because these foreign developers brought with them technological benefits from investments by them in previous years and decades in their own countries.  I fully appreciate and I wish to put on record <Col N="1640" /> that I realise the importance of getting the maximum benefit for locals in terms of jobs and added value to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The most recent development is the growth of substantial and sophisticated indigenous companies such as Carlings, Fanad, the ESB and others &mdash; I referred to this in my initial contribution.  That is our policy and I feel strongly that the small farmers must be catered for.  I am not just saying this today as a cosmetic exercise.  We have put this into action and it is part of our policy, having had discussions with various public representatives and people in the industry.</P>
    <P>In so far as the satellite farmers are concerned, in rural areas if fish farming is to be successful there must be the good will of the community.  It is a two-way process.  Where there are large multinational companies I think it is important that there be a mix.  In relation to satellite farming all would agree that it is a welcome innovation in the industry.  Satellite licences will allow small scale producers to operate side by side with the well established large volume of salmon farms thereby gaining from the expertise and management experience of the bigger producers.  I believe that as some of the large scale producers move out to open seasides there will be more room for the satellite farming schemes to be introduced in the sheltered areas.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point Senator McCormack referred to, that it is the new technology.  Because of the new technology larger farmers will be in a position now to move out with larger cages into the rougher seas.  The new technology referred to by Senator McCormack will allow us to utilise farming sites which were previously unthinkable for fish farming.  It goes without saying that more advanced cage systems will require greater capital outlay and of course will increase the risk attached to the venture.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the larger companies are prepared to do this and to move out into the more open sea leaving the more sheltered sites for the small producers.  I said that these small producers would not be in a position to <Col N="1641" /> become involved in fish farming because of the capital that is required, the expertise that is needed and the management control and marketing.  With the close relationship between the small and the large producers I think they can be very successful once more.  I firmly believe that licences must be issued in the names of the small producers and not in the names of large producers who could terminate any agreement at any time. The licences will be in the names of the satellite farmers and they will have an internal arrangement with the larger companies.  It will also mean that under management control of the larger companies, they can place their cages in areas at distances much closer than if there were several producers of salmon.  The distance in that case would be one kilometre whereas with the management control there would be more room in various bays and inlets for these small producers.  It will ensure that we can make greater use of the limited sites that are available to us.  We have a long coastline but the sites available are limited.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan referred to the pollution and said that I should take very seriously the situation of the Swilly where there are 20 factory ships at the moment. There are more than 20, and I referred to this in my initial contribution.  I was pleased to inform the House that at least 20 ships there are processing mackerel from Scottish coasts and not from Irish coasts.  This time last year the mackerel season was closed.  We had landed some 72,000 tonnes in six weeks because of the indiscriminate landing of fish on the west coast.  There was no plan.  Fish were landed indiscriminately at minimum prices, at no advantage to the fishermen. The tonnage landed was much greater than the capacity to produce.  Consequently, many of these went to fish-meal and were not for human consumption.</P>
    <P>Because of the arrangement we have with the industry this year there is a tonnage per vessel per fortnight.  One will appreciate that because of the weather conditions we did not provide for a tonnage per week.  We have regular landings to plants throughout the country.  This <Col N="1642" /> means that only a very small percentage, if any, has gone to fish-meal this year. This may be because of the quality, the long rough steam 48 hours from the north west coast down to Killybegs.  All this can affect the quality of the fish.  Less than 1 per cent went to fish-meal because of the planned approach here.</P>
    <P>While this is not fully relevant to Report No. 33 in relation to aquaculture, which Senator McGowan referred to, I would like to inform the House that the boats in the Swilly are the boats which have been serviced by the Scottish fleet.  We have, of course, some four or five luggers in Killybegs but they are to take the overflow.  They will only receive fish after we are fully satisfied that the shore has been serviced.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan referred to the danger of pollution of the waters and to the lack of work for locals.  The people of Rathmullen were delighted and pleased when we in the Department licensed these vessels.  There is a spin-off to a small village such as Rathmullen who are benefiting substantially.  We also have an input through our Customs and Excise.</P>
    <P>We must remember that during the months of October, November and December our boats were fishing off the north west coast of Scotland.  We must remember also that we are in the EC and that we must work in harmony.  If I felt that those boats were causing pollution and creating serious problems for the aquaculture industry, we could take another view.  I do not have to spell out the view that I would have there.  All that is being pumped back is the water being used while the mackerel are being processed. The affluent would be going to fish-meal and frozen in blocks and there would be no problem there.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the serious problems of pollution.  Ten days ago the Minister and I were particularly perturbed.  We monitored the movements of the <i>Hellespoint Courage</i>, a Liberian crude oil tanker which left the north east coast of Scotland on its way to Corpus Christi in the States and developed steering problems.  Fortunately the emergency steering operated. They turned and headed back off <Col N="1643" /> the north west coast of Ireland, around the Mull of Kintyre, and went to anchor off Aran Island off the coast of Scotland where repairs were effected.  It was a particularly worrying night, for all of us. That was the night when the storms created havoc off the west coast.  That boat was carrying 69,500 tonnes of crude oil. One shudders to think what could have happened were it not for the fact that they had emergency steering.</P>
    <P>I also want to indicate that all of that was being monitored by the MRCC in Shannon, by the Swilly &ldquo;Marine Surveyors&rdquo; Office in Dublin, by Malin Head and of course by Clyde in Scotland and supervised both by the Minister and me. We were glad to report late that night that our fears had been allayed and that the boat had finally found its way through.  We must be very careful, and all we can do is ensure that we have legislation in place in the event of another <i>Kowloon Bridge.</i>  There would have been no comparison if this boat had leaked its cargo off our coast.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Seanad for the speedy passage of the Oil Pollution of the Sea Bill, 1987.  I hope to take Committee Stage next week.  That covers vessels carrying oil as cargo.  We are also drafting legislation which will be known as the Sea Pollution Bill, 1988.  This will update the 1975 or 1976 Act and cover materials other than oil.  We are not reacting to a situation of last week which could have produced a serious problem here.</P>
    <P>Senator McCormack referred to the question of EC grants and where we stand now.  He referred to the report itself and the previous regulations.  Grants are made available to us from the Community under Council Regulation No. 40/28 of 1986.  It is from that source that finance is obtained from Europe.  In order to qualify for grant-aid from Europe, there must be a minimum of 10 per cent grants sanctioned within the State.  In regard to Gaeltacht areas and BIM, we also have responsibility.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that in the Council of Ministers on 15 December the Commissioner and his officials, the President <Col N="1644" /> and his officials and my colleagues in the Council of Ministers expressed our disappointment at receiving less than 2 per cent of the overall grant-aid available to us.  It is not sufficient to express my disappointment.  We must take some action.  That was the first step we took. After that we arranged a meeting between our officials and officials of the Commission.  We had a further meeting in Europe late last week in relation to this.  We want to make absolutely certain that from here on in we can receive an equitable share of the moneys that are available.</P>
    <P>Senator McCormack asked what has gone wrong.  This year we endorsed the applications.  I should say that it is a matter for the applicants to prepare the applications to Europe.  They are straightforward.  They will receive any assistance they require from my Department, from BIM and from Údarás na Gaeltachta.  I do not believe that the applications this year were any different from previous years.  I was of the firm belief that something in the region of £3.5 million would be available to us.  One can only have one's application processed twice.  Eight applicants applied for a total of some £3.8 million and we had hoped for grants amounting to £3.5 million.  Of course that is in the past.  I would like to reiterate that this is the prerogative of the Commission.  All we can do is impress upon them our disappointment and improve, if that is possible, the applications we submit and submit more detailed information if this is necessary. We must, of course, with any application, convince the EC of the viability of our industry and that each individual project is worthwhile and worthy of support.  We intend to provide the Commission with detailed economic backup information on projects.  Last year we had only one tranche, this year we have two.  We would hope that the results of the applications in the first tranche of the year, which will be available in May, will be much more favourable than those which were decided upon towards the end of last year.</P>
    <P>Senator McCormack referred to the <Col N="1645" /> fact that fish imports amounted to some £35 million.  We must strive to reduce this and we must strive to substitute for these imports.  If one analyses the type of fish being imported the large percentage would be processed white fish.  I referred earlier to the difficulty we have which is continuity of supply.  Naturally, with a fresh market so near home, a small market in Dublin, much bigger markets in Fleetwood, Hull and Grimsby, anyone involved in the industry is going to go for the maximum price.  The fish are being exported fresh because of the supply and demand and the quality of our white fish demands a high price.  We need to have continuity of landings.  There is a problem because of the weather, but if we can strive to build up a deep sea white fish fleet and ensure that they are able to fish at times when our 65 to 90 footers and over cannot fish then we can, with a continuity of supply, be in a better position to add value to our catches.  There is no better industry than the fish processing industry to respond if the raw material is available.</P>
    <P>Senator McCormack referred to the shortage of supply of juveniles.  I would like to inform the House that substantial investment has taken place here.  We are now moving towards a position of self sufficiency in the supply of smolts.  The Senator also referred to the report of the Salmon Review Group.  This report has been welcomed by all.  It gives a concise history of the salmon fishing industry in this country over very many years.  There are many worthwhile recommendations in this report.  I have views on how we should tackle the many problems of the industry, but I think I would be flying in the face of the industry itself if I were to express them.  I have had many opportunties since the review group presented the report to the Minister.  We have now asked the industry to give us their views on the recommendations.  If I were to express my views openly at this stage then I would be pre-empting the views of the many who, I hope, will respond to our request and our public advertisement in the national press to those interested to make their views known to us by 29 <Col N="1646" /> February.  We will then take an overview of all and try and ensure that we can implement a policy in the best interests of all involved in the salmon fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Senator McCormack also referred to the rod fishing licence.  I would like to take the opportunity of reiterating what I stated in this House and in the Dail and elsewhere that all of the income from rod licences will go to the fish industry.  I would like to remind everyone that it is not £15 for a trout and coarse licence.  It is £15 for a trout licence and £10 for a coarse licence.  The media seem to believe that it is £15 across the board.  We are fully committed to the development and protection of the industry.  All of the finance obtained from these rod licences will go to the development and protection of the industry.  It is not another form of taxation to go to the Department of Finance to be used for some other purpose.</P>
    <P>I would also like to remind this House &mdash; this is not pre-empting an election but I might not get the opportunity before the season starts &mdash; that this was passed unanimously, not only by this House but by Dáil Éireann.  Some members of the Oireachtas now find it is popular to go to public meetings and condemn the Government and the Minister for the Marine for introducing this licence. Those people know &mdash; their spokespersons and the Leaders of some of their parties intervened in the debate &mdash; that the legislation was passed unanimously by the Seanad and Dáil Éireann, apart from a vote called for by the Labour Party on the Second Stage of the Bill.  It is important to note this.  Anything that is said either in the Seanad or in the Dáil is fully recorded.  While people may not be aware of how people voted at the time they will be made aware that it was a unanimous decision and it is pointless for politicians to try to gain popularity by suggesting they are completely opposed to it.  If they are opposed or if they were opposed then that was the time to do it. We are doing this in all good faith because we believe it is necessary to protect and develop our inland fisheries.  It is not a <Col N="1647" /> penal tax and I would ask the various angling associations throughout the country to co-operate with us.  We want co-operation and not confrontation and by December 1988 or January 1989 they will have seen what we are doing, and that we are sincere.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to obstacles to the development in designated areas. Of course there are obstacles.  We try to determine the amount of aquaculture a particular bay or a particular inlet can sustain.  This is of course a scientific exercise. I referred earlier to the question of distance separation criteria for fish farms that are operating separately to prevent disease spread.  Of course working under the same management control the distance is a major problem.  As I said earlier in the debate &mdash; and this was referred to by a number of Senators &mdash; we fully take the traditional rights of sea harvesters into consideration.  Of course the water quality is taken into account.  We must determine what level of environmental monitoring needs to be done.  This involves detailed consultation with all parties concerned and we in the Department fully believe in consultation with the industry and will continue to consult with them.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir de Buitléar an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an timpeallacht. Tá a fhios agam go rí-mhaith an tsuim atá aige san timpeallacht agus glacaim leis na pointí a luaigh sé agus déanfaimid gach iarracht chun an timpeallacht a chaomhnú.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to ecological baseline surveys and we are, at present, using water quality management plans in areas where problems of conflict are going to arise, for example, between industry and local authorities which discharge effluent and fish farms that need clean water.  The Senator's concerns are well founded and we must do our utmost to be absolutely certain that the type of pollutant that he refers to can be prevented if at all possible.  One cannot categorically state that fish farms do not pollute.  Certainly fish farms pollute. With the proper quality control we can <Col N="1648" /> ensure that the pollution resulting from Irish farms will not have any effect on the environment or indeed on any other fish life.</P>
    <P>Finally in relation to the points made by Senator de Buitléar the last thing I want is for fish farming to effectively sterilise areas so that it is no further use to the farmers or indeed to others.  This often necessitates caution.  We in the Department have a very rigorous system to control the import of smolts, in case of a disease risk.  If anything we are criticised because some people feel that the system is much too rigorous but I feel it is necessary if we are to have proper control.</P>

    <P>He also referred to the question of satellite farms which I dealt with, I hope adequately, both initially and in my reply, and I fully appreciate the necessity to ensure that satellite farmers are catered for.  He referred to the infrastructure of two fish farms.  Of course it is not the fish farms alone.  All along the west, in Donegal, Kerry, Galway and Mayo there are fish processing plants.  As recently as last week officials of the Department of the Marine had a meeting with officials of the Department of the Environment and Seamus Keating, the Galway County Manager, at which this problem was discussed, and they looked at the possibility of approaching the Community for funding to help us over this difficulty.  I discussed with a number of people in West Galway, particularly in the Clifden area when I attended their annual gala on Saturday week last and spoke to them on the question of salmon farming generally in so far as it was the Irish Salmon Growers Association who organised the conference. It was very beneficial and I would certainly encourage public representatives to attend these conferences and to familiarise themselves with fish farming.  I accept that the greatest danger is that there are too many people who <Col N="1649" /> are not fully aware of the fish farming process and its fears of the unknown.</P>
    <P>We have a duty in our Department to try to familiarise those people who have fears of the unknown with the exact process. Senator Fitzgerald referred to the fear that was there many years ago in the Kerry area when rainbow trout farms were set up.  It was a fear of the unknown but with the passage of time people have become satisfied that many of these fears were unfounded.  He referred to the small boat men and I think that they should take an interest in satellite farms.  I am convinced that if we took a decision in Ireland that we should not have any farming of salmon because of the effects it would have on wild fish, it would not have increased the price of wild fish at all.  The production of smoked salmon in Ireland is only 5 per cent or thereabouts of the total production of smoked salmon and it would be wrong of us to assume that that would affect the price of wild fish.  Wild fish will always demand a premium price.  One can compare it with the bainin sweater as against the báinín-type sweater which was manufactured in Italy a number of years ago.  Initially it had an effect but after a short time those who were purchasing became aware of the vast difference between the two.  There is a difference but it is a matter of opinion and it is a matter of taste between wild salmon and farm salmon.  I once had that view but now I am convinced otherwise.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of ranching I have no intention of going into it now because times does not permit me.  Furthermore, it is with the Salmon Review Group and I would respectfully suggest to anyone who has views in relation to this that they should make these views known to the Department before the 29th and if Senator Fitzgerald has strong views on ranching we will give consideration to them.  He also referred to the value of salmon to tourism as against drift netting. Of course, one cannot compare those but we will have another day to discuss this when I will be able to elaborate more fully.</P>
    <P>While many Senators referred to fishing at sea and the effects that this was <Col N="1650" /> having on salmon, no one referred to the question of pollution on the land.  I am of the strong belief that there are serious problems with pollution and that must be tackled.  A sub-committee of the Cabinet are tackling that problem.  It is quite easy to see.  It is all happening at sea.  Everything is fine on land.  That is one we can tackle and one that can help us to resolve the problems.  Senator Fitzgerald also referred to &ldquo;the few honest to God fishermen&rdquo;. I think it was a slip of the tongue. What he possibly meant to say was that all fishermen are honest to God fishermen.  I would not like it to go on record that Senator Fitzgerald, who is a fisherman himself, differentiated between some types of fishermen.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate.  It has given me food for thought. I will try to ensure that any fears the Senators have can be allayed.  I am delighted that we have now in place the development strategy for the aquaculture industry.  It is now approved by the Government.  The guidelines are there. We will try to ensure that we streamline this as far as possible to make it much less difficult for those who want to become involved in the industry.  We will weave together all the strands that were there in the past and hindered the development of the aquaculture industry and we will do our utmost to assist in every way.</P>
    <P>The point that came across from all Senators was the question of control.  We fully appreciate the importance of this. We only have to look back to May or June of last year when we had in Cork the problem of bonamie in relation to oysters.  We acted immediately when the native oysters there became affected with the disease.  I will take the opportunity of clarifying the position.  That disease does not affect the oysters for human consumption. It only affects the oysters for relaying purposes.  We acted immediately and we made an order ensuring that these could not be transferred to other parts of the country.  That is the type of action which we will take any time there are difficulties in relation to control.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Brian O'Shea that he proposes to raise the following matter: the problems arising for a certain company in proposals of the Department of the Environment in relation to the EC directive on containers for beverages.  Before I call Senator O'Shea, may I just point out that the Chair would be obliged if individual companies or persons were not named.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire mar gheall ar an seans atá agam an cheist seo a phlé san Seanad mar cheist í seo atá anphráinneach i mo cheanntar féin.</P>
      <P>The Clerk of the Seanad informed me earlier that I was not to name the company involved and I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his guidance on that. I am here primarily to plead for the security of 105 industrial jobs in Waterford city and to ensure further expansion of the particular company involved here. This expansion is also very much in the pipeline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company of which I speak has <Col N="1652" /> been operating for the past six or seven years on the industrial estate in Waterford city and it employs 105 people. During that period there have been no lay-offs at the company, there has been no short-time and indeed there is a fairly high level of overtime at the plant which means that, in effect, these are quite well paid jobs.  In a city like Waterford which lost 900 industrial jobs through rationalisation in Waterford Glass late last year, these jobs are very important.  To give some idea of the scale of the company, the annual wage bill is in the region of £2 million.  The receipts to the Exchequer in terms of PRSI and PAYE payments would be in the region of £800,000.</P>
    <P>Obviously this company is a very important employer in Waterford and there is a very definite prospect of a $3 million expansion to the plant either late this year or early next year.  This expansion would provide an extra eight jobs. There is a programme under consideration with the principals of the parent company in the USA relating to the adaptation of the company's present equipment to change the size of can tops which this particular company produce. At present they produce a 209 millimetre can top.  By the year 1990 it is reliably stated that the demand in Europe will be for a 206 millimetre can top and that 80 per cent of the demand in Europe will be for this particular can top.  In order to adapt the company's plant and machinery to bring about this change, it will require an investment of $7 million over a two to three year period.  It will also effect quite a saving in material costs in terms of the manufacturing of the can tops.</P>
    <P>There is the prospect of a $10 million investment in that company.  A request for that appropriation has gone from the Waterford subsidiary to the parent company in the States.  There is confidence in Waterford that the request will be successful, all things being equal, but this is where the problem arises.  The Department of the Environment in response to EC Directive 85/339 relating to the packaging of beverages, in January <Col N="1653" /> 1987 came up with a programme, part of which was to outlaw cans for beer.  On the Irish market beer in cans accounts for about 1 per cent of the market.  This would be small, but we have to look at the company's co-operation.</P>
    <P>In terms of the company's produce, the production for the Irish market would be very small.  The company depend on exporting to the member countries in the EC, and the major worry that the American principals have is that there will be a knock-on effect in other member states. Ireland is the only member state which has come up with proposals to curtail the use of cans, and it seems the company are interpreting this as a hostile act against the industry.  I would have to say in fairness, that I do not consider that that was what was intended by the Department.  Indeed, I am sure it is not. If we look at the company's operation &mdash; I am talking about the parent body and its subsidiaries &mdash; there is a subsidiary in Norwich and a subsidiary in Rhymney in Wales.  The programme in response to this EC Directive from Britain has contained nothing relating to the curtailment of the use of cans.  I understand that as this programme has been processed through the Community, there has been a response from the environment and consumer protection directorate saying that they cannot recommend the acceptance. I understand this emanated from Britain along the lines of consumer affairs rather than environmental affairs.  What Britain does, or does not do, is something that I am not concerned about here. Essentially what I am concerned about is protecting the 105 jobs in Waterford and the prospect of eight more, and ensuring that the eight jobs that I mentioned earlier will, in fact, come to fruition.</P>
    <P>The company have Italian and Spanish subsidiaries.  Obviously the plants in Britain and the plants in Italy and Spain will be looking for the type of investment from their parent that should be coming to Waterford.  In conversation this morning with the managing director of the company, he stressed that the expansion programme in Waterford is at risk unless there is a favourable decision.  What is <Col N="1654" /> meant here by a &ldquo;favourable decision&rdquo; is that the Department of the Environment would decide not to go ahead with their proposal to ban beer in cans.  Because of the way production is moving in Europe &mdash; where it is expected that by the year 1990, 80 per cent of cans will be of a smaller type &mdash; if the plant in Waterford does not get the investment from the parent company in the United States, obviously the operation in Waterford would be to some extent at risk.</P>
    <P>The week before last I brought a delegation from the trade union in the job to meet officials of the Minister's Department. We were very well received and a very good case was made by the trade union personnel.  They stressed they were there to protect jobs, to ensure their employment and to ensure that the company continued to prosper in Waterford. They felt &mdash; and I agree with them &mdash; that initially when this proposal was made the reaction of the parent company in the United States was not envisaged.  Indeed, the managing director told me that there had been no discussions with the company prior to this particular programme being forwarded to the EC.</P>
    <P>I am putting it to the Minister, therefore that in terms of protecting and cleaning up our environment, the Labour Party, myself and the trade union movement generally, like the people who came here last week, are interested in a clean, pollution free environment, but this whole question must be put in context. There is an ongoing problem at all times between environment and jobs.  In our present situation where there is a high level of emigration and a very high level of unemployment, putting at risk a company such as the one I describe for what, in effect, would have a fairly minimal result on our environment, in terms of making it a cleaner environment could have a profoundly damaging effect in the general area of employment.  This directive relates to containers for beverages and not just to cans.  Because there are other containers which, in my view, are equally as damaging to the environment I feel that the number of cans involved <Col N="1655" /> will have no serious impact environmentally.</P>
    <P>This directive relates to containers for beverages and not just to cans.  Because there are other containers which, in my view, are equally as damaging to the environment I feel that the number of cans involved will have no serious impact environmentally.</P>
    <P>The pundits tell us that by the year 2000 more than half the jobs in our country will be in the tourism/leisure related areas. This enforces the idea of a cleaner environment, but this particular aspect of the programme has a certain cosmetic effect. It is something that is there.  It sounds as if we are making a lot of progress environmentally, but I would submit that we are not making that type of progress at all.  It worries me greatly, having spoken to the unions and to the managing director of the plant, that the programmes I have described &mdash; the expansion programme and the programme for the conversion of the present equipment for the manufacture of smaller cans &mdash; are under consideration in the United States.  I will repeat myself and say that the company feel that a Government who did a great deal, and rightly so, to encourage them to set up a manufacturing plant in Ireland now appear to be doing something that could be very damaging to the company's whole operation in Europe because the parent company is the largest manufacturer of packaging in the world. I hope their investment and presence in Ireland will increase rather than diminish.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to have another look at this and make a decision in favour of protecting 105 jobs, ensuring the creation of eight more jobs and that £2 million is not withdrawn from the local economy in Waterford.  In regard to the Minister's Department I should like to say that the package of incentives introduced by the previous Government led to great progress being made by Waterford Corporation.  A new shopping complex is about to commence in the city.  The rationale behind that complex is based on consumer spending and if £2 million <Col N="1656" /> is withdrawn from the local economy or is decreased what Waterford Corporation are trying to achieve will be damaged. Under the programme for the shopping development, many historical and archaeological sites in the city will be developed and the city council are going out to sell the city as an area for tourism much more forcibly than has been done in the past.  Every investment that improves the local economy in Waterford is absolutely vital.  Therefore, at the end of the day if the present 105 jobs in a company that has not seen any lay-offs, where there has not been any short-time working and where there is a high level of overtime, are put at risk what the city council are trying to achieve in developing Waterford in terms of its commercial and service sector will be devastated.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day £800,000 will be going back to the Exchequer in the form of PRSI and PAYE payments.  If, for instance, those people were to lose their jobs &mdash; that is a prospect I do not want to contemplate &mdash; instead of being net contributors of £800,000 to the Exchequer they would be in receipt of money from the Exchequer.  The impact of this part of the programme, this proposal to outlaw beer cans, on Waterford must be taken into consideration.  When considering the effects environmentally we must bear in mind the effect on 105 families in Waterford and, indeed, on the economy generally if the sale of canned beer is outlawed.  I hope the Minister will look at this case sympathetically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>We must always be careful that we do not indulge in a lot of double talk in so far as environmental protection and control are concerned.  It appears that many people are all for the environment, but at a price.  It is all right in any circumstance as long as it does not affect themselves and, unfortunately, that applies to some other aspects of life.  It is all right to put it anywhere you like, but do not put it next to me or do not put them next to me.  I am trying to get away from that.  The environmental programme I have is not a cosmetic exercise <Col N="1657" /> in any sense and, for the first time since the foundation of the State, I am stiffening up the environmental division of the Department of the Environment so that it can respond to the environmental requirements as I understand them and as the people want to see them developed over the next number of years.  That was not always the case.</P>
      <P>How can we make progress on anything if every project or proposal we put up is challenged by some sectional interest or group?  That has always been the case.  When the Senator speaks about urban incentives and the advantages that have been taken of them, he must remember that it was not a Coalition proposal at all.  It was a Fianna Fáil proposal in 1982 and the Coalition left it aside for four years until they reactivated it and saw the usefulness of the programme we had suggested.  It is we who have brought that to fruition now in the Custom House Docks area and in the other designated areas.  We must get our facts right.  I am concerned that we do not end up with a lot of lip service in this country on improved environmental control.  That is what has bedevilled the whole effort to bring about a cleaner environment for far too long.</P>
      <P>There is an awareness now that the apathy that existed in so far as environmental protection and development were concerned has passed and I would like to think that collectively we would see the need to take positive steps.  It is not always possible to accommodate everybody, but if it is in the national interest and if it is in the interest of protecting and preserving an asset which is absolutely essential for the environment, including what the Senator said about the tourist development programme, then so be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to prohibit the sale of canned beer here was an important element of the national programme for the implementation of the EC Directive 85/339/EEC.  This directive, which was notified to member states on 27 June 1985 obliges member states to draw up four-yearly programmes, beginning in 1987, to reduce the volume and tonnage of beverage containers discarded into the <Col N="1658" /> waste stream.  That is what we were asked to do.  This objective can be achieved either by legislative or administrative means but the measures chosen must be geared to achieving economies in raw material utilisation, reduction in energy consumption and improved environmental standards.  They are not my requirements.  They are the requirements of the EC Directive.  Within the framework of the national programme the measures to be pursued can include encouragement of refilling and recycling of containers, the promotion of selective collection and retrieval of non-refillable varieties for economically feasible uses and for the development of consumer education.</P>
    <P>The initial Irish programme was presented to the EC Commission in January 1987 and was the first such programme to be submitted by any member state.  Hurray, we were first for once in the European sense.  It was formulated following detailed consultation with the trade interests in the various beverage marketing sectors and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  These included the beer, wine and spirits, soft drinks and liquid milk industries which are the main beverage container users here.  The programme took account, as it was required to do by the directive, of the current level of industrial activity and the extent to which particular forms of container were used in the various drinks sectors.</P>
    <P>While it became clear that the use of cans in the soft drinks trade should be allowed to continue indefinitely because of the extent to which this form of container was used in the trade, the situation in the beer sector was radically different. Unlike other member states the Irish beer market is almost totally dictated by consumer demand for either draught or bottled beer and can function effectively without canned beer.  This country has the highest European percentage of beer sales in draught form.  I am informed that the total beer market here is in the region of 700 million pints and that approximately 86 per cent of this is supplied through draught beer deliveries to the licensed trade.  Of the balance, some 13 <Col N="1659" /> per cent is sold in glass bottles while only 1 per cent is sold in cans.  There is widespread acceptance in trade circles here that marketing requirements can be met satisfactorily by confining beer distribution to sales in draught or in glass bottles and it was, therefore, a logical step to move towards prohibition of this form of container.</P>
    <P>There is no question of the proposed prohibition being a barrier to trade. There is a well established pattern of foreign beers being brewed here to meet consumer requirements.  Well known British, Dutch and German beer brands are marketed here in draught from and it is anticipated that this pattern will continue. There is also an established but limited traffic in imported bottled beer.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of the EC directive in question is to reduce the environmental impact of used containers.  This country's proposal to prohibit the sale of canned beer is a sound one from an environmental point of view particularly when seen in conjunction with the arrangements being made, and spelled out in the national programme, to step up the level of glass recycling.</P>
    <P>Specific steps have already been taken by the Department to promote and financially assist the expansion of glass recovery and recycling operations which, unlike the recycling of metal cans, has been shown to be a practical proposition here.  In the circumstances it makes sense from an environmental point of view to prohibit the use of cans in a market sector where glass has largely been used until now.  The national programme emphasises the need of continuing the study of recycling possibilities in both the metal can and plastic container sectors and there is, furthermore, reservation in the programme that in the event of development here of commercially viable can recycling facilities the continuance of the prohibition could be reviewed.  I would like to come forward now to comply with that request and do what is being done successfully in other countries.  That would enable me to carry out a review in <Col N="1660" /> a positive way and seek a solution to this matter.</P>
    <P>Widespread publicity was given to the content of the national programme and, in particular, to the proposed prohibition of canned beer sales when the programme was presented to the EC Commission 12 months ago.  There was no adverse criticism from anybody at that time and this continued to be the situation up until September 1987 when a draft of the proposed regulations was sent to the EC Commission, as required by Article 7 of the relevant directive.  At this point the Commission chose to seek further information on the Irish programme which it had received no less than eight months previously and to raise a number of queries, some of which related to purely procedural aspects, on the proposed regulations.  This was accompanied by a request that the making of the regulations should be deferred.  The matter has since been the subject of correspondence and discussion with representatives of both the Environment and the Internal Market Directorates of the Commission as well as the Commission's legal services department.  Well reasoned replies have been given to the points made by the Commission and the Commission has been informed that the making of the regulations as previously proposed is still under consideration in my Department.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that some of the procedural points raised by the Commission were unreasonably obstructive and they were motivated, at least to some degree, by a build-up of pressure from external trade interests.  I want to make it clear that I am not criticising either the management or workers of the factory which has given rise to this debate for registering concern that the proposed prohibition of canned beer sales here might prejudice in some way their export trade.  The company manufactures metal can ends and I understand that the entire product is exported.  I can see no real grounds for concern that export outlets will be affected.  Both the marketing and consumer patterns of the other member states are very different <Col N="1661" /> from those which prevail here.  Canned beer is widely sold in other member states and allowing for the directive requirement that market conditions must be taken into account in the formulation of programmes there is no reason to believe that they would follow the Irish lead.</P>
    <P>Certainly no such prohibition is proposed in the UK programme, a draft of which was recently furnished to the EC. These points have been explained repeatedly in discussions between company representatives and officers of my Department and I am surprised at the continuing suggestion that proposals formulated to deal with a purely national environmental problem should continue to raise some industrial hackles.  In some of the correspondence which I have seen the can prohibition has been described as &ldquo;hostile&rdquo; to the industry.  I consider such terminology unnecessarily emotive as well as unfounded.</P>
    <P>I will close by saying that the regulations, and their scope, are still under consideration and have not been finalised. <Col N="1662" /> The programme to which they relate is a phased one and is reviewable at four year intervals.  There is provision for ongoing consultation between the public sector and trade interests both to monitor the implementation of the programme and to consider further possibilities for achieving the objectives of the directive. I will be meeting some other interests in this matter in the immediate future. There is a willingness by me to consult in the matter.  What I would like to see achieved is that a recycling process could be achieved internally, like the instance I have given of recycling glass.  If I could get the operator the Senator is talking about and some of the bigger movers in the manufacturing of the product involved then we would have taken a step forward in the environmental sense and would be providing a satisfactory solution to all concerned.  I hope that can be achieved.</P>
