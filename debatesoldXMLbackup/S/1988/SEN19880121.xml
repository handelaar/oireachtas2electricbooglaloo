      <P>I have notice from Senator Nuala Fennell that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the serious lack of cancer screening facilities for Irish women as compared to women in other EC countries, the need for the Minister for Health to indicate a countrywide cancer screening programme which would be consistent with his commitment to preventive medical care.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to expedite the processing of applications by farmers throughout the north Cork region for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The possibility of siting the administrative headquarters of the proposed National Forestry Authority in Castlerea, County Roscommon, as part of the Government's decentralisation policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> I regard the matters raised by Senators Fennell, Bradford and Connor as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Fennell's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Bradford and Connor may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, there are two points that I wish to raise.  Can the Leader of the House tell us when we can expect the Companies Bill?  As I understand it, there have been a great number of changes and proposed changes.  It is only fair that we give the various spokes-persons a chance to do their work for that Bill.  Secondly, I would like to refer to a report detailed on the ITN news last evening and in <i>The Irish Press</i> today and which states that huge quantities of arms have been imported into this country in recent times, including surface to air missiles and mortar bombs.  If this report is factually true it will constitute the greatest threat to life and civilisation that this island will have ever faced.  There is a need, in the public interest, for a reply from the Minister for Justice as to whether or not this information is factually correct and what steps the Government are taking to deal with the matter. Because of the urgency of the matter I propose to seek under Standing Order 29 an emergency debate on this subject today.  I will give you notice after we conclude the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Leader of the House indicated that he would advise the House today of new and pending legislation which will be coming into the House.  Perhaps, he can give us that further information today.</P>

      <P>Before we adjourned <Col N="695" /> for the Christmas recess I raised the matter of the Companies Bill and asked the Leader of the House at that time whether he could circulate the amendments which are now being proposed by the Government and by other people to that Bill so that we would be able to give them some consideration.  I reiterate that request now.  Could he also tell us when we can expect to take the Committee Stages of the Insurance Bill, 1987, the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987 and the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1987 and the Report Stage of the Video Recordings Bill, 1987?  That is important legislation. I understand that the Departments have had some difficulty in preparing some of those Bills.  It seems incredible but the Second Stage of the Adoption Bill was taken in the third week of July last.  At that stage there was haste on the Government's part to discuss that Bill.  The Minister, in his Second Stage speech, indicated that he was going to bring in another Adoption Bill as soon as possible and wanted to get the Bill under discussion through very quickly.  Six months later we have not reached its Committee Stage.  We should take that Bill immediately. I also ask the Leader of the House to address himself again to the possibility of a debate on the Constitution.</P>

      <P>First of all, I would like to support the call made by Senator Manning for further information on this very serious and disturbing report that large quantities of significant and dangerous weapons have been imported into the country.  Secondly, I would like to know whether it is intended that the Housing Finance Agency (Amendment) Bill, 1987 will be taken next Thursday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of questions for the Leader of the House.  First of all, I want to refer to item No. 11 on today's Order Paper, which is the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1987.  Am I permitted to refer to it?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will leave it to the electorate of the National University to decide on that.  On 15 separate occasions over the last 12 months members of the Government gave promises on this issue. All I want to say is that if the Leader of the House cannot persuade the Taoiseach and the Government to produce their own Bill then he could still facilitate a discussion of mine at an early stage.  I appreciate that many Members feel that there are defects in my Bill, but I am quite happy to consider amendments if there is some inertia on the part of the Government.  I would hate to think that bureaucratic objections are going to prevent them from keeping what I know was a sincere promise.</P>
      <P>In regard to other items, I want to associate myself with what Senator O'Toole has said.  I found the Committee Stage of the Video Recordings Bill rushed and compressed through no fault of the Members of this House and particularly through no fault of the Leader of the House or the Chief Whip of Fianna Fáil.  The Committee Stage was rushed because the Minister wanted to get this Bill out of the House quickly.  It was an extremely important matter and is something we are all agreed on.  The circumstances under which it had to be taken were somewhat unsatisfactory. Indeed, parts of the Committee Stage and parts of my own amendments could not be discussed, through no fault of any Member of this House.  Two months have now elapsed and this allegedly important Bill has sat on our Order Paper without any attempt at the provision of amendments. Can we have some indication from the Leader of the House as to what is the crisis that has developed on the Video Recording Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, like Senator O'Toole I ask if he can give us some indication as to what is the crisis that has developed on the Adoption Bill?  I appreciate that the <Col N="697" /> Minister has been busy closing down hospitals but he could still proceed with this Bill, which is extremely important. The image this House has will be affected by the fact that, in the words of a member of the Fine Gael Party in the Dáil, the Adoption Bill is languishing in the Seanad, as if in some way it was the fault of the Seanad that it had not been proceeded with.  It is not the fault of this House that Government business is not being proceeded with, it is the fault of the Government.  I wish they would get their act together and introduce the necessary amendments in good time so that we can have an intelligent discussion on the Bill.  I do not want to score political points on these issues.  I simply want to enable this House to participate intelligently in a discussion and I would hate to have us coming up towards July suddenly being landed with a clatter of amendments and Bills which will be rushed through in three or four days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised and I will take each of them in turn.  The Report Stage of the Video Recordings Bill will be taken next week. The Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill which is a Private Members Bill will not be taken in the near future.  The Government Bill on homeless persons will be published very shortly and the House will have an opportunity to debate it at an early stage.  The Housing Finance Agency (Amendment) Bill will be taken next Thursday and the Companies Bill will be taken very shortly.  I can only say that it will more than likely be taken next week or on 4 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The leader of the Fine Gael group, Senator Manning, raised the question of arms importations and if he puts down a request motion under Standing Order 29 (4) I am sure that satisfactory answers will be given.  That is the proper manner in which to deal with that matter.  In regard to the Adoption Bill I will again go to the Minister today to ensure that the Committee Stage of that Bill will be taken as soon as possible.  It is not the fault of the Seanad that that Bill is not before us.  I can give a guarantee to the <Col N="698" /> House that I will take appropriate action today to ensure that that Bill comes back into the House as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in the House yesterday that the Whips should get together to decide on the best way to deal with a debate on the Constitution.  I said that legislation would be of paramount importance to this House but that we would give time for a reasonable debate on the Constitution &mdash; and when I say a reasonable debate that could take place over a short period of time I do not mean that it would be a debate confined to just one day.  We want to set a formula whereby a reasonable discussion could take place on the Constitution and I did say yesterday that the Whips should get together to decide on how best to deal with that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said yesterday is that there is a mythology abroad that somehow what is being done in this country is inevitable and there is a particular offensive mythology abroad which suggests that if we did not have all those nasty, corrupt, self-interested, self-serving politicians, what is being done now would have been done a long time ago because it is so obviously correct.  The strategy that is being adopted, which is represented by severe, highly selective and highly discriminatory cutbacks in public services is not inevitable.  It is not the only way, and it most manifestly is not the best way.  There is a fundamental doubt as to whether it can even achieve the objectives it is supposed to achieve.</P>
      <P>I am not persuaded that continuous and successive cutbacks in public expenditure will ever actually achieve the objective of balancing the books of the Government.  I am not persuaded that reducing public expenditure, which apparently will now result in a decline in gross national product and an inevitable decline in disposable income and in tax returns, will ever actually balance the books because I think it will cause a disproportionate depression in economic activity which will result in a decline in revenue to the State and an increase in unemployment which will have the direct opposite effect of what is intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have frequently asked people &mdash; people in industry, commerce, business and economists &mdash; to give me an example of a country which has taken the road that they are advocating at the state we are at and under the conditions we have and which has succeeded in achieving anything.  We have had these prescriptions tried, these prescriptions of dealing with economic crisis by severe cutbacks in public expenditure, all over South America, prescribed by the International Monetary Fund and by various <Col N="700" /> other agencies.  In no country have they succeeded in bringing anything other than misery, deprivation and injustice. They have not produced economic growth.  They have not produced economic advantages to the great majority of the population.  There is no evidence that what these produce is a short-term painful shock followed by a return to growth. It has not been demonstrated.  It is a theory of an increasingly vocal lobby of economists which has very little factual evidence to sustain it.</P>
    <P>I do think it needs to be said and said again that if economics is a science &mdash; which I doubt &mdash; then it must operate according to the rules of science.  The first one is that the theory is only as good as the experimental evidence.  However fine, pleasant, simplistic or appealing the theory, it is no good unless there is evidence to sustain it.  I repeat what I have said over and over again, instead of presuming that because you say things over and over again that it becomes true, would those who advocate the line being taken by our Government please tell the Irish people and us where it has worked. For example, in 1981 Sweden had a budget deficit considerably in excess of ours as a percentage of gross national product.  They have now almost eliminated it and they did not do it by closing hospitals and cutting back on fundamental services.  They did it in an entirely different way.  They did it without extensive human misery, without increasing the numbers of people who are unemployed, without causing a collapse in their productive sector, without causing massive emigration.  It is impossible to find any serious study by an Irish economist on the achievements of many of the smaller nations of Europe.  They have this fixation with looking West towards the United States which is a singularly unsuitable model or else looking to the Far East to a totally different culture. There is an utter unwillingness to look at comparable models, countries of a comparable state to ourselves &mdash; like Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Austria and indeed Switzerland &mdash; and not to copy <Col N="701" /> them but to see what we can learn from them.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that there is now appearing an underlying strategy in these cutbacks which seems to me to be close to being a calculated attack on the poor and it is as much a reflection on the people who interview them as it is on the Government that when the Taoiseach was interviewed recently, he was able to dismiss an allegation that the cutbacks were bearing too heavily on the poor, simply by saying no they were not. Because neither the radio journalists nor television journalists who interviewed them seemed to have any information.  I do think that instead of going on and dealing with a whole lot of issues I would like to confine the remainder of what I had to say to detailing &mdash; and I can do it without notes because it is so clear &mdash; the scale of the assault on poor people in our society by the present Government.  The first thing that needs to be said is that there is no doubt that the real levels of welfare payments have been maintained. There is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>If we were to go on that alone then the alleged protection of the poor would appear superficially to have been sustained. The truth is of course that there is far more deprivation than income; it is a fundamental.</P>
    <P>The first thing to be said is that everybody on welfare is unacceptably poor because of the unacceptably low levels of welfare.  The second thing that needs to be said is that if at the same time as we do no more than maintain the real value of welfare, we make health services more inaccessible and increase waiting lists for health services.  The same applies to education if we begin to chip away at free education, as is being done and has been done by successive Governments in recent years, so that little demands are made here and there on the fixed income of the poor for extra contributions for school heating, for the provision of things as minor as toilet paper.  In the case of the school where my daughter attends, pupils have been asked to bring in plastic bags because there is a leak in the roof and the seats are getting wet.  They need <Col N="702" /> something to sit on so that they do not catch pneumonia.  The list is endless of minor expenditures and minor costs schools can no longer meet.</P>
    <P>If I am asked to contribute a voluntary contribution of 50p a week, of course I can afford it but if I was on £35 a week or £50 a week then 50p unbudgetted, unplanned, that I now have to meet means a litre of milk gone from the family table.  They are the choices people are being forced to make.  Even more fundamental than the assault on the costs which poor people have to sustain, the costs they will have to sustain in many areas of life as various economies are introduced in the health services, in the education services, in the deprivation of immediate treatment for their children which will result in increasing illness, are the cutbacks in the maternity services which will invariably result in an increase in the infant mortality rate.  Margaret Thatcher has the dubious distinction of being the first British Prime Minister in the past 30 years to preside over an increase in the infant mortality rate in Britain.  I regret to say that I think the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, may well have the same dubious distinction in this country.  They are the sort of things that are easily seen if one wants to look.</P>
    <P>It is a regrettable fact that most of our society, and most of our politics, seem to choose to adjudicate on the commitment to the poor exclusively in terms of whether their increases are above or below the increase in the cost of living. There is far more to the plight of under-privileged people in our society, to oppressed people in our society than income.</P>
    <P>Let me go through the other small things which have gone unnoticed but which seem to me to be part of a deliberate plan.  There was, for instance, the decision to close the National Social Service Board which now appears to have been reversed but which did appear to be part of a strategy.  There is the in some ways more serious decision to hamstring the Ombudsman.  In a quite extraordinary decision to save a small sum of money the Ombudsman has been <Col N="703" /> deprived of staff and has been compelled to make a special report to the Oireachtas which the Oireachtas so far has blissfully chosen to ignore.  I know there is a motion on the Order Paper of this House from Fine Gael Members about the matter but we have not discussed it and, apparently, we will not discuss it.  The consequence of the Ombudsman being deprived of his capacity to operate is that people who need welfare, or who need other State services, can be put on the long finger, can be delayed, can be slowed down, can be kept waiting and will not be in a position to assert their right to have their services provided because the one independent enforcement agency that was available to them has been taken from them.  That will result in the oppression of the poor even further in our society.</P>
    <P>When we go through detail upon detail of peripheral areas where unnecessary economies which could not be justified in terms of the overall needs are being made we see that they all end up oppressing the poor far more than anybody else.  The Government have created a climate of hostility to the unemployed, have created a climate in which every innovation in the Department of Social Welfare, whether it be computerisation or anything else, is seen, highlighted and headlined as another attempt to deal with fraud.  It is virtually impossible now to get a member of the Government, or of the Government party, to talk about the consistent, deliberate degradation which unemployed people have to go through in the process of signing on.  We have a consistent, and I think deliberate, degradation underlying virtually every statement from the Minister for Social Welfare on the issue of welfare.  It seems to be a consistent catalogue of anti-abuse campaigns as if abuse was the only problem in social welfare, as if the humiliation of the recipients was not an equal problem.</P>
    <P>I referred to the apparently deliberate calculated undermining of the Combat Poverty Agency in this House before, to the three successive reductions in one <Col N="704" /> year in their allocated budget, to the arbitrary, unplanned, unconsulted cut backs in the budget of that agency.  I said at the time that it appeared to me to be mean-minded and vindictive and I repeat it now.  The idea that the poor would be protected in a society where all the independent agencies who attempt to vindicate their rights are being hamstrung is a joke.  It is a reflection on us, on the media, and on the governing party, that the Taoiseach could get away with that extraordinary assertion that there was no particular way in which one could see the poor carrying the burden of the cutbacks in public expenditure.  The truth is that virtually nobody else has carried the burden of the cutbacks in public expenditure. Other people have been inconvenienced by the cutbacks, that I accept. I have been inconvenienced, the Members of this House, people in jobs, and people in houses have been inconvenienced but the only ones who have suffered from the cutbacks in public expenditure, who have suffered because they see the difference in their dignity, they see the difference in their standard of living in terms of basic commodities like health, education, housing, income and food, are the poor.  That is the difference.</P>
    <P>The idea that the burden is carried equally when some of us suffer an inconvenience while others suffer a gap in the fundamental needs of life, the idea that it is an equal burden because they take £2 off me and £2 off somebody on £35 a week is a joke.  That is not carrying the burden equally.  We have a society in which the economists say we have this extraordinary position where everything is taxed except those things that cannot move out of the country, where we tax the income of people who are employed and, if they do not like it, they can move. We tax goods and if the people do not like that they can smuggle them in but we do not tax property, we do not tax capital and we do not tax wealth which are precisely the things that nobody can move out of the country.  That comes from a Government who claim not to be discriminating against the poor.  They <Col N="705" /> may not be discriminating against the poor as consciously as they are discriminating in favour of the rich but the outcome is exactly the same.  The wealthy, the affluent, the powerful are protected, are cossetted, are rubbed up the right way.</P>
    <P>We have now a culture of affluence, a culture of wealth in our society, where the vulgar display of wealth is something to be encouraged, something to be approved of.  It is regarded as the sign of success, of enterprise and of achievement. We are now moving from the idea where vulgar displays of wealth and affluence were regarded as precisely that to a position of beginning to nod, approve and encourage these because they are supposed to be the signs of wealth and affluence.  A society which adopts that as the criterion to measure its development is a society which has already discriminated against the poor, which has already judged the poor.  That is the underlying philosophy.</P>
    <P>The underlying philosophy, as <i>The Irish Times</i> said during the October crash, is based on the satisfying of the perceptions of the financial markets.  <i>The Irish Times</i> said, quite perceptively at the time that two things motivate the financial marketplace: one is greed and the other is fear.  If that statement had come from me it could be dismissed as left wing rhetoric but that was from an editorial in <i>The Irish Times.</i> Whatever <i>The Irish Times</i> was 20 years ago, or ten years ago, it is not now a left wing journal. I find it extraordinary that the whole of our country's economic strategy is based on developing an economic strategy which meets the demands of the financial marketplace and the financial marketplace is based on two things, greed and fear.  Our society's economic strategy is based on satisfying the greed and the fear of the financial markets.  That is most regrettable and that is why, inevitably, poor people will be the victims of what is going on.  We cannot simultaneously satisfy the greed and the fear of the financial markets and satisfy the basic needs of the poor because satisfying the basic needs of the poor will produce an <Col N="706" /> inevitable response in terms of the greed and fear of the rich.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we give in to the rich and the powerful and in the process the poor are the victims.  That is the most regrettable part of the present strategy.  It is not permitted for me to talk about taxation on this motion but I would simply say there is considerable and increasingly well documented evidence that there are other remedies in terms of dealing with public expenditure.  There is an increasing volume of information on that.  Most of it stayed buried up until about three or four months ago but it comes to light as more and more people begin to wonder about what is going on.  I do think at this stage that the idea that there is no alternative ought to be dismissed.  The risks involved in various strategies are what we should be talking about.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say much more because many Members want to speak. It needs to be said, and it will continue to be said by myself, that what has been done in the past 12 months, and the greater dose of it that we are going to see in the next 12 months, is nothing less than the most concerted and best organised attack on the welfare, the housing conditions, the health conditions, the education conditions and the job opportunities of the poorest in our society.  It is being done, sadly, by a party who used to build their strengths on their concerns for those people and who used to build their strength on a commitment to those people.  That is part of the big tragedy of the past nine or ten months.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, there were things that had to be done but many of the things that were done were not done because of financial constraints.  Cutting back on the Combat Poverty Agency, on the National Social Service Board, on the Office of the Ombudsman, were not products of financial constraints.  They were products of a strategy to quieten the poor, to shut them up, to effectively prevent them from complaining as their services deteriorated.  They do not have the resources to take legal action.  They do not have the resources to interest the <Col N="707" /> media.  They can only use the agencies that are available to them and those agencies are hamstrung.  That is why it is becoming clear to me that, at the back of this strategy of cutbacks, lies the hand of not just a political party, or a Government Department, but of certain extremely influential economists who boast about the fact that they have been consulted, boast about the fact that they have had a major say in how cutbacks should be implemented and boast about the psychology which underlies those cutbacks. Anybody who wants to read more should read the reports in <i>The Irish Times</i> on the economic workshop meeting in Kenmare and they will see what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about some sort of inevitable housekeeping of our finances. We are talking about an ideology and a philosophy and that ideology is anti-poor and pro-rich.  That is why it is so regrettable that the Government's assault on the poor and the under-privileged has been so easily buried by the media because so few people, either in politics or in the media, have bothered to study in detail what is going on.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance in his opening address when introducing the Bill on 18 December described 1987 as a good year.  I share that view. Could I just pick up a point made there by Senator Brendan Ryan who mentioned what I would interpret as the economic ideology of the Government?  Fianna Fáil could never be accused of being strong on economic ideology.  That is not intended to be a criticism but rather that they have faced in a practical and pragmatic way the issues of the day and tried to tackle them in that fashion.  The reality, of course, is that we now live in the harsh, tough new world of the late eighties.  The heady days of growth in the sixties and seventies are now no longer available to us.  From what I hear at many levels and in many places, there is a widespread understanding of the key importance of the state of the public finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tough and difficult cuts in public <Col N="708" /> expenditure taken by the Government are seen for the most part as necessary by most people.  Putting the public finances on a sound footing is vital to everything that we, as a people, aspire to. Confidence is, obviously, an essential ingredient to international recovery and to real economic growth.  The Government's determination to manage the public finances, to attack the stubbornly high level of national debt, and to try to reduce the stubbornly high current budget deficit are very much steps in the right direction in creating the climate and confidence for economic growth which is what we all aspire to and wish to return to as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The action which the Government have taken on the public finances since taking office last March represent an explicit demonstration of leadership.  The important difference between the results we have seen in the outturn for the end of 1987 and the years under the previous Government is that we now see practical evidence, encouraging results, of what the Government have been doing.  It is very obvious from the end of year Exchequer returns that the Government have, indeed, taken charge of the economy. For example, the current budget deficit for 1987 shows that the outturn is £20 million below the very tight target set in the March budget by the Fianna Fáil Government.  The overall Exchequer borrowing for capital and current expenditure was £72 million below the budget target and almost £360 million below the corresponding figure for 1986.  They are key results and they are an important encouragement showing that the harsh cuts are actually producing results in tackling the central problems of the level of the debt and day to day, current expenditure.</P>
    <P>Political leadership today must forget about short term goals and gains and take the necessary action to deal with the new world of the late eighties.  Already there is evidence that confidence is returning and this has been facilitated by a reduction in Exchequer borrowing, as I have just said, and by the emphasis that has been placed by the Government on <Col N="709" /> attracting funds back to the country.  The tough, indeed radical action taken on the public finances by the Government since taking office last March has made a direct contribution to the reduction of interest rates.  Falling interest rates are obviously necessary to create the climate for investment, making capital cheaper and encouraging people to invest.  Furthermore, since the outturn for 1987, when those results were published, interest rates have fallen that much further.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan talked about equity, or lack of it, in relation to the cuts.  The cuts, resulting in savings since last March, were made right across the board.  We do not like them.  Who likes cuts?  Who likes cuts in services of various kinds?  What has made them acceptable, and why a consensus has developed in favour of the cuts, harsh though they are, is that the pain has been spread across the board.  There is, however, one important exception in relation to the spread of the cuts and that is in the social welfare area. I reject the claim by Senator Brendan Ryan that the cuts made by the Govern&mdash; ment are a calculated assault on the poor. He conceded that in the past Fianna Fáil have been a party of concern for the less well-off and, indeed, compassion over many decades.  They are still very much that way, as I know as a member of the parliamentary party.  The reality is that if we are to achieve higher levels of support for social welfare, in addition to the rate of inflation which is quite an achievement in itself, we need the resources to do so.  Obviously, the amount that can be expended on social welfare has been facilitated by the resolute action of the Government in tackling abuses in the social welfare area.  That has brought in a number of millions of pounds which can now be channelled in order to maintain real levels of social welfare.</P>
    <P>Again, in his speech on 18 December the Minister for Finance made a lengthy reference to the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  Despite criticisms in certain quarters, this three year programme which was drawn up and based on consensus in consultation with the social <Col N="710" /> partners was indeed a significant achievement and agreement.  Unlike its two predecessors, <i>The Way Forward</i> in 1972 and <i>Building on Reality</i> in 1984 which were prepared by successive Governments acting alone, we now have a programme to which all the social partners committed themselves.  Clearly this augurs well for its implementation in the strict sense over the three-year period.</P>
    <P>The programme covers a range of issues including pay which is obviously a very important component.  It also covers a number of non-pay issues.  It was concluded without deflecting the single-minded determination of the Government to restore order in the public finances. The key element of the programme is the public service pay agreement.  I want to stress this element because pay is of critical importance as nearly half Exchequer expenditure is on pay.  At the outset of the pay agreement provision is made for a pay pause of six months and then there are modest annual pay increases of 2.5 per cent over the next three years.  It does, however, include provision for tax concessions and, like many others, I look forward to the budget next week to see the first increment of the tax concessions.  This is important in the context of the pay provisions because it should mean, with the tax concessions, that most people will be able to maintain their standard of pay and their standard of living.  A further feature of the programme is that the trade unions undertake in it not to engage in industrial action in pursuit of claims, and this should make a major contribution to industrial peace.</P>
    <P>I hope the realism, as demonstrated in the negotiations and in their conclusion, will continue in the three years ahead.  It is essential, obviously, that the pay terms of the agreement are strictly adhered to and, therefore, the agreement needs to be carefully monitored.  I emphasise this because public service pay for 1986 under the previous Government exceeded the target in the Coalition proposals in <i>Building on Reality</i> by £127 million.  This was largely responsible for the massive overrun on the current budget deficit in that year.  Therefore, strict monitoring and <Col N="711" /> control of pay is central, indeed vital, to the achievement of Government objectives. Care is, therefore, required to ensure that only the pay terms of the agreement are awarded.  There is no point in drawing up an agreement if the targets are seriously overshot.</P>
    <P>The modest but realistic pay increases in the programme must lead to an improvement in our international competitiveness. I was very encouraged by the speech of the Minister for Finance on 18 December and by the speech of the Minister of State yesterday showing that exports are thriving.  They are up very substantially, especially in the electronics area.  Perhaps more encouraging is that our indigenous industry in areas like textiles and clothing is also doing well.  That has been the weak link, as it were, in export performance but the increase in the level of exports by indigenous industry has continued to improve during 1987.</P>
    <P>We are not permitted to talk about taxation in this debate.  Senator Ryan mentioned that taxation sources should be sought elsewhere.  Taxation levels are excessive.  We all feel the pain of taxation. The reason expenditure has been tackled in such a radical and, I suggest, imaginative way, is really that no more tax can be raised at this point, especially from the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan also talked about vulgar displays of wealth.  It seems to me in the late eighties that very few people can afford to have that kind of wealth, vulgar or otherwise.  It sounds more like 20 years ago when people had that extra surplus, as it were, through the fruits of economic growth but which is not available at present.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> for tax concessions of £225 million over the next three years. The Government have already allocated additional resources to improve the system of tax collection and enforcement. This is often an area of criticism by those who feel hard pressed under the taxation system.</P>
    <P>All I want to do, a Chathaoirligh, is to make these few brief points.  Perhaps I <Col N="712" /> could summarise what I have been saying as follows.  The restoration of order in the public finances is a prerequisite for national recovery.  The Government have faced this challenge with courage &mdash; and it did require it &mdash; and determination by taking charge of the management of the economy.  There has been a positive response to these policies in that there is clear evidence that confidence, which is vital for investment and economic growth, is slowly but surely returning to the country.  Despite the severity of the cuts in places there is, I believe, widespread support for the general thrust of Government policy.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> which includes a public service pay agreement, is a document based on consensus and that augurs well for its implementation.  The many proposals in the programme are particularly important because pay represents almost half of Exchequer expenditure.  The pay terms of 2.5 per cent per annum preceded by the six months' pay pause combined with the tax concessions of £225 million over three years will mean that purchasing power, so important to employees, will be maintained in the period concerned.  Like everybody in the country I look forward eagerly to the Budget Statement next week to see what figure will be allocated to tax reduction from the agreed projected £225 million for the three year period.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, therefore, I submit that the Government are doing their duty. They are doing well: they are doing a good job.  This duty requires tough and difficult but fair decisions which must continue to be taken in the national interest to get this country back on the rails to prosperity in the future.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a few points on this important annual debate in the House.  First, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance in his opening speech yesterday said that 1987 was a good year and my colleague, Senator Brian Hillery, supported that claim this morning.  I would like to say that 1987 was a difficult year for many people.  People might like to think that perhaps Halley's comet influenced things here last year, and I am convinced that something had a strong influence on the present Government which made them change course with such vengeance once they were elected. I am one of the democrats who think that once a Government are elected they should be allowed to get on with their policies; be they the policies they were advocating before the election or not, once they set out on their post-election policies they should be left at it for a couple of years and be judged on the results.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of another year it is difficult to know what to say or advocate. Did the general public receive any recommendation from the Oireachtas?  It is one thing to pose questions but it is tantamount to political suicide to encourage or speak in favour of some of the policies being pursued by the present Government. However, it is clear that our country cannot continue to enjoy a standard of services which in most areas cost greatly in excess of what our taxpayers and the economy in general can support or afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is wrong with our educational system?  We compare very favourably on so many counts with any of the other countries in the EC or the developed world, but what is wrong with our system here that has produced generations of citizens, a high proportion of them dedicated to ripping off the State in one way or another?  Perhaps it is unfair to say that about the educational system because people might think it was implied that we are talking about the sectoral interests of teachers or whatever, but there must be something inherently wrong in that after so many years of <Col N="714" /> independence people see the State itself not as something they want to support and contribute to but as something there for the milking.</P>
    <P>In the general melee of the cutbacks and reorganisation, agricultural problems for some inexplicit reason have been lost.  That does not mean that all is well in that sector of our economy.  As a matter of fact, over the Christmas period &mdash; which this year was very quiet and restful and with the weather so mild there was no great hassle on anyone &mdash; I came across a quotation:</P>
    <P>We trained hard.  But it seemed that every time we were beginning to form up into teams we would be reorganised.</P>
    <P>I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganising, and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency and demoralisation.</P>
    <P>That was not said about the present Government, even with respect to the demolition of ACOT or the amalgamation with ACOT and An Foras Talúntais.  It was a quotation from Caius Petronius in 66 AD, so seemingly things do not change that much.  That quotation seemed to fit very nicely as a description of the mayhem and confusion in the agricultural advisory and research services at present.</P>
    <P>The proposed cutback in ACOT and the abolition of the county committees of agriculture has been sudden and has left a void that I presume will be eventually taken up by the private sector.  The Minister for Agriculture's handling of An Foras Taluntáis, the agricultural institute, gives me personally great regret.  In the 25 or 30 years of that organisation's existence they have carved out for themselves a niche in the international family of research institutes and they are recognised and respected, especially across Europe.  I cannot understand why the Government are not just content with reducing their budget by 40 per cent, a devastating blow on any institute or organisation.  To take from them their <Col N="715" /> name as well and replace it with a name that I last heard when I was going to school 30 or 40 years ago when we were learning Christian doctrine is a nonsense considering the work and expertise this institute have built up.</P>
    <P>Surely it is not possible to face the future with such a strong agricultural sector in our economy without the benefit of continuing agricultural research into viruses and strains of agricultural diseases or the development of new species of plants and seeds.  It leaves our entire agricultural economy very vulnerable, and surely we cannot expect our competitors in the other EC countries to be able to pick up the deficit we are inflicting on ourselves.</P>
    <P>The agricultural institute have served agriculture, the land and the people very well, and I hope the Minister for Agriculture will have a rethink before he deprives them of their name and reputation in the proposed changes.  We will have an opportunity of dealing at length with that when the proposed new legislation comes before the House.</P>
    <P>I read during Christmas about the Commission of the European Communities proposing a new voluntary set aside land programme.  Our Minister has not said what our attitude is going to be to that proposal, or at least if he has I have missed it.  One of the problems of fallowing land is land erosion and on the other hand, weed infestation.  It will not be a good situation for any farmer, even a farmer who decides he is going to continue on in full agricultural production, if his next door neighbour decides to avail of the set aside land grants and leave his land idle, because the farmer continuing in production will be infested with the weed seeds which will blow with the breezes over his hedge.  A serious disadvantage to fallow without growth cover is nitrogen bleaching of the soil and hence more pollution, so that in a strict sense all fallow by tillage or chemicals will cause erosion, and in my view, cover crops are necessary.</P>
    <P>I ask that our Government take a serious look at endeavouring to replace <Col N="716" /> this voluntary set aside land programme by encouraging farmers to produce alternative energy crops.  If we were to produce an energy product such as rapeseed oil with its by-product which could replace very costly imported protein meals, we would not be faced with the problem we met in 1974 for instance, when due to a shortage in the US, the price of the soya bean trebled with an extraordinary effect on the agricultural economy here.  I hope that our Minister for Agriculture and Food will put down an Irish amendment to the Commission's proposal on the set aside policy.  An alternative energy crop must surely be acceptable to the Commission and if the grant structure proposed for the set aside acreages were to be allocated for alternative energy crops, it could mean the introduction of an important new industry to the country.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the only oil crushing facility we have in the country for years, the National Oil and Cake Mill in Drogheda, has been in liquidation for some years now, but I see no reason why an additional plan could not be implemented for the more simplified process of producing for energy oil which does not need the same type of refinement as oils for human consumption would require.  It could be centrally situated in an area like Carlow, Portlaoise or Tullamore, in one efficient plant which would cover and service the entire country. I mention that in passing because it is important that, in regard to every proposal put forward by the Commission of the European Communities, our Ministers and civil servants should be in there very fast with a way of ensuring that such proposals can be amended to suit the best interests of the Irish economy and the various industries in general.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a number of different Departments.  The Forestry Commission have been re-organised.  I find it extraordinary that the Department of Energy can now decide not to allow the small family-type sawmills &mdash; of which there are some 300 in the country &mdash; to buy timber from the national forests. The reason they give for this is that <Col N="717" /> the Department of Finance have decided that squares of timber should be sold only to certain categories of taxpayers.  I find that absolutely amazing.</P>
    <P>There are many small family-run sawmills serving local communities in every county and the only place they can get their raw material is from the forests around the country.  It is nonsense if the foresters or the Department refuse to sell them timber just because they do not fall into certain tax categories.  As well as that, it gives the illusion that the Department now have decided to deal only with certain best favoured multinational empires who want to have a complete monopoly of the timber industry.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Finance clears this problem with his colleague in the Department of Energy because it is absolutely intolerable to think that the State services can be fixed in this regard.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with one or two other Votes.  Vote No. 23 which provides for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice is a vehicle under which one could have a nice debate on the question just raised. Nevertheless, I anticipate that we will have a debate on that.  Vote No. 29 provides for the salaries and expenses of the <Col N="719" /> Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants in lieu of rates, etc., to local authorities.  I have been a member of a local authority for some 30 years and I find it is no longer an occupation, a post or an elected office which is enjoyable for a number of reasons.  For example, services have had to be cut back and they have been cut back drastically in my county.  Of course, this is something I have raised at local level and I am not going to deal with it for very long here, except to point out to the Minister for Finance the seriousness of the evolving situation at local authority level.</P>
      <P>There are three operational areas in the county I represent.  The road services section in my area deals with about one third of the 500 miles of county roads. Those roads are used by many other people in addition to the local people because we are in the heart of the country and many roads cross back and forth through the county.  Yet, we have nine road workers only working every week on 400 to 500 miles of roads.  A sum of £20,000 is provided for the maintenance of county roads for the entire county. That is about £12 per mile.  It would not be possible, even for £12 per mile, to have somebody to wash the signposts at any of the crossroads never mind to have potholes repaired.  The Government have an obligation to examine that situation as soon as possible so that our road structure will not deteriorate still further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate and very sad for those of us who took pride in the high standard of local authority services that councils developed, nurtured, nursed and provided for the people during the past number of years to see them abandoned before our very eyes.  Of course, it is not fair to blame the Government for that. Some years ago service charges were introduced.  The problem originally arose in 1977 when the Fianna Fáil Government got a huge majority in the general election because of their promise to do away with rates and some taxes.  That kind of manifesto or platform would be popular in an election any year but there <Col N="720" /> was nothing to replace the finance and that is when the problem arose.  When the subsequent Coalition Government tried to introduce the imposition of levies and charges, some Fianna Fáil councillors publicly advocated non-payment.  It is very hard to get back from that.</P>
    <P>Terrible injury and damage has been done to local authorities and local administrations by the thoughtless acts of a very small number of people.  It is unfortunate that we now find ourselves in a disastrous situation where there are not sufficient funds to pay the staff to carry out the services.  In my county the public refused to pay £15 per year for a scavenging service where modern trucks called at houses in every village in the county every week.  They gave an excellent, comprehensive service but because the council did not have enough money they had to abandon that service.  Now some people who would not pay £15 for the service do not mind paying £100 to the private sector to do it.  We are such daft people that we can be led by the nose by people who advocate an easy way out. People do not think of the future.  That is sad because not only are the public going to pay for a more expensive service but it will not be as comprehensive as the public service it is replacing.  This will mean we are going to have more pollution and more indiscriminate dumping of domestic refuse on by-ways and in various parts of the country.  While people like to keep their own place tidy, they do not mind in the least rushing out and dumping their rubbish on somebody else's property.</P>
    <P>The policy changes introduced by the Minister for Education in the educational services system will mean a great reduction in second level education service at county level.  That is only gaining momentum at present and many of the staff in the smaller schools that have served the counties very well over the years do not know whether their jobs are secure and this leaves a lot of uncertainty. We are in a difficult phase at present because people are not happy in their work.  They are under pressure because of the uncertainty of their jobs and they <Col N="721" /> cannot see any hope for the future.  In addition, there is the problem &mdash; which, of course, is not new &mdash; of providing jobs for our young people.</P>
    <P>We need to awaken a national spirit, designed to encourage people to throw in their lot with the country.  The people who are working with or without encouragement from the Exchequer and the Central Funds will try perhaps to set up their own private services which will be attractive to the public and fill whatever voids are there.  However, the mentality to do that is not there at present.  The incentive must come from the Minister for Finance.  I hope that in his budget next week he will be very mindful of trying to encourage people to continue working and that taxation will be pegged at a level that will encourage people to continue to give of their best, not only in their own interest or that of their families but in their national interest also.  I hope the Government will endeavour to reduce the burden of taxation on the people who are continuing to work in this country.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make those points on the Appropriation Act, 1987, and I look forward to seeing how the Government and the Minister for Finance are going to react to the points that were made so very forcibly in the House before the recess.  Senators from all sides of the House have pointed out very clearly the difficulties &mdash; and not just the political difficulties &mdash; that the present fiscal legislation is having on some sectors of the people in this country.  I hope he will have as much of the wisdom of Solomon as can be expected next Wednesday. Above all, I hope the Government will endeavour to reintroduce hope and give fair play to the section of the population who are on the lower rungs of the ladder.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Appropriation Act gives us an opportunity to review events of the past 12 months as well as giving the Minister <Col N="722" /> the appropriations necessary to deal with matters in the coming year.  The Government have taken tough, difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions but these will not only ensure our future but the future of generations to come.  The Government's achievements speak for themselves: reductions in interest rates by 5½ per cent; stabilisation of our national debt; inflation down from 3.9 per cent to 3 per cent; Government budget targets achieved; borrowing reduced by £300 million; and exports at record levels. Above all, confidence has been restored to the Irish people.  However, there is much more to be done.</P>
    <P>Taxation is still at an unacceptably high level.  I welcome the Minister's decision in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to grant £70 million in tax relief to the hard-pressed PAYE sector and I hope that this is the first step on the road to tax equity and reform for this hard-pressed sector.  I fully appreciate the Minister's determined effort to secure the payment of outstanding taxes from the self-employed. However, as previous Governments have failed in their duty to collect these taxes, this fact, together with high interest rates, is resulting in grave cashflow problems for small businesses and the self-employed.  The Minister has introduced the 10 per cent penalty for those who are late in submitting their accounts.  In view of this it seems unjust that interest rates charged are in excess of the commercial bank rate. While bank interest rates are at 11 per cent approximately, interest charged by the Revenue Commissioners is 1.25 per cent per month which is the equivalent of 15 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>Small businesses and the self-employed are an important and growing source of employment in this economy.  This is the area which gives most hope for expansion in employment for those who find themselves victims of redundancy or unemployment. I welcome the Government's decision to provide an increase of 3 per cent from mid-July for social welfare recipients.  I would like to compliment the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, on extending the free fuel <Col N="723" /> scheme to cover 30,000 long term unemployed and the extension of optical and dental benefits for the wives of insured workers.</P>
    <P>However, increases in social welfare are no substitute for meaningful employment. Every source must be made available to combat our grave unemployment problem.  Bodies such as the IDA and Bord Fáilte must be examined with a view to making a greater contribution, directly or indirectly, to the creation of jobs.  It is a national scandal that the IDA have a land bank of almost 6,000 acres &mdash; two million square feet of empty factory space.  In conclusion, I wish the Minister and the Government every success in their stringent efforts to put this economy back on a sound footing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended opening my contribution on the basis on which I am now going to do it.  This arises because of some observations made by Senator Haughey here yesterday.  As we are talking about large sums of money under different headings, it is appropriate that, in the first instance, I deal with the question of sums of money paid to private enterprises, to publicly owned enterprises and the value that is gained from both of them.</P>
      <P>In this context, Senator Haughey seems to suggest that the call for privatisation was trying to strike the right balance.  Senator Haughey said that he believed in the mixed economy and that the balance needed to be weighted towards private enterprise.  He may be sincere about that, but the people who have been &ldquo;hollering&rdquo; for private enterprise certainly were not sincere and were not as well intentioned as Senator Haughey in striking a balance between private enterprise and publicly owned enterprises.  If we are not very careful about privatisation, we will have what they had in England which was a programme of denationalisation which has nothing to do with a mixed economy. This would be unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to put a few things on <Col N="724" /> the record about privatisation and publicly owned companies and the role they play in the economy having regard to the fact that more money is being appropriated both for private enterprise and for publicly owned companies.  In relation to publicly owned companies last year the public enterprise sector did not cost the taxpayer any money because overall they showed trading profits of £447 million The most profitable areas are open to privatisation.  We cannot have that, because ultimately somebody will sell off shares, the profitable operations, and the company lays off workers, all in the name of private profit.  Then there is no public benefit.  The economic development enjoyed as a result of the public enterprise, the job creation and the wealth produced are hindered and the State control over whether we encourage modernisation or expand new project policies and investment etc. is lost.  We must remember that private companies will not be looking for unprofitable State enterprises but will be looking for the profitable ones.</P>
    <P>Despite the incentives, inducements, grants, subsidised services and so on given to the private sector, it has not expanded over the past 15 years.  Grabbing what is already there is not a substitute for industrial expansion.  This is what the private sector have been doing. The fact that public enterprise employs only 2 per cent of the total number of employed in manufaturing industry is very revealing.  It certainly knocks the argument about privatisation on the head with regard to selling off the profitable aspects of the public sector.  The public sector is one of our few economic successes. At present there are 78,000 people employed throughout the country providing very essential services to the public.  To put these services into the hands of private enterprise threatens the security of jobs.</P>
    <P>Since the trade unions and the Government have entered into a national agreement into which is written a guarantee on job creation, there has been too much crowing about private enterprise taking on the profitable parts of the public <Col N="725" /> sector.  This must be tackled seriously to make sure that we do not end up with a denationalisation programme rather than a programme for a genuine mixed economy. There is nothing ideological in what I am saying.  I believe in the mixed economy but I am very much afraid of the people who can put their hands on very substantial sums of private money and invest it and, when the time is right, can sell off the investment to anybody, and control is lost.  The quick buck mentality is at work.  We have seen a great deal of evidence of that in recent times.  For example, in Britain when they decided to start privatisation in the public sector some of the companies were sold at give away prices and ultimately when an assessment was made of what was lost on these transactions, it showed an immediate loss to the tax payer of £4.5 billion in the selling off process, not to speak of the damage that was done when companies were taken over.</P>
    <P>There are many deficiencies which have to be tackled in the public sector. However, when you look at the number of private company closures every week, the number of redundancies and so on, the deficiencies in the public sector are nothing compared to the failures in the private sector which have led to massive job losses.  Privatisation would not make enterprise much more commercially successful. In fact, it would have the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>The demand for privatisation is not based on the needs of the national economy. It is a response to the cries of international capital.  For example, Mr. McPearson, an American banker and legal adviser, said last year that the US would link its aid giving programme to privatisation efforts and the head of livestock developments at the World Bank called for steps to be taken immediately to privatise CIE, Aer Lingus, ESB, NET, Bord na Móna and the airports.  These are very substantial public enterprises that have served this country very well.  The track record of the Irish private sector shows that their objective is short term <Col N="726" /> gains.  Short term gains certainly take precedence over long term benefits.  The evidence is there.  They failed on numerous occasions to heed the warnings on industrial organisation, both in the sixties and in the seventies.  The result of that was catastrophic job losses; so why are we all so terribly excited about what the private entrprise people will do for us?  When we have regard to all the inducements, incentives, grants, subsidised services and so on which they receive, it makes us sceptical about whether private enterprise can deliver on the question of job creation.</P>
    <P>I have regard to this in particular because of the national agreement that is being entered into.  I am afraid that the promises may not be delivered on, if we look at a mixed economy on the basis of denationalisation rather than just dealing with the question of efficiency within the private sector.  I showed earlier the amount of profit the private sector have made overall.  When the private sector can develop they will be supported, and more capital will be provided for them to develop more jobs.  The employees of one State company in one year paid more PAYE than the whole of the farming communities that year.  That is also something which we should regard seriously.</P>
    <P>Let us not get carried away with the powers of privatisation; they do not exist. I am sceptical of the powers of private enterprise as I was born and reared in the inner city of Dublin.  I know the population growth has been very substantial since I was a child in the twenties.  From the time when I could realise what full employment and unemployment meant, I have never seen full employment.  I will not see it before I die either.  There are many young people in this House who are probably 30 years younger than I who certainly will not see it either.  I am always astonished at the belief in the private sector.  The evidence is that there are no grounds for it, but we never face up to it.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to private enterprise. I would be behind it if I thought it was doing the job it is supposed to do and that it was not a selfish scrambling system. <Col N="727" /> I am antagonised by private enterprise because it is a selfish scrambling system which does not measure up against what the public sector have done over the years.  I pay tribute to Seán Lemass here on the development of the public sector and the development of the whole concept of a mixed economy.  We must recognise that private enterprise cannot match the performance of public enterprise overall, taking into account the benefits that go to both sides.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that earlier I referred to a State company in which the employees paid more in tax in 1984 than the entire farming community.  The company was An Bord Telecom.  I am not suggesting that farmers are not prepared to pay their fair share of tax.  Most of the farmers I have spoken to are prepared to pay their fair share of tax and are very forthcoming on it when you get into discussion with them.  But the people who lead them are not that keen on the idea and farmers are led away from the concept of measuring up to what they should pay in tax etc.  I do not blame the individual farmers.  It is a collective problem which can be remedied.  The PRSI proposal is a small beginning, but it is a beginning.</P>
    <P>People in public sector employment have good steady jobs and there is not the same temptation in a steady and permanent job to dodge tax as there is in private enterprise.  The use of the black economy is not open to public servants in the same way as it is to some private enterprise workers and they are not exposed to the possibility to abuse Government training schemes.  I do not want this to be taken out of context, but many of the employment schemes and enterprise allowance schemes are an abuse.  They are a means of suggesting that there are fewer people unemployed than there actually are.  In the public sector, people are not entitled to take up these schemes so they do not cost the Exchequer any money.</P>
    <P>Another interesting thing about the public sector is that it creates a lot of profits for the private sector.  For <Col N="728" /> example, in 1983-84 Aer Lingus paid £49.5 million to the oil companies for fuel, and over half the State's subvention to CIE is paid out to the private sector for goods and services.  Many private enterprises depend almost totally on public enterprise for an outlet for their product or service.  Dozens of provincial garages would have to lay of hundreds of workers if An Post and An Bord Telecom cancelled their contracts for the maintenance of a large part of their fleet, over 4,000 vehicles.  In 1985, An Post alone purchased 340 new vehicles.  If the sugar company closed tomorrow, about 50,000 farmers would be without a market for their produce.  That is one side of the argument about the moneys provided for both private and public enterprise.  There is clear evidence that the money put into public enterprise, having regard to the overall public sector, is a much better investment with one reservation, that is, that inefficiencies should be tackled.  We should all support that.  It is not a question of ideological hang-ups.  I am a little bit worried about somebody saying that we have to give a lift to private enterprise so as to get the balance right.  The balance is the other way around.  The public sector are doing their duty.  The private enterprise system has not come to terms with the country's long term needs.</P>
    <P>The cuts in public expenditure outlined in the 1988 Estimates for the Public Services and the public capital programme were not negotiated as part of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  It is important that I say that in this House as an ex-trade union official nominated for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. There is a belief that the cuts were actually negotiated by the trade unions with the Government.  It may sound funny, but if you go into a lot of pubs you find that is the belief.  The trade union movement certainly did not negotiate the cuts. They went into discussions on a pragmatic basis to serve the interests of their members.  Based on the fact that there is only one fixed principle operating in the trade unions, they went in to get the best conditions and wages they could for their members in all of the circumstances.  It is <Col N="729" /> necessary that the trade union movement be seen to be reserving their right to oppose the implementation of cuts. Where these cuts would result in a reduction in essential services to the public, or where they would bear heaviest on the lower paid social welfare recipients and the working class areas, certainly the trade union's voice will be heard again.</P>
    <P>The main problem with the tax system, as shown by the recent Exchequer returns, is that some sections of the community are not paying their fair share of tax.  The tax base is too narrow and some features of the system are highly repressive. As a result, the PAYE workers bear the brunt of the bad application of the tax system.  They are certainly paying much more than some sections of the community. Therefore a key element of the budget must be to reduce the disproportionate burden on the PAYE sector and provide real tax relief for workers.  I mention real tax relief because again we are talking about appropriating money to do certain things.  I will mention one or two examples later on of how we have not got real tax relief at this time.  There is some tax relief and credit for that must go to the parties to the national agreement.</P>
    <P>The tax system badly needs to be reformed so that the other sectors of the community, including the self-employed, companies, the owners of capital and wealth pay more.  I do not want to be regarded a farmer basher &mdash; I am certainly not that.  I have a great regard for the farming community, but they will have to be included in the overall situation.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment by the Government to reduce income tax.  This is to the accumulative value of £225 million.  Out of that, as I understand it, the PAYE allowance under the national agreement will cost only £70 million.  This is obviously the minimum.  I am not making the argument that more could have been provided at this time.  It should be understood, also, that what is happening to working class people is that they are not getting a great lift at all.  For the whole of 1988, between more job losses and so <Col N="730" /> on, the morale of workers will be further reduced.  When they open their wage packets and discover the reality of the tax relief, their morale will be even further reduced.</P>
    <P>I may have made a mistake in my figures in one or two of the examples I have given.  I will give two examples and I think that I have them right.  I left school a long, long time ago and I certainly could be inaccurate.  For example, if you take somebody who has £7,800 annually, or £150 a week in wages, he is getting a tax benefit of £17.50 for 1988.  Another increase in the allowance would yield him £26.50 in 1989 and another £35 in 1990, which would add up to a total of £79 over a three year period.  I hope I have that right, but this is how I see it.  The matter needs to be clarified or I must be contradicted. That comes down to people receiving an allowance spread over the three years of, on an average, 56p tax relief over and above what they have at the moment.  I hope I have that wrong because when people start opening their wage packets and realise they are only about 50p better off as a result of the £70 million tax spread, the situation will not be very satisfactory.  On the other hand, for somebody earning £13,000 and getting the same relief over the same period, the likelihood is that he or she will get £725 over the three year period.  The result of that will be a little over £5 a week extra in tax relief.  We are talking about two very different amounts of money.  I know it is not possible to go through all the cases and I do not intend to do so.  I thought I would give those two examples and perhaps somebody can correct me if I am wrong.</P>
    <P>The reason I am making the point is that nothing has come out of this national agreement except that, for pragmatic reasons, the trade unions needed to get in there, not only to play their role in the national recovery but to protect their own members' interests.  It is not a bad situation overall, having regard to the circumstances, but putting the wages and tax relief together over the three year period will create disappointment among the working classes.  There will be some <Col N="731" /> resentment because they misunderstood what the tax benefits would yield.  Also, coupled with the other job losses, etc., it will add to aggravation amongst the working classes in 1988.  All that can be said at this time is that it is a beginning to letting the PAYE workers see there is some hope that the disproportionate amount they are paying in tax will be tackled over a period of time.  It is a long, long haul.  I do not think we should fool anybody about that.</P>
    <P>The favourable outcome of the Exchequer finances in 1987, lower inflation and the fall of the dollar mean that some increased resources are now available for job creation.  Increases in social welfare payments and readjusting of the Estimates for 1988 could take place, also.  The opportunity is there. These selective increases in expenditure could be financed by reorganisation of grants and subsidies to industry and farmers. Unless action is now taken, the country will continue to face a growing crisis over the serious lack of jobs.  Recent forecasts from the ESRI and OECD indicate that unemployment and emigration will increase in 1988.  This will add to the misery of the working class sector.</P>
    <P>Not enough emphasis in the debate has been put on the whole question of what the key objective in the 1988 budget should be.  The key objective must be to create jobs and to halt the growth of unemployment and emigration.  I know that each person will crow in his own bailiwick.  Many people will be concerned about charges and so on.  If the jobs and tax situation were put right, many of the complaints over charges and so on may not have the same degree of severity or produce the same antagonism that is now manifested.</P>
    <P>The worrying thing is that the Estimates for the public services show that Government action today has been concentrated mainly on stabilising the national debt and the GNP ratio.  There are other areas in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; and we must not be too critical in that respect &mdash; where action must be taken.  There must not be just <Col N="732" /> an agreement.  For example, the 1988 budget must include specific measures to stimulate economic growth in 1988 and to implement the commitments to the programme of job creation, tax reform and increases in social welfare payments. It is easy enough to put it down on paper; the job of putting it into action must now be done.</P>
    <P>On the question of education and health, again, in the Estimates published last October the burden of adjustments was not shared equitably across all sections of society.  The poor and lower paid were hit hardest by the cuts in public spending.  Also, in framing the Estimates, the Government did not take sufficient account of the need for increased growth in the economy as a means of stabilising the national debt and the GNP ratio. Again, that brings us into the public sector area where there is an opportunity for the Government to act.</P>
    <P>We know that essential services to the public always cater for the lowest paid, social welfare recipients and the working class and these categories suffer most in the cuts in education, health and the local authority services, which were very severe and, I think it can be said, unjust. Whether they will damage the basic structures of these services I do not know; I think they will.  The structures have taken decades to establish.  When the Government were imposing cuts across the board, I do not think there was very much account taken of social equity and if they did take account of social equity, they missed out somewhere.</P>
    <P>The proposed increase in the teacher-pupil ratio certainly would reduce the educational opportunities of working class children.  Again, we have to guard against a two-nation development &mdash; the rich and the poor.  The changes in the health service &mdash; some of them actually by stealth &mdash; can lead to a two-tier health service.  While I do not suggest for one moment that the Minister for Health deliberately set out to achieve that purpose, the signs are that developments will head in that direction unless we can see more opportunities given to the credit <Col N="733" /> unions who have announced some initiatives in recent times to assist people to get health insurance.</P>
    <P>It has been said to me, and I am inclined to agree, that some of the public expenditure schemes and tax breaks are transferred to the rich who always seem to remain untouched when we are dealing with the Estimates or when we are doling out money.  If that is the case, the budget must readjust the 1988 Estimates to make sure that the public services get their proper whack.  Much damage has been done there to schools, education, health and so forth.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the farmers and said a little about the self-employed.  The fact of the matter is that the farmers and the other self-employed are not paying their proper share of direct tax.  This is not referring to the individual farmer. The large farmer leadership, in my view, can be a contributory factor to that. When you get big organisations like this, not only among the farmers but in the private sector also, there are opportunities for evasion and avoidance.  For example, if people are not paying their direct share of tax, there is great opportunity for evasion and avoidance.  For example, generous business allowances, expenses, etc.  can be allowed for tax purposes.  The recent OECD report shows that an average <i>per capita</i> income tax paid in 1986 by group was &mdash; employees £2,768, self-employed £2,005 and farmers £629.  Although 70,000 farmers earn more than the average industrial worker, only 17,500 of them are paying income tax.  In order to provide real tax relief for the PAYE worker, as set out in the <i>National Programme for Recovery</i>, the Government must raise more in taxation from farmers and other self-employed if they are going to be able to live up to the letter of the agreement they have made.</P>
    <P>I do not want to look across the House when I say this next little bit, but persons such as doctors, accountants and solicitors should be paying more in taxation. Immediate action should be taken by the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that most of these people pay more tax than <Col N="734" /> they are paying at the moment.  There must be evidence of it.  I will not go too far down that line.  You never know when you might need a doctor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Capital allowances and business expenses should be restricted and expenses deductable only when they are wholly, exclusively and necessarily for the purpose of a trade or profession. We all know the opportunities for evasion and avoidance.  The present refund scheme for unregistered farmers should be abolished.  All farmers should be required, as other taxable persons are, to register and maintain business records. Self-assessment should be introduced for farmers and the self-employed under certain conditions.</P>
      <P>With the introduction of self-assessment, the present system within the Revenue Commissioners for the examination of the accounts of the self-employed and of companies must be improved considerably and include the random selection for audit of a representative proportion of accounts by size of business and by occupation.  Penalties for noncompliance must be increased substantially and the tax collection powers of the Revenue Commissioners, including disclosure of information by the financial institutions, improved.  Before receiving any State grants, farmers and other self-employed persons should be obliged to supply a tax clearance certificate to show that they have paid all taxes and levies due from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the Government are committed to income tax reductions to the tune of £225 million but it is not going to mean a great deal for the worker.  If some of those things I have just mentioned were put into operation, the PAYE workers would see that there was a definite and consuming desire on the part of the Government really to tackle the problem of taxation.  I do not wish to point the finger at the present Government over the tax situation, certainly not.  Quite frankly, <Col N="735" /> the previous Government &mdash; and I was a member of one of the parties in Government &mdash; were to blame there, also.  There were plenty of opportunities, but they had not the bottle to tackle the rich in an effective way and we lost an opportunity there.</P>
    <P>For example, we could have gone a little further on the wealth tax.  Admittedly, the first yield from it was not great and, subsequently, Fianna Fáil did away with it.  In fact the first yield from any scheme is never great but this time the yield would have been much greater.  The people concerned got off the hook by making the argument that the tax would have the effect of money being taken out of the country.  Profit has no loyalty to anyone, it is a citizen of the world, so to speak.  Most of those people interested in making profit on their money are prepared to put it in banks in Switzerland if that is where profits are highest.  They might have a conscience in respect to some of the money made in this way but if their own profits are not as healthy as they think they should be, according to their criterion, they will not lose a lot of sleep about the overall position of the country.</P>
    <P>There have been good reports about the Exchequer finances and the Government's approach to the problem has been good to date.  They are now in a position to tackle the question of giving additional tax relief in the not too distant future.  As I have already said I do not think this will come about too quickly.  I suggest that if there is any extra money available, real tax relief should be thought about very seriously in the context of the budget.  At the end of the day if the people I criticised a few moments ago who move their money around in order to get a better return could see themselves getting a better return for their money here they would leave their money here.  It is a bad way to buy money but that is a fact of life.</P>
    <P>Increasing tax relief would provide an incentive for the PAYE worker to increase productivity.  What also adds to costs to the State is the overlapping and <Col N="736" /> duplication of trade union activity.  If proper attacks were made on the whole question of tax, if people were made to pay their way and if the disproportionate burden was taken off the PAYE worker, there would be a favourable climate in which to talk about a reduction in the number of trade unions and in which to introduce further measures with regard to the transfer of engagements, etc.  The trade union movement would accept that it would be better served by having fewer unions operating more efficiently and in a more direct way.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the moneys available for tax relief in the budget cannot be confined to the PAYE sector.  It is unfortunate that the indexation of the PAYE allowance cannot be increased significantly and that we cannot widen significantly the indexation of the standard rate tax band.  It is also unfortunate that we cannot ease further the burden on the low income taxpayers by widening the exemption in regard to payment of the young employment levy and that we cannot convert the tax allowance to tax credits as this would be much fairer for low income taxpayers.  Having regard to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government should seriously consider these issues.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> commits the Government to maintaining the overall value of social welfare benefits and to considering special provision for greater increases for those receiving the lowest payments.  This is why we believe the very minimum should be provided. We believe that Congress should be advocating that old age pensioners, the unemployed and others on social welfare should not be asked to bear any part of the sacrifices that may be necessary at present.  We believe that to ensure greater social equity and the maintenance of the living standards of social welfare recipients that social welfare payments should be increased at least in line with the cost of living.  Someone may say that that is a debatable point but frankly I do not believe that is so.  As the year goes on we will all come to realise that.</P>
    <P>Child income support should be <Col N="737" /> improved and the child dependant allowance should be standardised.  Incidentally, I read recently that we have over 100 different child benefit payments. We talk about the need for rationalisation and the need for people to be more productive and efficient, yet there is a lot of waste within our Government services. If the figure I have quoted for the number of child benefit payments is correct someone has got to look at that scheme.  I may not be accurate on the figure but I recall a man by the name of Barrington giving a lecture on local government reorganisation and when giving examples of inefficiency this was one of the things he mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency recommended that the income maintenance needs of unemployed young people between the ages of 16 and 18 should be reviewed expecially in regard to the supplementary welfare allowance.  There is an argument as to at what rate farmers and the self-employed should pay PRSI at in 1988.  The National Pensions Board recommended that they should pay at the rate of 6.6 per cent.  It is acknowledged in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that the yield from corporation tax is low due to the extraordinary number of relief and allowances which are available to companies.  The programme provides for a review of the corporation tax code and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>A recent OECD report shows that taxes and corporate profits now amount to 3 per cent of total tax revenue compared with 9 per cent in 1965, with 13 per cent in the United Kingdom, 7 per cent in the United States and 21 per cent in Japan.  The budget must provide for increased taxation from manufacturing companies.  When we compare the gap between the 3 per cent of total tax revenue with the figure of 9 per cent in 1965 and with the figures I have mentioned for the UK, the United States and Japan we can see that we are not doing that well in that area.  There must be some reform of the corporation tax code.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the question in regard to a tax on property is covered in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i><Col N="738" /> but certainly taxes on capital and property have been reduced substantially over the years.  They are lower than those in Britain, the United States and Japan and they are also lower than the EC average. That is another area which needs to be tackled.</P>
    <P>Given the increase in the repatriation of profits, a levy should be imposed on the portion of the profits of manufacturing companies that are not reinvested in productive assets in Ireland.  A portion of the levy could in fact be refunded to companies that increase employment levels or incur research and development costs in Ireland.  Allowances and reliefs in respect of capital assets could be restricted a little bit more and another look needs to be given to this area.  Further restrictions should be introduced on tax lending and leasing, including section 84 loans.  What I am opposed to is any extension of the tax relief available under the business expansion scheme or increasing further the income tax allowance available to private investors because, as I understand it, these schemes cost over £3.4 million in 1987 and have had very little effect on job creation.  As I have already said, if the Government are serious about creating jobs which they can control, which will be steady and sure and which will not lead people towards the black economy or other malpractices, then the public sector is the best bet.  We interpret too liberally &mdash; maybe the Revenue Commissioners are at fault here &mdash; what is a qualifying trade and therefore abuses creep in.</P>
    <P>The thresholds for capital gains tax and capital acquisition tax should be reduced. In particular, the exemption threshold for capital acquisition tax of £150,000 in the case of children should be reduced substantially.  The income thresholds and the level of relief for children under the residential property tax should be reduced to increase the yield from that tax.  Furthermore, stamp duty should be levied on inheritances.</P>
    <P>The budget can be seen as part of the process of implementing the four year <Col N="739" /><i>Programme for National Recovery</i> negotiated between the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This programme provides for the simultaneous implementation of integrated policies in four main areas: job creation, tax reform, stabilisation of the national debt-GNP ratio and the removal of social inequities in our society.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> provides for the creation in manufacturing industry of 20,000 extra jobs on average per year over the next ten years.  That is a very difficult task and I wish them well in their intention. Some people believe that private enterprise can do it all but it certainly cannot.</P>
    <P>The programme also provides for the creation of additional jobs in natural resources in a number of projects to be developed by State companies.  I would like to see that encouraged and it would relieve my concern whether sufficient emphasis is being given to job creation in the public sector.  For example, State companies could expand into the tourist industry and into international financial services.  Have Aer Lingus not branched out successfully into various areas?</P>
    <P>There should be a reallocation of the funds for industrial development to existing public enterprise for investment in job creation projects in information technology, forestry, high processed food projects, chemicals and pharmaceuticals and the 48 other projects outlined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Funds should be allocated to Airmotive, the Sugar Company, the ESB and Bord na Móna for the establishment on a joint venture basis of a substantial manufacturing project in the mechanical engineering industry.  There has been much abuse over the years with regard to the tax allowance relief for companies in respect of building, plant and machinery. As everyone else is suffering cutbacks that is an area that should be looked at as well.</P>
    <P>On the question on job creation we have to talk about recruitment to the public service, particularly in the revenue collection sections.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> provides that <Col N="740" /> additional resources would be made available to the Revenue Commissioners in order to achieve improved results.  I hope this becomes a reality.  I am a little bit sceptical about whether the will exists to win it but it can be achieved if we make up our minds about it and if the letter of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is adhered to.  One way or the other, if it is not adhered to what will happen is that there will be industrial strife.  If the terms of the agreement are not lived up to the unions will have to take another look at the position and pull out of the agreement. I do not see that happening but it should be borne in mind that the unions are not fastened into it.</P>
    <P>It should be clearly understood that the trade unions do not initiate wage claims; claims are initiated by the members and if their members who make an agreement see that that agreement is not being implemented or that there is no real desire on the part of one party to the agreement to live up to it then in the very same way as pressure mounts up for a wage increase, pressure will mount up for a withdrawal from this <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  That will be a sad day.  It is very important that we give our attention to tax reform, evasion, collection and enforcement as this will assist in the creation of jobs to which there is commitment in the programme.</P>
    <P>What we have to bear in mind is that we are in a great deal of trouble.  The difficulty we are undergoing at present was self imposed.  Nobody from the outside imposed it on us, we imposed it on ourselves down through the years. Nobody came in from outside and did it to us; we did it to ourselves down the years.  It was done not only by one Government but by successive Governments. There is no use wearing a crown of thorns about the fact that we are in a bad way, because we imposed the sorrow on ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy has deteriorated further into crisis since the last budget. Unemployment continues at its highest level ever and, according to recent forecasts, will increase further in 1987.  Emigration has recommenced.  The tax <Col N="741" /> system has not been reformed and real interest rates are at near record levels.</P>
    <P>The imbalance in the public finances remains and, as the Commission on Social Welfare showed, many social welfare recipients are living below the poverty line.  This deterioration, caused by a lack of planning and the insistence of successive Governments that developments be left to the free play of the market forces, reinforces the need for a new approach.</P>
    <P>The main problem facing the Irish economy is the lack of growth.  The next budget needs, therefore, to address two issues: first, how to improve the prospects for growth and jobs in 1987 and, secondly, how to begin to tackle the longerterm problem of rebuilding the Irish economy.  To get the economy growing again, specific measures should be introduced in the 1988 budget to improve the prospects for higher growth, the creation of wealth and lower unemployment than in 1987.</P>
    <P>In particular, the budget should provide for selective increases in job creation expenditure, to be financed by a reorganisation of subsidies to industry and farmers, real tax relief for PAYE workers to be financed by reforming the tax system, a move towards stabilising the national debt-GNP ratio by, in particular, increasing the rate of growth in GNP and increases in social welfare payments in line with the recommendations of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  Following the budget, a medium term national plan for growth and economic recovery should be introduced. The current crisis facing the Irish economy will not be solved overnight.  It requires a medium term strategy.</P>
    <P>It should be clear to all by now that moves to tackle the jobs crisis, tax reform, the national debt and the inequities in Irish society are feasible only in the context of a medium term plan for economic and social development in which specific priorities are laid down for a number of years ahead and an integrated approach is adopted to tackle <Col N="742" /> these problems.  The trade union movement is willing to play its part in the formulation of such a national plan.</P>
    <P>The urgent need for planning which would enable the Government to control development in the economy is highlighted by the inability of the Government in recent times to deal with building societies, ensure that price reductions are passed on to the consumer and to stop the growth in the &ldquo;black hole&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Overall, I have covered the proposals in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the situation at the moment.  The steps I have suggested need to be taken if we are to win the support of the working classes who, ultimately, constitute the majority.  They may not vote for the Labour Party but overall they constitute the majority of the nation and at the moment they are carrying a very disproportionate burden.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what Senator Harte had to say and I must confess that one would find it very difficult to disagree with a lot of it. He is a man of good sound logic and his arguments were very good.  I agree with him that the twin problems facing the country are inordinately high taxation and massive unemployment which is souldestroying. It is almost like a volcano with the social welfare payments merely keeping a lid on what is a very explosive situation.  The end of year Exchequer returns do give us some cause for optimism and hope.  They are an indication that Government policy is making some attempt to get the public finances under control.  I believe it will be many years yet and that it will be a painful process that will not be without very serious repercussions on the whole economy. The public sacrifices have been enormous, particularly in the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say something on the health services.  They, more than any other service, have suffered more in the nine months that the Government have been endeavouring to implement their new policy.  Admittedly, the health services up to last April were absorbing a disproportionate amount of the gross <Col N="743" /> national product.  Indeed, they were inefficient and wasteful.  By comparison with the British national health service they were an extortion on the public because we were not getting value for money and the relative cost, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the national health service, was deplorable.  In Britain &mdash; I have studied the figures and made comparisons with the populations in both countries &mdash; they get value for money with 100 per cent of the population covered.  We have to say that only 35 to 37 per cent of our population avail of a proper free health service.  Having said that, and knowing that the measures were necessary to bring some form of control into the health services, I would say without equivocation that the measures were too drastic in too short a time.  Economies were necessary to achieve fiscal control but the measures to bring them about and have them implemented in such a short time brought about chaos.</P>
    <P>To put the position in regard to the health services in proper perspective, it must be said that in the sixties and seventies we had created the impression among the public that there could be no limit on the amount we would spend on them.  Indeed, it began in the fifties with the great Minister for Health, Donogh O'Malley, who decided to abolish once and for all the poor law system that operated with the dispensary service.  He initiated that and he was a wonderful person.  However, that in its own way created public pressure for more and more improvements in the service.  The Adminstration that took over in 1973 thought they should go one step further and provide taxis to bring medical card patients to dispensaries and hospital outpatient departments.  We had fleets of taxis flying around Dublin city on that business.  That was done to prove that we had a caring Administration.  Indeed, patients of mine were getting taxis.  Many of them may have been elderly people but they were not incapacitated.  The taxis would call for them at 8.30 a.m. and, of course, the patients would sleep on.  The taxi man did not care if he did not get a reply, he just sat in his taxi running up <Col N="744" /> the bill.  The patient might wake at 10 a.m. or 10.30 a.m. and say he or she would not bother travelling that morning. Many of them also thought that as well as taking the trip in the taxi to the outpatient department they could get the taxi to take them to Moore Street to do a bit of shopping also.  There was gross abuse of that scheme and that escalated costs in the health services.</P>
    <P>Added to that there were major break throughs in the health services.  I am only trying to point out how this all developed. In the sixties we provided kidney dialysis machines to hospitals and we went one step further and provided them in the homes of the patients.  Many patients, young mothers and fathers, were able with the aid of dialysis machines to continue to work and lead a normal life. They might go into hospital and stay there overnight and then go to work the following day.  They were not exactly cheap but we provided them on an enormous scale and many, many lives were saved.  Later, we went one step further with heart transplants &mdash; very costly procedures &mdash; and coronary by-pass surgery, now a normal procedure costing between £12,000 and £20,000 with all the other ancillary services that are provided. We now have, perhaps, 1,000 people per year being restored to normal life with the aid of coronary by-pass surgery.  Then we said there must be bone marrow transplantations so that we could bring about remission for the many hundreds of children who have leukaemia.</P>
    <P>The break throughs were continuing at a phenomenal pace.  The public, seeing the television and other media coverage of the events and break throughs abroad, were making demands for those services and doctors responded to those demands by making their own demands on the health services and called for the setting up of special units.  We had hip replacement operations which restored many severely crippled people to normal mobility and a normal working life. <Col N="745" /> Thousands of such operations were carried out and we were not able to cope with the demand.  We had more geriatric patients and people living longer, each in their own way making more demands on the services.  We had the <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation technique, now a normal procedure but a very, very costly one.  We had new equipment such as CAT scans, costing £1 million.  We were to have one for the country, but we now have them in nearly every major hospital.  It has got to be that way because the demand has increased at a phenomenal pace.  Doctors are of the opinion that they must provide the best for their patients and patients have become more and more enlightened with the media highlighting all the new techniques.</P>
    <P>If we were to continue at that pace the cost of the health services would outstrip the gross national product, it would absorb more and more money.  That is a frightening thought.  We do not have a country that is creating more and more wealth and that is the big problem and the Government were confronted with when they took office last April.  The Government decided they had to do something positive and very definite; radical surgery had to be performed to bring about economies and bring the cost of the health services under control.  The only problem with that is that we cannot do that in a short time without creating havoc, chaos, a total breakdown and a major disruption of the whole service. The repercusions are enormous.  It is a very traumatic thing and we cannot just displace personnel in hospitals or close down hospitals without frightening effects on a community.  We cannot do this.  What we have to do is look at the problems, look at what has to be done and say, &ldquo;We will get the health services under control within five years by planning a number of economies and then in five years time we will have the matter totally under control.&rdquo;  Only by such a procedure can we have proper health services but we cannot just close the doors, turn the key and say it is all over.  We cannot do that and we may have done <Col N="746" /> immeasurable harm to our health services by that &mdash; if I may say &mdash;&ldquo;elephant in the china shop&rdquo; attitude.</P>
    <P>I hope wiser counsel will prevail and that we will see control of the health services over a phased period.  The answer is to decide the target for curtailment of the services and over a period of three to five years bring it under control.</P>
    <P>We know that hospitals are very costly places, that they are very inefficient and very wasteful.  There was a notion in our society that if a patient wanted a medical investigation he or she had to go into hospital.  Hospitals can cost as much as £1,000 a week for a bed.  Doctors, perhaps, agreed with this notion.  Patients felt they needed the medical investigation and doctors agreed that it should be done in hospital.  We never thought that we should get general practitioners or family doctors, to carry out many of these tests. For years I have been preaching this and have asked why patients had to go into hospital for tests.  I suggested that such patients should stay in hostels beside the hospital.  We had to look at those areas because hospitals are inefficient, wasteful and very costly.  We had to bring them under control in some way.  However, we cannot close them down.</P>
    <P>Many patients in psychiatric hospitals have been institutionalised for years and we cannot close the door on them, move them out into the community and say &ldquo;you will be all right&rdquo;.  These people are ending up in prison or in hostels.  They are being neglected and isolated and are a serious problem for our community. We cannot do this and &mdash; if I may say so &mdash; we have been callous and totally without care and consideration for these people.  We have to set timetables and targets and say we will achieve them over a period.  At the same time, we have to bring the public with us on this.  They are the problems that have arisen and I say we should look again and should not continue with this approach because it will do untold harm.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the serious economic and ethical problems that arise from the major breakthroughs.  The question <Col N="747" /> we have got to ask now is: can we afford these costly procedures?  Are we willing to permit funds to be diverted from other areas in the health services, such as the geriatric and psychiatric areas, to fund those sophisticated operations?  Should we deprive the old people of the medical care they require so that a young person can have a liver or heart transplant?  They are very serious ethical problems and no one has touched on them as yet.  Indeed, if Margaret Thatcher in Britain who is now confronted with a serious crisis in the health services was to initiate a public debate on this the public might appreciate her a lot more.</P>
    <P>One of us may find that we need a technical procedure that may cost £20,000 or £30,000 but will the public be prepared to pay for this?  Will the public be prepared to pay more for the health services?  Who is going to make the decision?  This is very important.  Will it be the doctor, the surgeon, the cardiac surgeon, the geriatrician or will it be left to an independent committee?  Are we going to neglect the old so that a young person can have a coronary by-pass operation? These problems will arise more and more because the amount for the health services is circumscribed and more people are going for cardiac operations &mdash; 300 a year in Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin.  Such operations are absorbing more and more of the health services finance, leaving less and less for our old and psychiatrically disturbed patients. They are the problems we face and we have got to answer them.</P>
    <P>The financial constraints in the health services may force us to deprive patients of their entitlement to these new lifesaving operations.  Are we saying that means and not need will be the determining factor?  Have we the right to deny senior citizens their right to basic medical care in the interests of new technological breakthroughs that will bring life and hope to younger people?  I hope those operations do not become the exclusive preserve of private health care.  I know the questions are varied and complex but we should not ignore them.  We have an <Col N="748" /> obligation to face up to the challenge posed by them.  The Department of Health have been singularly silent on this. There is a need for a public debate on the issues involved in this and the Minister for Health must initiate that debate.  I hope he rises to this challenge.</P>
    <P>We have at the moment a serious situation with more and more private medical institutions being set up.  It is worrying that the person of normal means may find himself or herself at the end of a very long queue while the person with the appropriate means can have attention very quickly.  This poses a very serious problem about the kind of society we are living in.  I do not know the answer.  I have had problems with it, wondering what is the best answer for our country. The rapid rise of these private institutions poses a problem for us and, with more and more of them coming into being, we may find that the services of our skilled medical personnel are absorbed in private care to the exclusion of public care. That is a serious problem.  We cannot allow such to happen.  I hope the medical profession will see the matter in this light and take steps to curtail the escalation of all these private medical institutions that are vying with each other in providing luxury care at very high cost.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte spoke about doctors and what they are earning.  That is a good question to raise.  The general practitioners in the medical card sector &mdash; the GMS &mdash; have a 35 per cent retention tax on their fees but this is posing very serious financial problems for them.  The fee they charge a patient covers the service and the expenses for practice.  It has been agreed, even by the Department, that half the fee goes by way of expenses &mdash; car expenses, clerical expenses and administrative costs, so taking 35 per cent of the whole fee has produced serious financial problems for the general practitioners. I cannot agree with Senator Harte that they are benefiting to any great extent.  As a matter of fact they are a hardship case at the moment.  I could not say the same for their consultant colleagues.</P>
    <P>I hope that some kind of agreement <Col N="749" /> can be reached whereby the public perception of the medical profession paying their tax will be achieved.  Nothing gives rise to more public annoyance and cynicism than when there are certain groups who appear to be not paying their tax. The medical profession have been a little remiss on this in not explaining that the consultants have a contract that they give 33 hours per week and are paid for that by the State but that the tax is deducted at source.  This is not explained to the public who, understandably when not aware of this, start saying these people are making fortunes and will not pay tax. It should be explained and the organisation themselves should perhaps take more time and trouble in enlightening the public on this.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the time of this House on unnecessary things.  Areas of the health service should be looked at so that we can know where we stand.  The service is absorbing more and more of the gross national product so there is a problem.  I do not envy the Minister his task in this coming year.  He has incurred the wrath of so many and it is difficult to please so many vested interests.  I often think that some of the people who are, as it were, dislocated as a result of the measures taken, are more concerned with their own jobs than with the care of the patients.  The health service is now a burgeoning industry employing 66,000 people.  Of course dislocation of a service like that causes massive unemployment and, understandably, the Government would be concerned about it, but the Minister having to face the wrath of these people is something you would not wish on anyone.  He has had a very traumatic time in trying as a doctor to show the concern &mdash; and he above all is caring and has a sense of concern for patients &mdash; knowing the radical measures he had to take were contrary to his own principles as a doctor.  The Government might look again at the situation and perhaps try to phase in the economies we want to bring about in the health service.  It would be in the better interest of the public and the public would be more tolerant and <Col N="750" /> understanding if they knew it was that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was elected on the Agricultural Panel and speak on agriculture for my party in the House here.  I will generally confine what I have to say to agriculture, to its performance in the past year and to the way the Government relates to agriculture in this role.  We might also try to project into the future.</P>
      <P>I will start by quoting from the Official Report of 18 December 1987, column 355.  On that evening the debate on the Appropriation Act, 1987, took place. The Minister was here in the House.  He said in relation to the agri-industry, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Agriculture is also likely to show a real improvement in 1987.  After two difficult years, we expect to see a strong recovery in farm incomes due to a number of factors.  Output prices are likely to be much better than in 1986. The volume of farm inputs has fallen because of better weather.  Input prices have also fallen.  The recovery in farm incomes this year should be substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an overall tone of optimism in what the Minister had to say but I do not know on what he bases that optimism because we know from official figures from the institute that the output in agriculture &mdash; that is overall commodities &mdash; was down by 1 per cent in 1987.  It will fall by 2 per cent &mdash; twice that amount &mdash; in 1988.  That is what we had in the past and that is what is projected and I am sure it will be accurate because this is a scientific examination taking account of all the factors involved.  The finding for the year gone is based purely on facts. Yes, there were increases in cereal production and in sugar beet production, but they were weather related.  The Minister did not say to us on 18 December when he addressed this House that cattle numbers were down by 5 per cent in 1987.  He did not tell us that milk production went down by 1½ per cent in 1987.  He had nothing to say about the fact that pig numbers went down by a further 1 per <Col N="751" /> cent in 1987 and that the rate of decline in breeding and dairy cow numbers in 1987 was between 3 and 4 per cent, possibly closer to 4 per cent than 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Yes, sheep numbers went up by 8 per cent but that was related to a favourable market for sheepmeat.  The upward curve in the sheepmeat area arises largely from the farsighted policy of the Coalition Government of putting in place policies to encourage this sector to expand and to take advantage of the growing sheepmeat market in Europe.  This growing consumer demand is against a background of falling sheep numbers Community wide. These and these alone are the reasons for the relative prosperity of this sector and it has absolutely nothing to do with anything the Government might or might not have done in terms of agricultural policy in 1987.</P>
    <P>What have the Government, or more appropriately the Minister for Agriculture, done in the last year to arrest the decline in the national cattle herd?  The national cattle herd is the greatest single sector left to us.  That is absolutely pivotal and all-important.  If we take 1986 as a base year, at present trends in the cattle sector, cattle numbers will have fallen by 15 per cent in 1989.  Beef breeding cow numbers will be reduced by a staggering 180,000 animals by 1991.  That is all part of that combined decline of 3 per cent or possibly 4 per cent in total cow numbers last year.  I do not think anybody has worked out the percentage decline for 1988, but obviously we are set for a major decline.  Think about what this overall staggering figure is doing to the national cattle herd.</P>
    <P>There was some kind of feeble attempt by the Minister to establish a new breeding cow expansion scheme in the autumn. It involved some kind of alliance of the banks, the farmers through their organisations, the co-operatives and the meat industry.  Lastly and it would seem least of all, the Minister and the Department were involved.  From the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; this scheme floundered around like a drunken sailor and the various bodies involved could not agree as to how to proceed or <Col N="752" /> who was going to do the financing, and nobody, least of all the Minister, was willing to give any direction.  The whole setup is moribund and going nowhere. This was in 1987 the response of the Government to this most critical question with all its consequences for the farmers' income and the income and the employment of the people who are in the food related to agriculture industry.  Remember we have a higher proportion of our total workforce engaged in that industry than any of our partners.</P>
    <P>We are not alone talking about those two interests, we are also talking about the much greater interest of the wider economy because all of that is inextricably bound up here.  My opinion, and that of most observers is that the Minister and the Government get not just zero but minus marks for their performance in this area of the beef herd expansion.  I have elaborated on and one could repeat how central and pivotal the beef herd is to the whole agricultural industry and to the whole national economy because it has to become the largest single sector within agriculture.</P>
    <P>We might turn to the dairy industry in 1987 and look forward to 1988 and beyond.  During last year dairy farmers' incomes taken globally within the boundaries of the State increased but this was purely and simply because we had a normal summer in 1987.  Then there was the fall in the value of the dollar which meant cheaper imports like fertilisers and which brought down peat costs.  The cost of things like maize and soya beans went down by 20 per cent because they are dollar-related commodities.  The disastrous summers of 1985 and 1986 were two of the worst ever recorded and in these years milk production, because of the weather, fell dramatically.  The increase we are talking about for last year, 1987, is in comparison with those years.  This is why the dairy sector income rose significantly in 1987.  It is a significant increase by comparison with two of the worst years on record, and it is quite dishonest to link it to anything the Government did last year.</P>
    <P>However the crisis in dairying looms <Col N="753" /> larger than ever in 1988 because of the continuing quota restrictions.  I do not know if most people recognise that at this moment, a few weeks into a new quota year, we are about 1½ per cent over quota. If you project it to the production surge that always happens between February and April we could find ourselves in excess of quota by 12 per cent in what one would call a surge production period. Leaving that aside, there is now little doubt among those who have studied the market, the people who are well informed among the farming community or within the industry itself, that nationally we will exceed our quota by 5 per cent in the calendar year 1988.  This is quite unprecedented and has no parallel with any past experience.  What have the Government or the Minister done to cushion the impact of this major blow in the future on the incomes of the dairy farmers and especially small dairy farmers? The answer, I regret to say, comes in a single work, &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On bovine TB eradication, what has happened in the last year?  Nothing, except that the Minister increased the disease levies on farmers and now the farmers pay by these levies two thirds of the total cost of the national disease eradication programme.  I have said that before, and it is important that one repeats it often because there is a widespread perception among the people that our disease eradication programme is purely and simply borne by the taxpayers. It is not.  Two thirds of it is borne by the farmers and one third by the taxpayers. That is not to make any argument that we should not be careful and mindful and see that financial resource as precious and spend it wisely.  It is important that the facts about it are clearly set out.</P>
    <P>The disease levies on farmers at the various take-up points amount to £20 million approximately and the total expenditure is £30 million.  That is two tens and one ten.  The spending of £30 million notwithstanding, we will find when the figures are published that in 1987 we went backwards and not forward in eradicating tuberculosis in the national bovine herd.  Much is made, rightly so, of <Col N="754" /> the £1,000 million which has been spent since the inception of the scheme.  I agree that most of it has been taxpayers' money because we are talking about the past and the idea of levies is relatively new.  There is still no sign that we have come anywhere close to complete eradication or reaching an acceptable level of completeness in this area, because you never get complete eradication of the disease despite all this expenditure.  Most people rightly see it as costly and many as somewhat scandalous.</P>
    <P>What of the future in terms of disease eradication?  My party earlier this year produced a policy document on clearing the national herd of bovine TB.  It proposed a radical approach.  It was practical and had and has wide support among farmers.  We sent a copy of our policy to the Minister and invited him to adopt it and add to it if he so wished, and if he wished to make certain adjustments by taking from it we would not have minded either as long as he adopted a new approach.  Did the Minister react?  No, he did not.  He hardly bothered to acknowledge receipt of the document and, of course, he proposed no new policies or departures, being content it seems to let the present scheme run its wasteful merry way.  Let the Minister and the Government be warned that the farmers who pay two thirds of the cost and the general taxpayers who pay one third of the cost will not continue to tolerate this ducking of a clear responsibility to do something about what has become something of a public scandal.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the pig industry went through a rough time in 1987.  It declined in output by at least 1 per cent and is set fair to continue that decline in 1988 and beyond if something is not done about it.  What has the Minister done to stem that decline during his first year in office?  Alas and again, nothing.  He has made all kinds of grandiose wool gathering announcements about new processing plants all over the country.  We have heard about new market drives and new drives into expanded process lines. When the huffing, the puffing, the bluffing and the bluster was all over, there <Col N="755" /> was no action and the industry continues its downward spiral.  Research, development and education in agriculture in 1987 was, and in 1988 will be, if I may borrow half a line from Dickens, &ldquo;the worst of times&rdquo;.  Charges for ACOT services were set up earlier in the summer but the worst sabotage came with the announcement on the amalgamation of ACOT and the Agricultural Institute of a 43 per cent cut in the combined budget of these organisations. The practical effect of this proposal was to make 1,000 people redundant.  This constitutes 50 per cent of the total staff of ACOT and of An Foras Talúntais.  There are approximately 1,100 people working in An Foras Talúntais and about 1,000 people in ACOT.  If the Minister is to achieve his targets, as set out in the Book of Estimates for 1988, he would need to make 50 per cent of that total workforce redundant in the coming year.  That is more than any other Government agency had to take on board &mdash; this was mentioned on a debate on this point before.  There has hardly been any decrease at all in the staff numbers in Agriculture House.  I do not wish to be critical of them.  I have my own criticisms of the Civil Service.  I am a former civil servant and I have a good inside knowledge on how it operates and so on, but it is unacceptable that the arm of the Department of Agriculture that is most relevant, most germane and most helpful to farmers and to the industry is the arm that has to take the greatest cut of all.  The administrative side &mdash; which I know has its own role as back-up to agriculture but which is certainly not as meaningful and germane &mdash; has taken a staff drop of 2 per cent or less which is almost meaningless and which ordinary natural wastage would have taken care of in any event.</P>
    <P>Taking 1,000 people out of the research, development and educational services to agriculture constitutes a madness of Gothic proportions.  Ireland, excepting Greece, has the highest dependence on agriculture for wealth creation in the EC and we have twice the number of people employed in farming compared <Col N="756" /> with the EC average.  Agriculture contributes 46 per cent. of net exports when raw material inputs are taken into account.  I could go on quoting statistics, figures and facts which back up the argument of the pivotal role of agriculture and agri-related industries in the Irish economy.  No country in the Community should be spending more on research and education than we should because of the facts I have mentioned and because of our pivotal need to be abreast of technical, scientific, market and financial changes in agriculture.  We must keep our performance and product quality on a par with our competitors.  In recent years we have spent much less on research and education per person employed on the land and per farm unit than most of our Community competitors but in this singular piece of madness the Government propose to almost have again the inadequate amount we spend.  Any observer looking in from the outside would think that the Minister for Agriculture has taken leave of his senses in this attempt to destroy the most vital support service to our most important wealth creating industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the disgraceful performance of the Government in relation to extensions of the severely handicapped areas under the EC Directive 268/75.  We call it the reclassification question.  I am delighted that the Minister of State is with us because his constituency of east Galway is very much affected by this.</P>
    <P>In the months prior to leaving office Deputy Austin Deasy, the Coalition Minister for Agriculture, lodged with the Commission an application for an extensive extension of this scheme.  We knew at the time of application that the areas applied for met all the criteria in terms of relative economic disadvantage and that, so far as the Commission was concerned, granting the extension was only a matter of form as long as we paid the national share of grants amounting to 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil response to this initiative by Deputy Deasy was to go around the country during the general election <Col N="757" /> campaign of last January and February saying that Fianna Fáil, if returned to office, would fully implement a policy of extended areas.  This chorus was led by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on agriculture, Deputy Michael Noonan, who is now Minister for Defence.  In my constituency of Roscommon they even went one better.  Both candidates went around shouting that not alone would the 40 per cent of farmers in our county who were excluded from the scheme &mdash; and who are still excluded from the scheme &mdash; would be included but that on top of that there would be a further 100 per cent increase in the value of cattle headage grant paid to all farmers in the constituency should the better way triumph. The better way won but it did not win triumphantly and what did we get?  The incoming Government welshed on the promises of expanded reclassification in 1987.  What was worse, the Government failed to take up the negotiations for expansion in 1988 and, even much worse still, we now find in the Book of Estimates, under the Estimates for agriculture, a proposed reduction of 8 per cent in expenditure for farmers in disadvantaged areas.  I am sorry the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture are not here, but I hope the Minister of State who is acting for them will let us know what is involved in this reduction.  Is this betrayal of the promise to disadvantaged areas to be further compounded by a reduction in the level of assistance given to farmers who are lucky enough to be classified?  That is an important question and, if possible, I want it answered here and now.</P>
    <P>My party see the agri-food industry as having a central and pervasive role in the national economy.  We see it as pivotal to our ability to generate sufficient wealth to provide an acceptable standard of living for the whole population.  Agriculture is to us what oil is to Venezuela and what copper is to Zambia.  It is central to our economic survival.  Agriculture has a major social role in Ireland, aside from the role of enhancing the gross national product, and this must be preserved also.  The Taoiseach said that the <Col N="758" /> agri-food industry will and must play the leading role in his Government's policy document &mdash; the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  He could have fooled me and many more like me when we see the stand-up policy he and his Ministers adopted in relation to every problem that arose in the industry in 1987 and the stand-up policy they appear to have in relation to every problem that will face the industry next year, the year after and the year after.</P>
    <P>We go into 1988 with great trepidation. We feel, farmers feel and the agricultural spokespersons for this party feel that the best we can hope for is favourable weather. All the other omens are unfavourable. There will be a 2 per cent drop in the value of all commodities generated in the agricultural field in Ireland in 1988. At EC level, on which we have an absolutely crucial dependence for our prosperity and for our markets, etc., there are all kinds of changes taking place which will be adverse to us.  People who are pure economists would say there is a madness about producing products for which there is no longer a market and I would have to go along with some of that. We are a member of the EC and, on entry, it was part of our bargain to allow freedom of trade to release or open our markets to our partners in order that they could sell here.  We suffered a major loss because of this.  The industrial base which we had in the early seventies was almost wrecked because of this freedom of trade and because our history of protectionism went back to the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>As of right, we expect in return that we will be protected in any major adjustment in the Common Agricultural Policy in 1989 and beyond.  At present, the Commission is proposing removing thousands and thousands of acres of agricultural land from production.  That is going to have very major ramifications for this country.  Every farmer and everybody whose livelihood is in any way related to agriculture &mdash; and there are few people who do not have some indirect relationship for their livelihood to the agricultural industry &mdash; must ask how that policy will be applied here.  Will we apply <Col N="759" /> a policy of making mendicants out of the thousands of medium and small sized farmers?  We fear that the Government do not fully understand or comprehend everything that is involved in these major changes.  We have gone along with the cosy opinion that nothing has changed and that the halcyon days of the late sixties and most of the seventies are still with us.  They are not.  The political climate and the political opinion in Europe has changed utterly and that has major consequences for this country.</P>
    <P>We should warn the Minister that his performance must buck up, if I may use that phrase.  What we have seen in 1987 is not good enough.  In a sense it was a neutral year in terms of what is externally pertinent to agriculture.  That means that not a lot happened in terms of EC policy changes to affect us adversely but major changes are coming.  The political climate is changing every day and it is changing adversely in terms of where our interest lies.  I say to the Minister and to the Government that they must be more vigilant and more aware of this vital national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Traditionally the debate on the Appropriation Act in the Seanad is a wide-ranging one for the reason that, unlike the other House, we do not have a debate after the budget and, therefore, advantage is taken of this facility to cover different areas of concern. To a large extent, it is a facility which benefits the Opposition more than it does the party in Government because the party in Government have an opportunity of bringing up problems and matters of concern at parliamentary party meetings and having those problems dealt with in that way.  As has been exemplified by the contribution made by Senator Connor, the Opposition have this opportunity to deal specifically with areas of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my contributions I have tried to be fair and objective and I do not want to start off in any other way now.  In relation to the Coalition Government, we had a period of great stringency at the end of <Col N="760" /> their period in office and they doubled the national debt from £12.5 billion to £25 billion.  I could spend a long time going into details on that matter alone.</P>
    <P>That enormous debt was inherited by this Government.  Looking back on their year in office, every member of the Government should feel proud of the marvellous achievements they have made in all areas.  First, the financial targets were achieved and this has given great confidence to everybody.  I have discussed the Government's performance with people on social welfare, with employers and those who are financially secure and while there has been criticism everyone, without exception, paid tribute to the Government and to their achievements because undoubtedly they are on the right track.</P>
    <P>During the past year the media has to a large extent concentrated on the cutbacks, on financial rectitude and balancing the books but other areas have been neglected to a considerable extent. The positive areas where the Government have achieved much, for example, in horticulture where they have established a new ministry in the food area, mariculture and the science and technology areas, are all significant and they should not be forgotten.  I could go into all these factors in detail and spend considerable time on them but, as I have said, I do not think this would be appropriate and that is not what the debate is intended for.</P>
    <P>The Government are rightly concerned about the vulnerable people who depend on social services, the aged and the infirm.  However, I have one grouse in relation to the free fuel scheme.  This is a good and necessary scheme.  I am sure all of us who are in public life have been approached by individuals who have been disappointed in one way or another.  My immediate concern is in relation to people who did not apply in time because, unfortunately, they miss out.  My understanding is that this is the first time application forms were not sent directly to people who qualified.  On all previous occasions, those who qualified or were expected to qualify received application <Col N="761" /> forms for completion.  Apparently, on this occasion a notice was simply published in the newspapers.  On previous occasions the notice was published additionally.</P>
    <P>Many people in this area cannot afford to buy papers and possibly because of age, poor eyesight or other reasons, may not be able to read the papers.  They were not aware that it was necessary to make application, to get the form and have it completed.  They missed out.  They will only be paid from the time they made application.  Quite a few people are affected.  It seems rather harsh that people who would qualify are debarred simply because they did not apply in time. If somebody qualifies for this scheme, even if he applied after a particular period, he should get this payment.  I hope that in future schemes this will be looked into because it is unfair to penalise people, particularly when it is not their fault.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the roads.  In this area there is much to be done.  I am pleased to note that considerable development will take place in road work in the immediate future.  In County Meath there is cause for concern.  At one stage, the roads in County Meath were the best in Ireland.  The situation today is far from that.  On many occasions in this House I have mentioned the main road from Clonee to Dublin.  It is over three miles of a very narrow road and most of it does not even have a grass margin.  This morning when I was coming up from Clonee to Blanchardstown I was in a traffic hold up because of a very slow tractor with a very wide trailer.  This is quite common here.  It is extraordinary that the main road from the northern part of Donegal right through Cavan into Meath, Kells and Navan is a first class main road, and then when we come to the entrance to our capital city we have a narrow inferior road.  If planning were properly carried out, that should have been the first road to have been developed.  I understood that development was to take place last year.  Hopefully, it will take place this year.  I raise <Col N="762" /> this once again in the hope that something will be done very soon.</P>
    <P>On a more general point, our roads are most important from the point of view of development.  Transport costs are higher here than they are in any other country in Europe due to delays and to several other factors caused by our roads.  It is strange that over the past number of years the value and importance of a proper network of main roads were not taken into consideration.  There is a necessity to develop our county roads but not to the same extent as our main roads. I recall a recent occasion when Senator Kiely referred to county roads in Kerry where he hoped that development would not damage the environment any further. That was a very important point.  While main roads may be intended primarily for speed and heavy traffic &mdash; indeed the standards of our main roads are determined by the speed aspect &mdash; this is not as important on county roads.  To make them safe for travelling rather than speeding is more important.</P>
    <P>Tourism also is very important.  The roads play a big part with regard to tourism. I was very pleased to read recently that the Taoiseach promised that anyone who had a worthwhile suggestion would be welcomed and that every suggestion would be taken on board and considered. This is important in a country that depends so much on tourism.  In the debate on the Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill I mentioned this aspect and that further development with regard to fisheries would pay handsome dividends. In every part of this country we have streams and lakes, large and small, whose potential has not been developed to the extent possible.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned on other occasions that it was easy for me in Kells to determine during the summer whether or not we had a successful tourist season simply by going out in the mornings and taking note of the number of cars passing by with boats and fishing equipment on the roof.  In north Meath and throughout Cavan there are small lakes which are noted for their fishing potential.  It is <Col N="763" /> important to understand the value of coarse fishing.  I made the case on other occasions with regard to coarse fishing that, whereas one pound of salmon may be bought for perhaps £2 or £3, a pike might be worth £1,000 to the nation through tourism.  Tourists interested in fishing come here.  The weather is not all that important.  Of course, they like to come in good weather, but primarily they come to enjoy the fishing.  We have the lakes and rivers which could be stocked properly.  I know there is a problem. Growing up in a rural area, I noted that there were problems with regard to poaching in our rivers and small lakes. Some individuals felt that the fish in those rivers were there for them alone, and by poaching the rivers they deprived people of many hours, days and weeks of enjoyment. Great tribute is due to our fishery inspectors, but there is a limit to what they can do.  It is necessary to educate the people to bring home to them the value of fishing.  If people realise the importance of fishing, the poacher will be ostracised.  This is the only way we will overcome that problem.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas where tourism could be helped.  It is unfortunate, for example, that there are no grants for guest houses and hotels.  Possibly this will come later.  They, and indeed Bord Fáilte, have played a very big part in tourism.  I compliment Bord Fáilte and all the officers there for the great work they have done.  There are many aspects of tourism which can be expanded and improved.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to agriculture. I too am concerned about farmers. I noted on other occasions, that the Government had determined their policy with regard to the payment of tax by farmers.  I have no doubt that the Government decision was the proper one, because people should pay tax in relation to their income.  Nevertheless, a very good case could be made for the farm tax &mdash; the £10 per adjusted acre. For a start, the farmer did not have to employ an accountant.  The amount was reasonable.  The adjustment procedure <Col N="764" /> seemed to me to be fair.  I am sure some provision could have been made with regard to farmers who were sick or had problems of that kind.  In relation to payment of £10, anybody who could not afford to pay that much per adjusted acre, should not be in farming.  When this matter was discussed initially, I was one of a number of representatives &mdash; and I think that every representative was contacted by the farming organisation &mdash; who was lobbied to go against the tax.  It has more or less transpired since, that it was the large farmer who was opposed to this tax.  Unfortunately, the small farmer at that time did not make his voice heard.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that not everybody who owns land is a farmer. Simply being the proprietor of a large tract of land, does not convert one to being a farmer.  Land, in some cases, is intended as collateral or for prestigious purposes or whatever.  The large farmer can now employ an accountant to reduce his profits so that he does not have to pay very heavy taxes.  I just mention in passing, that the farmers at a particular time got an opportunity; they did not grasp it and now a decision has been made and I agree with the decision.  I am simply expressing my feelings with regard to that proposal.</P>
    <P>In the area of housing, unfortunately things are not as good as we hoped.  New house grants of £2,000 are still payable. There is a problem in relation to people who build their own homes.  It is unfortunate that this is not sorted out to the advantage of families where, for example, there are one or two tradesmen. One of the conditions of the new house grant is that the house must be built by a contractor registered for VAT. Where the house is built on the applicant's own site under a contract to build, which is termed self-build, or building by direct labour, the VAT-registered work undertaken by the registered contractors must not be less than £15,000.  More than one registered contractor can contribute to make up that £15,000; nevertheless, it is an inhibiting factor in many cases.  It is unfortunate that we do not have some kind of system for collection of VAT <Col N="765" /> where people are able and prepared to build their own houses.  I appreciate that it is precisely in relation to the problem of payment of VAT that this condition has been imposed.  It is unfortunate that some simpler system could not be devised.  I am sure the Minister can come up with some system which will help in this area.</P>
    <P>People living in secondhand houses needing repairs do not get a reconstruction grant.  If this continues over a long period the housing stock will deteriorate.  Perhaps we can expect a change in this regard in the not-too-distant future.</P>
    <P>I am glad that disabled persons' grants have been retained.  They are very important, and more so now, because the reconstruction grant for new applicants has been abolished.  The disabled person's grant is available up to a maximum of £5,000 or two-thirds of the estimated cost.  This is of considerable benefit. There has not been a reduction in the funding for this grant and I pay tribute to the Minister for that.  There are a few problems with regard to this grant which should be looked at.  One relates to planning permission.  I brought it up on other occasions.  In rural areas where an extension includes a septic tank, it is necessary to apply for planning permission.  Planning permission for an elderly individual who is not familiar with the regulations, can be rather difficult and to some extent, costly.  I appeal to the Minister to make provision so that payment to a professional person with regard to obtaining planning permission would be allowed in the £5,000 grant.  In other words, I ask the Minister to consider that in calculating the amount of grant payable to any individual allowance would be made for the cost of obtaining planning permission, or else have the situation, as I understand it applies in County Dublin, where the local authority provide the plans.  Possibly this would be the better solution.  In general, it would not cost the local authority very much.  The biggest cost for any individual with that problem would be obtaining a 25 inch ordnance survey sheet which costs around £33 and <Col N="766" /> the local authority would have all the 25 inch sheets of the county.  Even if it were a problem to provide money for this area, if a local authority made provision to supply the appropriate section of the 25 inch ordnance survey sheet that, in itself, would be a help to applicants.</P>
    <P>Small businesses have their problems. We have discussed this subject and the joint committee have considered many aspects of small businesses.  Every help that can be given should be given to small businesses because the general feeling nowadays is that the small business can be the foundation for success.  Whereas in the past large profits were associated with big business and big concerns and a large number of employees, it is generally agreed now that small business can have quite reasonable profits.  The overheads are reduced and there is so much to commend the small business.</P>
    <P>Forestry is another area that many people are concerned about.  More can be done in this way.  We have plenty of suitable land.  At present, the EC is considering making payments to farmers not to cultivate or use their land in the normal way.  It is a rather extraordinary situation and I suppose it will bring about some considerable change in land policy in the immediate future.  All that could be taken into consideration with regard to our forestry development.  I think we are doing reasonably well.  I note the State attempted to sell off some of its forests recently but apparently the amount of money on offer was not sufficient to induce the State to sell.  There are problems in that area, particularly with regard to fire hazards.  A forest which takes so long to develop can be destroyed in a very short space of time. Perhaps that is why some concerns are not too anxious to invest so much money in forestry.  By taking reasonable precautions, such as divisions between areas of forestry, this would take care of that problem to some extent.</P>
    <P>It has been proved that the timber produced in this country can compare favourably with the timber from any other country, and is, if it gets what people would regard as a fair chance.  In <Col N="767" /> the past, the problem with our native timber was that in many instances it was cut down one day and used in the roof of a house or in some other way a few days afterwards.  Of course, that is not the proper way to deal with timber.  It must be harvested properly, like in any other item.</P>
    <P>Coming from County Meath, I feel I must make a plea with regard to the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.  Baile Gib is close to Kells in County Meath and we also have Ráth Cairn where Irish is the spoken language of the people, a living language.  Unfortunately, I feel that the Irish language is doomed as a spoken language.  We made many mistakes in the past.  I have always felt that originally there was not enough money provided to encourage people in the Gaeltacht areas to remain there and to have a decent way of life there.  Many of them were ripped out of that culture and that environment.  To that extent, the Irish language and the Irish culture suffered.</P>
    <P>At this late stage some great effort should be made so that we would have a situation where most of the people would be bilingual.  That is most we can hope for at this stage.  Coming from a county that is proud of Baile Gib and of Ráth Cairn, I make that plea with regard to the Irish language.  In passing, I want to pay tribute to the urban renewal programme and hope we will have further developments in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have noticed recently that our exports in particular areas have expanded and I was particularly concerned about one of these, that was stone that was dressed and transported abroad for use on buildings. We have a tradition here which could very well be extended and enlarged.  We have other areas of craft and craftsmanship, in timber and in many other areas, that could be expanded.  Perhaps it would be worthwhile looking at them.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong if I did not refer to the unemployment problem and hope that we would see improvement in this regard.  We are all familiar with the exodus from this country.  In Kells nearly <Col N="768" /> every second family has someone who has emigrated.  There are quite a few who have sons and daughters staying illegally in America and they are very concerned. I hope that some progress will be made in this regard.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to the Ombudsman.  I would also like to pay tribute to him and hope he will be able to continue to do the important work that has been done over the years.  On one occasion I had reason to contact the Ombudsman about a particular individual who was aggrieved.  I must say that I was very impressed by the way in which the matter was dealt and that in the end full justice was done, due to the efforts of the Ombudsman.  I would like to pay tribute to the work he had done.  I am sure that very many people have reason to be grateful to the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I do believe that this debate is more suited to members of the Opposition parties. It affords them an opportunity to make criticisms of Government policy and they have availed of that here today. I simply want to say again that the past year is one of which the Government may very well and very justifiably be proud.  I look forward to a more successful year ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this Appropriation Act, 1987.  It gives us the opportunity to look back at the year that has gone and at where we are going in the year ahead.  I acknowledge what Senator Fitzsimons has said, that it gives us in Opposition the opportunity of being critical of Government policy more so maybe than, what he would like to say himself. But we are not being critical for the sake of being critical.  If there are areas of Government policy that we are not happy with, it is our duty as spokespeople in Opposition to address that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make an opening remark about the Minister for Finance's opening address on Second Stage of the Bill.  He outlined the progress that was being made in the country, with inflation at its lowest for two decades, the balance of payments deficit down below 2 per <Col N="769" /> cent of GNP, interest rates falling substantially, etc.  He was attributing all this to Fianna Fáil Government policy but he failed to mention that the previous Coalition Government's policies over four and half years were the real reason that we have this favourable situation today.  I would also like to remind him that when the Coalition Government took office five years ago inflation was heading to the mid-twenties, interest rates were out of control and it was against that background that the Coalition governed for four and a half years, bringing the country around to the present low inflation and low interest rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the progress that was made in alleviating the unemployment situation.  He said:</P>
    <P>In the 12 months to be end of April last, the live register rose by 18,400, but in the 12 months to the end of November the increase was only 3,800. A further improvement in this trend is expected by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Well, as we know, he did not get this improvement and the unemployment figures now stand at over 250,000.  This figure would, of course, be much greater but for the high level of emigration which is taking place.  All during the year I come through Molesworth Street on my way to Leinster House and I saw the huge queues of people waiting to get their passports. All of this under a Government which made an election issue out of unemployment and had large billboards in the major towns all over the country showing the passport and telling the people, <i>There is a Better Way.</i>  There was a better way but the people did not take it and are now once again finding that out to their cost.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the construction industry.  This has been decimated under the present Government.  Fianna Fáil had, prior to the election, stated that the industry would make a significant contribution to economic growth and employment.  The industry currently depends on the public capital programme for 70 per cent of its finance.  The cut of <Col N="770" /> 3 per cent represented a drop in funding of approximately £50 million in 1987. This reduction, in addition to the abolition of the £2,250 house purchase grant, the home improvement grant scheme, the £5,000 grant for local authority tenants and the reduction in the level of mortgage interest relief to 90 per cent led to a further sharp decline in activity and employment throughout the industry.</P>
    <P>In relation to housing grants, Fianna Fáil stated that prior to the election the Government's policy document on the industry had suggested that all grants be revised with the aim of improving their impact and benefit to the industry.  The abolition of the £2,250 and the £5,000 grants without a full compensating reduction in VAT was wholly unjustified and had a further negative impact on this sector in 1987.  It was also contrary to the clear implications of the manifesto.  In relation to the £5,000 grant for local authority tenants, this incentive had been very useful in stimulating local authorities to buy houses in the private sector and also in relieving demand for local authority housing.  It had become an important source of demand for new housing and for the home improvement grant scheme. This scheme provided a considerable amount of work for contractors and subcontractors and was supplemented by the additional contribution from the householder. It was also valuable as it was confined to registered firms within the industry.  That, of course, was to deprive the black economy.  In addition, it provided badly needed employment, with a consequent saving in unemployment benefit and tax revenue.  While it was obvious that in view of the State finances there would have to be cuts in various sectors, the measures referred to are ill-advised, negative and, in effect, will increase unemployment in the industry, currently standing at 47,000 people.</P>
    <P>As somebody who is involved in the construction industry and as a member of the CIF, I know that building in this country is dead at present and that there is no future here for the construction industry.  It had always been said in the past that under Coalition Governments <Col N="771" /> the construction industry suffered.  That myth has now been well and truly exploded.  It is clear to be seen that the construction industry advanced significantly under the last Government but has now been stymied by the present Fianna Fáil administration.  I would like to quote a brief pre-budget submission from the Irish Housebuilders' Association. It will give a background to the present situation of housing in the country. It states:</P>
    <P>Housing activity has declined dramatically since the start of the current decade.  The number of public and private sector housing completions is estimated to be approximately 17,000 units this year which represents a decline of 38 per cent since 1981.</P>
    <P>Private sector housing completions could be under 15,000 for 1987 which represents a 44 per cent decline in the level of completions since 1981.</P>
    <P>An appropriate measure of future private housing sector activity is represented by the registrations by the National House Building Guarantee Company.  At its peak, the Company registered 10,830 units in 1983.  The forecast for 1987 indicates that at best the Company will register 7,000 units which is a 36 per cent fall in housing starts as measured by the Company in three years!</P>
    <P>A further indication of trends in the private housing sector has been the decline in the proportion of mortgage advances directed at new housing.  In 1981, 50 per cent of loan approvals by various financial institutions and the State sector were in respect of new housing.  In 1986 this had fallen to 35 per cent and this trend has been continued in the first six months of 1987. New house loan approvals are approximately 10,000 per annum at present, compared to approximately 15,000 four years ago.  A further decline of 23 per cent in the public capital programme for 1988 will result in 12,000 job losses directly, with a further 4,000 to 6,000 job losses in the professional, <Col N="772" /> manufacturing and building provider sector.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn my attention to the tax situation.  I would start off by saying that tax reform is vital and possibly was one of the disappointing aspects of the last Finance Bill as a minimum of £300 million extra was taken from the PAYE sector.  When people talk about tax reform, they talk about reduction in tax. We must have a system which will lead to a reduction in tax if we are to maintain incentives to work and if we are to keep highly educated and skilled workers at home.</P>
    <P>The only way of reducing taxation is by cutting public expenditure.  The more a Government spend the more tax people will have to pay.  The present high levels of tax are a direct result of the gross over-expenditure of the late seventies.  We must reform the income tax system and widen the tax bands so that the vast majority of people pay tax at standard rate.  An immediate move towards self assessment together with reform of company taxation and a spread of the tax base will give leeway over the next few years for reductions in income tax and a broadening of the existing tax base.</P>
    <P>The decision of Fianna Fáil to abolish the land tax is to be deplored.  This land tax was perceived to be fair by the majority of farmers and by the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan in his address to the Seanad on the Bill made reference to the strictness of the Revenue Commissioners. His opinion was that they were too strict and had too much power. I agree with the Senator on that.  I agree also that the rates of interest they charge on outstanding accounts at 1.25 per cent a month is too punitive.  If it is the case that the Revenue Commissioners are carrying out strictly the letter of the law, perhaps we have a duty to have another look at the legislation.  I have found the Revenue Commissioners in my dealing with them to be totally inflexible and not to allow any room whatever for negotiation. I am not saying that I am in favour under any circumstances of tax evasion <Col N="773" /> but I do believe that when problems arise in small companies &mdash; as they invariably do &mdash; there should be some degree of leeway for negotiation with the Revenue Commissioners.  This has proved not to be the case.</P>
    <P>I am sure that many of us here today saw the recent &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on television in relation to sheriffs and tax collectors.  The counties concentrated on were Meath and Westmeath and we saw the tragic circumstances which followed the exercise. We saw the way in which these officials went about their business.  I could not concur with the way in which they acted on behalf of the State in collecting taxes. It was a very bad programme from their point of view.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn very briefly to the subject of education.  There is panic and confusion running through the Fianna Fáil Government in relation to education. There have been comprehensive U-turns on nearly every statement made during the four years of bitter opposition in the Dáil, four years of promises and undertakings to teachers, students and parents.  On 8 April 1987, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, said that within the overall allocation of resources she proposed to give a particular priority to primary education.  I ask is the worsening of the pupil-teacher ratio a particular priority?  We now see a cut of £42 million in the allocation to the primary sector. Parents, teachers and managers all need to know how much damage is going to be done, how much real money is going to be saved and how many more children are going to be stuffed into our classrooms.</P>
    <P>Another major cut which demands an explanation is the £6.5 million cut in school transport.  This implies not only further increases on a massive scale in charges but also far-reaching changes in eligibility.  In plain language the parents and youngsters need to know if they will have a bus next year and, if so, how far will they have to walk to get to it and how much it will cost them.  There is great concern among parents and pupils alike that when the small print is finally read many pupils now going to school by bus <Col N="774" /> will be walking there instead.  It is my belief that education has taken a sudden and massive blow under this Government. This is all the more despicable because of the guarantees given to the education world by the Taoiseach two days before the general election.  He described Fine Gael's minor cuts as devastating and said that it would be completely counter-productive to implement them.  On budget day, 31 March, Fianna Fáil's failure to understand the education sector was exposed when £11 million over and above the minor cuts we had proposed was taken out of the system.  We are talking of taking approximately £86 million out of the system in 1988.  I do not have to press the point any further as the facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>I will now make a brief comment in relation to the Department of Justice. The overall net Estimate for the Garda Síochána in 1988 is £273 million.  There will be cutbacks in overtime and there is disillusionment within the force, yet the Minister says that he is satisfied that the Estimates provided for the Garda Síochána for 1988 will enable all essential policing services to be fully met.  I have my doubts that this is going to be the case. The Association of Garda Inspectors and Sergeants also have their doubts.  I would like to quote from an article in the November 1987 edition of <i>Garda News</i> in relation to the situation they found themselves in because of the kidnapping and the cutbacks and how they affected their management.  I would also like to make a few recommendations on their behalf to the Minister.  The article reads:</P>
    <P>The debate which honed in on the defects in the management of An Garda Síochána was nothing new to AGSI members or to the many people who had been concerned about the development, or lack of it, in the Force for the past 50 years or more.  In fact, no less than 17 years ago in its concluding comments the Conroy Commission had this to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We would be failing in our duty to the Minister if we did not strongly urge that an examination be carried out by <Col N="775" /> appropriately qualified people into the role, organisation and personnel policy of the Force and, in particular, its relationship with the Department of Justice.  For example, (a) there was evidence of an unclear defintion of roles as between the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána. Specifically, there was a vagueness causing uncertainty and ineffectiveness about the relationship between the Department and the Commissioner. There seemed to us to be a lack of delegation from the Department to the Force.  This lack of delegation permeated the Force.  Authority &mdash; particularly in relation to financial resources &mdash; was not commensurate with responsibility, causing an unhealthy &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude.</P>
    <P>(b)  There was no comprehensive planning based on research.  No one was specifically charged with this function. The result was reaction to circumstances and <i>ad hoc</i> decision-making.</P>
    <P>(c)  There was no clear personnel policy.  We found it disturbing that, in a Force of this size, there was no one with specific responsibility for developing an on-going personnel policy, including training and retraining.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a tragic fact that those comments are as relevant today as the day they were written and it is supremely tragic that it took an incident such as the O'Grady kidnap to bring them to the forefront of public attention &mdash; such basic recommendations for the good of the Force should have been seized on and acted upon at once.  If they had been implemented perhaps there might have been a vastly different outcome to the earlier kidnap hunt incidents.</P>
    <P>What the kidnap incidents highlighted so cruelly was the utter lack of delegation of authority within the Force &mdash; a lack which was pinpointed clearly by the Conroy Commission but one which has now been exacerbated <Col N="776" /> by the shortsighted manner in which the financial cutbacks have been implemented, leaving local officers floundering about in the dark without a clue as to the resources they can deploy in an emergency situation and unable to mount the type of operations which are necessary in such instances.</P>
    <P>During the hunt local Garda management was left not knowing how far to go in conducting searches, mounting armed checkpoints and detailing manpower to take part in the investigations and chases with the end result that the Force as a whole was made to look inefficient and lacking in co-ordi-nation.</P>
    <P>In his Christmas message to the Garda Síochána published in the December 1987-January 1988 edition of <i>Garda News</i> the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I commend and congratulate the Garda Síochána for the excellent work in effecting the release of Mr. O'Grady.</P>
    <P>Of course, that is as it should be but those were not his comments half way through the search.  I suggest that he work in close co-operation with the Garda associations and iron out the many problems facing the force today.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn, very briefly, to Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Senator Fitzsimons is associated with a Gaeltacht area in Ráth Cairn.  I also come from a Gaeltacht area, the Múscraí Gaeltacht in Ballyvourney.  I would like to place on record my congratulations to Údarás na Gaeltachta for the good work they have been doing in the Gaeltachtaí with very limited resources.  We have heard of many cases in the past where Údarás have been criticised and, in my opinion, very unfairly.  We also hear of the failures of factories and projects that never got off the ground in those areas but we never hear of their successes.  It should be said loud and clear that from the very beginning Údarás were working at a disadvantage in that there is no comparison with trying to attract an industry to the SFADCo area of Limerick or, indeed, <Col N="777" /> to Cork or Dublin and trying to get an industry to survive in Glencolmkille in Donegal or, indeed, in any part of Connemara or south Kerry.  From the very beginning Údarás were working on projects which I would regard as being second best projects because the best projects deal with the IDA and with SFADCo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise; that was an awful mistake to make, especially in the Cathaoirleach's presence.  It has a good record attached to it and it is very suitably situated.  It makes a big difference to be situated close to a part or close to an airport as distinct from the picture I am trying to paint.  We should give more encouragement and finance to Údarás because they work in areas where we need to have industry and to prevent emigration.</P>
      <P>My own area would be considered as one of the second best Gaeltachtaí, location wise, being situated on the Cork-Killarney road.  It would come second to Ráth Cairn which is close to Dublin airport and Dublin port and has all the facilities available to it.  It would be fair to say that in my area we are as close as we can get to full employment, thanks to the many industries brought in by personnel from Údarás na Gaeltachta. However, at the moment we have one factory which is in difficulty and I know that the Minister for the Gaeltacht, who happens to be the Taoiseach, is aware of that.  He has taken an interest in that industry.  I hope the jobs will be safe, are kept in the Gaeltacht and not relocated elsewhere but the job should be cost effective with a good return for the funds of the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons said that in his opinion the Irish language is doomed. That was an overstatement of the present position of the Irish language because even in Dublin city a number of Gaelscoileanna are being established to revitalise the Irish language.  The same applies to Cork city and outskirts.  In the <Col N="778" /> city centre a number of scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha have been set up.</P>
    <P>There is an Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Irish language and members of it are trying to get Members of this House to speak Irish in the precints of the House.  A survey was carried out by the committee of each Member of the Oireachtas and out of a total of 226 Members only 80 replies were received. It is up to us as Oireachtas Members to give example to the people by making an effort to speak the Irish language, particularly in the precincts of the House.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of a Minister of State to deal with forestry.  It is a move in the right direction by the Government.  I welcome the decision to set up a new State-sponsored body.  It may be an avenue to help us get away from the huge surpluses of milk, grain and so on.  It will be a big job trying to educate the ordinary farmer that there is a profit margin to be obtained from forestry and that forestry is an alternative to the huge surpluses we have in the EC.</P>

      <P>Is aoibhinn liom bheith ar ais arís agus ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí go léir a ghlac páirt san díospóireacht thábhachtach seo.  Nochtadh a lán tuairimí i rith na díospóireachtá agus tá an-spéis agam féin agus ag an Aire Airgeadais sna tuairimí sin.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank Members for their co-operation in getting the Appropriation Bill through in the month of December.  I must also thank Senators for their contributions to this resumed debate yesterday and today.  They have in most cases, at least by implication, shown their approval of the appropriation accounts for 1987 and, therefore, of the Government's discharge of the obligation laid on them by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate a large number of specific comments were made about individual items and individual programmes of expenditure.  I do not propose to deal with all of them in detail; many of them would be more properly dealt with by <Col N="779" /> other Ministers more directly concerned. However, I would like to take up some of the many excellent points made during the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia, the first speaker from the Opposition side, urged that money be made available to refurbish the National Gallery, particularly its air conditioning system.  It has been apparent for some time that the environmental conditions in the National Gallery are unsatisfactory.  My Department, that is, the Office of Public Works, have prepared a major refurbishment scheme for the premises incorporating the installation of a modern air conditioning system.  It is envisaged that the scheme will be implemented in phases over a number of years.</P>
    <P>Planning for the first phase of the work, which will deal with the most serious problems at a cost of in the region of £5.5 million, is at a very advanced stage.  The placing of a contract to carry out these works will depend on the availability of resources within the Office of Public Works' building programme.  It is not possible at this stage to state when this will be, but I would be hopeful that something may be done over the next year and thus ensure the continued preservation of our valuable paintings and art treasures.  I want to assure the House that the Government are very concerned to maintain and preserve those valuable art treasures and paintings.</P>
    <P>A lot of comment has been made of late about the state of the National Gallery. I wonder why this information was not made available to the relevant Minister, or Department, much earlier to ensure that work could be carried out on this?  However, the Government, and I, will leave no stone unturned to see that action is taken as quickly as possible, given the financial constraints placed on the State at this time.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia also criticised the reduction in official development assistance and contrasted it with the allocation for the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Government regret very much that Ireland's economic circumstances should <Col N="780" /> have forced such a reduction on us.  We have been successful in building up a modest but worth-while programme of aid to developing countries in recent years.  I can assure the House that the Government remain committed to the maintenance and expansion of official development aid as soon as economic circumstances permit.  Meanwhile, in 1988 the funds available will be sufficient to maintain a basic programme of assistance from Ireland to developing countries. All commitments to existing projects will be honoured but it will not be possible to enter into new commitments.</P>
    <P>As regards the Department of Foreign Affairs, the 1988 allocation is based on a contraction in our overseas representation. Further economies will be effected in the administration of the Department by curtailing travel, reducing expenditure on official entertainment and our information services and limiting the allowances paid to Irish diplomats abroad.  The total number of staff will also be reduced following the general policy on Civil Service numbers thereby helping to reduce the State's public service pay bill which is absolutely enormous taking into account our population base, our financial base and the level of public service that our people enjoy.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia urged that State funds be provided to develop an archaeological find in Waterford.  The Senator referred to a paying of £10,000 by the Office of Public Works to Waterford Corporation in respect of archaeological excavations.  I was pleased to have sanctioned this during the last year.  The payment was made to allow work on archaeological investigations, which up to then had been funded by Waterford Corporation, to continue in that year.  I understand the excavations are continuing this year under funding from the Corporation's own budget.  I further understand that an application for assistance of the order of the figure mentioned by the Senator, which was close to £250,000, has been made to the Department of the Environment and is under active consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> The urban renewal programme is part of the Government's strategy in revitalising urban areas in our inner cities and larger towns.  It is an excellent scheme.  It helps to bring life back into these huge urban areas which are often filled with old buildings and much dereliction.  It is also part of the Government's efforts to create investment opportunities and job opportunities both in the construction industry during the programme of work in the various projects and thereafter in the new development on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>Senator Seán Haughey highlighted the need to stamp out social welfare abuse engaged in by a minority and to provide a more efficient delivery of services to the genuinely needy.  I can assure the Senator that these two objectives have been high on the Government's list of priorities since we came into office last year.  Some remarkable progress has been made on both fronts.</P>
    <P>In the 1987 budget the extension of the Jobsearch programme nationwide was announced.  The main purpose was to help the long term unemployed.  Many of these have now been put through Jobsearch courses to improve their job seeking skills and to give them new motivation to resume active job seeking after years on the dole and being unemployed.  In some instances it was even possible to direct the long term unemployed towards jobs in the private sector or to let them participate in schemes such as the social employment scheme.</P>
    <P>The detection of those on the live register who might not be genuinely unemployed was expected to be a useful bonus from the programme.  However the extent to which those interviewed or even just called for interview have chosen to sign off the live register has been rather surprising.  It would be fair to sum up the programme by saying that the bulk of those on the live register are genuinely unemployed but in some instances they had become discouraged and needed some outside agency to encourage and motivate them to resume active job seeking. Unfortunately, the programme has also confirmed a long standing suspicion <Col N="782" /> that there was a hard core of abusers on the live register.</P>
    <P>The Jobsearch programme has not been the only notable success achieved in the past year.  The published allocation for disability benefit in 1987 was £232 million.  The outturn was less than £220 million.  This was due to a variety of factors such as a lower intake of claims, the transfer of some recipients to invalidity pensions etc., but a significant contribution towards this saving was also made by the introduction of controls for the detection of cases of working and claiming disability benefits.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that it is now the policy of the Department of Social Welfare to prosecute such offenders and this has helped to reduce the incidence of such abuse.  Other improved controls are also beginning to accrue from the extensive computerisation in the Department of Social Welfare in recent years.</P>
    <P>On the question of improved services to which Senator Haughey referred, I can point to the introduction of one stop shops in several locations around the country where applicants can have all their welfare queries attended to under one roof.  Many local centres have been connected to visual display units via the Department of Social Welfare's information system which can give them on the spot replies to claimants' questions about their welfare entitlements and payments. Where possible, decision making is being devolved in the routine cases down to local employment exchange level.  This leads to being able to put claims into payment at an earlier stage and reducing, or even eliminating, the need for interim reliance on the supplementary welfare scheme.  I feel that some commentators outside the Department of Social Welfare have sought to look at all welfare initiatives from an antiabuse or fraud control perspective.  While this is a consideration in some instances, we are primarily concerned with giving those who rely on welfare a much quicker service, and where resources permit, in better surroundings.  The programme of upgrading facilities in public offices and employment exchanges is evidence of our <Col N="783" /> commitment in this regard.  Again in 1988 the allocation of extra resources to the Department of Social Welfare Vote is tantamount acknowledgement of the Government's commitment to looking after those less well off in the public sector.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald referred to a refusal by the Department of Forestry to sell timber to many small family firms. This is simply not so.  The Senator may be referring to a requirement introduced by Forestry some months ago that all persons or firms tendering for timber should produce tax clearance certificates. This ensured that persons or firms who did not pay their taxes would not have an advantage in bidding over those who did pay their taxes and discharged their liabilities and responsibilities to the State and to the Exchequer.  This move has proved successful and has been welcomed by the industry in general.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan criticised the reduced allocation for the Ombudsman's Office.  The Office of the Ombudsman was set up in 1984 with a staff of 14 people which had increased to 41 people by the end of 1986.  Even taking into account the importance of the Ombudsman's functions, this was a most exceptional development at a time when almost every other area in the Civil Service was being reduced in size.  In view of the ongoing need for severe financial restraints it was no longer possible to continue to exempt this office from the drive to contain the cost of the public service to the taxpayer and the relevant allocation was reduced accordingly.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also asked why Irish banks do not lend to the Government at lower rates given that the loans are entirely secure.  Banks hold relatively large amounts of Government paper. This constitutes the bulk of their lending to the State.  A high proportion of this Government paper is traded in the Stock Exchange and therefore the yield on it is determined by market forces.  The remainder is issued by way of tender and the yield on this is also determined by market forces.  In general, interest rates <Col N="784" /> in Ireland are influenced by international interest rates and the supply of and demand for money in this country.  The fact that Government paper is entirely secure is, of course, taken into account by the market in determining, the appropriate yield on Government securities. The Government actively manage their debt so as to minimise the cost of servicing it, but we must always remember that in a small open economy like ours international trading and money markets have a major influence on the interest rates being charged here taking into account the reaction of our own domestic markets and the supply and demand situation prevailing here at home.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte suggested that any money available because of the savings in 1987 should be used to relieve the burden on PAYE taxpayers.  The favourable 1987 outturn for the Exchequer finances and the effect of reducing the borrowing requirement did not increase the resources held by the Exchequer or allow for additional expenditure or tax reliefs in 1988.  Senator Harte also criticised the level of farmer taxation.  We in Government have ensured equitable treatment and assessment for all taxpayers right across the board.  Farmers, like the self employed, are being taxed on their incomes and assessed accordingly.  While comparisons are often very odious and may often give an imbalanced impression, it must be remembered that farmers by the very livelihood which they pursue are the biggest payers of indirect taxes in the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor in a wide-ranging address, particularly specialising in agriculture, referred to the major cuts in staffing in ACOT and An Foras Talúntais at a time when agricultural research is very relevant.  Legislation providing for the amalgamation of AFT and ACOT was recently introduced and will be treated as a priority in the next session. The amalgamation was decided upon because the public finances could not continue to provide funding of £35 million to the two bodies.  It was considered that <Col N="785" /> through amalgamating the bodies, certain administrative savings would be achieved. I am sure that many people in this House believed when both bodies were set up and, in particular, when ACOT was created, that it would have been much better to revamp the existing structure rather than create the new structure. In addition, further savings could be gained by concentrating valuable resources on the priority needs of agriculture. It is much simpler and cost effective to operate the essential research advisory and educational services to agriculture from a single effective organisation than from two separate bodies.  It is understood to date about 400 employees of the two organisations have decided to opt for the voluntary redundancy package.  The question of how best to achieve the level of savings implicit in the 1988 allocation of £20 million is under examination.  An efficiency audit of both organisations, as well as of the Department of Agriculture and Food, is under way and should be completed over the next two months or so.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor also referred to the reduced allocation in 1988 for headage payments to farmers in the disadvantaged areas.  There are a number of factors involved in the reduced allocation for headage payments in 1988 as compared with 1987.  The 1987 allocation contained provision for special payments as a result of the hurricane in August 1986, some of which were not made until 1987.  These amounted to close on £4 million.  Another factor is the reduction in the off-farm income limit from £6,400 to £5,200 which accounts for a reduction of £1 million. Senator Connor berated the Minister for Agriculture and Food on his performance. I have to say that we are fortunate at this time to have a man of the calibre of the Minister for Agriculture and Food in office.  He has held various ministries and also been European Commissioner and I do not think anybody with his experience has ever held this position before.  His ability as an international negotiator, particularly in the forum of the European Commission and on the Council of Ministers has been <Col N="786" /> proven decisively and conclusively to be to the advantage of Irish farmers during the past year.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor said &mdash; and it is a pity he is not in the House at this time &mdash; that cattle numbers were down and the breeding stock population had been reduced and he blamed the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Agriculture and Food for this.  The position is clear.  We came into Government in March last.  We inherited serious difficulties in the economy right across the board.  We found agriculture in serious difficulties: farmers' incomes had been reduced, and in many cases eroded, and many farmers were in a serious financial position.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food has tried to redress that situation. The reason the cattle population is down and the breeding numbers are down is that in many cases financial pressure was placed on farmers during the reign of the Coalition Government, during the previous five years, and they had no option but to dispose of their breeding stock in order to meet their financial commitments.  It now falls to this Government and to the Minister for Agriculture and Food to create an environment and give incentives to farmers so that they can again expand, develop and invest in further breeding stock and make their contribution to increasing the cattle herd and the breeding population.  We must ensure that the State sector, the private sector and the farmers themselves make their fair contribution to creating that environment.  Negotiations are presently being pursued vigorously by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to create the conditions which will enable the cattle population to be restored to a satisfactory level.</P>
    <P>If one was to summarise what Senator Connor had to say one could say that he wanted production but he was not worried about processing.  He criticised the Minister for having lent his support to various processing outlets throughout the country and for the State support that had been given to them.  For far too long much of our best beef and cattle have left this country on the hoof and have not <Col N="787" /> been processed.  As a result, many valuable jobs have been lost and there has been a great loss to the economy also. We must ensure that there are ample processing facilities available so that we can get the last shilling out of our own natural resources.  The hallmark of the Government's policy has been to create the incentives for the private sector to go into processing and production and to ensure that jobs can be created for our young people.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government must be complimented on the tremendous work that has been done in this area.  The vast sums of money which have been negotiated by the Minister for Agriculture and Food from the FEOGA fund in Europe is proof positive of his skilled ability as a negotiator and his full understanding of the problems Irish farmers face at this time.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor made great play of the severely handicapped areas scheme.  He mentioned the last general election and the commitments my colleagues in Roscommon gave during that time.  He told the House this afternoon that during the months prior to the general election the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Austin Deasy, had lodged an application with the European Commission for an extension of the severely handicapped scheme right across the country.  My constituency colleague, Deputy Paul Connaughton the former Minister of State for Agriculture, would not like to hear that because he claimed that he lodged that application.  The facts are that on 4 February 1987, 12 days before the general election, the then Minister for Agriculture lodged a hurried application in the European Commission. That was considered by the Commission right throughout the summer and was rejected by them in the autumn on the basis that it did not meet nine of the 12 conditions laid down.</P>
    <P>It was then up to this Government to put another application together and a detailed, positive, logical and practical application has now been lodged in Brussels by the Government, through the <Col N="788" /> Minister for Agriculture and Food, and negotiations are proceeding.  As soon as the European Commission and the Council of Ministers agree to that application the Government will accept it, implement it and honour it in a positive, professional manner as any good Government would.  These are the facts and they will stand up.  The record in the Department of Agriculture and Food will show that.  That cannot be contradicted and there is no point in people clamouring that they did this or that when we all know it was done in the heat of a general election to try to save seats and win votes. In my constituency, the then Minister of State not alone publicly issued the statement that he had made the application but the week before the election he wrote to every farmer in the constituency in a very detailed manner, quoting the farmer's herd number, telling him the number of stock that he had and the amount of money he was going to get in 1987 as a result of this application.  The facts are that these were political decisions; they were not made in the best interests of the country but in the haste of the day.  Consequently we must now take up where the Coalition Government failed and restore Irish agriculture, through European support, to where it was when we were last in Government in the early part of this decade.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher in his contribution referred to the construction industry and said that once and for all the myth had been buried that Coalition Governments had let down the construction industry, implying that Fianna Fáil always looked after it but that now we were neglecting it.  It was very easy for a Coalition Government to look after the construction industry, by sanctioning £330 million of home improvement grants and only providing £100 million.  It was left to us, as the new Government, to provide the balance of £230 million.</P>
    <P>In the weeks prior to the general election of 1987, £30 million was sanctioned for school buildings but no money was provided in the Book of Estimates or in the Budget.  We had to provide that £30 million.  We have always looked after the <Col N="789" /> construction industry.  We have created a climate for investment now.  We have reduced interest rates to their lowest levels in decades and we have given the opportunity for people, through the decentralisation programme, through the urban renewal programme and through the public capital programme, to invest their resources to create the opportunity for themselves, in a reduced interest rate and financial environment, to make their contribution to the development of the economy under State leadership and State motivation.  That is the principle on which this Government will proceed.  We are stimulating the economy by creating the opportunity for private enterprise and the Construction Industry Federation to respond to the leadership given and to the climate that has been created.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kelleher also talked about education.  We must remember that the Fianna Fáil Government did a lot for education by creating equality of opportunity in the sixties, something which until then was sadly lacking.  Education was the privilege of the few.  Now equality of opportunity prevails.  As a result, we have a tremendous young intelligent work force.  Today we have almost one million young people at school.  We have a national debt of £25 billion.  We have a quarter of a million people unemployed, and we have only 800,000 people working day after day, week after week making a regular tax contribution to the Exchequer.  Taking everything into account, £6.3 billion has been passed in the Book of Estimates by the Dáil, by the biggest majority in its history, and by this House also.  Out of the Book of Estimates we have allocated one-fifth of <Col N="790" /> the State's resources for 1988 to education. Nobody can claim that this Government are neglecting education. Our children have a fundamental right to education.  They will get it from this Government.  We will ensure that the necessary resources are made available, taking into account the constraints placed on the economy and our resources at this time.</P>

      <P>Senator Kelleher also referred to Údarás na Gaeltachta agus ba mhaith liom freisin comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Táimid anbhrodúil as ucht an sár-obair atá déanta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta i rith na mblianta atá caite agus ón lá a bunaíodh é.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelleher also referred to SFADCo.  I was delighted that the Cathaoirleach mentioned the fact that SFADCo was located in the adjoining county to Galway, County Clare, the Cathaoirleach's own county.</P>

      <P>We try to dispel any confusion.  The aim of this Government is to have everything on the table and no confusion about anything.  I would remind Senator Kelleher that the Coalition Government proposed to remove SFADCo off the Statute Books completely. In an effort to ensure the maximum utilisation of the State's resources by any semi-State sector, the Government decided to revamp the role of SFADCo.  SFADCo who had an industrial brief, and were responsible for tourist traffic through Shannon Airport up until 1987 have now a full industrial transport brief through Shannon, they are responsible for the Shannon Free Airport area, and for tourism and they have a full <Col N="791" /> industrial and financial brief for the whole mid-west area.  They are co-ordinating the roles previously taken by themselves, the IDA, the County Development Teams, Bord Fáilte, the tourist boards and the various other statutory bodies which means that there is proper utilisation of State resources to ensure that the maximum number of jobs are created and that the maximum economic activity is generated in the mid-west region.  This is the type of policy the Government have been pursuing right across the board in every area.  It is the type of policy we intend to pursue in all areas in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelleher also talked about the Department of Justice and the Garda and blamed the Minister for the present situation.  We all salute and acknowledge the great work being done by the Garda and the Department of Justice.  We were all delighted with their success in bringing the terrible kidnap ordeal to its conclusion. The resources needed to preserve the security of the State and to ensure the freedom of movement by individuals and by any people coming to this country will be made available on a continuous basis by this Government despite the economic constraints we have inherited and despite the difficulties we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been criticism in this House of the Government's policies.  Some allege that these policies necessarily involve cutting back in growth and employment.  This view is very shortsighted and dangerously simplistic.  Our gross indebtedness rose throughout this decade.  It did not buy permanently higher growth in employment.  This is a point I would like to stress.  There is no trade off, except in the very short term between fiscal expansion and growth.  In the medium term borrowing which was used to fund further growth begins to act as a drag on the economy through the interest payments which are required to service that debt.  In the eighties, unlike the seventies, real interest rates have become negative.  In plain English, that means that the real interest burden is <Col N="792" /> rising over time, and so we must find even more resources for debt servicing.  This is a serious difficulty that the present Government have to handle.</P>
    <P>Cutting back on Government borrowing and expenditure has had some adverse effects on growth in the short term.  I do not deny that.  We must remember that these policies are essential for the health of the economy in the medium term.  However, there are positive spin-offs in the short term, too.  The main benefits so far have been lower interest rates.  There were no fewer than six separate interest rate reductions since the Government came into office and since Dáil and Seanad Éireann passed the budget last March.  There has also been a real improvement in confidence.  This is not just something intangible; it can influence how people make their investment decisions which is also important for the long term growth of the economy.</P>
    <P>It is quite incorrect to say that the policies we are following now have not worked anywhere else.  Let me turn the statement around.  No successful and prosperous economy anywhere in the world allows its indebtedness to the rest of the world to rise unchecked or allows Government spending to rise inexorably.</P>
    <P>There is, unfortunately, no shortage of countries in the world which ran into problems through allowing unrestrained public service expansion funded by external debt.  The end of that road is not prosperity but chronic indebtedness which puts an enormous constraint on the freedom of action of economic policy. All the indications point to the fact that this Government have finally started to bring the public finance problem under control.  It was starkly clear when we came into office that as long as public expenditure and, in consequence, taxation and borrowings remained at their present levels, productive activity would simply be stifled and the economy would not recover.  Pious platitudes about the need to reduce expenditure are no longer enough.  What we now need is action and that is precisely what this Government <Col N="793" /> are providing, swift, decisive and determined action.</P>
    <P>Finally, what this Government are providing is swift, decisive and determined action.  They have resolutely taken action to tackle the fundamental problems, aiming for a medium term solution which will allow growth to resume at a sustainable rate.  Sound foundations are being laid and the benefits will be reaped in the years to come.</P>
    <P>One of the main foundations for recovery which we have put in place has been the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the public service pay agreement. The programme represents a consensus-based approach to the resolution of the difficulties facing this country.  It has been endorsed by the principal economic and social interests and has received the support of the public generally, including the trade unions and the farmers alike.  I would like today to pay my tribute to the positive attitude adopted by the trade unions and the farmers in acknowledging the serious difficulties that this country has and acknowledging their role in helping to resolve, along with the Government, these difficulties.  I am confident that the leadership they are giving will ensure that this economy can respond to the very important measures being taken by the Government to stimulate economic activity.</P>
    <P>It is only through such consensus that our problems on the economic and social fronts can be overcome.  The programme is based on the realities facing us and the strategy and principles outlined are consistent with the views expressed in the NESC Report: <i>A Strategy for Development, 1986-1990.</i>  This report sets down the requirement to be met to avert an economic crisis and to establish a solid basis for increasing output and employment over the long term.  In line with the NESC recommendations, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has adopted a consistent and coherent macro-economic strategy in borrowing, in particular fiscal policies which will stabilise the national debt in relation to gross national product.  When we take into account the level of services we have <Col N="794" /> in the areas of health, education, environment and right across the board, in comparison with other countries in Europe &mdash; and we are part of the European Community &mdash; and in comparison with our GNP, it shows clearly that the levels of services are much greater in proportion to our financial debt and our population structure than in other countries throughout the Community.  The amount of GNP we are putting into our public services and into servicing our national debt is serious.  This is why people must acknowledge the difficulties that various Ministers have now to grapple with to ensure that these difficulties can be resolved by consensus and by proper support right across the board.</P>
    <P>In addition, the programme has also put forward a development strategy, focused on the international trading sectors of the economy.  We have had in the past year the highest level of exports ever in our history, which shows the committed, flexible and productivity performance of our people.  It shows the ability of our industrialists and our factories and the people involved in high technology to be able to produce and compete with any other country throughout the world.  We can be all proud of that tremendous effort and we must also salute our unions and our workers, for 1987 was an industrial strike-free year and that led enormously to the tremendous success we have had in our exports and in our export growth.  We are hoping that 1988 will even surpass the performance of 1987.  Already, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister with responsibility for Trade and Marketing are ensuring that no stone will be left unturned to ensure that the private sector and private sector leadership will be available to complement the State incentives and the State resources so that we can equal or even surpass the great export performance of 1987.</P>
    <P>An integral part of the overall programme is the public service pay agreement. This provides for yearly increases in pay, averaging about 2½ per cent over the three year period of the programme. The agreement is the outcome of very <Col N="795" /> many long hours of difficult negotiation and, in my view, it represents a satisfactory compromise between what the Government can afford to pay and the expectations of the trade unions and their members.  Some people seem to suggest that it was unnecessary for the Government to have given an average increase over the next three years in their negotiations with the social partners.  This I could not accept; indeed nobody with any practical positive financial sense would accept it.  If the Government are to meet the public service pay bill, if they are to meet the servicing of the national debt, if they are to stimulate the economy and if they are to ensure that we can reschedule and renegotiate our serious national debt, then they must know over a number of years, and particularly over a three year period, exactly what money they have to spend on the public service pay bill and in servicing our national and international debt.  In that situation, when we know exactly where we are going, when we know what we have to spend, it is much easier to negotiate and to arrive at a positive conclusion as to what can be done over three years to reduce the national debt and to bring it within manageable proportions.</P>
    <P>A very important element of the agreement is the weighting of the basic pay increases in favour of the lower paid, which should enable them to secure a real improvement in relative wage incomes over the period of the programme.  The value of achieving consensus with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and with the other representatives of Irish industry in a national programme to tackle our economic and social problems cannot be overstated.  It was crucially important to the success of the programme that agreement be reached with Congress on the development of pay over the period involved.  Any national programme which did not contain such consensus on pay policy would have been seriously flawed from the outset.  Apart from the certainty that it provided for Government planning, as I already have alluded to, an approach based on consensus will <Col N="796" /> minimise pointless confrontation and the hardship arising from industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>A very significant element of the agreement in this regard is the undertaking on the part of the unions not to engage in industrial actions in pursuit of claims in excess of the pay terms.  This will naturally contribute greatly to industrial peace in the public sector for the three year period of the programme and leave the Government free to concentrate on solving the serious problems facing the economy without the distraction of what can often be very damaging disputes. Moreover, it allows for proper planning and strategy management of our finances by the Government.  The Government are determined that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will succeed and are relying on the parties to that programme to help in that aim.  In this area we all, as public representatives and as community leaders, have a very fundamental role to give active, positive support and leadership to the consensus arrived at, in trying to resolve the enormous financial difficulties that confront this country.</P>
    <P>The Government policies are the right ones for the country at this time and, as I said earlier this week, are entirely in keeping with the recommendations of independent analyses and of organisations both at home and abroad.  I know of no reputable economic body or institute which do not support the broad thrust of the Government policies.  Various economic analyses have been done and various comments have been made and they are all positively supporting the attitude and the policies at present being pursued by this Government in the interests of all the people on this island.</P>
    <P>The debate we have had, ranging over the performance of the economy generally, should be an occasion for us to look at the shape of what is emerging, to identify the strengths that we have seen in 1987 and to conclude that we should build on those during 1988 and future years.  This will be one of the central concerns of Government economic policy during the course of this year and in future years.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the votes of sympathy to Mrs. Eva Mooney and to Senator Paschal Mooney on the death of former Senator Joe Mooney.  Joe Mooney was a Member of this House from 1961 to 1965 as a nominee of the former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass.  He was a member of Leitrim County Council for more than 40 years and was also a member of many of the county and regional committees throughout the same period.  He was known for his great interest in tourism and also for his great pride in County Leitrim.  He always availed of every opportunity to <Col N="798" /> promote the county.  He will also be remembered for being the only person to keep the An Tóstal festival running since its inception in 1954.</P>
      <P>Joe Mooney took great pleasure in the fact that he gave many Irish artists their first launching pad to fame and glory.  He will be remembered for having discovered the now international Irish stars, Foster and Allen, at the An Tóstal festival in 1978.  He was a most unassuming and unselfish man who never used his position for personal achievement or gain.  He was a most approachable public representative and his constituents found a sympathetic ear when they called on him no matter what hour of the day or night.  He has a great sense of humour and was very lighthearted in his approach to life.  I will miss him as a friend and as a politician but most of all as a great adviser to me in my capacity as a Senator.</P>

I was saddened this afternoon to hear the tragic news of his untimely death.  I would like to join in the expression of sympathy to his son, our colleague, Senator Paschal Mooney, and also to his widow, Mrs. Eva Mooney.</P>
      <P>As other speakers have said, Joe Mooney had a long and distinguished career as a public representative.  He was a member and former chairman of Leitrim County Council and he served with distinction for a number of years as a Member of this House.  His record as a public representative is one of outstanding service to his native County Leitrim and to his country.  He was associated with the development of many projects of an economic and tourism nature in his native county and indeed he initiated many of these projects himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Joe Mooney was a great advocate of utilising and exploiting to the maximum all our many indigenous resources.  He realised the potential of these resources <Col N="799" /> for job creation and economic development. His support for the coal fired generating station in Arigna, for tourism in Leitrim and for projects such as Knock Airport were wholehearted and sincere. During his lifetime he was honoured on many occasions and in various ways by the people of his native County Leitrim. Today I am sure his passing will be mourned not alone in County Leitrim but throughout the country.  He was a true Irishman and a true patriot.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a ainm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to clarify its policy on Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this motion in the depths of a winter that has seen the horror of Enniskillen but has also, thankfully, seen a widespread and welcome revulsion against that horror and all it stands for. There are unmistakable signs of political dialogue in the North &mdash; it is rather difficult to interpret them &mdash; whether they be the Unionist talks about talks or the controversial meeting of John Hume and Gerry Adams.  On that matter I still have an open mind though I think most <Col N="800" /> people find it very difficult to know what exactly was the point of the meeting, who stands to gain or whether the gain is likely to outweigh the damage it will cause in Unionist perceptions.  I have an open mind on it.  As a historian, however, I have some reservations about the symbiotic relationships between constitutional nationalism and physical force nationalism.  These are not separate strands in Irish history; they are closely intermingled.  Constitutional Nationalists have frequently lived off, lived by invoking the spectre of, physical force nationalism.</P>
    <P>While keeping an open mind on the matter, I would not like to see the Hume-Adams talks resulting in some kind of reemergence of a Catholic front, a kind of pan-nationalist Catholic civil rights movement.  If that happens the Government must not get involved in supporting that kind of movement.  One of the implications of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is that ostensibly our Government are the guarantor of the Nationalists but by the same token they are committed to safeguarding the rights of the Unionists. There will be no solution in the North which involves a Dublin Government backing any kind of renewed Catholic Nationalist front.</P>
    <P>Dialogue is taking place and has taken place before with abortive results.  Hope deferred maketh the heart sick but hope also springs eternal.  January, which is a month named after the god, Janus, is an appropriate month for looking backwards and forwards, which is what that god characterises.  While not losing sight of the implications of Enniskillen we look forward, albeit with some apprehension, to the hopes of a new political spring.  We are already on the home run to the end of the third year of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and to the review which that agreement envisages.  Whatever defects the agreement had in conception, foundation and implementation it stays in place and is likely to endure.</P>
    <P>Long before November 1988 the Government must be clear about the approaches they are to make to this review and that is one good reason for a <Col N="801" /> debate of this kind.  We should begin to initiate the debate which is a prerequisite for the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. It was suggested to me, when it came to my turn to propose a motion from the University Senators, that a motion of this kind would be a distraction from the compelling fiscal and financial problems the Government face but, I do not think that that argument holds any water.  First of all, the Government, I am sure, would not like to be compared to a former undistinguished President of the United States about whom it was said he could not perform two very simple actions &mdash; one of which delicacy forbids me to specify &mdash; at the same time.  I am sure that our Government can deal with these two problems.</P>
    <P>In purely southern terms, the North is as great a malaise as the economy.  It is a running sore in Irish life, even if we try to ignore it.  Since the mid-seventies the South has undoubtedly wished the North would go away and I have been re-assessing my interpretation of that ostensible southern indifference.  I do not think it is indifference.  I do not think it is callousness or hyprocrisy or ambivalance.  I think it is that the South has been absolutely baffled by what is going on in the North, as baffled as the average English, the average American and the average European citizen, and our ostensible indifference does come from a kind of despair, a characteristic nationalist fatalism that nothing could be done about it. But I think the post-Enniskillen mood is changing that.  Enniskillen could not be put in the category of the politics of the last atrocity, something which would make a stir for a while and then disappear.</P>
    <P>There is a tide of public opinion that cries out for new and imaginative political departures that will work towards peace. I think the South is in a mood which is saying for the first time since the troubles began, what can we do for the North? Tell us what we can do for the North. The public in the South are in no mood to reiterate the old stale clichés of our unattainable objectives.  I am suggesting that this debate is appropriate not only <Col N="802" /> because things are stirring, because we are on the run-in to a review of the agreement, but because the public mood is in a very unusual situation and is expecting a difference of approach.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the North is as pressing as the economy and they are closely linked.  At a psychological level if the people see our Government making some really imaginative moves on northern policy, then that in itself will help to combat the corrosive cynicism towards our politicians.  It will suggest to the public that if our Government are serious, hard working and imaginative about the North, then perhaps the economic problems can also be solved.  I think there is a psychological connection there.  But more obviously we need a northern policy which will work towards peace and northern politics simply because we cannot afford the North indefinitely.  We cannot afford the consequential security costs. We cannot afford the chronic deterrent to investment.</P>
    <P>One of the great hopes of the economy in the future is what I might call cultural tourism.  We have not even begun to tap the possibilities of this country as a kind of a new island of scholars.  Island of saints, we never were, except in mythological imagination, and certainly never shall be again but we could be an island of scholars.  The potential for cultural tourism is enormous but not as long as our resources are drained psychologically and economically in the northern problem. The matter here is of sheer self-interest as well as concern for the North. Finally of course it is sheer madness to think that we could take on the North in terms of unity and in terms of integrating it into our economy.  Northern Ireland is a depressed area industrially, it belongs to an antiquated industrial economy.  It survives only because of massive transfers from the British Exchequer which we would find it impossible to match.</P>
    <P>By the way, I think it is historically proper that the British Exchequer should continue to shore up the northern economy. Perhaps I should make an important distinction here.  I do not think it is in Britain's competence to solve the <Col N="803" /> problem of Northern Ireland &mdash; at least certainly not on her own &mdash; but it is Britain's historical responsibility to carry the major share of the burden, what I might call the British lion's share of the burden.  I see nothing wrong with that. We must insist that the British continue to alleviate the worst effects of the northern problem.</P>
    <P>My purpose in initiating this debate is two-fold.  I want to elicit information from the Government &mdash; eternal optimist that I am &mdash; and I want to hear my colleagues' views on this crucial national topic.  My own views are evolving all the time.  I cannot say that I held the same views for very long since the northern troubles broke out.  Some people might regard that as a sign of a very unstable temperament but I would like to think that it is an attempt to respond to a situation that is constantly changing.  Later this month, I hope to develop these views in detail in various fora.  Today I simply want to sketch the main outlines of what I think.</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly my views are rooted in historical realities.  The orthodox nationalist thinking about the North, whether it is constitutional or physical force tradition &mdash; and this includes Fianna Fáil thinking as well as Provo thinking and Fine Gael thinking &mdash; rests on historical fallacies, mythologies.  The first thing we must do to have a correct analysis of where we are going is to set the historical records straight.  Thus the Provisional propaganda to which we will be increasingly subjected I predict in the coming year, according as they try to retrieve their losses after Enniskillen, and anyone who reads what they have to say will realise that they are now aiming at minimising the post-Enniskillen damage and at winning the hearts and minds of young people by appealing to them meretriciously and spuriously but appealing to them on an insidious propaganda basis.</P>
    <P>One of the pseudo historical points which the Provos make is that partition is the cause of all the trouble: Partition is the great injustice, according to them, committed against the Irish people; the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, must <Col N="804" /> be repealed; that way lies the undoing of the injustice.  The other cliché or cant phrase they use &mdash; and again it is not only the Provos but also the mainstream consitutional Nationalists &mdash; is national self-determination.  I suggest that there is no basis for these twin concepts of self deception.  There is no proper historical basis for either the idea that Partition was an injustice esssentially or that we were denied national self determination.  Partition was inevitable from 1912 or 1913 onwards.  There is the faint possibility that had Irish Nationalist leaders taken any notice of Unionist resistence to home rule in the period betwen 1886 and 1912, and God knows that gave them plenty of time, if they had taken on board Unionist objections to home rule, and if the third Home Rule Bill had incorporated safeguards for Ulster Unionists, it is just possible that Irish unity might have been preserved in the 1912 Home Rule Bill. However, it was impossible after that. Certainly, the 1916 rising made partition even more inevitable.</P>
    <P>What happened after 1920-21 was that the kind of partition which was created, the extent of the partition, the way in which the boundary commission was handled and the maximising of Unionist control over Six Counties became confused in people's minds with partition itself.  While they were right about the cynical way in which the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 came about I think that blinded them from seeing that partition was actually a condition of Irish independence, not a flaw in Irish independence. That is an unpalatable fact and we have to face up to it.  The injustices of the Stormont regime compounded the sense of grievance but, nonetheless, the basic point is that some kind of partition seems to have been inevitable from a very early stage.</P>
    <P>So it was with national self determination. In most statements issued these days by the Provisional mouthpieces, Gerry Adams and Danny Morrison, you will find repeated again and again the phrase that national self determination has been denied to the Irish people and that this must be restored. <Col N="805" /> You can have national self determination only where there is a real consensus, only where there is an agreement, not just a majority view, and only where there is a real consensus as to what the nation is. The essence of our continuing problem in the North is that there is no agreement as to what the nation is.  Therefore, it seems that you cannot have a concept of national self determination where a substantial minority denies that it belongs to the nation and thus the results of the 1918 General Election are invalidated as an assertion of national self determination.</P>
    <P>There is another element which has further confused the issue.  We assume that because Ireland is an island it is entitled to independence and that the geographical shape of the country is divinely ordained, in other words, what God has ordained geographically, let no man put aside.  There is no basis for this argument. It is a purely sentimental argument which rests on an aesthetic concept of the island and it is a further flaw in the <i>a priori</i> assumption that the whole island is entitled to self determination.  I suggest, therefore, that the premises on which the Provos argue are suspect but they are also the premises on which most of our constitutional Nationalists base their case.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil claim and the Fine Gael claim to unity is no different from that of the Provos.  Of course, they abhor the methods of the Provisional IRA but they pursue the same aim.  In my view, the aim is spurious.  The claim is phoney and should be rejected just as much as the methods.  There is no historical justification for asserting that the national territory is the whole island.  Articles 2 and 3 make this assertion and, disappointingly and illogically, the draft constitution of the Progressive Democrats asserted the same thing last week. Nor do I think there is any point in replacing a territorial claim by a quite pointless and arguably insincere aspiration to unity.</P>
    <P>Most of the evidence we now have from the polls is that more and more people in the South are not aspiring to <Col N="806" /> unity.  I suggest we should renounce not only Provo methods but Provo objectives. We should liberate ourselves from the will-o'-the-wisp of territorial unity.  It can be said that the Provos, after all, ruthless as they are, have the courage of our convictions though they are not really convictions.  Our attitude to the national question can be compared with how Matthew Arnold described 19th century Victorian religion: we are half believers in a casual creed.  This is what the Provos are taking advantage of and what they are saying to our young people is that they are only acting on what we profess to believe.</P>
    <P>My argument is that we must stop believing those basic premises because they cannot be sustained.  We have no moral claim to unity.  Apart from anything else, we forfeited our moral claim to the unity of this country again and again since independence when again and again we refused to modify the Catholic nature of the State.  Catholic bishops and politicians who worked for the retention of a Catholic clause in the Constitution &mdash; some of those politicians professing all the while to be neutral &mdash; have no moral right now to wring their hands over community divisions in the North because they helped to perpetuate the image of the South which is in large part responsible for community conflict in the North.</P>
    <P>I would like to see political arrangements in the whole island which would be a long step from the shibboleths of territorial unity.  I believe the Anglo-Irish Agreement should be seized upon as the framework of opportunity.  It is not perfect. It has not been implemented like Christianity, it has not even been tried. The Unionists consider they have a grievance because they were not consulted though that is largely their own fault. Article 1 says that the constitutional position will not change until there is a majority in the North in favour of unity but that does not help us very much either.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether anyone has really pointed this out but how can our case be improved if, instead of a 60 per cent Unionist majority, there was a 49 <Col N="807" /> per cent Unionist minority?  It might change the statistics but it would not make the problem any easier to solve.  I am not starry-eyed about the Anglo-Irish Agreement but I do think it provides the framework.  What I think our Government should be doing is aiming for a situation where we would withdraw the territorial claim and thus reduce pressures, where we would liberate ourselves from mythology and reduce pressures on the North.  It would mean, for example, that the Anglo-Irish Agreement would be a far less threatening document to the Unionists because they would have no grounds for seeing it as a stalking horse for Irish unity.  They have good reason for seeing it in that way now.  All that having been done, we would be in a strong moral position to say to Great Britain that we are not interested territorially but that we are certainly interested as Irish people and as guarantors and that now the onus is on them to really satisfy the aspirations of the Nationalists while at the same time telling the Unionists they are not constitutionally in any fear.</P>
    <P>What Ulster Unionists want is the assurance that their British identity will be preserved outside of a united Ireland. It baffles me to hear, for example, the Minister for Foreign Affairs repeating again, against all the evidence, that we can satisfy the Protestant ethos of the Ulster Unionists within a united Ireland and that we will give them assurances. That is not what they want.  They want the assurance that their British ethos will survive outside a united Ireland.  I see no reason that there should not be imaginative political structures in the North of a kind not yet envisaged, it is the kind of situation which cries out for these complex structures.  Here is a situation where we all have to make compromises.  This will be our historic compromise.  We will withdraw our claim to territorial unity; the Ulster Unionists will be told in no uncertain terms by the British that they are not going to be thrust out of the United Kingdom but they are not going to re-assert their ascendency and they will have to share power.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> There is no reason why Ulster Nationalists, such of them as are Nationalists because it would seem now to be increasingly clear that many Northern Catholics are satisfied to be in the United Kingdom as long as their own self-esteem and self-respect is protected, should not have the same cultural fulfilment as, let us say, Welsh people have under a different kind of political agreement. You do not have to be a member of a nation state in order to have your personality fulfilled, your cultural traditions respected.  There are other ways of doing it.  They are the feelings I have and this is the kind of imaginative political arrangement I would like to see.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that it can be done overnight; what I am arguing for is a suggestion to our people that they should have a new way of thinking about these things.  Part of this deal would be that the SDLP would stop talking in nebulous and sinister terms.  I am a supporter of the SDLP in many respects and a great admirer of them.  In fact, I am a member of a group called Friends of the SDLP but, if I were a Ulster Unionist I would feel very uneasy at words like &ldquo;process&rdquo;, &ldquo;framework&rdquo;, or &ldquo;stage&rdquo; which are used by people like Seamus Mallon, Brid Rogers and John Hume.  The feeling there surely must be that this is simply a milestone on the road to a united Ireland. A new Ireland is another of their code words.</P>
    <P>I am putting myself on record as saying that now I totally reject the concept of a united Ireland and I am suggesting that my position is as patriotic as those who prattle empty rhetoric about a united Ireland.  It is patriotic to recognise that our territorial claim is unsustainable, that it is morally and historically unsustainable. It is, moreover, patriotic to recognise that the best interests of Ireland, the best interests of peace, the best hope of containing violence, is served by the proper working of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and by the continuance of British power in the North as long as that is necessary.  The real danger, and the real nightmare we should have, <Col N="809" /> is that the Brits will go unexpectedly.  If the truth were told, instead of talking about Irish unity, meaningless prattle about Irish unity, we should be making novenas, or whatever the secular equivalent is nowadays of novenas, that the British will stay in the North indefinitely.</P>
    <P>I cannot expect that Fianna Fáil will be converted to my point of view, at least not overnight.  I now move to the main reason why I moved this motion; I want to know what the Government think about the North.  A friend of mine has described the characteristic style of the Government as rialú gan míniú, Government without explanation.  Admittedly, they have kept their nose to the grindstone and they may decide that they have no time for giving elabororate explanations but it is not good enough that there has been no major statement from the Government on their Northern policy.</P>
    <P>I can, in a way, understand their traumatic attitudes about the North given the origin of the party's foundation and given the anguish and the angst of the arms trial in 1969-1970.  But what now is Government policy?  Do they really mean the official aim of the Fianna Fáil Party which was laid down at their foundation?  Does Michael O'Kennedy still believe there should be a British withdrawal, as he did in 1975, or has that rush of blood to the head now receded?</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach really serious that a unitary state is the desirable outcome of our present problems?  If he is still insistent that Northern Ireland is a failed entity, what realistically has he got to suggest in its place?  When he says that he is accepting the Anglo-Irish Agreement because he is bound by his predecessor's contracts, is that a real and sufficient and satisfactory reason to be acting on the most crucial issue in Ireland today?  That would be all right for some marginal external treaty.  What do the Government have to say about Peter Barry's allegations of 8 January, that the Government are dragging their feet on the Agreement and the workings of the Agreement?  Finally, what does the Taoiseach mean when he said in a recent radio <Col N="810" /> interview that Anglo-Irish relations will never be correct as long as the Northern Ireland problem remains unresolved? What does he mean by that?</P>
    <P>They are the questions I would like answered as this critical year unfolds, as we prepare for the first review of the Agreement in November.  The House, and the country, are entitled to know what the Government policies are on those crucial issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the motion. Like Senator Murphy, I make no apology for bringing the issue of Northern Ireland back to the fore front in the Seanad today.  I was delighted to hear his renewed challenge to the preconceived ideas in which many of the people, and many of the political parties, in this country believe.  I particularly think it is relevant that we should discuss the Northern Ireland problem in a week in which a very dramatic event occurred for which we have still had no reasonable explanation. That was, and I think it is relevant to comment on it, the meeting between John Hume and Gerry Adams.</P>
      <P>John Hume has, quite rightly, earned the respect of politicians of all parties in Ireland, and abroad, for his tireless work for peaceful constitutional nationalism in Northern Ireland but I do not believe that, first of all, he should be allowed to loftily explain his meeting with Gerry Adams by saying that he would talk to anybody at any time.  That is not an adequate explanation.  Nor do I believe that the Government, and politicians here, should continue to give him the sort of blanket pardon they have given him for this meeting in media interviews and in public statements since it happened. Both parties owe it to us to tell us why this meeting took place.  I feel that this House should condemn that meeting as not helpful towards progress in Northern Ireland, not helpful to this State and as giving Mr. Adams a credibility and a stature which he has not earned and does not deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That meeting has thrown a lifeline to the IRA, and to Provisional Sinn Féin, a distinction which I do not wish to make, <Col N="811" /> at a time when they were on the rack after Enniskillen.  It is quite inexplicable to me that Mr. Hume, a man of international stature, should give Mr. Adams, a well known terrorist, a lifeline at a time when his public support must be failing and has faded recently.  It would be far more helpful if Mr. Hume were looking in the other direction, towards the Unionist community, and talking to them about co-existence and peace, formations of government, internal formations of government and structures in Northern Ireland at this time.  It is a pity that he did not.</P>
    <P>This motion is broad.  It is not, as far as I am concerned, meant to be an expression of approval or an expression of condemnation of the Government's record on Northern Ireland.  To me it is asking a question, because I am particularly confused about the Government's policy on Northern Ireland.  I feel that the less we interfere in Northern Ireland affairs the better and the more useful role we will play.  Nevertheless, while I welcome some of the moderation which has marked this Government's term of office &mdash; and I differ with Senator Murphy in that I welcome their <i>volte face</i> on secion 31 &mdash; while I welcome their implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and their belated deathbed conversion to extradition, I do not see in these piecemeal moves any overall conversion, any turning of their backs on the constitutional element about which the Government have always been suspect for historical reasons.  This Government's policy on Northern Irleand has been marked purely by one thing, that is pragmatism. It has not been marked by any consistent attitude of any sort.  In a very welcome response to Loughgall we saw a strong statement from the Minister for Foreign Affairs in May and I wish to read into the record a small section of that statement.  He said that the Irish Government reject utterly the warped policy of the Provisional IRA, that it is the leadership of the IRA who trap young people into the cycle of violence that has brought so much suffering to Nationalists and <Col N="812" /> Unionists alike; that it is that leadership who are responsible for putting those young lives at risk.  That to me was a very welcome unequivocal condemantion from the Minister, squarely placing the blame for the trouble in Northern Ireland on the IRA and nowhere else.</P>
    <P>We also got a piecemeal response from the Government regarding Enniskillen, the response being that the Government changed their mind on the extradition issue.  While I welcome that change of mind, I think it is dangerous that atrocities of that sort should make such fundamental differences to policy on Northern Ireland.  There was immense confusion over extradition and the Government appeared to be speaking with two voices on that issue as they do so often on Northern Ireland.  I suspect that at their next Árd Fheis the Fianna Fáil Party will make different noises from the ones the Minister for Foreign Affairs makes to the British Government.  That is understandable and we can forgive them for it, but it is very confusing if on such an important issue of extradition, which should be an issue of principle, it takes an atrocity like Enniskillen to change the minds of a Government.</P>
    <P>I agree with a great deal of what Senator Murphy said about the issue of a united Ireland.  So little is known about what the Government and those within it who portray, urge for and continually pay lip service to a united Ireland, envisage as the sort of united Ireland we are going to get afterwards.  It is a sort of Utopian myth, a dishonest Utopian myth, purely for the faithful and for rousing the faithful.  The Taoiseach, the Minister, the Cabinet and every single Member of this House know what Senator Murphy said is true, that there is not a hope in hell of a united Ireland taking place in our lifetime or in the lifetime of anybody in this House.  That is the reality.  If we want to delude a few people who know no better or who have some belief in a romantic myth with rabble rousing speeches, let us go ahead, but it is dishonest; it is unhelpful and it drives the fear of God into the Unionist population in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> It is probably time that the territorial claim embodied in Articles 2 and 3 was challenged in a serious way by the authorities here.  I do not see why we should necessarily have a referendum in the Republic purely on Articles 2 and 3.  If we are going to challenge the idea of unity we should challenge it throughout the whole island.  It would be far more sensible to have an all-Ireland referendum on unity.  If the cost is spelt out, if the type of Ireland is spelt out, if what it would cost people in their pockets is spelt out, that might result, in a very uncomfortable outcome for those who have championed this myth for so long. I urge the Government to consider the possibility of getting together with the authorities in London and holding an all-Ireland poll on unity.</P>
    <P>A notable omission &mdash; not just under this Government &mdash; from those who shout loudest about unity is that they have absolutely no understanding of the Unionist population in Northern Ireland. I hear, and have heard in recent years, very little about the role which Unionists would play in this so-called united Ireland.  It is a territorial claim which is made in the Constitution, but the one million Protestant Unionists in the North are ignored because it is impossible to accommodate them.  This is where I agree with Senator Murphy.  We have been through too many levered red herrings on the issue of a united Ireland.  We have too often said that if we gave them divorce or a new Constitution or extradition and if we abolished Articles 2 and 3 maybe that would convince them that they could come in with us in a united Ireland.  It does not matter what concessions we give to them, they are not interested in coming into a united Ireland with us on any terms whatsoever.  As Senator Murphy so eloquently said, if we were to accept that, and that was a precondition for talks and for negotiations, then progress of some sort could be made, because so long as the threat of a territorial domination from this part of the island is there we are certain to drive the majority in Northern Ireland back <Col N="814" /> into their ghettos and the problem will become worse rather than better.</P>
    <P>The best thing this Government can do in relation to the present problem is to interfere with what is going on in Northern Ireland as little as possible, to issue as few public statements as possible, to be as unprovocative as they can be in the circumstances, not to rattle sabres and to mention unity as little as possible.  We can possibly use our influence to encourage the Nationalists &mdash; because that is the only place that we have got influence &mdash; to stretch their hands across to the Unionists to produce an internal solution to the problems there.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from Fianna Fáil once again as to whether they believe that a unitary State is the only possible solution or the best solution.  Do they expect us to believe that a unitary State is a runner?  They know perfectly well that it is not a runner.  I ask them to come clean and tell us what the practical immediate future is.  Do they really believe that British withdrawal is a practical alternative at the moment?  Do they really believe that talking about a unitary State is anything but pie in the sky?  It is not.  What I should like to see them doing is simply keep as low a profile as possible to encourage the Nationalists to make the Northern Ireland State work and to condemn and root out from our midst the IRA and any of their propaganda organs and covers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the way this debate has started.  It is quite obvious that both the proposer and seconder of this motion do not have very much interest in what is happening either in this part of the island or the other part of the island.  It is clear they have no belief except in themselves and when they spoke of the SDLP they spoke about talking in &ldquo;nebulous and sinister terms&rdquo;. They used the words &ldquo;prattle&rdquo; and &ldquo;empty rhetoric&rdquo; for anybody who has any aspirations to a unity of minds in this country.  The suggestions of both people are not suggestions that would find very much popularity either in the North or <Col N="815" /> South.  It appears that Senator Murphy thinks that anybody who disagrees with him is either a fool or a knave.</P>
      <P>The claim by Senator Ross that we should dump the territorial claim is the kernel of the argument that was raised by both Senator Ross and Senator Murphy.  I can assure both of them that this claim will not be dropped by Fianna Fáil, either in or out of Government.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil stand today, as they have always done, by the principle that we must secure the unity and independence of Ireland as a republic and as true republicans we believe in the achievement of this aim by peaceful means.  We cannot divorce ourselves from the territory of people of the northern part of this island nor would we ever wish to.</P>

      <P>We, as a party and Government, firmly believe in the values as stated in Articles 2 and 3 of the 1937 Constitution which has served this country and its people well for over 50 years. It is our wish that the sound, enduring institutions of this democratic State should be extended to the part of this country from which we are still politically separated.</P>
      <P>We are proud of the Constitution and there is no doubt that it is the foundation for sovereign political independence and a guarantee of our fundamental rights and liberties.  That guarantee embraces all the people of Ireland and places a special responsibility on the Government. We have a moral obligation to do whatever we can, using the instruments now at hand, to secure material improvements in the situation of all the people of the North not alone bearing in mind the position of the Nationalist population but bearing in mind also that any improvement in their position will make things better for everybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind or in the <Col N="816" /> mind of the members of my party that violence is counterproductive, brings nothing but misery and that the continuance of violence will no doubt delay the day when all the people in this island can live in peace, harmony and unity.  My party have always condemned the use of force for political purposes.  We will use every means possible to defeat and bring the perpetrators of violence to justice.</P>
    <P>The Forum report sets out our fundamental position on Northern Ireland. This problem can be resolved only within the wider Anglo-Irish framework developed since the 1980 Dublin Castle Summit.  The Forum report states that, &ldquo;a settlement which recognises the legitimate rights of Nationalists and Unionists must transcend the context of Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  While we would, of course, welcome agreement between the political parties within Northern Ireland, that will happen only if it includes a wider Irish dimension, and the Anglo-Irish Agreement contains provisions for both. Unionist participation in the political process is an important missing element at present.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are the republican party and have always had a pragmatic approach, based on achieving progress by every means available.  Even though Senator Ross mentioned that we are a pragmatic party, he suggested that there is something wrong in being pragmatic.  I do not see what is wrong with taking a pragmatic approach on any issue.  Fianna Fáil were founded in 1926 as a means of getting away from a rigid doctrinaire abstentionist position.  In the forties and early sixties Fianna Fáil took strong measures to stop campaigns of violence.</P>
    <P>The aim of a united Ireland can only be pursued using political means by a sovereign Government representing the Irish people.  If we can establish real equality for Nationalists in the North of Ireland, then much of the rationale for a separate Northern Ireland state would disappear.  Re-establishing our own economic strength is the first priority if we are to be in a position to contribute constructively to a long term solution.  The <Col N="817" /> Enniskillen bombing has shown the disastrous impact of violence.  We would like to see violence cease before there is another such disaster, which experience has shown sooner or later cannot be avoided. The campaign of violence is totally repudiated by the vast majority of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>A very high priority must be given to the improvement of the economic and social situation of the people of West Belfast, with a contribution from the International Fund.  More progress and fair employment is also required.  The administration of justice and the question of the UDR must also be examined.  The practice of Irish Governments is to honour and operate agreements entered into by their predecessors.  We are not alone in doing that in the case of the present Anglo-Irish Agreement which seeks in every way possible to improve the situation of all the people of Northern Ireland and especially that of members of the Nationalist community.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made over the past few years.  Last year's marching season was the quietest on record according to the Chairman of the SDLP and that is undoubtedly due in some significant way to the work of the Tánaiste, Deputy Brian Lenihan in the Ministerial conference and through the Belfast secretariat. At this stage I would like to send Deputy Lenihan our best wishes and I hope to see him back in harness again in a very short time.</P>

      <P>We have moved fair employment on to a new priority base and this is perhaps the single most important issue of practical concern to Nationalists at present.  As a result, we expect the British Government to introduce new and effective fair employment legislation in the next session of Parliament.  We would have liked to have seen much more rapid progress in a range of areas, including the rate of accompaniment of the UDR by the RUC, and in regard to relations generally between the security forces and the Nationalist community <Col N="818" /> and in the administration of justice.  We have actively made known to the British Government our concern at the inadequate progress in these and other areas and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>There is a need for dialogue between constitutional politicians right across the political spectrum.  There is no way the political problems of this island can be permanently resolved without the input of every section of the Irish people, including the Unionist community.  The real test for Unionists today is that they enter into the search for stability and real peace on this island.  This will not be achieved by hiding behind slogans, outdated rhetoric and unrealistic pre-conditions: the way forward must be through honest and direct dialogue.</P>
      <P>I must pay tribute to the board of the International Fund.  It is hoped that the fund will be actively used to fund imaginative and substantial cross-Border projects and that it will respond positively to the needs of those areas which have been most affected by the instability of recent years.  Approximately one-eighth of the unemployed in Northern Ireland live in West Belfast and the fund must respond creatively and effectively to this challenge.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party, either in or out of Government, will continue to take initiatives and create structures for the political resolution of all the problems of all of this island.  We will not hesitate at any stage to do pragmatically whatever is necessary to achieve the aims for which the Fianna Fáil Party were originally set up namely &mdash; to create on this island a unity which would be a unity of mind as well as unity of territory.  The Fianna Fáil Party have not, and will not, abandon that principle.  The Taoiseach being a pragmatist, will do everything possible to ensure that the aims of the Fianna Fáil Party will be progressed, so that in the not too distant future, we will see unity between every section of society, unity not alone of territory but a unity of purpose, to ensure that everybody on this island will have the opportunity to live in peace and harmony.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Independent Senators for having chosen this topic today.  I regret that the time available, of necessity allows one only to skim the surface of this problem.  I, too, am looking for answers to questions similar to those raised by Senators Ross and Murpny who, coming at the problems from very different starting grounds, seem to be in general agreement as to the nature of the questions which are disturbing many people about the Government's attitude to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Before coming to those questions, I would like to return to another more immediate aspect of Northern Ireland. This debate today is taking place overshadowed by the apparent confirmation yesterday of what had been suspected for such a very long time, the persistent running of guns on a massive scale from the Government of Libya to the Provisional IRA in this country.  The scale of this operation is extremely frightening. The list of weapons include surface to air missiles, mortars, high velocity rifles and so forth.  Already, we have been told and apparently it is confirmed, that four shiploads of these armaments have come through.  What we saw on the <i>Eksund</i> is merely the tip of the iceberg.  What is truly frightening is the claim which has been made persistently and with authority that these armaments are here.</P>
      <P>I am sorry we did not have the opportunity today to have the Minister for Justice here to tell us with authority what the actual situation is.  If that situation is, as we are now being told, and as Garda sources confirmed today, as reported in <i>The Irish Press</i>, then some very serious questions need to be answered very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, there is the question as to how all of this happened.  How did these armaments get through?  Four boatloads got through and one boat was caught, not by our people but by the French authorities. Are we going to see an immediate review of security methods and procedures as is so badly needed?  Can we be told the result of the nationwide search, a very justified search it was?  Has it been called <Col N="820" /> off or will there be a follow-up?  If these arms are here no effort should be spared in tracking them down.  There should not be financial cutbacks and cutbacks on overtime, and a lack of effort should not hinder this exercise in national survival. There is a need immediately to allay the public disquiet which follows from this apparent confirmation yesterday of rumours which had been persistent.</P>
    <P>The second question raised by this is a question from which this Government persistently shy away.  That is the question of our relationship with Libya.  There was a full debate in Fine Gael time on this before Christmas.  The Government on that occasion, and the Government's spokespersons, were apologetic and defensive.  Yet the evidence is clear, and has been clear for a very long time, that Libya has been interfering on an unprecedented extraordinary scale in the internal affairs of this country, breaching our sovereignty in the most blatant way imaginable.  It is doing this, by providing the material of war, material which gives the possibility of death and destruction on a massive and hitherto unimaginable scale.  We are it appears, a pawn in Ghadaffi's ongoing struggle with Britain, a pawn which is allowing the enemies of the Irish poeple, the Provisional IRA, to be armed in a way which has never happened before.  The evidence that this is happening is clear.  The evidence is that the enemies of the Irish people are being armed by another sovereign state to carry out warfare against the people of this island, the very people whom all parties claim to want to see united together in some form of political and fraternal union.  How much more evidence do we need before our Government take action on this matter?  It was embarrassing to sit through the debate here before Christmas when the Government refused to make clear their attitude to Libya in explicit terms.  Mealy mouthed, unworthy excuses were trotted out by people who should and did know better, as they made their lame excuses here that evening.</P>
    <P>I am asking now that we do either one of two things, but let us not have this <Col N="821" /> ambiguity, this so called pragmatism which seems to dominate all Government thinking at present.  Either we, as all groups, except Fianna Fáil, called for in this House before Christmas, break off diplomatic relations immediately with Libya as an indication of the revulsion and the disgust of the majority of people in this country over that country's continuing interference or else, if we have a special relationship with Libya, which some people seem to think we have, or if there is some sort of friendship between the Leaders of the two countries, then let our Government mount a diplomatic onslaught, straight away, aimed at persuading Colonel Gadaffi from his murderous ways as far as this country is concerned, and aimed at reversing the policy of that Government towards this country.  For a sovereign proud independent State, as we claim to be, it is intolerable that there is this continuing persistent murderous interference in the internal affairs of both parts of this island.</P>
    <P>The third consequence of what is happening, however, is the most frightening of all.  If these arms are here and if they are not apprehended, the whole scale of our political problem changes.  We will then be in a situation of almost total warfare in at least one part of this island but possibly over the island as a whole. We will be in a situation where internment may be the least draconian of the options open to the Governments North and South.  We will be in a situation where no type of political dialogue or progress of any sort is possible.  That is the enormity of the threat which now faces the authorities and the people in both parts of this country.  In speaking as I do, I am not being alarmist.  I am voicing the very real fears of a large number of people who are asking for Government clarification on this matter.</P>
    <P>On Government policy, over the past year or so since the Government took office, in the short time available to me I would like to come back to some of the points which were made by the first two speakers in this debate.  As things have operated on a day to day basis, this Government have done very little that is <Col N="822" /> wrong, as far as the carrying out of policy in relation to Northern Ireland is concerned. The problem with this Government is that their whole position lacks any bedrock of credibility or any sense that the Government actually believe in the principle underlying the carrying out of the present policy.  This is a serious flaw.  It is evident to the most hardline groups on both sides in Northern Ireland who do not see the same level of commitment to the present policies that was there in the time of Dr. Garret FitzGerald and Dick Spring during the last administration.  The Leader of the House talked with a certain amount of pride about Fianna Fáil's pragmatic approach. That is exactly what is wrong.  Because, for pragmatic, one can write &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; or &ldquo;ambiguous.&rdquo;  In Fianna Fáil speech what pragmatic means is that they have the capacity to oppose in Opposition, policies which they will then take up and seek to apply in Government.  Over the last few years, Fianna Fáil took a number of very definite stands on Northern Ireland. They attempted to hijack the majority report of the New Ireland Forum.  They opposed, and opposed vehemently, the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Fianna Fáil had no dialogue over the last number of years before they came to power with the mainstream political parties in Northern Ireland.  They had ceased to speak to the Alliance Party, they had ceased to speak to all but one section of the SDLP, they were not speaking to the Unionists.  They was no dialogue whatsoever during all that time.</P>
    <P>Over the past two, three or four years it has been clear that whatever conviction there was in Fianna Fáil on Northern Ireland was an adherence to the old ways, to what others of us would see, and see with sincerity, as being the old shilboleths, the old clichés, the old slogans, which served well in the past but which never had to be put to the test of analysis, which never had to be subjected to ways and means, which never reached forward to ask the question, &ldquo;What do you mean by Irish Unity?  How do you, in reality, accommodate the new minority groups? <Col N="823" /> How do you guarantee you can safeguard rights?  How do you spell all of this out?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These hard questions, such as even the costing of Irish unity, were all skipped away from and we were told blithely that all would be well on the day, at this great All-Ireland Constitutional Conference where all sides would sit down.  At that stage, Fianna Fáil would put everything on the table.  That was, I am afraid, a cop-out.  It was a substitute for a hard thought out policy and it gave that party the luxury and the option of using Northern Ireland as a pawn in the domestic politics of this State, where every single initiative over the past four years was fought and opposed tooth and nail.</P>
    <P>Now we find Fianna Fáil, in Government, seeking to put into effect the very policies they so vehemently opposed.  In Government, Fianna Fáil have worked the Anglo-Irish Agreement, though with none of the passion or the commitment of Peter Barry, Garret FitzGerald, Alan Dukes and Dick Spring.  They have worked it, not out of conviction but simply because there was no alternative, because public opinion would be outraged if the Anglo-Irish Agreement were interfered with or an attempt made to scrap it.  They had to work it because their parliamentary support would collapse.  It is one issue which would unite all of the Opposition groups in the other House if there was any attempt made to collapse the Anglo-Irish Agreement but it has been worked without generosity or without conviction.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong feeling among many people who do not want Northern Ireland to be an issue of party politics in either Houses in this State, who want as far as possible to get as wide a degree of consensus as to what needs to be done in Northern Ireland as possible, that it is no longer a matter of importance.  There is a strong feeling both in this House and outside it that once again &mdash; and indeed much was tacitly admitted by the Leader of the Government in this statement &mdash; that the Northern Ireland question has once again been put on the back burner, that it is no longer a matter of immediacy <Col N="824" /> or importance, that containment, pragmatism or whatever, is the name of the game.  If that is so, then I believe that this Government are being not just cynical &mdash; that we could live with &mdash; but they are losing a great opportunity to make progress.</P>
    <P>I believe that, as never before, the vast majority of people in this country are sick and tired of what they see as prating and as slogans and as shaping up.  The vast majority of people would support a policy which put aside gradiose goals, which put aside posturing and had as a subjective anything which would work towards making possible genuine dialogue among the major political groups in Northern Ireland and the establishment of any set of institutions within Northern Ireland which would be acceptable to the people there, which would bring about a genuine polity in that part of this island.</P>
    <P>Six or seven years ago, for politicians from mainstream parties to say that and to have that as a major objective, perhaps the major objective over the next decade or two decades, would perhaps be tantamount to heresy.  Today, the vast majority of people would be happy if that were the objective which could be attained.  What I am saying is that public opinion is almost certainly way ahead of the official Fianna Fáil line.  Indeed, there are many Fianna Fáil who will say in private that the official line is way behind them.</P>
    <P>People here do not want to be an impediment to a solution in Northern Ireland, an impediment either by holding out and fuelling expectations among Northern Nationalists which we cannot be able to deliver on, nor do we want to be an impediment through frightening Unionists about things in which we only half believe, things which we cannot realise and things which we know to be so.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that the questions asked by the first two speakers in this debate are the questions to which I want answers.  I want answers to them in good faith but, most of all, I would appeal to the Government to work the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the spirit in which that <Col N="825" /> agreement was conceived.  If they do, they will have the backing of the vast majority of people in this country.  I ask them to listen to the ordinary people of Northern Ireland, not to be influenced by what the traditional supporters of their own party may well want from a part of Ireland that probably they have never been to and know only vaguely, but listen to what the people on all sides in Northern Ireland are saying.  What the ordinary people are saying is that they want political institutions within Northern Ireland, institutions which will work.  If we got that far, then I am quite certain that better relations with the South, and eventually some form of unity, will come about.  That sort of unity is the only unity which is worth having on this island.</P>

      <P>I do not have much to say on this subject, but I have not heard anything this afternoon that will convince me that the Government do not have a commitment at this moment to the progressing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. We heard of lack of passion from one speaker and yet we were advised by another to keep a low profile, in fact, to say nothing.  We would appear to have a further suggestion, that we should ignore the subject and it will go away altogether. Of course, that is not the style of this party and it never has been.  That anybody would suggest in this House from any side that we should drop the legitimate aspiration of the majority of the people of this island that is the cornerstone of our Constitution absolutely astounds me.  Nothing has happened and nothing has convinced me in this debate this afternoon that such should be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With analysis of the current situation in the North of Ireland, we have to ask ourselves, did the present crisis, the crisis of the last 18 or 19 years, evolve because of what has been suggested here today is an unsustainable territorial claim over the Six Counties of this country?  I suggest it did not.  It came about because of very basic deprivation of human rights, the type of deprivation we can see on our television screens every night on the West <Col N="826" /> Bank and in the Gaza Strip and we are appalled that the Palestinian people are being deprived of fundamental human rights.  These are the very same type of acts that we saw played out on our screens in connection with this country in 1969 and 1970.  It was not a debate on the streets about a grandiose, mystical, territorial claim that we have over the Six Counties.  It was a cry from the heart of a deprived people for very basic, fundamental human rights.  The majority of the people of this country subscribe to a concept that some time in the future, let it be two centuries away, the people of this country, legitimately aspire to unifying this whole island by peaceful means.</P>
    <P>This present crisis did not spring, as I said, from that claim, but had a very very different reason altogether.  We saw that, not a thousand years ago people in that part of this country did not even have a vote, where they could not even have a human rights march without being harassed by the forces of the State, not just by rednecks but by people in uniform representing the Government of the North of Ireland, not even the British Government but the police force of the North of Ireland.  These are the kind of things the people of the North of Ireland, of Ulster, rose up against in 1969.  It was not to reunify this country but it was because, as I have said at the outset, the people could look with some degree of confidence to us.  This party particularly but the other major parties, too, subscribe to the concept of the ultimate unity of this island.  As a party we did not walk away from the situation in 1969-70 and neither will we walk away from the situation that has subsequently evolved.  We have to thank the last Government for the trojan efforts they made in advancing the debate.</P>
    <P>Maybe there were people in my party and organisation who did not agree with every line and every scintilla of what was agreed but prior to the last election the Leader of our party made his position quite clear and the election was fought on that basis.  I am a little disappointed to hear that people are now suggesting that we do not have a commitment in this <Col N="827" /> regard.  I did not hear one example this afternoon of a lack of commitment to the progression of that agreement.  Maybe the emphasis is changed in some areas but I still fail to see an example of where any opportunity has been lost in our efforts to advance that legitimate forum of debate that has now been established. I would not like to think that the debate was the preserve or the monopoly of Fine Gael and Labour because the debate that took place prior to Sunningdale took place by virtue of overtures from our party and was progressed by the Coalition Government who came into office in 1973.  Let us not suggest for a moment that there was no Fianna Fáil input into the advancement of legitimate debate between the major partners in this dispute. Fianna Fáil most definitely had a legitimate input but, as I have said, the emphasis might have been somewhat different.</P>
    <P>We cannot lose sight of the fact that many people still subscribe to what has been referred to here today as very fundamental and bedrock republicanism. Tragically a lot of this has become quite misguided but we cannot ignore it.  It is not going to go away.  I am rather disappointed that people appear by innuendo to suggest, for example, that John Hume should not have spoken to Gerry Adams.  I would be much more disconcerted if he was not prepared to talk to him.  Surely we have reached the ultimate impasse if dialogue is denied between any of the protagonists in this debate.  I congratulate John Hume on taking the initiative.  It cannot have been easy for the SDLP given the kind of harassment they have been subjected to at election time and so on by Sinn Féin.  The facts are that they are still prepared to talk and at least when you talk there is hope.</P>
    <P>On behalf of this side of the House I am suggesting quite clearly that if people can produce evidence to the effect that the Government lack commitment to the pursuing of legitimate debate between the main parties in this dispute, they should do so.  I agree with Senator Ross's <Col N="828" /> suggestion that we should have an all-Ireland debate and an all-Ireland referendum on whether the majority of people still subscribe to a united Ireland. I have no doubt that if such a referendum was held the result would be a most emphatic and very sizeable yes.  If the day ever comes when people in this or the other House, propagate that kind of mentality &mdash; I will not go so for as to say Quisling mentality &mdash; the mentality that we should opt out, throw away the keys and say that the situation as it is in this country at present will remain for ever, I certainly will never subscribe to that point of view.  It is an anti-Irish disposition and I could not agree with it.  It is not the position of this party.  We will continue to aspire to a united Ireland.  Sixty years is a very short time in history as Professor Murphy more than anybody should know.  We should never deny the people the ultimate right to aspire to a united Ireland.</P>

      <P>The debate is very much retrospective.  We are having an inquest as to what has been happening during a period in history and there is a tendency to shy away from the harsh realities of dealing with a problem.  As well as every speaker in this House, I will be looking at this matter very subjectively. No matter how much we appear to take the objective view of the problem we are all too close to it to be in any sense objective.  I am sick and tired of listening to people who think they are experts on the North of Ireland.  I have yet to find such an expert.  Not only is there none in the South but neither is there any in the North.  The structure of society in both parts of this country does not allow for the sort of pluralist or broad view that is needed and that is where the problem begins.  Every speaker from the North or the South comes from some sort of ghetto-type background and therefore <Col N="829" /> they look with a very blinded or blinkered view at where the problems are and where they might be resolved.  It is a cant at this stage that the strength of any democracy can be judged or measured by the way in which it treats its minorities.</P>
      <P>I intend to spend the first five minutes of my time looking at how we came to be where we are today.  In dealing with this question of the despicable treatment of the minority in the North, we must take a close look at the despicable treatment of the minority groups on this side of the Border.  The minority in the North have suffered as have minority groups in the South but for different reasons.  It is time we had a close harsh look at that.  When I began to put my thoughts together on this issue.  I wrote on top of the page: &ldquo;Let us keep party politics out of this.&rdquo; But I must take up one point that the Leader of the House made in his statement. He said without a quiver: &ldquo;as true republicans...&rdquo; No word has been devalued or has deteriorated to the same level in the last short period of our history as the word &ldquo;republican&rdquo;.  It is time people began to understand that there is a major difference between being Nationalist and being republican.  There is nothing republican about denying rights to minority religions or supporting changes in our Constitution or legislation as has happened on two major occasions in the last six years which caused offence to minority groups and which deny them rights, as they would see them, that they might have in other groups, in other areas, in other states and under other jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with my colleague, Senator Murphy, in saying the he would not accept that we should have an aspiration towards a united Ireland.  It is quite legitimate and in order to have that aspiration. It is a fair and a just objective provided it is approached in a fair, just and honest way and there lies the nature of the problem.  We have refused to do that.  We talk securely from Dublin about those in the North who need protection but we have shown very little evidence that we are prepared to accommodate the cultural differences, the differences <Col N="830" /> of belief, the differences in religion and the differences in political aspirations in the North of Ireland.  In other words, we have not grasped the fact that the Presbyterian from Ballymena is as much an Irish person as is the Catholic from west Cork or from anywhere else.  This has not been accepted and the easiest way to see that is to watch the reaction from a group of Southern Irish people to an atrocity in the North of Ireland.  There is an amazing difference, depending on who it is has suffered at that particular point.  I would like to consider why it is that somebody who is baptised in a different church has therefore a different value from people from another church. It is totally unacceptable.  I think it is also unacceptable that we should allow our legislative process and our constitutional responsibilities to deteriorate into the panic politics we have seen over the years.  We have seen it recently, I have given my views on it before.  In the wake of Enniskillen we rushed through the Extradition Act.  In the wake of Birmingham on the far side of the water we rushed through the prevention of Terrorism Act and in the wake of the Dublin bombings, ten years earlier, we rushed through the Offences Against the State or the Criminal Justice Act, I forget which. They were all bad pieces of legisaltion put through in a rushed, ill-considered way, in a reactionary manner.  That has been the nature of our problem here.  We are attempting to find fire brigade type solutions to a problem that has simmered and developed over a long period and it can only be grappled with by taking a true republican aspiration for a pluralist State where there will be, above all else, tolerance and acceptance.</P>
    <P>There are only two issues in society whether it be Northern Ireland, Southern Ireland, North America or South America and they are peace and poverty.  I intend next week to develop those two particular areas in the light of finding a solution where we do not differ from people by virtue of which side of a partition they happen to be born on, in which church they happen to be baptised in, in which <Col N="831" /> hospital they happen to be born, in which housing estate they happen to live, in which schools they happen to go to or in which graveyards they happen to be buried.  The discrimination and the sort of womb-to-the-tomb discrimination and differences that are carefully fostered by interest groups in our society have to be addressed by us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you first of all for enabling me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister of State for being here.  I raise this matter for a number of reasons. We are talking of course about the programme or lack of programme for cervical smear testing and for breast examination for cancer in this country.  I raise the matter because I am very concerned that there has been a decrease in the number of outlets where cervical smear testing can be done.  This is a service which will suffer very badly and is suffering because of the health cutbacks. I raise it also because in the last Administration when I was Minister of State responsible for women's affairs I <Col N="832" /> realised that this service for women was one that required constant pressure.  I say to the Minister and to his Department that I found a very haphazard and patchy approach to this service.  Unless women's organisations or the Congress of Trade Unions or my office were constantly harassing the Department things fell by the wayside.  The cytology section in St. Luke's Hospital tended to have a terrible backlog of test results and it was very unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>The Department responsible for women's affairs are no longer there.  We are suffering health cutbacks and despite the fact that there are many doctors in the country and many personnel working in the various regional health departments who care about this, they are helpless. They are not able to do anything about the poor services being offered. The policy of the Department is something that worries me and sometimes I wonder whether the Minister's officials are not influenced by that guru in Trinity College who believes that none of these cancer testings should be done for women.  He has been getting greater and greater publicity recently in saying that it does not matter whether you test for cervical cancer or breast cancer, women will die anyway.  It is a very dispiriting approach and it is contrary to worldwide trends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the situation.  Women are being badly served at present by the service they are getting in the country. Most women are aware of the benefits of smear testing but few have availed of them.  This is illustrated by a European public opinion survey done in September 1987 on the prevention of cancer.  This showed that knowledge and awareness is very high among women but correspondingly the number of women who have availed of smear testing is very low. An example is that while 86 per cent of Irish women know about testing only 30 per cent have availed of it.  We have a high awareness level here but a low take-up. We can compare this with the take-up in other countries which is 45 per cent in Denmark, 46 per cent in Germany, 60 per cent in France, 61 per cent in <Col N="833" /> Luxembourg and 55 per cent in the UK. Ireland compares very unfavourably with those.  This is related to the fact that outside Dublin there are towns where there is no health centre providing cervical smear testing facilities, and similarly in such towns there are general practitioners who are not offering this service. That leaves women with no facility whatsoever unless they come to one of the family planning centres where they have to pay, in Dublin or in other big towns.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to focus some attention on this for a number of reasons. There was a recent Eastern Health Board report which showed that few women in the high risk groups come forward for cervical smear testing.  These high risk groups are women over 50 years and women in the lower socio-economic groups.  Because 1988 is the Europe Against Cancer Year and the EC is launching a code against cancer in the week 1 to 7 May next which will result in a great demand for screening services, this should be matched with good back-up facilities.  There should be information, availability of screening services and a good, fast system for giving the results of these screen tests.</P>
    <P>I am very unhappy with the general approach of the Department of Health in this area.  I would like to quote some recommendations from the Eastern Health Board report on the availability of cervical testing.  The recommendations they made were that a national committee should be appointed and charged with organising an effective programme for cervical cancer control.  It should be specifically organised as a public health centre control programme directed towards a significant reduction in mortality from cervical cancer.  The committee should engage a community physician as director who would be responsible for the day-to-day organisation of a screening programme and also would be accountable for its delivery.</P>
    <P>A well organised laboratory service for reporting on smears must be provided. Information systems must be such as to <Col N="834" /> enable satisfactory monitoring and evalu-tiaon of the scheme.  A specially designed education programme is essential and it should be directed at the high risk groups. Cervical screening tests must be made widely available through family doctors, hospitals, clinics, and information linkage is essential.  They make in all 12 or 13 recommendations and I am quite sure that the Minister of State is familiar with these.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about health prevention and a measure that has a proven record.  In other countries, notably Sweden and Norway, cervical cancer has been virtually eliminated because of a realistic national screening policy over the last ten to 15 years.  At present we know that this cancer is affecting younger women because there is now a more aggressive virus around and that early cervical cancer is related to earlier sexually activity.  It is preventable.  Cervical cancer can be detected in its preinvasion stage and treated successfully.  A major handicap in the establishment of a successful cervical screening service is the dearth of information on the existing services and its clients.  While figures are available regarding the number of smears tested during 1986, it is difficult to ascertain the actual number of individuals who were screened for cervical cancer that year.  There is no proper record.</P>
    <P>I want this problem addressed because it is unreal and it is not even good health policy that we do not know exactly what is happening or what is available in various parts of the country.  We are not involved here with some new and untested medical technique.  We are talking about an established process that can save lives.  I suggest that the Minister of State should not be thinking at present about initiating any more studies or setting up any more task forces or committees.  They are delaying tactics and allow the Minister of State and his Department to sit on the fence on this issue.</P>
    <P>That is what is happening in the related health area of breast cancer screening.  In this country around 574 women per year die of breast cancer.  Yet, mammography, which is an X-ray of the <Col N="835" /> breast, has been established as an important detection tool by doctors worldwide. I refer particularly to the Forrest report, produced by Sir Patrick Forrest of the University of Edinburgh last year.  It stated:</P>
    <P>There is now unequivocal evidence that screening &mdash; using a technique of X-raying the breasts called mammography &mdash; could reduce deaths from breast cancer by about a third, possibly more.  About 13,000 women in Britain die from this disease every year.</P>
    <P>This benefit clearly is evident only in women over the age of 50.  Current studies need more time before they will establish how useful it is to screen younger women.</P>
    <P>Doctors are not yet sure how often a woman should have mammography &mdash; perhaps once a year, perhaps once every three years.  Further studies will provide the answers.</P>
    <P>That report which was drawn up by a UK working group on breast cancer screening, which was chaired by Sir Patrick Forrest, has come out with very valuable evidence for all of us.  Health Ministers in Britain have accepted its main conclusions and are now implementing a screening programme.</P>
    <P>I know that the Department of Health's response to requests for action on this issue perhaps will be to say that this work requires precision machinery and carefully trained personnel.  As far as I know, that was the response to a question in the Dáil.  Of course, it does. It is right and proper that we should have the best precision machinery and well trained personnel but this equipment is not outlandishly expensive to buy or the staff impossible to find.  I do not think it is good enough to say that these are prerequisites.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that we do not have even one centre which carries out a proper breast screening programme of women of 50 years and over and this despite the fact that there is conclusive evidence in the United States, Sweden, Holland and now in Britain to show that <Col N="836" /> mammography screening properly done on women over 50 can save lives.  The estimated cost of screening women every two years, starting at the age of 50 and continuing until the age of 70, is about £120 per individual.  That is the cost as outlined in the Forrest report.</P>
    <P>I accept that the financial situation in this country does not allow a service such as the one which exists in England.  Of course, I accept we cannot have screening programmes.  I would very much like to have them but we cannot have screening programmes for breast cancer nationwide. A start should be made by having at least one centre with one programme. I suggest that if we continue with the kind of policies that are being put forward for women's health in these particular areas, we will be left very far behind in new techniques for preventive health for women.  I suggest that the Government should have a role in this area.  As I have illustrated, we are way down the league in either European or worldwide statistics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my appreciation to Senator Fennell for raising this matter and her views will be carefully noted by the officials of my Department.  Over the past few decades health professionals have been placing increasing emphasis on the scope for preventing cancer.  On the basis of current statistics, it appears that about one-third of the deaths from cancer are due to smoking tobacco, while another third appears to be from dietary factors.  In 1986, more than 400 women died from cancer of the lung.  One of the most effective ways to prevent lung cancer is to encourage people to stop smoking.  The causes of cancer of the cervix and the breast have not yet been identified but the early onset of the disease can be detected by screening programmes.  I am very much aware of the anxiety and concern felt by women regarding cervical cancer and breast cancer and I welcome this opportunity to talk about the importance and efficacy of screening programmes for these serious illnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1986, there were 58 reported deaths <Col N="837" /> from cancer of the cervix.  The PAP smear test is recognised as a reliable method of testing for carcinoma of the cervix.  Under existing arrangements, a woman may avail of a smear test through her general practitioner, at clinics organised by health boards, maternity hospitals and family planning clinics.  A diagnostic laboratory service is available at several hospitals throughout the country.  To clarify one point raised by Senator Fennell, the laboratory service for smear testing at St. Luke's Hospital was suspended last year for a few months to clear a backlog but it is now open again and working normally.  More than 135,000 smears were examined in laboratories in 1986.  The service is available without charge to women who are exempt from charges under the Health (Out-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987.</P>
    <P>Cervical screening is available at present to any woman who wishes to have a smear test.  Other countries have gone further and provided a comprehensive screening service for all women or those most at risk of contracting the disease. An Eastern Health Board Report on Cancer of the Uterine Cervix, prepared in 1986, suggests that the nature of the disease in Ireland is similar to that reported in international studies.  These studies have shown a greater incidence of cervical cancer among women from lower income groups, older women and women of high parity.</P>
    <P>I am of course, anxious to ensure that the cervical screening programme is utilised properly by women most at risk from the illness.  The failure of the British cervical screening programme to reduce signifantly deaths from cancer of the cervix since its inception suggests that a great deal of thought must be given to ensuring that women most at risk from the disease will be encouraged to come forward for testing.</P>
    <P>A study of current arrangements for cervical screening is at present being undertaken by the Faculty of Community Medicine of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland on behalf of the Department of Health.  The objectives of the project are:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> 1.  To review the present organisation of services by addressing such questions as where services are currently being provided, and by whom, what, if any, is the target population, what are the characteristics of the population utilising the service, and what resources are being devoted to the service.</P>
    <P>2.  To evaluate the service against the criteria suggested for a successful screening service.</P>
    <P>The project is funded by my Department and is expected to be completed in June of this year.  The question of a comprehensive screening service will be reviewed in the light of the recommendations emanating from this study.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Minister for Health has established a working group representative of medical and administrative experts in the field.  I appreciate Senator Fennell's views on the various reports but we felt it was necessary to establish the working group with the following terms of reference:</P>
    <P>&mdash;to examine the current arrangements for the taking and analysis of cervical smears;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to recommend how current arrangements can be improved to deal satisfactorily with the present workload;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to identify the target population and optimum frequency of screening for an efficient and cost effective cervical screening programme for this country and to recommend how such a programme be developed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has requested that the working group report as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Breast cancer is a signficant source of morbidity and mortality.  In 1986, 574 women died from the disease.  Women most at risk from breast cancer are those aged 50 and over, those with a family history of breast cancer and women with a previous cancer episode in a breast.  The disease is associated with considerable trauma and distress, particularly when treatment involved mastectomy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> The purpose of a breast cancer screening programme is to detect breast cancer at an early pre-invasive stage.  Screening methods include self-examination, clinical examination and mammography. Recent international studies have suggested that mammography as a screening strategy is beneficial to women over 50 years of age in terms of reduced mortality and gains in life expectancy.  Mammography is available in this country in a number of hospitals.  At present, however, mammography in Ireland is used largely as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or worried women and, in some cases, for at risk women.  However, self-examination is vitally important.  General practitioners and the public should be made aware of the fact that the mammography service is available to all in all health board areas, with the exception of the Midland Health Board area which is close to the Dublin hospitals.</P>
    <P>As a member of the European Community, Ireland is involved in the Community's &ldquo;Europe Against Cancer&rdquo; programme for 1987-1989.  In the <i>Europe Against Cancer Programme, Proposal for a Plan of Action 1987-1989</i> it is stated that in the majority of the countries of the European Community there is a lack of equipment and specialised staff, and because of this, systematic mammography is a long term objective in many countries.  A survey carried out last year into the attitudes of Europeans to cancer prevention found that while 58 per cent of those surveyed were aware of the value of mammography, only 13 per cent had actually had mammography.</P>
    <P>As some of you will be aware, the report of the United Kingdom working party on screening for breast cancer was published last year.  The remit of the working party was to make policy recommendations with respect to breast cancer screening and the place of mammography and to consider the implications of their implementation.  The British Government have accepted the proposals in the report and have decided to implement a national breast cancer screening service which will provide for screening every <Col N="840" /> three years for all women aged between 50 and 64 throughout the United Kingdom.  We will in this country be looking at the results of this programme with great interest.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that early diagnosis is important in the successful management of this disease but medical opinion is not yet completely agreed as to the efficacy and reliability of mammography as a means of mass screening.  This is because the yield from mammography screening programmes is dependent on the type of equipment used and the expertise of staff carrying out the technique.  As mammography facilities are relatively new to this country, it has not been possible to carry out any random controlled trials to evaluate the facilities.  The question of developing the existing service as a screening service will, therefore, have to take into account the outcome of further studies, the outcome of the new programme in Britain and the availability of resources for such a programme in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my appreciation to Senator Fennell for raising this important matter.  The more publicity generated about early detection the better.  I should like to assure Senators that the Department are aware of the problems in this area and that, within the limited resources available to us, it will be given greater emphasis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the mammography he spoke of is not generally available, that it is only for referral cases with symptoms?  Is he aware that it costs in the region of £75? We are not talking about something that is readily available.  Will the Minister agree to establish a pilot scheme associated with one of the programmes in order to keep in tandem with what is happening in other countries?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>GPs can refer patients for mammography.  I agree that a pilot scheme would be worthwhile but it is important to point out that self-examination has been found to be most effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is useful but at the end of the day mammography is the best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>A patient cannot be referred for this screening unless there are some indications of cancer.  The earlier cancer can be detected the better. We should encourage those in the high <Col N="842" /> risk category to have the test.  Mammography may not be well known and we will endeavour to publicise it.  We will also consider a pilot scheme, as suggested by the Senator.</P>
