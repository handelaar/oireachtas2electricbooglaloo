      <P>I have notice from Senator David Norris that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The condition of the Turner Glass-houses at the Botanical Gardens in Glasnevin.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Philip Hogan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to examine the serious consequences that her proposed change in the pupil-teacher ratio will have on the pupils and staff of Tullow community school, County Carlow.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford of the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the reduction of the annual State grants to the community development association, Muintir na Tíre, the need for funding to be provided from the national lottery.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Gerry Reynolds of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to establish a wood pulp factory in County Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> I also received notice from Senator Joe Doyle of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Energy to implement in full the recommendations of the Cremer and Warner report.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Nuala Fennell of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Government to clarify the current position of the National Social Service Board and to reaffirm its commitment to the future full functioning of the board.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Pascal Mooney of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to seek an explanation from the British authorities of the incident at Leeds-Bradford Airport, when a leading Irish cultural representative (name supplied) was forced to enter his name in English on a landing card and the implications of this incident for other Irish citizens using British provincial airports and seaports.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The rapidly deteriorating ophthalmic services in the South Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Hogan, Bradford, Reynolds, Doyle, Norris, Fennell, Mooney and Bulbulia as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Norris' Motion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senators Hogan, Bradford, Reynolds, Doyle, Fennell, Mooney and Bulbulia may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.  Senator David Norris on the Adjournment of the House this evening. The Leader of the House on the Order of Business, Senator Lanigan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would consider making time available, perhaps tomorrow after the all-party motion on AIDS, to discuss the recent and very disturbing development in Northern Ireland along the Border over the past number of days and, indeed, to have &mdash; I know we have had one recently, but events are moving very rapidly &mdash; a general limited discussion on recent events in Anglo-Irish relations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to ask the same question and to support what Senator Manning has said.  In doing so I have to add that, unfortunately, I cannot be here tomorrow.  Because of that I take this opportunity to congratulate the Taoiseach on the statesmanship which he demonstrated in his address to the Ard-Fheis last weekend.  We are going through a particularly difficult period in <Col N="1666" /> Ireland and may I say it is vital that somebody can hold the line because if we&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I add one last thing, a Chathaoirligh?  The present situation is being exacerbated by the release of Private Thain.  This opportunity should be taken to discuss and debate clemency, amnesty and repatriation in an equitable fashion.  Please, a Chathaoirligh, listen to me, because it is very likely that this thing will be hyped up and Anglo-Irish relationships in this island will become worse.  We should be developing what we have obtained and trying to increase our understanding and so, let us approach this in the constructive manner in which the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>You could have come as my partner if I had known.  I should like to endorse what Senator Manning has said and to ask for a full-blown debate on Anglo-Irish relations.  I asked for this a <Col N="1667" /> little while ago.  Senator Robb has underlined the fact that there are very strong feelings in this House which we cannot express at the moment because we have not got a formal procedure for doing so. Again, because of the crisis, it would be appropriate if the Leader of the House would give us some time for a debate on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind Senators, and particularly my colleagues on the far side of the House, that we circulated a memorandum on decorum within the House and in particular on the Order of Business.  The applause in the House today is to be deplored and I am sure you will go along with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Manning's suggestion if only to reveal that the House will by no means be unanimous on what is happening at present and if only to reduce the empty rhetoric that is going around at present about Anglo-Irish relations.  May I also deprecate the increasing habit of Senators who have strong lungs and who have inadequate manners to shout their way through the Order of Business totally against the ruling of the Chair?  The thing is becoming absolutely chaotic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the request by Senator Manning for a debate on or discussion of Anglo-Irish relations particularly in the light of recent events.  A number of us would wish to have an opportunity to participate in a debate in this House on the issue.  In particular I would like to refer back to the Anglo-Irish Agreement which was signed, to the expectations of that time, and to the reality of where we are now, not in a negative sense, I may say, but in the hope that we can be constructive about how to make progress towards peace and reconciliation on this island. There are extremely important issues that we can and should discuss.  The views of this House on those issues would be of <Col N="1668" /> value and significance at this point and I hope we will have that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Robb's request for a discussion on this very important matter.  This is a forum and a very important forum and many people would like to express themselves. If they are denied the opportunity to speak on something that is of vital importance to all of us, I think the debate takes place in a less controlled atmosphere and, as a result, reports from meetings and results go out and the wrong impression is given.  People are misquoted. I urge strongly that we should give time to the matter Senator Robb has raised.  It is appropriate that the Seanad should discuss the real crisis we have in many areas in the North at the moment. All too often we have to listen to people who have a misinformed view and sometimes they are the people who get to the media and get the light of publicity.  I urge support for Senator Robb's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House, first of all, what has happened to the Adoption (No. 2) Bill?  We have waited and waited.  I shall have to propose that this House order the Adoption (No. 2) Bill at a very early date, next week or the week after.  We did not get an explanation for the disgraceful delay on this issue.  May I say also that I support the wishes of my colleagues for a debate on Anglo-Irish relations, or what is left of them, because of the fact that these matters should always be debated first within the Oireachtas?  While I do not have a great regard for the mother of Parliaments &mdash; as it describes itself &mdash; in our nearest neighbouring country, they have established a remarkable tradition where Ministers make their statements on any material issue first in Parliament. It is regrettable that we do not emulate that.  I fully agree with Senator Murphy's remarks that there is an enormous amount of empty rhetoric about Northern Ireland but I would say that not all of the empty rhetoric emanates from one side of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not madly enthusiastic about a debate on Northern Ireland at this time for this reason: I believe that any such debate now would be very, very emotional.  We may get all the feeling that has built up over the years and this will not help Anglo-Irish relations, or help the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The other reason I do not think it should be discussed at this time is that the Protestant people in the North of Ireland have been given an opportunity now to come and talk to the Taoiseach.  That could well be put in jeopardy by any emotional outbursts which might emanate here, because the debates will not be reported exactly as they take place.  They will be reported as interpreted.  That could lead to more trouble.  There is ample opportunity for us to discuss the question of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the improvement of it.  If we get into the middle of something and the emotion builds up we can do more harm than good.  I emphasise the fact that the Protestant people are outside of this and they are a majority.  Their point of view must be heard before anyone else starts raising the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair point.  Could I&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You have spoken before, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>One simple point.  I go along with what Senator Harte has said in the hope that it might be possible to arrange any discussion there is on a day on which I might be present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to make a contribution on the Order of Business but as we are having a debate on Northern Ireland &mdash; half of the debate has now taken place &mdash; I do not think it is altogether correct for Senator Harte to say that for the first time the gate is open to the Protestant people.  In the four years the Coalition Government were in office it was open to them.  The New Ireland Forum was set up and they were invited to contribute which they refused to do.  I hope that door will always be kept open <Col N="1670" /> but it is not open now for the first time and it is an incorrect impression to give here.  If the Leader of the House can give time for a debate I would have great&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume Senator McMahon means what he said &mdash; you are having the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have great confidence in the Members of this House using language which would not interfere in any way with any moves being made towards reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  We should have a debate here. It is quite correct that many things have been said outside, at private and public meetings, and we could easily give a lead in the right direction here.  I would have great confidence that Members of this House would not use language which would in any way interfere with any efforts being made to bring about an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I also ask the Leader of the House to consider a debate of this nature?  Like Senator McMahon, I had not intended to say anything but I agree with Senator McMahon that the Members of this House of all sides have always adopted a very responsible, mature attitude towards any debate on any issue.  It is churlish, but then again unfortunately typical of Senator Murphy that he should introduce a note of acrimony into what is a very serious, sensitive area for this country.  We should at least show not only to our own people but to the world in general that we in this House are representatives and custodians of democratic principles and that when it comes to serious debates of this nature we can discuss matters in a serious and restrained way, which is what is called for at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really a question.  I was wondering would it be appropriate to congratulate Senator Mooney on having become a father on Monday night when his wife, Sheila, gave birth to a baby girl, Marie?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it arises on the Order of Business whether Senator Mooney has a daughter or son.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also like the idea that we should have a debate and if we are to have it we should have it on a day that would suit Senator Robb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a note about Senator David Norris.  I am not sure whether I was to reply to something he said or that he was making a comment. If he had a question I will answer it, if I can, afterwards.  The main question is that of the debate on Northern Ireland. Senators Manning, Ross, Robb, Mooney, Murphy, McGowan, Farrell, Robinson, O'Toole and Ryan all spoke on this.  I have no objection to having a debate here on the situation in the Anglo-Irish sphere at present.  I do not think tomorrow would be the appropriate day to have it.  I suggest that we should have a debate at an early date.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons why I do not think it should be held tomorrow. There is a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference today: there is a meeting tomorrow; another meeting and a statement next Tuesday.  I suggest that after next Tuesday that we can set an early date for the debate.  Unfortunately, it would appear that Thursday does not suit Senator Robb but Government business will be taken on Wednesday next.  Unless we can come to some arrangement to suit Senator Robb, it would seem as if the debate will have to take place on a Thursday. However, we will have a talk with Senator Robb and see if we can arrange a date that will suit him and the Minister. There is no point in having Senator Robb here if we do not have the Minister here. There is no point in having a debate if we do not have a reply from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, I signified to the House last week that the reason for the delay has nothing to do with tardiness on the Government's part, that there are very difficult constitutional matters to be dealt with before this Bill comes before the House.  These constitutional matters <Col N="1672" /> have just about been eliminated and it is hoped that the Bill will be taken at a very early stage.  I am not saying it will be next week; it could be the week after.  The Bill will be taken in the near future.  I do not think any other question was asked.  I do not know exactly what Senator Norris was referring to.</P>

    <P>The purpose to this Motion is to allow <Col N="1673" /> the Joint Sitting next Friday to be broadcast live on TV subject to the existing arrangments that apply to radio broadcasts in respect of broadcasting material and to allow French to be officially recorded in the Official Report.  When the main Motion providing for the Joint Sitting was being passed last Thursday, I mentioned that the motion now before the House would be necessary.  Details of the Joint Sitting are to be finalised at a meeting of the group leaders later today and are basically the same as those which pertained for the last Joint Sitting. Senators will be notified by the Clerk of the arrangements later today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask, in this context, who actually has the ownership of the video tapes of this speech?  Is it the House, the Committee on Procedures and Privileges, or RTE?  A matter of this nature will obviously receive worldwide attention.  The tapes will be available for transmission in countries outside of this jurisdiction which, of course, means there will be cost involved.  I am curious to know who actually holds the ownership of video tapes of House proceedings?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course everybody agrees with this motion.  Is it not time that we came out of the 19th century and did not have to have a special motion before the House every time television is referred to?  The fact that we have to pass special motions to allow the most important medium of communication to record the proceedings of either House of the Oireachtas seems to me to be as much an indictment of our own apparent determination to make ourselves as irrelevant as possible as anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion is most welcome but can we not decide quickly that we recognise that the late 20th century can acknowledge television as a medium of communication which does not have to be specially introduced for special occasions with special permission?  It is the medium of communication of the late 20th century. We should be using it, not sort of <Col N="1674" /> defensively protecting ourselves from it most of the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call the Leader of the House who might like to reply, I may say we are discussing this at the moment in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges &mdash; television in the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; and I would think that if it is agreed to or not agreed to you will not have it appearing on the Order of Business.  I feel that is the answer to what the Senator has just said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question, in future whenever this debate is aired on the media you, a Chathaoirligh, as the representative of this House, should take the opportunity to indicate the wishes of the House to the media.  The most recent media attention devoted to this issue had the Government Chief Whip discussing matters in this House and I felt that in the circumstances, with the greatest respect to the Government Chief Whip, it should be the Cathaoirleach who should discuss these matters as they pertain to this Chamber.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>RTE own the tapes.  The matter of broadcasting or authorising the broadcasting does not arise in any way because of the fact that we do not allow television normally.  This is to authorise live radio and television broadcasting of a particular item.  It has nothing to do with any future arrangements that may be made regarding the broadcasting or non-broadcasting on a regular basis of the Seanad proceedings.  That would be a matter for new rules.

      <P>I have circulated &mdash; because sometimes there is confusion in these cases &mdash; a list of Government amendments and the groupings of the amendments.  Having been on the floor of the House myself I realise that one may become bogged down, and if anybody is confused regarding the amendments being taken together, please ask me or use the lists.  We will deal with it as we go along.  We are now on section 48.</P>

      <P>Before we begin, I would like to make a general point about the amendments we have before us today.  I certainly do not want to be difficult or obstructive but the progress of this Bill into the House and through the House has been quite unorthodox and most unusual.  The Bill was published.  It was introduced into this House.  There was a very long, detailed Second Stage debate on the Bill.  During the course of that debate the Minister invited outside submissions.  This is highly unusual.  This is normally done before a Bill is published.</P>
      <P>There is a certain element of discourtesy to this House in the way in which this has happened because submissions have been made to a Bill which was published and debated in this House.  If that was to be done the submissions should have been filtered through an Oireachtas committee where those of us who were involved with the Bill would have had access to what was happening.  We would have seen the submissions and we could have evaluated them.  That did not happen.  The submissions were made to the Minister privately, something which normally happens before a Bill is actually published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously the large number of Government amendments which we have before us today and the next day are the result of these very detailed submissions made by outside groups after the publication of the original Bill.  It would be fair to the House if the Minister &mdash; perhaps not straight away because he may not be prepared for this &mdash; were to report to us on the submissions made to him <Col N="1676" /> since we last discussed this Bill and the points which have been taken on board in response to various pressure groups or interested groups in this matter.</P>

      <P>I dislike interrupting anybody.  What you have said would be more appropriate on Fifth Stage.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Senator's concern. I do not think he has anything to worry about.  This Bill has 189 sections.  There are some 42 sections in Part IV of the Bill.  We have 66 amendments to 42 sections.  The Bill was first published in January 1987.  Some 60 interest groups submitted their suggestions and proposals after the Minister's invitation.</P>
      <P>All of this points to one simple thing, that this is major legislation.  It is extremely complex.  We have come forward today with many amendments from the Government side as a direct result of what the Seanad told us the last day we discussed it.  If there was any discourtesy in continuing with outside submissions that is regretted.  The only purpose is to ensure that we get this Bill right.  This is not a political Bill from the Government's point of view.  It is a Bill on which we want the maximum amount of assistance from this House and the other House.  The reality is that it has been knocking around since January 1987 and was the subject of much political debate before that time.  It has been around for a long time; it is time we moved on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to get a balance into the Bill between the needs of business and the needs of other interests in the business. I appreciate the Senator's concern, but there is nothing underhand or unusual about it.  Submissions are made. They are published by interest groups. They appear in the newspapers.  Almost anybody who would make a submission <Col N="1677" /> to the Department would almost always issue it for publication.  It is a process whereby we just listen to what outside interest groups and the Seanad and the Dáil are saying.  There is certainly no attempt in any way to go past this House. We are trying to get it right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good point. Perhaps I could use section 48 to do just that.  We are asking that section 48 be removed in that it does not serve any necessary or useful purpose.  It would help in tidying up the Bill now to remove that section.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with Part IV of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, which we are going to deal with today, let me just say there are a number of clear objectives, to remind ourselves.  First, we are trying to eliminate abuses which have grown up in company law over many years, to stop the Phoenix syndrome which many commentators have pointed to, the people who abuse the privilege of company liability. We are setting out to stop that abuse, which the previous Government and this Government set their minds to doing.</P>
      <P>Secondly, we are setting out to make insider trading a serious offence.  That will be dealt with in the next part of the Bill.  We are setting out to balance this business of tackling people &mdash; the company cowboys &mdash; who abuse private liability or limited liability.  There is a balancing system in the whole legislation, that is, a system whereby companies can be rescued by putting them under the court's jurisdiction for a limited period of three months.  In that time, for example, their debts are frozen and the company can be restructured and re-organised and nursed along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not identical but it is close to the American Chapter 11 system, whereby there is a situation between a company going along from day to day and suddenly <Col N="1678" /> going into liquidation.  There is a three months frozen period of intensive care in which the company, if it has any real chance of survival, can be nursed back to health.  That is a rescue system and it is a positive system.  It should reduce the number of companies going into liquidation, or at least put them into intensive care for a period.  There was a need to have a gap between the sick company and the death of a company.  That new ground has been put into this Bill, an intensive care system to give the company a chance to get over its illness or at least make some final decisions.</P>
    <P>That is the general thrust of what the Bill intends to do.  Today we are dealing with Part IV of the Bill, which deals with the disclosure of interests in shares.  Part IV of the Bill contains detailed provisions about disclosure of interests in shares and debenture of companies.  Under section 90 of the 1963 Act every company must keep a register of the shareholding and debenture holdings of the directors and secretary of the company.  This information must also be given in respect of their holding in any member of the same group of companies.</P>
    <P>This information must be given whether the shares are held by the director, by the secretary himself or herself, or by his or her spouse or children.  It must also be given if the property is held in trust for him.  Section 193 of the 1963 Act requires the directors and the secretaries of the company to give notice, in writing, to the company of such matters relating to himself and to his or her spouse and children as may be necessary for the purposes of section 190.  That is the existing situation.</P>
    <P>There is a new approach here.  Part IV of the Bill not only replaces the existing provisions relating to holdings of directors and secretaries with new expanded provisions, but it also introduces new requirements relating to disclosure of significant shareholdings by all beneficial owners of shares or debentures in a company. Under this new approach, which we are discussing today, the extent of the disclosure will vary according to whether the company is a public limited company <Col N="1679" /> or whether it is a private company and also according to whether the person involved is a director, or a secretary, or merely an individual shareholder in the company.  That is the broad framework for what we are trying to do in Part IV of the Bill, a new approach making it essential for people to disclose what holdings they have and that disclosure depends on various ifs and buts which emerge throughout the Bill.</P>
    <P>Chapter 2 of Part IV of the Bill deals with directors and secretaries.  This chapter is going to replace section 90 of the 1963 Act, register of directors' shareholdings, and so much of section 193, which is the general duty to make disclosures, as relates to section 190.  Under the new provisions the directors and secretary of a company must disclose their interests, no matter how small, to the company itself.  The new provisions are more wide-ranging then those they are replacing.  For example, what is to be regarded as an interest in shares is defined in considerably more detail in this chapter than has been previously defined.  Also, interest held by spouses and minor children of directors will be regarded as being held by the director.  There are more extensive requirements than previously about registers of interests which must be kept by companies and considerably more public disclosure of interests held.</P>
    <P>While Chapter 2 deals with disclosure of interests by directors and by secretaries specifically, Chapter 3, which we hope to get to today, on the other hand includes a new regime of disclosure aimed at all shareholders, that is, whether they are directors of the company or are not directors of the company.  The general idea here is that, where a person is the beneficial owner of at least 5 per cent of the issued share capital of a public limited company, he or she will be required to declare that interest to the company.  Following that such information will be available to directors, shareholders, employees and creditors of the company. In addition, such information may be considered desirable by persons who wish <Col N="1680" /> to establish a relationship with the company whether as shareholder, creditor, or in some other capacity.</P>
    <P>This chapter in section 72 provides for a register to be kept by every public limited company of the information supplied under section 59 and for the inspection of that register by not only members of the company but any person.  There are also provisions in Chapter 3 of this Part which will require an individual who is part of what is known as a consort party &mdash; Senator Ross might know something about those, I do not &mdash; to disclose his interest if the total holding of the consort party, as it is called, that is parties acting in consort to acquire shares, exceeds 5 per cent of the share capital of the company. A consort party is essentially a group of persons acting together to defeat the object of the notification requirement of the statute, the interest of none of them reaching the notifiable percentage of 5 per cent, but that of all of them together amounting to a substantial, or even to a controlling interest.  This is an anti-avoidance measure.</P>
    <P>Chapter 4 deals with disclosure order in private companies.  A general regime of disclosure is not being provided for in relation to private companies.  Chapter 4 contains provisions which, in exceptional circumstances, would allow a person with a genuine financial interest in such a company to go to the court and obtain a court order compelling disclosure where he or she can show the court that their interest would be prejudiced by non-disclosure. There is no general regime of disclosure in regard to private companies but one has access to the courts in that area.</P>
    <P>In a general sense the objectives of the Bill are eliminating abuses, tackling the Phoenix syndrome, the insider trading elements and the new company rescue system.  Today we are dealing with Part IV of the Bill which deals in general with how the public and other interested parties find out who owns a company, what an interest in the company is and what notification there should be.  Section 48 does not serve any useful purpose at this stage.  We suggest that it should be removed from the Bill.  If Senators <Col N="1681" /> require any more detail I will be glad to expand on that.</P>

      <P>In response to the broader framework in which the Minister has placed this section it was helpful to have the context in which we are now looking at a substantial number of Government amendments.  I do not know whether the Minister is in a position to say why the Government have taken the step on Committee Stage of altering substantially the nature of the disclosure provisions and broadening substantially the scope of them.  Section 48, an interpretation section which was in this Bill on Second Stage, is to be removed.  The interpretation section provides an interpretation of four concepts which are used in this section.  Was it a mistake to have a separate interpretation section initially in this chapter, or is the Minister of the view that because of the amendments now being proposed by the Government it has become redundant?  If so, could the Minister explain why it has become redundant?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now of the opinion that it was a mistake to have an interpretation section here.  That is the view of our drafting people in the Department. On Senator Manning's point, the result of those submissions has given rise to a large number of technical amendments. While there may be some criticism of the timing of the submissions, there was no doubt that some of the technical points raised with us have been helpful and useful and, no doubt, are points which will be made by the Seanad in due course.  With the exception of one substantive item in the whole Part, most of them are of a technical nature.  That substantive one is section 49 which we are coming up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I take issue with the substance of what Senator Manning was saying.  I welcome the fact that a Bill can evolve quite substantially on Committee Stage, particularly when it is introduced in this House.  We have had the experience <Col N="1682" /> of the Status of Children Bill.  The National Monuments Bill was substantially altered on Committee Stage.  I do not object to the Minister either seeking representations or receiving representations from interested parties. There is no reason why that process should be suspended or should not go on.</P>
      <P>It is helpful that Members of this House should be aware when there is a significant shift in the approach being adopted to a chapter.  I am happy if the Minister is deleting section 48 as having been unnecessary at the beginning.  It is unusual to have an interpretation section in a Bill in relation to a chapter but, as the Minister said, this is a very long and complex Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not mention section 82.  It is not easy to deal with it in isolation because one of the problems in getting down to section 83, is that in the way it is framed, unless the amendments say otherwise, it is an impediment directed more at preventing disclosure of information. The reference to an application for a disclosure order being made in contemplation or in furtherance of a trade dispute should be deleted from section 83 (5) (b).  I am not opposed to section 48 being deleted.  There is interpretation backwards, but there is no interpretation forwards.  There is nothing to substitute for section 48 to cover the other sections. It might be taken to be preventing the disclosure of information particularly when there might be contemplation of the furtherance of a trade dispute and this causes problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 48 has nothing to do with the business of disclosures.  It is a definition section.  It does not affect the rest of the Bill.  It is an interpretation <Col N="1683" /> section and from a technical point of view we do not need to make those definitions at that stage so we feel we can take it out. It is to tidy up the Bill.</P>
      <P>On the other point the Senator made about less disclosure the Government would say that the purpose of Part 4 is to have greater disclosure.  Perhaps that is something we can talk about when going through the sections.  I am adamant that the drift of this Bill is to give more disclosure. One could argue that there should be more, but that is a matter of degree.  Our point of view is that this provides for more disclosure of who owns a company, who the real power behind companies is and the general right to know who pulls the levers in the corporate world.  That is what is behind a lot of this Bill but there are some safeguards built in for a number of specific areas which are important.  The Senator mentioned trade disputes.  That comes up in a later section and we can deal with it then.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with amendments Nos. 42 and 43 together. This is section 49 (1): in page 48, lines <Col N="1684" /> 22 and 23, to delete the words &ldquo;public limited&rdquo; and in page 48, line 27, to delete the phrase &ldquo;public limited&rdquo;.  It has been correctly pointed out to us by a number of representative bodies that the scope of section 49 and therefore of all Chapter 2 is defective.  These people have rightly said to us that, under the Bill as it now stands, the disclosure requirements in Chapter 2 apply only to public limited companies and not to private companies.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the provisions of the 1963 Act, namely, sections 190 and 193, which are replaced by Chapter 2 of the Bill, currently apply to all companies, both private and public.  We agree it is undesirable that the scope of the new provisions should be less than the provisions which they replace.  The effect of this amendment, therefore, will be to provide that all companies, whether public or private, will be subject to the disclosure requirements of Chapter 2 of Part IV.  For that reason we need to remove the phrase &ldquo;public limited&rdquo; to include all companies under the disclosure requirements for directors and secretaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I am worried about this total disclosure of shareholdings in private companies is that we have to be extremely careful that we do not militate against any investment that will take place to create employment.  I know from my own profession that there are vast sums of money which are lying dormant and which should be going towards investment to create employment. They do not perceive that they would get the necessary financial return from doing so when compared to other investments they would have at their disposal, whether in insurance companies, Government gilts and securities or whatever. The incentive for people to take their money and invest it in a private company is something which this Bill should encourage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give an example of where this amendment could cause difficulty.  A community organisation, or a community enterprise organisation, could be funded by the Department of Labour under FÁS.  The Youth Employment Agency could give a grant for an enterprise worker of £17,000 a year to help communities to create employment, to help a self-help community association to create employment in their own community to keep people at home in their communities rather than going off as illegals to Britain or America.  In order to safeguard the directors' own individual interests it would have to be a limited company.  For example, there might be eight directors in that company who want to invest in 51 per cent of the shares of that company.  Those people, even thought in a voluntary capacity, would have to register themselves, would have to disclose their interest to the Companies Registration Office because it is a private company.  That would certainly cause tremendous difficulties for many people becoming involved in a voluntary <Col N="1686" /> way in communities in helping to create employment.  If I am to be asked as a voluntary person to put my name to a certain number of shares to get a private company in a community off the ground to create employment in my community, it would cause tremendous difficulties for me to enter into that because of the consequences it could have on my personal guarantees and on my personal company which I would have laboured for in my personal capacity.  I would like clarification on that before I agree to withdraw my reservations about the deletion of &ldquo;public limited&rdquo; company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment in principle because the distinction in the original section confining it to public limited companies is a bit of an arbitrary one.  Some of the largest companies in the State happen to be private companies.  For example, Bord Telecom and An Post are private companies.  They may not, in fact, have the same relevance in relation to disclosure of shares as other companies, but it is not a very real distinction. Since the interest is in having disclosure, it is appropriate not to confine it to the artificial creation of a public limited company as opposed to the artificial creation of a private company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned and to some extent share some of Senator Hogan's concern &mdash; this is something we want to tease out &mdash; about the implications and in order to pinpoint my concern it is necessary to refer to further parts of this section.  If a director or secretary does not disclose the shareholdings of themselves or their family, they would be guilty of an offence.  If we accept a further amendment the Minister is proposing, there is no question of getting the consent of the DPP for a prosecution.  Also the person has to do it within the proper period. When we come to the section we will discuss it.  We have to realise, if we are requiring disclosure right across the board of all shareholding in all companies, we will have to be terribly careful, first of all that people know they may be becoming liable for a criminal offence unless they do it and secondly, that there <Col N="1687" /> is a very significant publication before the section is brought into effect of what would be required.  It then would be a full requirement right across the board.  I would welcome the Minister's response on that.  I support the amendment in principle but would like to have further clarification on those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Senator Hogan's worry but it is not going to be a real problem.  If you hold shares in a limited company which is doing some local community work, it will come under this in the ordinary course.  All it means is that the fact that you hold those shares is to be made known to the company. You must tell the company that you hold those shares.  You cannot hold them privately. You could argue almost the other way that, in community efforts, it is even more important that there are no mysterious shareholders, that the actual holder of the shares is known to the public &mdash; all the more reason to make sure that the actual owner of the shares is known to the company so that they know who they are dealing with.  From a community point of view, I cannot see that it could become a real problem.  There is the other general point, too, that the public have a right to know in a general sense whom they are dealing with or the structures they are dealing with.  I understand the Deputy's worry but I do not think it is as serious as he may feel.</P>
      <P>Senator or Robinson is probably referring to the fact that just five days is to an extent a short time to get your act together in the face of perhaps a criminal offence.  Section 51 (1) in the last phrase provides that five days from when you become aware of the fact you need to notify.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) requires a person who is a director or secretary at the time of commencement of this section to notify the company of the existence and extent of his holdings in shares or debentures of the company at that precise time.  Subsection (6) provides at present that in the case of such a person, subsection (1) shall not require the notification by him of the occurrence of an event before the subsection comes into operation.  Effectively the same thing is being said twice in different subsections of the same section.  The reference to <Col N="1689" /> subsection (1) in subsection (6) is, therefore, in my view, unnecessary and perhaps misleading and should, therefore, be taken out.  That is what we are trying to do.</P>

      <P>The reason for this and the other three related amendments Nos. 55, 83 and 88 is that the offence involved, making false statements and so on, is already provided for in a general way in section 186 (1) of the Bill.  That section deals with the wilful or reckless making of false statements for any purpose of the Companies Act including, of course, this Bill.  It will, therefore, obviously apply also in relation to section 49 of the Bill.  The inclusion of these words in section 49 (7) is, therefore, unnecessary and this amendment will remove those words.  Similar situations arise in the case of section 56 (6), section 71 (7) (b) and section 77 (3) and there are related amendments to rectify the position in each of these cases also.</P>

      <P>Section 49 (9) means that before the Minister can take summary proceedings for an offence under the section he will have to get the consent <Col N="1690" /> of the DPP.  The purpose of the amendment is to remove this requirement which seems to be an unnecessary complication in view of the type of offences we are dealing with in this Bill generally.  In addition, the requirement to obtain the consent of the DPP before a prosecution can be taken would slow down the prosecution process and thus adversely affect the efficient operation of the Act.</P>
      <P>Under section 184 of the Bill the Minister is empowered to prosecute summarily for an offence under the Bill.  The effect of subsection (9) as it now stands would be to require the Minister to get the consent of the DPP before proceeding with the prosecution.  The situations in existing legislation where the consent of the DPP is required are extremely rare and, following further consideration of this requirement, it is perhaps now unnecessary and should be removed.  A similar situation arises in a number of sections in Part IV of the Bill and I propose in similar amendments to delete these provisions also.  The provisions involved are contained in sections 57 (4) and 71 (9), amendments Nos. 61 and 84 respectively.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the fact that the Minister is trying to bring about a more efficient working procedure in order to enable the taking of a case, I am somewhat concerned that the sole discretion on proceedings should be left in the hands of a Minister of the day. Perhaps the Minister would like to comment on whether it would be important from his or any Minister's point of view to have an independent procedure laid down by which the Director of Public Prosecutions would have discretion in bringing proceedings rather than leaving it to political input in the form of a Minister for Industry and Commerce, whoever that would be.</P>

      <P>Presumably when subsection (9) was put into the Bill when it was drafted and considered on Second Stage, it was felt that it would be appropriate to have this kind of check.  The Minister said he does not feel it appropriate <Col N="1691" /> to continue it in this and the other relevant sections.  He points out that the Bill itself authorises either the Minister or the DPP to bring summary proceedings for offences under this section. It relates to the issue I raised that we may come back to on the section itself, that we are extending disclosure right across the board to all companies.  Anybody who is a shareholder, or a secretary, or their families, must disclose.  We are saying it is a criminal offence if you do not do it within five days of when you know you have the interest in the company.  How does the Minister envisage it might come to the attention either of the Minister or the DPP that it would be appropriate to prosecute for an offence under this section in relation to disclosure of private companies?  It would be useful if we had some idea of how in practice this is likely to operate.</P>

      <P>In regard to Senator Robinson's point, all I can say is that it has come to the attention of the Minister in the same way as other items under the existing companies legislation would. There is no large inspectorate roaming the country trawling for problems like this.  It comes to attention by complaints and by general observation.  The Senator is correct.  There is no police force as such <Col N="1692" /> trawling for this kind of information but one would imagine that if there was a serious difficulty a complaint would be made.</P>

      <P>Looking at section 19 of the Bill, for example, the power of the Minister to require production of documents, the Minister has quite substantial powers in that area to seek information. In any case, where he is aware of difficulties he would certainly use section 19 to require production of documents and so on.  Arising out of that, he could initiate his own prosecution or, indeed, refer it to the DPP.</P>

      <P>On the section because it is possible to look at it in a broader context, I just want to come back to the point I made about the proper period which is, as the Minister says, five days from when the person is aware he has an interest.  When the section is brought into effect, anybody holding shares will be aware of it as of then and has five days in which to make that disclosure to the company, and that is every company in the State.  It is a very far-reaching proposal and I am concerned mainly that there is adequate public information and even education about the implications of it so that those who should be making disclosure to their companies are doing so.  Given again that it will be required in all circumstances, is it intended to have guidelines issued to companies from the <Col N="1693" /> Department as to how this is to be implemented, with standard forms, procedures and that kind of thing?  Is the Minister going to do that, given that this now applies right across the board?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the difficulty and we are going to have a close look at it.  I see the difficulty of &ldquo;supposed to be aware&rdquo; until the Bill comes into effect because that is the law and you have to be aware of it.  If you then have only five days for every company I can see a difficulty.  We will have a look to see whether we can arrange transitional arrangements and maybe come back to the House on this.  We could do information campaigns and items like that but we would nearly need to be into that now if you were going to start the Bill.  We will see whether we can work out some transitional arrangements because they will probably be necessary.</P>

      <P>How did the Minister arrive at five days as an appropriate time? Does he consider that may not be adequate time in order to have disclosure of shares to the company?  Perhaps that would help to get over the difficulty.  I realise that, no matter how often you tell them or how much information you give, a number of people will fail to see that they should comply with the law and in the five days tell their company of the amount of shares they have.  I would like the Ministers comments on how he arrived at that figure of five days.  Perhaps it could be extended.  I am open to what he has to say on it.</P>

      <P>Back in section 4 we do not count Saturdays and Sundays so it could not affect the seven days if, like me, you work seven days a week.  The figure appears in similar provisions in other countries, certainly in the UK.  I regard it as a reasonable time after you become aware that you may have an interest.  We could be here arguing for weeks that it should be extended but it seems to us to be a reasonable time after you have actually become aware in which to sit down and make the notification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at subsection (13) as currently drafted, we think it would be capable of two very different interpretations.  This has been confirmed by one or two of the submissions which we received so far.  The first interpretation &mdash; this is the one we would want it to have &mdash; is that, if a director gives a life interest in his shares to a third party, so long as that life interest exists, in other words, as long as the third party lives but only for that time, the director's interests can be disregarded for the purpose of notification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the other possible interpretation is that, when the director gives a life interest to a third party, on a strict reading of the subsection the mere fact of his having given such a life interest to somebody else would mean that the director's interest could be disregarded for all time, even after the third party died, and the interest reverted to the director.  We want to be absolutely sure that the wording of this subsection would <Col N="1695" /> not create a loophole for directors to get around their obligations in this regard. The purpose of the amendment, therefore, is to try to make it clear that &ldquo;so long as&rdquo; means &ldquo;for the time during which&rdquo; and does not simply mean &ldquo;provided that&rdquo;.  It is an attempt to clarify what we are getting at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have in Irish law the concept of an authorised unit trust scheme.  Section 50 (13) is based on UK type legislation.  The term used in our Unit Trusts Act, 1972 is &ldquo;registered unit trust scheme.&rdquo;  Paragraph (a) (i) of the amendment would rectify that.  The second problem, however, is that there is at least one other unit trust in Ireland which, while not registered, has the same characteristics as a registered unit trust For example, unit holders are the beneficial owners of interests in the trust's investments.  It is given the same treatment under the Capital Gains Tax Act, and so on, for example.  It seems reasonable to extend the exemption in this paragraph to unit holders under such an arrangement.  The formula of words we propose to use in paragraph (a) (ii) of the amendment has been used previously in regulation 45 of the European Communities Life Assurance Accounts Statements and Valuation Regulations, 1986, Statutory Instrument 437, 1986.  The third problem with the paragraph as drafted is a minor one.  The reference to the Charities Act, 1961, should be to a scheme made under section 46 of that Act and not to section 29, so we will have to correct it.</P>

      <P>The section provides for a very substantial extension of what would constitute an interest requiring the disclosure under section 49.  The thrust of it is really to catch any type of controlling influence or power to direct or whatever, and this reinforces the point that might be made.  It is not just shareholding we are talking about.  It is any broader or more subtle and indirect interest as very extensively defined in section 50.  This further supports the need either for the kind of transitional period the Minister is contemplating, or a very significant exercise in education of the entire population because a very considerable number would have interest in companies as defined here who might not have regarded themselves as being in that position. It is necessary to be aware of this difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these two related amendments is to rectify a problem which has been pointed out to us in relation to subsection (2) of this section.  This subsection is saying at present that, if you acquire an interest and you know that the acquisition gives rise to a legal obligation to notify the company, you must notify within five days.  The second clause in the subsection <Col N="1698" /> is saying that, if you do not know you have acquired an interest at the time you have acquired it, you must make the notification within five days of the date on which you first knew you had a legal obligation to do so.</P>
      <P>The problem with this is that it would make the provision very difficult to operate as it falls into the trap of creating a legal obligation on a person only if he or she knows that he or she has such an obligation, in other words, a contradiction of the principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse, as it where.  The two related amendments here rectify this by aligning the drafting of subsection (2) with that of subsection (1).  In other words, the time period for notification of the occurence of a notifiable event under subsection (2) should run from the time the person becomes aware that the event itself has occurred and not when he becomes aware that the occurrence of the event gives rise to a legal obligation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's explanation is clear in the context of what we have been talking about.  It refers back to the proper period being very strictly five days, or maybe seven if you include Saturday and Sunday, of when the event has occurred that entitles the person to the interest and the person is then required, as the Minister has properly emphasised, to know the law and cannot plead ignorance of the law in that.</P>
      <P>I do not want to repeat myself but I emphasise that it would appear that some amendment to the operation of section 51 would require to be contemplated on Report Stage in order to ensure that we are not imposing unfair standards too suddenly.

      <P>This amendment, like several others we are proposing today, is designed as a kind of a tidying up provision in relation to the provisions of Part IV of the Bill generally.  For example, the various provisions in section 71 &mdash;&ldquo;Other provisions relating to notification&rdquo;&mdash; are expressed to relate both to Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 at present.  However, we think it might be a better approach if, as far as possible, each of the chapters in this Part could be self-contained with the minimum of cross-referencing.  That is what this amendment amounts to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The formula we are using in subsection (1) of the new section already appears in section 71 in relation to Chapters 2 and 3.  Subsection (1) of the amendment would simply repeat the terms of section 71 (1) in the context of Chapter 2.  We take out the reference to Chapter 2 in section 71 (1).  The same applies to subsections (2) and (3) of the new section. We will be incorporating in Chapter 2 the terms of section 71 (2) and section 71 (3) (a) in so far as they relate to obligations under Chapter 2.  Exactly the same logic applies to subsections (4) to (7) of the new section.  These currently appear as subsections (4), (5), (6) and (7) (d), respectively, of section 71.  The amendment will simply copy these provisions <Col N="1703" /> into the new section for the purpose of Chapter 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the section speaks of the statutory directors' report would not hinder us from making the amendments since, first, the directors' report under the Companies Act does not confine itself merely to the activities of the directors but is intended as a review of the activities of the company over the financial year and secondly, there is an option in this section whereby the information required can be disclosed either in the directors' report or in the notes to the company's account.  Does that answer the question?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure at this stage and I am not even clear on my question.  Section 55 (1) uses the word &ldquo;director&rdquo; in two senses.  This amendment adds a subsection (4) to the section which says: This section applies to the secretary of a company as it applies to a director of that company&rdquo;.  In section 55 (1) we seem to be using the word &ldquo;director&rdquo; in two senses.  Section 55 (1) says: &ldquo;The directors' report or the notes to the company's accounts in respect of a financial year shall, as respects each person who, at the end of the year, was a director of the company, state...&rdquo;. <Col N="1705" /> What I want to know is are we saying &ldquo;shall...at the end of the year was a director or secretary of the company...&rdquo; and, if so, would it be perhaps clearer to make the amendment in that form? Perhaps the Minister might consider that on Report Stage.  I would like to clarify whether we want to say that: &ldquo;The directors' report and secretary's report or the notes to the company's...&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no secretary's report as such.  It is the report of the directors of the company.  As of now, the directors of the company, in the directors' report, must give the information. We are now trying to make sure that the information about the secretary is also given in the director's report.  If there is a drafting difficulty here we will certainly have another look at it but what we are clearly trying to do is to make sure that the holding of the secretary is laid out in the directors' report.  There is no such thing as a secretary's report.</P>

What we are suggesting we put in here is simply that this section applies to the secretary of a company as it applies to the director of that company.  We will certainly have a look at whether other items need to be amended in view of what the Senator has said.  Our intention is quite clear; we want to make sure that the information about the secretary is also included in the report of the Directors. We will have a look at that to see if we can improve it and we will certainly come back on it.</P>

      <P>The Fourth Directive <Col N="1707" /> is raising its head here in that the companies under a certain turnover limit will be exempt from lodging their accounts or disclosing them in that way.  Obviously the directors will still have to include the information in the register and in the directors' report but there is an exemption for certain companies under the Fourth Directive from lodging the directors' report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 55 (3) as it stands at present says: For the purposes of this section &ldquo;the directors' report&rdquo; means the report by the directors of a company which, by section 158 (1) of the Principal Act, is required to be attached to every balance sheet of the company. Is the Minister saying that does not, in fact, mean every company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the 1986 Act exempts certain companies so it applies to all the companies except those companies. They must still lodge the directors' report but under the Fourth Directive they are exempt from giving a lot of the information that is to be given on those companies.  Obviously because of that this information would not be lodged.  The Senator is correct in saying that a range of companies are exempt under the Fourth Directive which is under the 1986 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not followed this and perhaps it could be further clarified on Report Stage.  Even if companies, by virtue of the Fourth Directive, are below a certain size and do not have to file detailed balance sheets with the Companies Registration Office, do they have to file a directors' report and if they do, presumably they must then comply with the provisions of section 55 and at least file this information.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The companies who are exempt under the Fourth Directive do not have to lodge with the Companies Registration Office their directors' report and, therefore, this information would not be there.  They have to lodge abridged balance sheets and certain selected pieces <Col N="1708" /> of information once they are under the threshold level for the Fourth Directive. The Senator is correct to tease this out. They do not have to lodge the directors' report but they have to lodge instead selected pieces of information.  There is a range of companies who are exempt from this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>A significant distinction is being drawn between the general requirement under section 49 which applies to companies with no reserve where there is an obligation on the director or secretary to notify their interests to the company and the provisions of section 55 which, because of subsection (3), apply only to those companies who have an existing obligation and do not benefit from the exemption under the relevant directive.  Therefore, in those circumstances those companies will be required to make disclosures to the Companies Registration Office of the interests of their directors and secretaries.  If that is the position &mdash; and I do not mean this in any rude sense &mdash; is it a conscious policy decision that that would be the case?  In other words, now that the Minister has gone for fuller disclosure in section 49 is there a certain logic in pursuing this and perhaps having a different reference mechanism to the directors' report under section 158 since that excludes certain companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain parallel between the Fourth Directive and what we are doing here.  That is one of our concerns.  That was a calculated piece of work and we are trying to stay somewhat parallel to it.  The Senator is correct that all companies must get the information and put it on a register which is available.  There are companies who are exempt from going the other step of lodging with the Companies Registration Office the directors' interests and so on in the directors' report.  They are exempt from that general requirement under the Fourth Directive and the 1986 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain logic in trying to tidy up the notification business and making sure that even if one does not have to <Col N="1709" /> notify it to the Companies Registration Office, that the company are entitled to be fully aware of all of their shareholdings and have a register of that.  The people dealing with the company are entitled to have that information neatly compiled. There is a certain logic in it.  Perhaps it does not go as far as one would like it to go but the Fourth Directive is a sensible piece of legislation and is one we like to stay parallel to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that I do not follow the logic of the Fourth Directive. I know in general terms what the requirement of the Fourth Directive are.  They are an approximation of the Community level of disclosure of accounts of companies in trying to ensure that certain standards in that regard would be maintained in each member state.  They have no bearing on what the Oireachtas decides is proper disclosure for the purposes of the Companies Act.  I would have thought we are completely free in relation to disclosure of positions.  What is in the Fourth Directive, if I can put it that way?  The only relevance of the Fourth Directive is the trigger that it is being used in subsection (3) &mdash; the reference to the special definition of the directors' report.  If we did not have a special definition of the directors' report linking it into section 158 of the Principal Act then it could mean that those companies who must file the directors' report by virtue of section 158 (1) and those companies who file more limited information because they benefit from the Fourth Directive must also include as part of that limited information disclosure of the interests of their directors and secretaries.  Is that a policy opinion open to us?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Since that is a policy option open to us, if the Minister is in favour of disclosure and broadening the disclosure in section 49, which we have just dealt with, what is the policy difference <Col N="1710" /> in not having disclosure here of the directors and secretaries interests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a general feeling, which we interpret to be abroad, which says we do not want to overburden some small companies.  That was the thinking behind the Fourth Directive, which we backed up with domestic legislation in 1986.  The intention was not to nail all small companies to the wall with a range of disclosure requirements.  That is the simple thinking behind it.</P>
      <P>This represents substantial progress. As times goes on, it can be extended if it is thought necessary to do so.  Right now, we thought it would be smarter to run parallel to the Fourth Directive &mdash; which is the 1986 Act and which we debated &mdash; and exempt those companies from the requirement to lodge the directors' report because that does not happen under the Fourth Directive.  It is a policy decision generally not to get too heavily on the backs of small companies.  That is probably the general thinking behind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the nature of the budget, the earlier sections in relation to maintaining a register and the provisions which are to be included in the register in sections 53 and 54 require all companies, including even the smallest private companies, to have all this information to hand.  It does not seem a very significant additional burden simply to take the part which relates to directors and the secretary of the company and hive it off with the end of year report to the Companies Registration Office.  I see a very big issue there because the disclosure in relation to the private companies is in-house: it is disclosure by directors, secretaries and their families to their company, whereas disclosure in section 55 will make available in the Companies Registration Office the interests held by directors and secretaries of companies.  The Minister seems to have come half way on disclosure &mdash; which he has told us is something he wishes to achieve in the public interest &mdash; and then stopped.  I do not think it is a realistic reason for stopping to say that it would be a burden on companies <Col N="1711" /> because, effectively, we have imposed that burden.  All they have to do is take a bit of it and put it into the Companies Registration Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Senator's point.  We are trying to have a certain neatness about what a small company has to notify to the Companies Registration Office and that is enshrined at present in the Fourth Directive and the 1986 Act.  There is a certain neatness about what they have to do there and we are trying to stay parallel to that, literally for the sake of being neat and consistent. If the Senator's concern is that the public would need to know, that is provided for because the small companies will have to keep a register of the directors and secretaries interest and so on.  That register will be available to the public under section 54 (5) which states:</P>
      <P>The said register shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) if the company's register of members is kept at its registered office, be kept there;</P>
      <P>and shall during business hours (subject to such reasonable restriction as the company in general meeting may impose, so that not less than two hours in each day be allowed for inspection) be open to the inspection of any member of the company without charge and of any other person on payment of 30p or such less sum as the company may prescribe for each inspection.</P>
      <P>The information is available to the public without flooding the Companies Registration Office with all that additional information.  It may need to keep parallel to the Fourth Directive.  We are not trying to hide disclosure; it is available in the register.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>If every company, including every private company, must make its register available to its members and the public, for a 30p charge, so that it can be inspected and people can see <Col N="1712" /> what the interests of the directors, secretaries and members of the family are, what is the purpose of having this further disclosure in the Companies Registration Office?  It may be that that is a very obvious question but what is the purpose of having this additional disclosure in the Companies Registration Office for certain companies who do not get the benefit of the Fourth Directive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that point also.  The bulk of people will go the route of paying 30p and having a look at it but for the larger companies we felt that it might be better to have a more formal arrangement where that information would be more formally available centrally.  The cut-off point became, very much in our mind, one of administration and it seemed to be a neat cut-off point with the Fourth Directive.  There is some duplication there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>To pursue the effect of the disclosure &mdash; and strictly speaking I am going back to the point the Minister made earlier about access to the register under section 54 &mdash; is this going to result in its being possible for any member of the public, journalist, or interested community group, to ascertain from the company who holds any interests in the company and in what proportion they hold that interest?  The reason I ask this is that there has been considerable controversy in other countries about this.  I saw a television programme, and other Members of the House might have seen it also, about the buying of land in Scotland. Large chunks of the highlands in Scotland are being bought by companies and nobody knows who has purchased them.  Are we now going to have full disclosure so that you can go in to the Companies Registration Office and pay 30p and know at the end of it who holds the shares in every company in the State?</P>

      <P>For the sake of the record and to be clear on the requirement under section 54 to pay 30p, we are talking only about directors and secretaries. You would be entitled to know what <Col N="1713" /> interest any director or secretary of a company holds.  If you move away from that, you are into a different area.  I want to be clear about that because I do not want to give the impression that you can pay your 30p and get full information. That is not the situation.</P>

      <P>I think I am clear enough on this.  This will be my last intervention on this section.  If you pay 30p you can go to any company and ascertain the interests of the directors, secretaries or their families.

      <P>To give the Minister a rest, I will go in a different direction from that of my colleague, Senator Robinson.  I made comments under section 49 about the notification of shares, particularly for small companies the Minister has come to the aid of under the Fourth Directive. The Fourth Directive should be brought into vogue in relation to the notification of shares.  The Minister's thinking should be brought more into line under section 49.  I am concerned that there would be an undue disclosure of shares and interest brought to bear on small investors or people with small shareholdings in community enterprises.  I am extremely concerned about this and I hope the Minister and his officials will look at it and guarantee, <Col N="1714" /> as far as possible, that investors who make a contribution to shares in a company in order to create local employment will not be affected unduly.  That is my problem.  I am probably away from the PLCs, but at local community level I am concerned about the disclosure of interests and the notification of shares and how that could reduce the amount of investment and money we can churn up to create local employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will think about what the Senator has been saying between now and when I come back again.  If I thought this would damage local entrepreneurs or local enterprise I would not be here with the Bill in this form.  I am happy that local enterprise and business people who want to go along the road of limited liability will find that this Bill will give them all the protection they need.  There are rescue clauses in other parts of the Bill which will help those people, and it is a very small number of people who are not prepared to stand behind the ventures in which they are involved.  There is a small number of people in that category and I am not sure whether one would want to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pursue the topic <i>ad nauseam</i> but there are public servants or civil servants who want to become nominal directors of a local enterprise.  Because of the inherent dangers under the Companies Act they might feel they should not take any personal guarantees in relation to setting up a new company in their local area.  Those are the precise fears any person who decides to bring about the creation of much needed employment in a voluntary capacity would have in relation to the notification of shares and the disclosure of interests.  The fears generated by the documentation it would be necessary to give to the Companies Registration Office might drive people away from investment rather than the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that worry.  In the Department of Industry and Commerce the last thing we would <Col N="1715" /> want to do is to dampen any business spirit.  Quite the contrary; our job is to promote and develop it.  We are drawing a distinction between the people who are directors and those who are not in a private company.  If you are a director, your shareholding is in the register and the information is available in that way to the public.  If you are not a director, that type of disclosure is not there, but a person could go to court to get it.  If you had an interest in a company, you are not a director but you own a large slice of the shares, a person could go to court and get a disclosure order to find out who owns those shares.  Only a person with a financial interest can do that, and not just anybody.  They would have to have a financial interest and the court would have to be satisfied that the person with the financial interest had a legitimate reason for getting that information.</P>
      <P>If the court is satisfied that there is a person with a financial interest who needs that information in all fairness and equity he should have it because it is not fair to be dealing with a company in which the individual can hide completely in the face of somebody with a genuine financial interest.</P>
      <P>It is opening it up, but we cannot dodge this.  We cannot have it both ways.  We cannot increase disclosure and then do it in such a way as not to give out any names.  If we are going to increase disclosures that is what it ultimately means. We are trying to build in some protection. I have a strong personal view that we should make sure that we do not damage any flock of business people or entrepreneurs who are growing up, and that they are not discouraged from going into business and creating some wealth for the country.  This Bill seeks to get a balance between weeding out the cowboys, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, making sure we do not in any way dampen the entrepreneurial spirit.  We may have found that balance and with the help of the Seanad and the Dáil we will get this right before we finish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Minister's <Col N="1716" /> emphasis that we are only talking about directors and secretaries of companies in relation to disclosure, whether it is the obligation on the company to make their books available with the directors and secretaries interests disclosed on payment of 30p to any outsider, in the next section we are coming to, it is clear that we are not just talking about directors and secretaries.  We are also talking about their spouses and their children.  I am anxious to be fully clear on what the section means.  I may have a different emphasis from my colleague on this side of the House but it is important that whatever conclusion we draw we are clear on it.  In the case of private companies where we are covering directors, secretaries, spouses and minor children, we are covering a fair amount of a fair number of private companies.  We are probably getting a fairly full disclosure of private companies for 30p if we are getting all the interests of directors, secretaries, spouses and minor children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not getting information on the shareholder who is not a director.  In the case of minor children it is attributed back to a director. The names of all the minor children would not be necessary but the holding would be attributed to the main director. That main director would then be on the list.  It covers a fair share of Irish business. Where you have a shareholding in a company but are not a director, there is no requirement unless someone takes you to court to drag that information out of you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The companies run as family businesses where the shares are kept in the family would be making what in fact is a full and potentially public disclosure because a person can go in and as of right for the payment of 30p look at the register and determine the shareholdings. It would be invidious to name names, but there are significant family companies where people may not be aware of which member of the family holds what interest and they would then be in a position to clarify that by going in and seeing how much he or she holds <Col N="1717" /> or what a person holds by virtue of the shareholding of minor children.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that we should be aware of what the provision of this section of the Bill means because, in family companies, it would be an exception rather than normal to have shares held by a non-member of the family as a non-director. If they are held by a non-member of the family it is likely that person would be a director and that would be known, but to have shares held by somebody who was neither a spouse, a child nor a director would be somewhat unusual for private companies.  I do not claim to be an expert in it but if you have outsiders in, you normally have them in as a director and then they would be caught by the disclosure provisions.  As I am beginning to understand the thrust of the provisions, it seems that we are providing, because of the amendment made to section 49, to extend it to all companies for full disclosure of family companies in Ireland. It is better if we understand the implications of that.</P>

      <P>The 1963 Act has a similar arrangement where the broader family were drawn in in terms of aggregating the holding of a director.  This strengthens it.  The Senator is probably worried about family rows where some members of the family do not know what other members of the family hold.  I doubt that that is a real problem in family businesses today.  Most of the people involved in a company round the table would know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be my concern.  Senator Hogan has more of a concern than I have.  All I am doing is noting the extent of the disclosure and the extent of access to the information. Take a journalist who is interested in doing some sort of a survey on family <Col N="1718" /> companies in Ireland, he has all the information&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>All the journalist is going to find out is that the directors of a certain company hold so many shares. He is starting out with the information that they are directors.  It is going to be on the head bill for a start and it is in the Companies Registration Office. They know the directors.  All the investigative reporting is going to dig up is that these directors also happen to be shareholders and hold so many shares. By taking that from 100 you can find out that somebody outside the company owns some shares.  If you want to find that out you will have to go to court and the court will take into account whether you are entitled to that information.  Yes, it is radical, but it is not as dangerously radical as you might think it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is different, but if people are known to be directors of a company they are on the line.  The additional information that will be available is what percentage of the company you actually hold.  I do not know if it makes much difference to an outsider whether you hold 44 per cent, 22 per cent, or whatever.  If they are dealing with you, and you are a director of that company, they see you as representing the company and want to talk to you. What actual shareholding you hold, or how it is spread between your family, is not unusual additional information of such a nature that would be as widespread as you might worry about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening with interest to these technical arguments. The main thrust of the Bill is to eliminate fly-by-night operators and as Senator Hogan has said, we do not want to inhibit legitimate investors.  I appreciate that we have to try to achieve a balance in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to disclosure between <Col N="1719" /> public and private companies, I understand there are about 96,000 companies of which 93,000 are private companies.  I do not know how many enjoy the provisions of the Fourth Directive, and the yardstick as to what qualifies you to come in under the Fourth Directive.  Any company who request credit should disclose who the shareholders are.  In these days of difficult trading one of the biggest problems companies have is to collect the money they are legitimately owed.  If you are pursuing somebody who owes you a substantial sum of money, the more that is disclosed the better for those trading legitimately.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to achieve a balance because you have an investment capital incentive whereby people may want to invest in companies and may not want their name known as to which company they are involved with for whatever reasons.  As a small legitimate businessman, the more disclosures and the more information you can get about companies to whom you extend credit, the better. As I said earlier, we are trying to eliminate the fly-by-night operators.  I appreciate the arguments that are being made on both sides.  I appreciate that we are trying to achieve a balance in the Bill. As the Minister said earlier, eventually we will tease it out and, hopefully, when it eventually goes through both Houses of the Oireachtas, we will achieve this balance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>In case there is any question of there being any difference between us on the merits of disclosure, I very strongly favour it but I would be concerned if we did not fully examine the implications of what I believe is a significant change made to section 49, the extension of the disclosure of interests across the board to all companies, in other words, the removal of the reserve to public companies.  I said I support it but it is very important that we consider carefully what the implications are for the rest of this section and particularly the sections which have not been amended.  It would be undesirable, for example, if we somehow unintentionally provided for <Col N="1720" /> fuller disclosure of family businesses than any other concern.  We could legitimately ask ourselves: are we doing that and is that desirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Robinson for the analytical way in which she has teased out these arguments.  She has expressed my concerns very well, even though she might not agree with most of them.  On section 49 and on this section I have made my views clear.  I am concerned about the disclosure particularly in regard to small companies.</P>
      <P>The family business is the area in which most of our employment creation will take place in the years ahead.  If in any way we prevent entrepreneurs in a family business from investing their money in employment or in business, we are doing a bad day's work for local communities in particular.  I have no hang-ups at all about PLCs disclosing their interests, or disclosing their shares, or who are involved in them.  I am extremely concerned for the people, who, for whatever reason, are in a silent partner capacity, in small businesses.  As Senator Robinson has pointed out, there are cases before the courts at present where there might be an interest to know who owns what and how many shares they own in that company.</P>
      <P>We have not examined the serious consequences and radical nature of the Bill which the Minister has admitted.</P>
      <P>I think there will have to be exemptions under section 49 for family companies introduced on Report Stage.  I would like to discuss how that will come about. Public disclosure of these shares and shareholdings and the way they can be so easily got at by various individuals for whatever reasons may not always be in the best interest of the company, or the best interest of the creditors.  We will have to tease this out more on Report Stage.  I would not be happy at the way the thing is moving in the direction of creating employment at the moment.</P>

      <P>Senator Hogan obviously feels strongly about the question of discouraging enterprise.  I do not think this will discourage enterprise in any way. People can find out already who the directors are, now they will know what shares the directors hold.  They also will know whether there is a third party involved. They would have known about the existence of a third party under the existing law because you had to send in your list of shareholders.  While there was not a breakdown of the shareholding the list of shareholders had to be submitted to the Companies Registration Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a family company had a number of shareholders who were not family members, that would appear in the Companies Registration Office, as presently constituted.  Granted it could read Leinster House Limited, or something.  It could be a company that held the shares in the family company and it would not disclose the person behind that company. The only fresh area that a private family limited company has to worry about in a real sense is that, if there is an outside investor in that company and somebody with a financial interest wants to find out who it is, they can find it out in court. We are not dodging that.  Yes, it is an additional disclosure.  It is not unhealthy in my view.  I do not see what damage it can do.  If you have a financial interest in a company, you are entitled to know who you are dealing with if something goes seriously wrong.  You are entitled to be <Col N="1723" /> able to find out with whom you are dealing.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a non-director or relative of a director, child or spouse of director, in fact, in many cases I would have thought, particularly in the case of a private company you could probably do it by elimination.  If you have access to the director's secretary, spouse and children, then if there is an outside shareholding and you know the name of the shareholder, in a large number of circumstances you will be able to find out what the shareholding is in that case, just by finding out what share the others have and the value of them and what is left is the holding of the outsider.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>You can find out what shares the directors hold in the family and, by subtracting that from 100, you can find out that there is an outside shareholder who has the remainder shares. That is quite true.  To get the name of that person and to get further information means the court route however.  You may want to get more information about the actual name, for example, because it could be held in a company.  If you are an investor in a family company, you will very likely hold it through another company, so the existing regulations which say you have to list the shareholders in the Companies Registration Office would apply.  The information that it was owned by family members plus this limited company would already be there, but if you want to get behind that limited company now you have got to go to court. It is not as if we are suddenly pointing out that there are outside shareholders who up to now could be hidden.  Up to now that information was not hidden but <Col N="1724" /> was available at the Companies Registration Office.  You could always find out that there was an outside shareholder but you can now find out if that outside shareholding is held by a company.  If you are prepared to go to court and you have a financial interest and the court agrees with you, you can now find out who that is.</P>

      <P>This is equally clear. It is a question of a wrong reference.  The purpose of section 56 (8) is to ensure that information in relation to the interests of spouses and children or directors and secretaries will be recorded in the register of directors and secretaries interests required by section 53 and not by subsections (1) and (2) of section 51, as the subsection now states.  Section 53 is the section which deals with the keeping of registers whereas section 51 deals with <Col N="1726" /> time limits for the notification of information by directors and so on.  The purpose of the amendment, therefore, is simply to correct the wrong reference.</P>

      <P>I want to be clear.  This is extending the provisions of section 49 in relation to interest to spouses and children. We have already adverted to that. In relation to the filing of the information in the directors' report, the directors' report would extend to directors, secretaries, spouses and children.  Is that correct?  It would be lodged in the Companies Registration Office.  It is just a small point.</P>

      <P>In page 56, lines 26 and 27, to delete &ldquo;in the case of which shares or debentures are listed on&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;in the case of whose shares or debentures dealing facilities are provided by&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The amendments are similar to ones we have already made to section 29 of the Bill, which dealt with dealing by directors of a company in options.  The reason the amendment was made to section 29 and, indeed, why we are proposing it to this section too, is that the reference to a company which has a listing on a recognised Stock Exchange is <Col N="1727" /> not specific enough.  For example, it is not clear whether it means a company on the full Stock Exchange list or whether it would include, for example, a company dealt with on the unlisted securities market, the USM or, indeed, the new smaller companies market.</P>
      <P>We would obviously like to have the widest possible coverage of this section in the interest of the fullest possible information being made available to investors. The effect of the amendments here will be that, whenever a director or a secretary of a company with any sort of quotation in the Stock Exchange makes a notification to the company under this chapter, the company must immediately notify the Stock Exchange who may, in turn, decide to publish the information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is not, as might appear at first glance, to lessen the penalty for contravention of this section but rather to increase it.  We are dealing here with dealings by directors of publicly quoted public limited companies and we would attach great importance to the duty under this section on such directors to notify the Stock Exchange quickly of any dealings they might have in their own company's shares in the interest of investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The penalty for contravening the section is £1,000 in the current draft of <Col N="1728" /> the Bill.  On reflection, however, we think that the offence being created here is somewhat more serious than a straightforward penalty of a £1,000 fine would imply and that the penalty should be increased accordingly.  As to the form of the amendment itself, the deletion of the words mentioned in the amendment will have the effect of applying the provisions of section 184 (1) of the Bill to an offence under the section.  The offence will thus attract the standard penalties under that section for an offence for which no punishment is specifically provided.  The penalties will thus be a maxima of £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment on summary conviction and £10,000 or three years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to ask for clarification from the Minister about the duty here.  It seems as though there are different elements being dealt with here in section 57.  The main obligation is the obligation on the company in the circumstances of section 57, as amended, to notify the Stock Exchange where the company has been notified of interests of a director or secretary.  There is a penalty and the Minister is allowing for an increase in that penalty or more flexibility in that penalty by virtue of the other amendments, but there is a further matter and that is that the Stock Exchange may publish in such manner as it may determine.  I would like to understand that provision.  First of all, is that completely discretionary?  The Stock Exchange does not have to publish at all <Col N="1729" /> or is the &ldquo;may&rdquo; there mandatory?  Is it mandatory that it will be published and is it the form of the publication that is at the discretion of the Stock Exchange?  I would like to be clear as to what that means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirement is for the company to notify the Stock Exchange and then it goes on to say that the Stock Exchange may publish that in such manner as they think fit.  The present situation is that in most companies, there is certainly a requirement by the Stock Exchange to get that information from the companies under their aegis in any case, although it is not legally required &mdash; it will be after this Bill.  So, what we are doing is just giving, to an extent, legal effect to what is very often a method of operation of the Stock Exchange in any case.  We now want to make sure that they get that information.  We will feel we have gone as far as we should go once we are sure that they get the information, that they now in their regulation of the Stock Exchange on the various markets, the USM, SCM and so on, are fully aware of the information which they should be aware of.</P>
      <P>We felt we should not tell the Stock Exchange, as it were, how to use that information in the interests of their members.  You could make an argument for that but in general terms the Stock Exchange nearly always publish that information in any case.  They would certainly want a very good reason not to. You could argue that the Stock Exchange should be told to publish all that information but they may decide that in a particular case it is in the interests of the company and the investor not to do it. We are operating here on the basis that the Stock Exchange are well behaved and will do what is good for the investor and the company, I would like to drop it at that stage and leave it to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I have understood the provision specifically now in relation to the Stock <Col N="1730" /> Exchange and the fact that they may publish it.  If that sentence &mdash; the last part of the sentence from &ldquo;and the Stock Exchange may publish in such manner as it may determine, any information received by it under the subsection...&rdquo; was left out, would it make any difference?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Off the top of my head, I do not think it would make any difference because I assume they could publish it in any case, unless there is something somewhere which forbids publication by parties.  I cannot see offhand that there is.  I do not see any reason why it should be left out but I would have to return the question in this sense that if removing it makes no difference then being there should not be a difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking because I see a difficulty; I am asking so that I can understand.  If the section meant something it would be imposing some requirement.  That was my initial question.  It would require that there should be some publication of this information and I could see reasons for that. After all, we are making it a criminal offence not to inform the Stock Exchange.  It could well be a legislative purpose to require some publication but then not direct how this is to be done, leaving it to the discretion of the Stock Exchange how that would be communicated. As I have understood it &mdash; and the Minister may further clarify it &mdash; that is not what is being done and so the section adds nothing but the Minister feels: why not have it in there anyway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it would make a major difference to leave it out.  We will certainly have a look at <Col N="1731" /> that.  You could argue, however, that it does lay a slight onus on the Stock Exchange to consider very seriously as to what they are going to do with this information.  It has that insinuation in it that they may publish it.  If they are to make that decision, then it lays on them the clear job of not just filing the information in the outer office &mdash; not that they would do that, I think &mdash; but of seriously considering the information to give effect to whether they may or may not publish it.  You could make that argument.  I do not feel that strongly about it, if from a drafting point of view it is not necessary.</P>
      <P>What I want to do is clear, which is to say that the company must tell the Stock Exchange and the Stock Exchange should consider the information very seriously and then decide what to do with the information in the best interests of the investor and the company.  That is what I want to achieve here.  So, we will certainly look at leaving that out if the Senator feels strongly about it but perhaps it does put a slight onus on them to consider seriously what they are going to do with this information. To that extent, on balance, I would prefer to leave it there unless the matter is pressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, a great source of irritation to me personally, and I am sure to the Minister, is the amount of financial resources available in the State which are not being invested in public companies or in private companies.  I will certainly take advantage of this section to ask the Minister to highlight the situation in the Stock Exchange about small companies.  Various moves have been made over the past year or so to make the Stock Exchange more relevant to the smaller investor and to the small companies sector in the market.  I do not think they have been successful enough in that regard and perhaps the Minister would use his good offices to enable one stop shops to be operated by the stock market in order to attract the smaller investor rather than having to go through the expensive procedure of going to a stockbroker with the natural inhibitions a normal country individual would have in <Col N="1732" /> doing so in the capital city.  People generally would like &mdash; if they got the opportunity &mdash; to invest in public companies or private companies on the stock market and they do not get enough opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in the section we are talking about the publication of certain information as a result of an investment in the Stock Exchange.  Does that mean that if somebody as a director of a company, as a private individual invests in shares on the Stock Exchange, he or she would have that information published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are notifications in a public company, when the company has been told by the people who are supposed to tell it, the directors and secretaries, that the company has not that information on the Stock Exchange, all that section does is make sure that the link between the company and the Stock Exchange is kept tight.  The general stipulation here is that if you hold shares you notify the company.  What we are now saying is that you must tell the Stock Exchange if your company is on the Stock Exchange.  Obviously if the company is not, they would not be interested.  That is really all it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take this opportunity to say two things quickly, because I think the Senator is right about it.  The Government want to see wider share ownership. We want to see more people holding shares because if more people hold shares in Irish industry then more people have a stake in it and more people are concerned about the results of it.  This legislation will make it easier for people to operate in holding shares because it will be a lot more visible and above board in many ways.  It will bring in the wider public.  I would like to use the occasion to appeal for wider share ownership right across the board.  One scheme in particular called the Business Expansion Scheme has been very successful.  Basically it says that if you invest £25,000 of your personal income, your private money, in a manufacturing company or, indeed, if a trading house or some tourist amenities are being selected, you can write that £25,000 off <Col N="1733" /> against your personal income.  So, if you are a doctor, a dentist, a teacher, or a barrister or you have got other business interests, you can reduce your ultimate tax liability by investing that £25,000 in a manufacturing company.  That is a scheme that is attuned to get wider share ownership.</P>
    <P>We will be looking at more and more areas where we can encourage your average Irish person to put money into companies, to buy shares and to participate. That is why the Stock Exchange, for example, have brought in the Smaller Companies Market.  I agree that we must bring more people in as shareholders. The Smaller Companies Market is beginning to move now and more and more ordinary individuals are buying shares.  It does not have to be the Stock Exchange. That is one route.  You can do it privately: you can increase it into a business expansion fund scheme.  These funds are being set up where you can buy a share in a company by investing in a business expansion scheme fund so there are more and more financial instruments allowing people to invest in Irish business.</P>
    <P>I want to encourage more and more people to do that by owning shares.  It is no shame &mdash; quite the contrary.  One should be proud to hold shares in any company in Irish industry and be quite prepared to say so.  Sometimes there is an ethos which goes in the other direction which I would disapprove of that if you hold shares it is something you have to hide or pretend is not the case.  That is totally the wrong impression and feeling that this country needs at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for those points of clarification and his appeal to people to become more share-orientated as it were.  We concur very firmly on those matters.  I am glad of the opportunity to acknowledge the amount of work a former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy John Bruton, did in trying to get worker participation and worker shareholders involved in their own businesses and in the setting up and establishment of the Business Expansion <Col N="1734" /> Scheme.  Those innovations are now seen to be of tremendous benefit in creating more employment, in getting money that is dormant, active.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is trying to set a certain note but I must say I do not think people are ashamed to hold shares.  I think they do not have the wherewithal to acquire shares.  That is more of a problem, perhaps. If I could come back to the section from which we ranged rather far, there is a point under subsection (3) on which I would welcome clarification.  It is of some significance.  In relation to default, this section imposes a duty on the company to notify the Stock Exchange but subsection (3) says: &ldquo;If default is made in complying with the section, the company and every officer of the company who is in default&rdquo;&mdash; who is that?  How do they know they are in default?  They are exposed to prosecution, either summary or on indictment.  It should be very clear who might be in default.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can get the reference, but I understand it is every officer of the company who is knowingly in default.  The 1963 Act has the definition that &ldquo;failure to comply with the obligation imposed under subsection (1) will be an offence punishable by a fine not exceeding....  Those liable to prosecution in relation to the offence are the company and every officer of the company who is in default.&rdquo;  An officer in default is defined in section 3 (8) (iii) of the 1963 Act as meaning &ldquo;any officer of the company who knowingly and wilfully authorises or permits the default in question&rdquo;, so it refers back to section 3 (8) (iii) of the 1963 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that that would apply without a reference to it?  In relation to directors' reports we refer to section 128 of the Companies Act of 1963; would it be more appropriate to make it an actual specific reference here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be, but I do not see any difficulty with this 1963 <Col N="1735" /> solution either which seems to be reasonably clear &mdash; any officer of the company who knowingly and wilfully authorises or permits the default in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>

      <P>This section deals with investigations by the Minister into suspected contravention of the provisions of the Bill concerned with dealings by directors in the shares of their own companies. Subsection (6) specifies various other provisions of the Bill which are to apply to such situations.  Looking again at the provisions, in subsection (6) there appears to be unnecessary duplication in some cases.  For example, section 10 of the Bill need not be mentioned since it is already referred to in subsection (3). Section 11 need not be mentioned since the substance of it is contained in subsections (4) and (5).  Section 186 will <Col N="1736" /> apply automatically anyway.  The amendment would delete the present references in subsection (6) to sections 10, 11 and 186 on the basis that these provisions would already apply to such investigations by virtue of other provisions of the Bill.

Under subsection (5) it is provided that any such report may be written or printed, as the Minister may direct, and the Minister may cause it to be published. It would be helpful if the Minister could indicate the circumstances in which reports of this kind, if there were investigations, would be likely to be published. I ask because if the report discloses contraventions presumably they would be properly dealt with by way of prosecutions either by the Minister or the DPP and, therefore, might there be a difficulty in publication?  It is only if the inspector finds all is well that there would be publication?  If so, what would be the interest in having publication?</P>

      <P>Moving on to Chapter 3 of the Bill, for general information this chapter generally is different in that it applies only to public limited companies. There is a limit of 5 per cent put in for notification.  If you hold more than 5 per cent in a public limited company then the notification procedure is put in place.  We are not dealing in this chapter with private companies.  It is important to make that distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 63 is to make it clear in the avoidance of doubt provision in section 59 (2) (a) that the <Col N="1738" /> doubt we are clearing up is the case where the company's relevant &mdash; that is voting &mdash; share capital is divided into different classes and not where the whole of the company's capital is so divided.  The whole scope of this Chapter 3 is limited to interest held in the voting capital of public limited companies.  This is made clear in the preamble to subsection (2). All this amendment does is to make it clear that we are speaking about voting capital in paragraph (a) of the subsection as well.</P>

      <P>These are purely drafting amendments in most cases.  They arise because it is only in Chapter 3 that reference to a percentage share holding occurs.  In other words, a shareholder holding more than a certain percentage of the shares is required to notify that fact to the company.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <P>These amendments are purely drafting amendments and would make no substantive change in the <Col N="1739" /> Bill.  Like some of the other amendments we have prepared under Part IV of the Bill, these two are intended to tidy up the drafting and eliminate unnecessary complications.  There are essentially two reasons for the two amendments.  First, there is not much point in saying as section 59 (4) does in the opening three lines that &ldquo;the existence of an obligation in a particular case depends in part on the circumstances obtaining before and after whatever is in that case the relevant time&rdquo;, without mentioning what else it also &ldquo;partly&rdquo; depends on.  Not only that, the opening two-and-a-half lines of subsection (4) appear to simply repeat what is in section 60 (4) (5).</P>
      <P>The real object of section 59 (4) is simply to define a particular point in time at which a person buys or sells his shares so that it can be established that he has X per cent of a company's shares before that time and Y per cent of a company's shares after that time.  The second thing these two related amendments do is to shift the actual definition of &ldquo;relevant time&rdquo; to section 60.  Amendment No. 67 actually does this.  The reason is that there seems to be no reason to leave the definition in section 59 as there will now be no mention of &ldquo;relevant time&rdquo; until section 60.  Section 59 establishes basic parameters in relation to notification requirements and the definition of a particular phrase and without any refernce to that phrase in the section it would seem to be somewhat out of place.  We propose, therefore, to insert a new subsection at the end of section 60 containing the definition of &ldquo;relevant time&rdquo; and amendment No. 67 does this.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot resist making a very serious point on amendment 66.  It is really with the greatest reluctance that I accept the Minister's reason for shifting the subsection into section 60 and redrafting the subsection because as section 59 (4) stands at the moment, it is such a <Col N="1740" /> wonderful subsection for any lawyer: it really is a gift.  It necessarily requires a legal opinion and, therefore, the work of lawyers.  I declare that I am being self-sacrificing in being prepared to let that one go.</P>

      <P>On the interest to be disclosed &mdash; and the Minister has drawn the important distinction that we are now talking about disclosure of shareholding interest in public limited companies &mdash;could the Minister identify whether there is a substantial difference between the type of disclosure here and the type of disclosure of interest for directors and secretaries under section 49?  In other words, it is difficult to compare the sections because they are quite complex but as between the disclosure of an interest under section 49, in the context of section 49, and the disclosure of the interest here, is there a difference?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The most obvious one is the 5 per cent.  That is not required in private companies; it is in public companies. In public limited companies we are talking about voting shares.  I do not think that specific stipulation is laid down <Col N="1741" /> in the case of private companies.  They would be the two major ones as far as I am concerned.  There may be other detailed ones which we will dig up for the Senator's information.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete subsection (4) of section 62 which currently provides for approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas of regulations made by the Minister under this section.  This provision is unnecessary, however, since there is already provision in the 1963 Companies Act which provides for the same thing, that is section 396, and this Bill and the 1963 Act are by virtue of section 1 of the Bill to be construed together.</P>

      <P>I should like to have clarification on that.  I do not have section 396 of the 1963 Act in front of me at the moment.  Perhaps the Minister would help me.  I take it that the effect would be that, where any change is made in the 5 per cent, which is the cut off for disclosure, the Minister is satisfied that under section 396 of the existing Companies Act any regulation would have to be laid in precisely the manner which is provided for here subject to annulment of 21 days.</P>

      <P>I am not so sure if it is applicable here but the obligation to notify is within the same five day period. We are talking about possibly a more ascertainable issue which probably does not give rise to quite the same concern as the notification of interest under section 49.  I would be interested in the Minister's response as to whether he concedes that there could be a difference in the nature of the obligation to notify within the prescribed period.  Under the next section we are talking about notification of family and corporate interests but these are clearly defined interests in the voting share capital of public companies.  That is very defined and definable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has played a very valuable role in concentrating her mind on the need for transitional provisions in the case of private companies.  That is something we will <Col N="1743" /> need to have a very close look at, particularly when you consider we have already a form of transitional provision here in regard to public companies in section 81 which effectively extends it in certain circumstances to ten days.  That is the effect of section 81 on entry into force of sections 59 and 65.  There is a form of transitional arrangement there which is more benign for public companies.  That probably strengthens the Senator's argument that if it is that benign for public companies it should be at least as benign for private ones.  We will certainly have a very close look at that.  This one is OK for public companies.</P>

      <P>This section deals with concert parties and we are proposing this amendment for two reasons.  First, we are only interested in concert parties which involve acquisitions and disposal of relevant shares, in other words, shares carrying unrestricted voting rights.  We are not concerned with arrangements which involve acquisitions of any kind of share capital, for example, non-voting preference shares and so on.  Secondly, we think it is necessary to make clear that this group of sections, 65 to 67, dealing with concert parties applies only and solely to public limited companies and not to all companies.  As section 65 stands the concert party provisions could be interpreted to apply to all companies and we would not obviously want this to be the situation.  It is to make sure that it is clear that it is only to public companies.</P>

      <P>The sole purpose of these two separate amendments is to put ACC, ICC and Fóir Teoranta on the same footing as the pure banking bodies mentioned in section 70 (4) (a), (i) and (ii), in other words licensed banks, Trustees Savings Banks and the Post Office Savings Bank.  It has been represented to us that ACC and ICC in particular carry on businesses in the same way as the bodies which are licensed banks under the Central Bank Act and that the same rule should not, accordingly, apply to them as far as exemption under this section in certain circumstances is concerned. This seems to us to be a reasonable approach and is the reason for the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentally, I would like to reassure the House that neither this amendment nor indeed subsection (4) generally will <Col N="1749" /> give banks a general exemption from disclosure of interests and shares under the Bill.  All we are saying here is that where a bank holds an interest in shares merely as security, for example as collateral for a loan to a customer, they will be exempted from the disclosure rules.</P>

      <P>These four amendments are related to amendments we have already made to the earlier sections of Part IV, Chapter 2 of the Bill.  As I said on those sections, what we have in mind is to ensure that both Chapters 2 and 3 of this part are each effectively self contained with the minimum of overlapping between them.  In the case of these four amendments we think it is confusing to be creating in Chapter 3 sanctions for non-compliance with various provisions of Chapter 2.  The purpose of these related amendments, therefore, is to remove the reference to Chapter 2 from subsections (1), (2), (3) (a) and (7) (a) of section 71.  The new sections we have now put in before section 53 will effectively provide for the same arrangement but in a self contained way in Chapter 2, where we think they belong.</P>

      <P>The reason for the duty in the last two lines and the deletion of section 71, as currently drafted, is that a director who is making a disclosure of interest to his company shall be required to make clear to the company what exact duty he is fulfilling, in other words, which section or sections of the Bill he is declaring his interest under.  This is because the director will be subject to the rules both in Chapter 2 and in Chapter 3.  If the secretary of the company had a sizeable holding in the company then, like a director in a similar situation, he could be subject to the rules of disclosure of both Chapters 2 and 3.  This amendment therefore, would put the secretary in the same position as the director <i>vis-a-vis</i> the obligation in section 71 (2) to specify the particular duty under which he was making his disclosure.</P>

The amendment provides that a person could require that the nature of his interest in shares or debentures should be indicated in the register.  He may wish it to be recorded that he is not the beneficial owner of certain shares but merely holds them as trustee for somebody else.

      <P>The reason for this amendment is that the coverage of offences here in this section seems to be incomplete.  As currently drafted, contravention of subsections (3) or (8) would not be an offence.  On reflection they should be.  Subsection (3) requires the company to enter information received from shareholders within three days.  It would be important to make sure that it would be private since the whole purpose of disclosure provisions would be prejudiced if public limited companies did not keep their registers or interest up to date. Subsection (8) requires the public limited company to keep its register of interests at its registered office and to make arrangements to allow inspection of it by anyone interested.  There would be little point in having these requirements if we did not make sure they were observed.</P>

Does this mean that if it is kept under the requirements of the previous chapter it will be kept indefinitely? An entry against a person's name can be removed if more than six years have elapsed.

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Does this mean that once you are on a register you are going to be there for ever though you may not be a current director?  In other words, you can go back through the records of the company and you will find <Col N="1758" /> in the case of the public limited companies voting shares after six years have been deleted.  Why is there a cut-off here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason. In the case of the public company, six years seems to be a sensible cut-off point. There is a greater turnover in the shares, so there is much more activity.  In the case of the private company it is unlikely that you would have that much difficulty in having it going back further because there would be little turnover.  Compared to the turnover in a public company it would be minimal.  There is no problem about holding it going back because obviously the date of the interest will be attached to it.  There would be no question of it hanging there as if it was applying to some date other than the date on which it was mentioned.</P>

      <P>The provisions of Chapter 3, sections 59 to 81 apply to all share requisitions and disposals made after the date on which the relevant provisions came into effect.  The purpose of section 81 (1) on the other hand is to apply the same rules of disclosure to persons who already have interests on the date the Act came into force.  However, the present wording of section 81 (1) does not achieve this.  A person who has a substantial interest on the date of commencement could not on that date actually be subject to the notification requirement under section 59.  In other words, we have here a kind of legal conundrum. The amendment will solve this difficulty by deeming a person to have an interest for the purpose of the Bill regardless of whether he has it when the Bill comes into force or requires it after that date.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), section 63 (1) shall apply as if, for the period of 5 days there mentioned, there were substituted a period of 10 days.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Section 81 (2) is a transitional measure the purpose of which is to allow people who have notifiable interest on the date the Bill comes into force the longer period, as I explained earlier to Senator Robinson, the period of ten days to make the required notification rather than the standard five days.  There are two reasons for this amendment which would substitute a new wording in subsection (2) for the <Col N="1760" /> existing one.  First, the existing wording seems somewhat confusing.  At first glance it seems to be saying that section 63 (1) will not apply and then that it will.</P>
      <P>There is a more important point of substance, however.  As I have already mentioned, we say that section 63 (1) will not apply to cases arising under subsection (1) of this section, nevertheless a person will have to notify existing interests under section 63 (1) within ten days instead.  However, section 63 (1) provides not only a time limit but also that the notification must be in writing. The present version of section 81 (1) would remove the requirement for the notification to be in writing in a case to which that subsection referred.  The amendment would preserve this &ldquo;notification in writing&rdquo; requirement as well as, I hope, improving the clarity of the subsection.</P>

      <P>This is really a drafting amendment.  I accept that it is retaining the transitional provision of having a period of ten days.  Earlier we were discussing the need for a somewhat similar provision in the early section or at least parity with those who hold voting shares in public limited companies for the disclosure provisions in the other part.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 92:</P>
      <P>In page 74, between lines 26 and 27, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>(3)  Any reference in this Chapter to share capital or relevant share capital shall, in relation to a company, be deemed to be a reference to the issued share capital of a class carrying rights to vote in all circumstances at general meetings of the company, and references to shares shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me explain to the <Col N="1761" /> House, to keep ourselves on track, we are starting on Chapter 4 of the Bill which deals with companies other than public limited companies.  We are talking here about non-directors in non-public limited companies.  This is where you start into the court procedure for getting information.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 92 is to make it clear what the scope of the disclosure of orders made under Chapter 4 is.  The intention is that the scope of an order and, indeed, of the whole chapter should in so far as shares are concerned be confined to relevant shares, that is shares carrying full, unrestricted voting rights.  This is the approach we adopt in Chapter 3 of this Part in relation to public limited companies as Senators will recall.</P>
      <P>The reason for this limitation in Chapter 4 also is that whatever classes of shares a private company choose to have are essentially their own affair, and all that needs to concern the court or the applicant for a disclosure order is the identity of those who hold shares with voting rights, that is, those who exercise the real control and influence over the affairs of that company.  The problem at present is that the references throughout the chapter are not consistent.  In some cases, for example, section 83 (7) and section 85 (1), the reference is to relevant share capital while other sections simply refer to share capital.  While it could be argued that referring to relevant share capital in sections 83 (7) and 85 (1) (a) is enough to ensure that the scope of Chapter 4 is limited to relevant shares, it is probably worthwhile putting the matter beyond doubt.</P>

      <P>The purpose and thrust of the chapter have been made clear by the Minister in introducing this amendment, but I want to clarify that what the Minister is proposing to make particularly clear by putting it in here at the start of the chapter is that the disclosure in this chapter relates only to the relevant share capital of the voting shares in a company and no other type of interest; we are specifying one type of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be concerned about the exclusion of building societies. I know every policy holder or mortgage holder is deemed to be a shareholder in a building society in theory, but in practice over the years we have seen grave disquiet over the manner in which building societies operate their business and the difficulty or otherwise of the normal shareholder getting on to the board of a building society.  Would the Minister care to comment on whether the building societies in regard to the Companies (No. 2) Bill are too loosely termed under the building society legislation which is in the Department of the Environment jurisdiction? If so, can he do something to give each mortgage holder or policy holder in a building society an opportunity to have a greater say in the running of a building society and in the operations of its management?</P>

      <P>I would be sorely tempted, were it not for the fact that we are coming up to four hours of this, to get into that debate with the Senator but I do not think I should.  Firstly, this Bill is trying to do a great deal.  I do not think <Col N="1763" /> it should try to sort out shareholding structures of building societies which are very complicated institutions and if there are to be any changes in that area ideally it should be in building society regulations or under building society legislation. In other words, we have concluded in bringing forward this Bill that it would not make sense to try to do anything other than deal with the normal company.  If we tried to deal with building societies in a Bill like this, we would become totally confused.  In other words, building societies should be dealt with separately under building society legislation. That is why I have excluded it here.</P>

      <P>You have the wrong Minister for that because this is in the area of the Departments of the Environment and Finance.  There are a number of regulatory authorities dealing with building societies and all financial institutions. It is just not in our area.  The Central Bank has some role in these things and there is a register of friendly societies and so on.  There is a regime there to deal with the control and the future of building societies.  That is not something I would like to get into tonight.</P>

      <P>Having sat here for the best part of an hour I feel qualified to stand up at this stage.  I would like some clarification because of a variety of interests.  Section 82, (1) (d) of the Bill reads:</P>
      <P>any body corporate which is prohibited by statute or otherwise from making any distribution of its income or property among its members...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to incorporate a considerable <Col N="1764" /> area of charitable organisations, voluntary organisations and, I suspect, religious communities; I am not quite sure.  Could the Minister elaborate a little on the extent of the application of that because questions about charities, in particular, often arise?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is quite correct.  The intention is to exempt institutions, mainly charities, who would not be distributing their income among their members.  That phrase is used because distribution of income among members is a sign that they are a company, as it were.  The intention is to exclude charities and such like.  Before we finish the Bill, I will, if I can, give the Senator a list of what we exempt.  That is the clear intention of it.</P>

      <Col N="1765" /> SECTION 83.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 93:</P>
    <P>In page 74, lines 38 and 39, to delete &ldquo;not later than a date specified in the order&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a drafting problem.  While the idea of a date by which a disclosure order must be complied with is contained in subsection (1) (a) of this section, we have not inserted a similar form of words in paragraphs (b) or (c).  However, rather than insert the same words in these two paragraphs, a more suitable course would probably be to delete them altogether from the subsection. This is on the basis of specifying a date by which information must be given but would be more suitably left to the rules and practices of the court.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 94:</P>
      <P>In page 75, line 15, to delete &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo;, and substitue &ldquo;is of the opinion&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, this is a drafting problem.  Requiring the court under section 83 (5) (b) (i) to satisfy itself that the financial interests of an applicant in a disclosure order would be prejudiced by the non-disclosure of interest in shares in the company concerned is asking too much of the court as it is effectively a burden of proof that would be too difficult for it to discharge.  The reasoning here is that, in many cases, the court could not be satisfied that prejudice would result from non-disclosure until the disclosure has taken place because the existence or non-existence of prejudice would become apparent only after the information sought was disclosed under the order.  This would put the court in a very difficult position indeed.  The wording of the amendment would reduce the difficulties of the court in this regard by requiring it merely to take a view <Col N="1766" /> about the possible prejudice of the applicant by non-disclosure rather than requiring the court to satisfy itself about likely prejudice.  Overall the amendment is simply intended to help make the disclosure regime more workable and practical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be not surprised but pleased to know that I support that amendment.  To require the court to have a standard of being satisfied would be too much of a burden to make the section effective for the reasons clearly outlined by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 95:</P>
      <P>In page 75, subsection (5) (b), lines 19 and 20, to delete subparagraph (ii).</P>
      <P>The amendment is quite clear.  In adjudicating as to whether a disclosure order may be made, the court is required, in the light of the Minister's opinion, to be of the opinion: (i) that the financial interest of the applicant is or will be prejudiced by the non-disclosure of any interest in the shares or debentures of the company; and (2) the application is not made in contemplation or in furtherance of a trade dispute.  What I find most extraordinary about this is that a reference to a trade dispute is inserted in the middle of a large and complex Companies Bill which is long overdue.  The various huge and substantial documents about it which I have received and have endeavoured to read all agree at least that it is badly needed and well intentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is so threatening to a company that they could use the argument that somebody might be contemplating a trade dispute?  I am fascinated by the fact that the person who has a financial interest in a company may apply for a disclosure order, but an employee who I suspect under subsection (6) probably does not have a financial interest according to the law but quite clearly to the ordinary layperson has a fundamental <Col N="1767" /> financial interest, that is his job in a company, is precluded from seeking financial information about who controls the company, simply because the court could form the opinion that the application is made in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.  It seems to me that somebody somewhere got a notion that we could not let these nasty trade unions do this sort of thing and therefore we must prevent it.</P>
    <P>I do not think disclosure orders of the kind contemplated under these sections would be sought frequently.  Unfortunately, the trade union movement perhaps is not as good as it should be at assembling the information that legally could be availed of.  The logic behind that subsection excapes me.  I cannot see what fundamental interest of a company would be threatened by its employees who are furthering a trade dispute trying to find out who controls the company.  Secondly, why the absolutely unprovable assertion that somebody was contemplating a trade dispute?</P>
    <P>Given the ups and down of Irish industrial relations, I am not permitted to mention names but one large supermarket who have an appalling level of industrial relations could perpetually argue that some of their employees were contemplating an industrial dispute because they have such a bad record of industrial relations.  They could say effectively that employees could not at any stage seek a disclosure order about who had an interest in the company simply because they were &ldquo;contemplating&rdquo; an industrial dispute.  There might be &mdash; although I do not accept it &mdash; an argument for not disclosing information where the application is in furtherance of a trade dispute.</P>
    <P>To put in something as vague as &ldquo;in contemplation of a trade dispute seems to me to be effectively loading the dice completely against people who have a very fundamental interest in the future, structure and ownership of the company, that is, the employees.  I will come back to that when we are dealing with the section because I think subsection (6) <Col N="1768" /> deserves some elaboration from the Minister as to what precisely all these interesting topics mean.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole is here so no doubt he will elaborate on what I have just said. I simply move the amendment on the grounds that it seems to me to be invidious to pick out one specific area of activity and exclude that for reasons which perhaps the Minister can explain to us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the upturn in the Tourist Industry and expresses support for the restructuring of Bord Fáilte on a regional basis.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport for coming in to the House for this debate. We can accept from the Minister's involvement that he is keenly committed to the development of the tourist industry to its full potential, which is what we are all trying to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is recognised by all of us that there is an upturn in the tourist industry. I welcome that development.  I come from an area where tourism is very important.  We are concerned at this stage as to how we should maximise and take full advantage of this improvement in the industry.  I am glad to have had the opportunity to put this motion before the Seanad this evening.  I hope it will be <Col N="1769" /> accepted in the spirit in which I put it down and that the Minister will recognise that it is out of a genuine concern for the tourist industry that the motion comes before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the task force on tourism.  That is an additional bonus and, also, a welcome development. I hope that the task force have the support of those who are interested in the development of the industry.  In that regard I suggest to the Minister that as far as possible the task force should have an opportunity of meeting with local authorities.  Donegal County Council are keenly interested to assist and co-operate with the task force and I ask the Minister to arrange, at an early date, a meeting between the task force and Donegal County Council.  I and my colleagues in the local authority in Donegal would welcome such an opportunity and we would offer constructive proposals to develop the tourism industry in that area.  I put forward that suggestion to the Minister.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for putting forward the motion is that we recognise the upturn and improvements in the tourist industry. We recognise also that despite all the difficulties now pertaining in the North, there has been an upturn and substantial improvements in the tourism industry there.  This is encouragement for us.  We are aware of the general improvements in the industry both North and South. The improvements in the industry in the Six Counties have been such that members of the tourist industry there participated in a work shop at the RDS two weeks ago.  That is a welcome development because if there are improvements in the industry in the six Counties, which has gone through difficult times up to now for many reasons, this can only add to the overall picture of improvements for tourists who come to the country as a whole.  We have long recognised that if we want to develop tourism to its full potential, we have to do it in co-operation with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  That is recognised in Belfast and I hope it is recognised in the South also.</P>
    <P>The motion was put down mainly <Col N="1770" /> because some areas have been neglected. There is no question about that.  I claim that County Donegal is one of the areas that has been neglected.  County Donegal is part of a Donegal-Leitrim-Sligo tourism organisation.  I claim that tourism organisations, as they were structured and set up, got minimal finance and there was very little they could do.  It is not enough for them to print glossy brochures, attend festivals and see the nice guys.  It is a harder job than that because they have to compete with areas in Europe and other parts of the world that have sunshine, facilities and attractions that we in Ireland do not have.  Therefore, they will not succeed if the tourism industry is not promoted on an organised basis.</P>
    <P>For many years we in County Donegal have complained that we have not got our fair share of the money that is spent nationally on promoting tourism.  I want to outline what our greatest grievances are.  The budget for tourism development has been in existence for a number of years.  Bord Fáilte have given grants for the development of hotels, the provision of rooms with baths and for general improvements in hotel furnishings and fittings.  That development stopped when a number of people, largely based in big centres like this city, had developed their hotels fully and had enough bedrooms with bathrooms.  We would have some difficulty in believing that the structure of Bord Fáilte is a proper one.  We would rather see people who have not got a vested or personal interest in certain areas directing the spending of the funds of Bord Fáilte.  That would be the proper structure for Bord Fáilte.  Money should not be spent in areas where the benefit will come to those who have already made it in the industry.</P>
    <P>In the north west there are many examples of how a lack of funds and lack of input has cost us dearly.  A substantial amount of the Bord Fáilte budget for marketing is spent abroad and the benefits from that expenditure abroad largely come back to the areas that already have got the lion's share.  I feel that in comparison <Col N="1771" /> with areas like Dublin and Shannon and other areas in the south, the north-west has not got its fair share of expenditure.  This is an area which is ripe for development and expenditure in that area would produce a vast return and create employment.  Therefore, any expenditure on tourism development there would be worthwhile because it would come back to the Exchequer in substantial revenue.  I will not labour that point.  I have said it many times and it has been said by many other people also.</P>
    <P>I hope the upturn in tourism and the appointment of the task force are forerunners to the Government's acceptance that there is a need to restructure Bord Fáilte on a regional basis and that the regions must be strong enough to stand on their own feet and promote the industry on the ground.  I want to say to the Minister that if it is necessary to have a health board in a region to promote health care, then it is no less necessary to have a tourism organisation who have a budget in an area also.  There is no point in having an agency who distribute brochures and attend festivals.  That is not sufficient.  It has long been recognised that the regional tourism organisations have no teeth, no budgets and no ability to promote the industry.</P>
    <P>Now is the opportune time for areas such as the west and the county I come from to put forward their claim to be part of any restructuring that will come about in the industry.  I represent an area where unemployment is very high.  As I said before when I spoke on different subjects, there are 20,000 young people in secondary schools in my area.  When they leave school about 1,000 of them will find places at third level colleges in County Donegal, another couple of thousand will go to university and a big number of them will have to find jobs in the area.  A public representative has an obligation and duty to strive for the development of his area and to help in respect of employment.  I believe I am only doing my duty in bringing to the attention of the Minister in <Col N="1772" /> charge of tourism the high value of promoting tourism in the West and in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous potential for growth in the tourism industry.  I have said on many occasions that if we want to provide employment for people tourism offers the best hope.  We have a lesser chance of providing employment in agriculture. It is a contracting business and it is very difficult to sustain employment on farms.  Tourism will also help the garment industry, the tweed industry and the fishing industry.  I appeal to the Minister to accept that there is potential for the development of the tourist industry in rural areas such as Donegal.  He should recognise that if we want to provide employment for young people in their own country the tourism industry must be developed.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to accept that Bord Fáilte made a decision to close their office in Glasgow.  Anybody who comes from the West knows that we have had an emigration problem for years, and not just now, and that most of the people who emigrated from the north-west, especially Donegal, went to Glasgow and other parts of Scotland.  The Bord Fáilte representative in Glasgow worked out of the back of a shop.  He did not have a big elaborate office.  He had no car and when I was on a promotional trip with Donegal people he hired a van to take us around to the tourist agents.  He was on first name terms with them.  He was a one man show.  There was no big expenditure involved in keeping that office open; yet Bord Fáilte are so removed from the position on the ground that they closed down that office.</P>
    <P>I do not understand, and I do not think anybody else in the west understands, the thinking in Bord Fáilte on their decision to close the Glasgow office.  I venture to say to the Minister that this was the cheapest office to run that Bord Fáilte had.  They have many other offices all over the world and some of them are up to embassy standard or used as social centres.  That may be very important but I think we are entitled to question the value of those areas of high expenditure. <Col N="1773" /> I believe the Minister agrees with what I am saying.  He comes from an area like mine and I believe that if he was in my position he would make a more eloquent contribution but his case would not be much different.</P>
    <P>Rural areas have suffered serious neglect.  I have a number of brochures with me that are distributed in New York. It is fair to say to the Minister that the nearest references to the north-west in any of the brochures are Galway and Dublin.  That is an argument that is very easy to prove.  It goes beyond any doubt that the area is totally neglected.  It is neglected to the point that the tourism agents who sell the country do not consider it worthwhile to name County Donegal or any of the Six Counties in their brochures.</P>

    <P>I have no difficulty in highlighting to the Minister how important it is to restructure Bord Fáilte in such a way that the areas with the greatest potential for employment are brought into focus and that some money is spent there, thereby giving a valuable return to the Exchequer and relieving the necessity to pump dole money into rural areas.  I hope to live to see the day when the lorryload of money with the Army on every side of it, is stopped going into rural areas.  I cringe at the sight of that van because it is destructive for the moral fibre of the areas it goes into.  My ambition is that that vanload of money which goes to employment exchanges is stopped.  It is not that I think it is not needed.  I totally subscribe to the fact that it is needed. Perhaps more is needed because it is an effort to sustain people and keep them <Col N="1774" /> alive.  However, why do we channel money into that area when we can cure the cancer that is already there?  It is abundantly clear to many of us that there must be a recognition of the areas where money can be spent so that people can come off the dole and young boys and girls can be rescued.  This is part of what has to be done and I do not see any way of doing it other than by restructuring Bord Fáilte and creating regional organisations who can stand on their feet and promote industry.  I do not see any other way of doing it.  Any representative who does not recognise that it is essential for him to make a case for his area will be failing in his duty.</P>
    <P>I have a copy of a map, which I will also pass on to the Minister, which shows that both sides of the Border are blighted by unemployment to the point that they show up black on the map.  Many speakers in their contributions will talk about Cork, Shannon, Galway, Wicklow and Dublin but I believe the North is a good subject to talk about, but a hard one to deliver on.  One way to deliver on it is to recognise that the root cause of some of the difficulties there is high unemployment. The areas of Strabane, Omagh and Derry across the river from where I live have the highest unemployment in Europe.  Therefore, there must be a special interest shown in that area.  There is no point in paying lip service to it and looking for a special debate on it when there is a tragedy or somebody is shot, if that concern goes out the window the day after.  People who express concern about that area have to be consistent and recognise that the problem there is basically rooted in the Border problem.  Many people make forecasts about what will happen and how long it will take before the troubles in that area are over.  They hope that a generation will come along who will forget it all.  However, it is very hard to forget about it if you live in that blighted patch which stands out so clearly on the map.</P>
    <P>I have numerous reports on the Border area.  I would not be able to do justice to the case for that area in one day.  In 1983 the European Social and Economic <Col N="1775" /> Committee issued a report on Irish Border areas which covered all of the Border from Dundalk to Moville in Donegal.  That report was submitted to both the Irish Government and the British Government.  Financial experts in Dublin costed the implementation of the recommendations of that document at £800 million.  There was no way the Irish Governments had funds to implement those recommendations.  Since 1983, that document has been lying either in a wastebasket or is covered in dust.  The only people who got anything from that document were the firm of consultants who drew it up.  The document covered such a wide area that it was not possible to implement its recommendations.  I will give the Minister the page from the economic and social study which was done in 1983 and which highlights the high unemployment in the Border areas.  No matter what form of concern Members of this House express about the North I ask them to recognise that a basic cause for some of that unrest is the unemployment in the area.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that I must keep to the time.  I could cover many other areas but I would like to bring two small points to the Minister's notice.  Recently, the Minister for the Marine introduced licence fees for fishing in rivers and lakes. This is the first opportunity I have had to totally support the introduction of those charges on the basis that rod fishing in lakes and rivers had become like a town hall &mdash; everybody used it but nobody wanted to lock the door, pay for the light, clean the windows or do the maintenance. That is what fishing in our lakes and rivers had turned into.  The people who are catcalling that we should not impose a charge for rod fishing are the very same people who are calling on the Government to spend money on keeping our lakes and rivers free from pollution. That costs money.  I recognise that clean lakes and rivers and the fishing industry is a vital part of promoting the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I want to use this occasion to say that <Col N="1776" /> I totally support the introduction of charges for rod fishing.  However, I think we have done it too late.  We were the only country in the world that had free fishing. But free fishing meant that we had less than the best quality fishing.  We have a very valuable amenity and we now recognise that we have to take control of it and spend money on it.  I do not think those people who have to pay a small free for a rod licence will complain because the fishing and the rivers will be improved. Most people spend money on one thing or another.  A packet of cigarettes costs £2 and by comparison £10 or £15 for a fishing licence is very small.</P>
    <P>I want to use this opportunity to support the introduction of licensing fees and to encourage the Government to spend more on eliminating pollution.  Many of our beaches in the country have qualified for a blue flag, European recognition that a beach is clean and comes up to certain standards.  A number of beaches in County Donegal have qualified for the blue flag.  I ask the Minister to promote that aspect of tourism development.  We should ensure we achieve the highest possible standard of clean and properly cared for beaches and reach the point where all beaches in the country will qualify for a blue flag.  That should be our goal, and we should try to achieve it.  If we follow these guidelines the tourism industry should contribute in a very substantial way to employment.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see fit to restructure Bord Fáilte.  I took up this point with the present Director General, Michael McNulty.  He said the rent of the glasshouse at Baggot Street Bridge only costs buttons but he missed the point. The fact is that head office is sitting there and there are a number of people who are inward looking, backward looking and who are entrenched in an outdated method of selling the tourism industry.</P>

I hope it focuses some attention on the potential for development of the industry in the area I come from.  Let me assure the Minister that the people in my county are very concerned about tourism. They want to play a part.  I started by asking for a meeting with the new task force and I will finish by expressing the hope that the Minister can arrange it.</P>

      <P>I would cry better tears for Senator McGowan if I did not come from an area such as Tallaght which has the worst unemployment record in Europe.  He has made an excellent case for his end of the country and I do not want to take from that.  I hope the Minister will have some good news for him in the coming months.</P>
      <P>The motion before us gives us an opportunity of reflecting on the tourism industry.  Tourism is one of our greatest industries, ranking third in importance as this country's largest generator of foreign earnings and being surpassed only by industry and agriculture.  It is an area where there should be broad agreement as to how best the industry can be served and improved.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Small Businesses which was set up by the previous Government and sat during the term of that Government &mdash; a committee on which I had the honour of serving &mdash; carried out an indepth study of many of the problems associated with tourism. There were TDs and Senators of most political opinions and persuasions on that committee.  I was impressed by the immense sincere measure of agreement among all committee members on what steps were necessary to attract more foreign visitors to our shores and to encourage more of our own people to spend their holidays in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint committee carried out a study.  They received 15 written submissions from organisations, associations and individuals.  They heard public oral evidence from eight companies and organisations involved in the tourism industry.  In addition 50 separate interviews <Col N="1778" /> were conducted with many businesses involved in that industry.  We discussed at length over many hours and a number of lengthy meetings the problems as we saw them.  Having done this we issued a report &mdash; not a very lengthy one, less than 100 pages &mdash; known as the third report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses, on tourism, catering and leisure. In that report there were many worthwhile recommendations, some of which have been put into operation, others were noted but we have yet to see them being implemented.  It would be unreasonable to expect the Government to implement all the recommendations of a committee but it is only reasonable that any Government should give adequate consideration to the recommendations of any Oireachtas joint committee that would have gone to so much trouble and taken so much time to come to its conclusions.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at this report and take whatever steps he can to implement the remaining recommendations. I ask him also to discuss it with Cabinet Ministers so that we would see some of these recommendations taken to the Cabinet table.  I hope the Minister will take heed of my request.  I would like to see an all-party committee continuously monitoring the tourism trade which is is extremely important in terms of assisting our economic recovery.  I ask the Minister to discuss this with his Cabinet colleagues and consider setting up &mdash; if we are not going to have the re-introduction of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses &mdash; an informal committee of the Oireachtas to monitor the industry continuously, Politics are not involved as has been proven by the members of the various political parties who sat on the Joint Committee on Small Businesses.  There was a great measure of agreement.  It was a matter of assessing what should be done and then having the will to do it.</P>
    <P>A lot of credit has been taken by the present Government for the increase in tourism in the past 12 months.  There was an improvement in tourism in 1987. Everybody on all sides of the House and many people outside the House recognise <Col N="1779" /> and welcome that but I ask the Government not to spend so much time trying to draw credit for themselves for this upsurge in the industry.  Tourism is such that you cannot get improvements overnight. I do not want to take from anything the Government have been doing since they came into office, or from the Minister, Deputy Wilson or the Minister of State.  Many other Ministers who do not have special responsibility for tourism have taken many steps with tourism in mind.  The industry is such that it gets broad recognition from all Departments.</P>
    <P>The year 1986 was a particularly bad year for tourism.  This was caused by events outside our control.  We have gone over that in this House and, indeed, in the other House.  The Chernobyl disaster was one of the main factors which kept the American market away from Europe and, of course, the antics of our illustrious Colonel Gadaffi and the Syrian involvement in events, which we will not go into here.</P>
    <P>The Government, no doubt, have been paying attention to this industry.  Tourism is our third greatest industry as far as foreign earnings are concerned.  The fruits of the efforts they have been making have yet to be witnessed.  I sincerely hope we can report at the end of this year an even greater increase in tourism.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons for the increase in tourist traffic in 1987 was, of course, the deregulation of air fares.  This is generally recognised by all politicians and those involved in the tourism industry. The licensing of Ryanair in late 1985 brought that about.  This has led to an increase in the traffic coming into this country.  Who would ever think two or three years ago that one could now get a flight to London for £65?  At that time it was over £200.  I believe the increase in traffic is due to the reduction in fares.</P>
    <P>There is an increase in the American traffic coming into this country.  There are many charter flights from America going to London and because it is a cheap skip to Dublin or Shannon many of them are availing of the opportunity to visit <Col N="1780" /> this country.  We do not have the same attraction or the same volume of traffic into this country that would permit these cheap charter flights to come from the United States.  They are coming into London in their thousands every year.  I believe we are now getting a percentage of that traffic which we would not have got if there had not been a reduction in air fares or a deregulation of air fares.</P>
    <P>However, this has brought its problems. It now appears that the airlines are entering into below cost fares.  I hope the Minister has taken account of this and that he will use his efforts to ensure that this kind of trade does not continue. While we all want to get the cheapest fares possible, the fares should be legitimate. Below cost selling should not be carried out by any company because it is stronger than the rest in an effort to knock out the weaker company.  I suspect that Aer Lingus are now engaged in an under cost operation.  For far too long Aer Lingus had an monopoly, particularly on the London route.  Now that other airlines have entered into the field, I do not think Aer Lingus have a right to engage in below cost fares in the hope that their competitors will soon be knocked out.  I sincerely hope the Minister will take seriously what is happening in that area and ensure that it does not continue.</P>
    <P>I do not share Senator McGowan's view on the Fisheries (No. 2) Act.  I am not a fisherman.  I did a little fishing when I was going to school because I lived close to the River Dodder.  I enjoyed it but did not have the patience to continue.  It is very relaxing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The trout and coarse fishing rod licensing fee should not have been implemented.  Forty pounds for a salmon and trout and coarse fishing licence is a further imposition on tourists, plus the fact that Bord Fáilte have spent £45,000 on literature to be distributed in foreign lands advertising our free fishing. It will be very interesting when some of these foreign fishermen come and find <Col N="1781" /> that our brochures are incorrect and they now are required to pay a licence fee of between £20 to £40.  It will be interesting to see how the Government will get out of it because certainly I do not believe the fishermen will pay that fee.</P>
      <P>Much more could be said on this and, indeed, on many other items.  I hope I will have an opportunity at a later stage in a tourism debate in this House to go into many other matters.  I welcome the opportunity to say those few words and I hope the Minister will take seriously the remarks made by the Senators in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his successful efforts in acquiring additional funds for the Cork-Swansea ferry company which is of particular importance to tourism in the south west. I am aware of the Minister's commitment to the provision of that fund.  I would like to put on record our appreciation of his success in that regard.</P>
      <P>In preparing my notes I endeavoured to subscribe to the spirit of the motion. It is a commentary on the effectiveness of Bord Fáilte and the desire by many people in the industry to effect a change. As one who spent 15 years as a member of a regional tourism company I would certainly subscribe to the concept that the time is now opportune to seek change.  The winds of decentralisation are beginning to blow and an area which needs to be examined is the need to devolve the running of the tourism industry to the regions.  In some cases the regions have huge resources invested in tourism and in the development of tourism products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a region that has 31 per cent of the tourism plant of the entire country located in the counties of Cork and Kerry.  There is general agreement that the time to review the activities and the performance of Bord Fáilte has come. I would not indulge in a Bord Fáilte bashing operation because they were a singularly successful State company for many years.  What has happened, in effect, is that time has passed them by.  The <Col N="1782" /> developments in the international market place are such that there is a requirement for any company which represents a national government, as Bord Fáilte do in the foreign marketplaces, to concentrate their entire efforts and to strive with might and main to hold onto the market share and increase it.</P>
    <P>We get bland figures from time to time showing that tourism is the fastest growing industry in the world, and so on.  The facts of the matter are that we have not been holding our market share even though we have increased the figures.  We are losing the percentage of the total world market in tourism which we had in the past because of the huge resources now being poured into the bigger markets such as Germany, France, Italy and the United States by national Governments. I am aware, for example, that the Greek Government spent more last year on television advertising in the United States alone than the entire Bord Fáilte budget for the whole year.  They are a relatively new arrival on the American marketplace. It has been an attractive venue for Europeans for many years but their concentration on America is just an example of the kind of difficulty which is confronting Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>This highlights what the Government now appear to be saying &mdash; I subscribe to this point of view &mdash; that Bord Fáilte must concentrate exclusively on its international foreign marketing role.  Their role is not to be around this country as they appear to be doing, duplicating the business of the regional tourism companies and, quite often, interfering with the legitimate activities of the regional tourism company.  In fact, they have contributed to a substantial disillusionment in the industry.</P>
    <P>The activities of regional tourism companies have been curtailed because of the cutbacks in funds.  This has been evident, not just this year or last year but since the early eighties, to the extent that the regional company I represent have had their staff cut from 32 to 15 in the last couple of years.  How one can be expected to operate a tourism service on that basis I do not know.  However, there <Col N="1783" /> is general agreement that international and domestic tourism require structures which would probably reflect themselves in three different areas: the international level, the exclusive area of activity for Bord Fáilte, the national tourism product which would be a joint involvement for Bord Fáilte and the regional companies and the administration of tourism by regional companies on the ground exclusively on their own.</P>
    <P>The regional tourism companies are very well placed with their present structure to bear examination and to bear upgrading of their role in developing the tourism market.  Some of the things they could do would be to bring about a more attractive product through stimulating development of new attractions, organising novel and exciting activities and raising the standard of products and facilities generally.  That goes without saying.  We have been saying it for many years, but the regional tourism companies need to be reorganised.  Their funding should be reorganised.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a greater degree of input from the industry into the funding of regional tourism in the future.  I am aware, for example, in my own region many hotels are not even members of regional tourism companies, they do not subscribe at all.  Yet, you have a tourism plant on the ground, a network of offices, personnel orchestrating the activities of tourism associations, printing brochures, providing office services and so on and in themselves channelling many tourists into hotels, guesthouses, public houses and so on.  Yet, these people do not even subscribe to the well-being of the companies. There is something obviously very wrong with that and it is an area which needs to be examined.  This Minister and the Government at long last have seen that the industry itself &mdash; I am in the hotel business professionally &mdash; does not contribute enough to the well-being of the regional tourism companies.  That needs to be examined quickly.</P>
    <P>However, the role of the regional tourism companies will have to be upgraded, there is no doubt about that.  The level of <Col N="1784" /> interference from Bord Fáilte was very substantial.  The level of duplication was bordering on a disgrace in that you had people in regional tourism companies all over this country doing a very good job and people monitoring their activities, doing the very same job in Baggot Street. That needs to be changed very quickly. The role of Bord Fáilte in future will have to be solely in the international arena. By upgrading the regional tourism companies we will make them worthy of the name of regional tourism companies as they were originally intended to be, a kind of liaison group between the industry and the Department of Tourism and Transport and Bord Fáilte.  That is not happening at present.</P>
    <P>There are many, many areas that can be concentrated on by local tourism groups.  This is not being done at present. There is a need to concentrate on operating standards, environmental standards, developing a greater variety of product, cultural, artistic, historical, musical and environmental which are distinctly Irish in most cases.  We should develop in conjunction with those activities youth, sport and special interest activities.  There is a whole area there that requires constant attention.  It cannot be done by a group whose primary role is to market abroad.  When Bord Fáilte go abroad to market tourism they need to be satisfied that the groups responsible for the administration of the industry in this country are doing it effectively: at this moment they are not.</P>
    <P>We can examine any one of the areas where we claim to be distinct from any other tourist destination on the continent. For example, in the area of the environment itself &mdash; I have no doubt that Senator Norris will be touching very significantly on that aspect this evening &mdash; as a county council member I am actuely aware of the constant erosion of the environment and the impact it makes on tourists.  We should be equally conscious &mdash; and we are equally conscious &mdash; of the impact it makes on native people but I will confine myself to the impact it makes on tourists.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have expressed a <Col N="1785" /> desire down through the years to become more and more involved in tourism.  I think if they did nothing more than commit themselves to improving their role in the control of the environment and its effect on our towns and cities, and particularly in the countryside, they would make such a huge contribution to tourism that they should never be asked to do any more.  Unfortunately, quite often many local authorities see their role as being abroad with Bord Fáilte in Hamburg, Cologne or in Paris.  That is where they want to be, but that is not the role for local authorities.  Their role is to complement the image that is being generated by marketing or selling this country abroad.</P>
    <P>The point has been made here that we cannot compete with places in the sun. We have no desire to compete with them because we have something that is uniquely different.  We should preserve it but sometimes I despair that we can when you drive down through scenic routes like the Healy Pass or the Pass of Keimanfiach or the Vee in Waterford and you see cars dumped over the ditches, all over the place, you see unauthorised dumps, houses built in the wrong places, a plethora of signs and signposts, many unauthorised: I could go on for the rest of the night.  Yet, local authorities are looking for a role in tourism.  That is their statutory role and I say that as one who has been a member of a local authority for the past 15 years.  If local authorities want to be involved in tourism, let them address themselves to the environment. We would ask them to do no more.  That is particularly important.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas in which the regional tourism companies have the expertise on the ground.  In their midst there are hoteliers, guesthouse owners, town and country homes, farm guesthouse people, handlers for travel agents and so on.  They are the people who have a deep concern that tourism should work in this country and yet they are being curtailed in every possible way by Bord Fáilte, who have curtailed their budget. They have been constrained in many <Col N="1786" /> ways and I could go on here for half an hour.  As a member of a regional tourism company I am acutely aware of the constraints. Bord Fáilte create so many problems for the operation of regional tourism companies, the fact that they are there at all at this stage is an indication of these people's commitment to the well-being of the industry.  There are many things regional tourism companies could be doing.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this business which should be addressed by the Minister is the singular way Bord Fáilte have resisted the expressed desire of regional tourism companies to go abroad in the vanguard of their marketing programmes.  I look at Bord Fáilte's marketing programmes as somewhat of a pepper pot nature: they go to Germany and try to convince Germans to come to Ireland because of the beauty of the countryside and so on, but in concert with that particular marketing programme you need people to go from the Cork and Kerry region, from the Donegal region, the mid-west, the Lake-lands to sell their specific package because each region has its own particular differences.  This is where we fall down.</P>
    <P>We are selling Ireland as a product. We have to be much more specific in future.  There are many new areas of development that can be examined.  I cited one recently, hill walking.  If there is any country in this world for hill walking it must be this country.  In the UK alone there are three million registered club hill walkers but we have not even addressed that market yet.  There are huge numbers of angling clubs in the UK, France and in Germany and we have not got next or near them yet.  Off season, we concern ourselves with the fact that we have a 12 week season in this country.</P>
    <P>We have not developed, for example, the shooting industry.  I can remember Frank Hall having a great parody about shooting tourists and some guy took him literally and decided that there was a bit of a sideline in shooting tourists.  The facts are that there are many areas of opportunity and the day has come when we have to concentrate and focus on <Col N="1787" /> where we have strength.  We cannot compete with Spain and Portugal.  We have very distinct facilities of our own; we have expertise on the ground.  This initial step of setting up a task force in the short term is very welcome but I think that in the overall spectrum of the tourism industry, only when the Minister and his Department are examining the redeployment of staff and expertise from Baggot Street, down into the regions, will we get the kind of response that I know is forthcoming from regional tourism companies if they are given their head.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are areas of public debate in which I have a great interest and about which I know a great deal.  There are other areas in which I have a great interest and about which I know relatively little.  The subject of tonight's debate belongs to the latter category and I am glad to defer to the expertise of people like Senator McGowan and Senator O'Callaghan.  But I speak because I share their views &mdash; and Senator McGowan and I share relatively few views in common but I think we both agree on the overwhelming importance of the tourist industry &mdash; and, as Senator O'Callaghan has suggested there are whole sections of that industry which we have not even begun to tap.  He referred to hill-walking, for example, and here I can vouch from personal experience.  If I may be provincial I would suggest that areas in the County of Cork must be unparalleled in the whole world of hill-walking. However, I will not push that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan referred in passing to the 12 week tourist period, but sectors of the industry like hill-walking are not dependent on the 12 week period. The weather we enjoy at present, for example, is ideal for that kind of industry. We should be pitching the appeal of that, I think, virtually on an all-year-round basis.  As one who from time to time spends short terms in the US, and who knows that, come a particular month you can say goodbye to walking for three or four months, I must say that on my return <Col N="1788" /> I greatly appreciate our great amenity in that regard here.</P>
    <P>In a previous debate I also mentioned the merits of cultural tourism.  I think the phrase is beginning to be fashionable now.  It has enormous potential.  Here again I can speak from personal experience. For several years, I have been running a summer school in Irish studies in University College, Cork, and we have evidence that the reverberations of that are endless.  The students who enjoy themselves and go home after a fulfilling experience are messengers of tourism and they send back their relatives and so on and they themselves come back when they are better placed financially later in life.  We have only begun to tap a lot of the potential of tourism and I agree with Senator McGowan that properly handled it will be the single greatest contributor to creating employment.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, the secondary reason why I am speaking is that I am curious about the motion.  I did not quite understand the way in which it was pharsed. For a moment, I thought that Bord Fáilte was being restructured on a regional basis and I made some inquiries before the debate and I found that that was not so at all.  Though Senator O'Callaghan addressed himself if more relevantly to the core of the motion than other speakers, even he did not really convince me as to how this balance could be struck &mdash; because it is a question of striking a balance between the national and the regional.  The people in Bord Fáilte itself, in headquarters, will not agree that there is a need for regionalisation, or at least they will not agree there is a greater need for the present degree of regionalisation. They are not aware of the problem or they will not admit a problem.</P>
    <P>I think that it goes without saying that Bord Fáilte has to be there, that its role is clear in some regards, as Senator O'Callaghan pointed out, that it has to market the country nationally.  I cannot see regional tourism boards projecting the national image as Bord Fáilte so effectively does.  Here I would like to mention the excellence of their publicity journal, <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i>, which <Col N="1789" /> is very favourably spoken about abroad. I think that only a central organisation could make that kind of promotion.  On the other hand, as I understand it, the regional tourism boards are becoming financially more self-sufficient.  Indeed, on account of the times in which we live, they have had to cut down &mdash; they have had their funds cut down &mdash; and, as I understand it, there is more self-generation of finance in these local areas. They are doing all kinds of things like selling brochures and indeed there are money-gathering exercises by individual members of the regional tourism boards. If they are increasingly paying the piper, as it were, then it is understandable that they want to call the tune also.  I would like to hear more about this.  I would like to hear the Government's views about it.</P>
    <P>I have no closed mind myself about this matter.  For example &mdash; to come back to the area which I know best and about which Senator O'Callaghan knows a great deal &mdash; it seems to me that if the Cork-Kerry Tourism Board is increasingly more autonomous in fact in terms of finance and so on, then it is only fair that it should be able to operate autonomous marketing as well.  Who better than the Cork-Kerry tourism people to know, for example, that the people of the south of England and the people of Wales are the likely people to come to Cork and Kerry?  Freedom should be allowed to the regional areas to do that kind of local recruiting.  That only makes sense.  It should not be beyond our wit to devise some system of values between the central and the regional demands.  I believe that the central organisation is somewhat concerned about the independent activities of SFADCo &mdash; I do not know whether that is so or not &mdash; but I do understand that Bord Fáilte are not altogether happy, perhaps, that certain regional organisations should be demanding this kind of autonomy.  It is certainly a matter for the Government to tell us where the balance should be struck.</P>
    <P>Like other Senators, I welcome the arrival of the task force on the scene.  I hope that the new appointments to Bord <Col N="1790" /> Fáilte will be made very quickly for the vacant chairmanship and the managing directorship and I think that would be good for the morale.  Finally, I did listen very carefully to Senator McGowan and though I am not intimately acquainted with his part of the country, nonetheless I do accept what he has to say about the fact that it is a particularly deprived area and that the Border does present problems there as well, but the Border also presents opportunities I think.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to note that in the news earlier on tonight there was a report on a conference which has just concluded in Enniskillen &mdash; a cross-Border conference &mdash; in which they are acknowledging on both sides of the Border that they have common interests and that they must market the scenic Border area in common.  Here is one of the areas.  Incidentally, I think that that conference was sponsored by that excellent organisation, Co-operation North, which does a world of good virtually unheard of and unpublicised work.  I am pleased about the symbolism of new beginnings in Enniskillen after the horror of last November.  But the conference points up how it is that there can be cross-Border co-operation, there can be creative coming together on both sides of the Border without having recourse to the counter-productive rhetoric about political unification.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to support the motion.  I support the spirit of the motion. I join in welcoming the Minister and I look forward to his comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. S. Haughey Mr. S. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to say that I very much welcome this debate and thank Senator McGowan for putting down the motion.  It is a very timely debate and one which the Government I would imagine would very much welcome at this time given their commitment to boosting the tourism industry this year and in future years.  Having said that, I would like to congratulate the Minister for Tourism and his Ministers of State and the Government for the commitment they have given to the tourism industry both last year and this year.  It would be fair to say that they seem to <Col N="1791" /> believe that tourism certainly has not reached its full potential in this country and they seem to be setting out to rectify that situation.  They have come up with a number of initiatives which even to date, have proven successful.  I congratulate them and wish them every success.  The people of Ireland would certainly be behind them in trying to develop the tourist industry to its full potential.  Everybody realises that has not been the position to date.</P>
      <P>I hope you will forgive me if I take this opportunity to congratulate Dublin on its millenium, its 1,000th birthday.  I do that for a particular reason; I believe 1988 is going to be a very good year for tourism because that celebration is taking place and I hope that as a result of the celebrations many tourists will visit the city from the Continent and other areas and it would then be the responsibility of Bord Fáilte to ensure that once these tourists enter the capital they will then go and explore the rest of the country.  That is precisely what Senator McGowan is hoping for by his motion and, hopefully, the tourists, having come to Dublin for its celebrations will then proceed to Donegal, Cork and Longford&mdash;and even Tallaght for that matter &mdash; and boost the tourism industry right throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody accepts that the tourist industry has not been performing as well as it should and it has been said that in Ireland we have a second rate tourist industry.  We must a now examine why that is so.  Mentioned in Senator McGowan's motion is the whole issue in relation to Bord Fáilte and that now must be looked at in a hard, critical way.  The time has come to look at all these institutions and bodies which have served us very well in the past.  In a time of changing circumstances, changing economic conditions and changing social circumstances and, given the Government's position in setting out to bring about national recovery and to make Ireland more efficient and more productive, these bodies must now be looked at in a hard, critical way. Bord Fáilte would certainly have to be <Col N="1792" /> criticised for not developing the tourist industry as much as possible.  There are fine men and women involved in Bord Fáilte and they have done a tremendous job.  I think times are changing and we must now look at the board to see if it is serving us well and how can it be improved.  In that regard I welcome the setting up of the Tourism Task Force which every other Senator, from what I can gather, has also welcomed.  I think they will set about this hard, critical analysis which we now must undertake.</P>
    <P>Of importance also is the Price Water-house report on tourism which came out in October 1987.  It listed three things which it saw wrong with the tourism industry in Ireland: one, poor marketing, two, unco-ordinated management and three misallocation of resources. Every Senator, to some extent, has dwelt on those three inadequacies and I hope that the Tourism Task Force will now come up with positive proposals under those three major headings.  I wish the Members of the Tourism Task Force every success in their job and I welcome those who have been appointed to it.  We have hard-headed business people and people from every other element of society included in it.  They are very positive and efficient people.  They know the job that they have to do and they are determined to make the task force a success. I wish them every success in that regard and I am confident that they will do a good job.</P>
    <P>In particular they should look at a number of areas, first access to Ireland. That has been dealt with by Senator McMahon and other Senators.  That is the first issue they should deal with how to get tourists into Ireland and how to get them in cheaply.  There have been a number of developments in that regard during the last two years and I think we should encourage that even further and come up with strong recommendations to ensure that tourists enter Ireland as cheaply as possible from the continent.</P>
    <P>Other Senators have mentioned areas and topics which we could develop further in relation to our tourism industry and the matter of adventure holidays and <Col N="1793" /> hill-walking and so forth has been mentioned. This is something that Ireland must now set out about seriously to develop so as to encourage tourism &mdash; golfing holidays, fishing holidays, sailing holidays and hill-walking holidays.  That whole adventure area has been underdeveloped in Ireland and we should now do everything possible to market the special advantages Ireland has in relation to those areas and encourage people to come into the country.</P>
    <P>The other area the task force should look at is the whole area of competitiveness. Everybody would surely agree that Ireland, by way of prices, is not as competitive as it could be.  The whole issue of indirect taxation and petrol prices, restaurant prices and so forth should be examined in a hard, critical way with a view to encouraging people to come into the country.  There is no doubt that prices and our competitiveness are under question by continental visitors and indeed under question by people within our own country.  That must be considered in a hard, critical way also.</P>
    <P>In addition, Ireland has a number of other advantages.  We have special interests peculiar to Ireland and I am thinking of our national games, GAA and so forth, the All-Ireland hurling final and the football final which are unique to Ireland.  Those events could be marketed abroad in a very special way which has not been done to date.  Ireland has a very special place for the horse.  There are a number of areas there which could be developed &mdash; horse racing, showjumping, bloodstock and so on &mdash; and which would encourage a special type of person to come here for their holidays.  I hope that the Tourism Task Force will bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that has been mentioned by various Senators and that is our environment.  Up to this we have had a very pleasant, unpolluted environment but it is under threat at present and we must be extremely careful that we do not destroy this unique asset which we have, pollution-free beaches and so forth, and we must be very careful that <Col N="1794" /> we do not destroy our environment, that we do not have graffiti on every wall you look at, that we do not have litter all over our beaches and so on.  I hope that the Government, the local authorities, and every institution and body in this country will set about ensuring that our environment is protected, so that our tourism industry can be developed to its full potential.</P>
    <P>It has been said over the last few months that Ireland has failed to keep pace with the international trend in tourism and that if we had done this we would have earned an extra £500 million in the ten-year period up to 1986.  This is a very important statistic and shows how crucial it is that our tourism industry reaches its full potential and is developed to the absolute maximum.  We simply must get this industry right and develop it in the way that it should be developed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion by Senator McGowan.  I believe that decentralisation is certainly needed.  Tourists have been coming to this country in unprecedented numbers during the last year but they are not getting into all areas of the country.  Some areas of the country have been totally missed by tourists from the Continent.  Were the Tourism Task Force and the Government to set about implementing what Senator McGowan is suggesting&mdash;that decentralisation should be encouraged &mdash; I think we could get the tourists into every part of the country, which is not the position at the moment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the moves which have been made to date to decentralise our tourism industry.  I note that the Shannon Free Airport Development Company has now taken over tourism in the mid-western region.  That is a good development and further decentralisation along those lines is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I welcome the motion.  It sets out that improvements in the tourism industry have taken place during the last year and it makes suggestions on how the industry can be improved even further in the coming years.  We must get it right.  I believe we will, and I wish the Tourism Task Force every success in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what my colleagues in this House have said on this motion.  I agree with a great deal of it but I have some reservations about the motion.  I agree &mdash; and it is being signally recognised by the Taoiseach and the entire Government &mdash; that tourism is an extremely important element in the re-energising of the finances of this country.  They have also recognised that cultural tourism is a very significant area.  It is the most significant potential growth area and I wonder sometimes what we are doing with this.  I do not want to attack Bord Fáilte.  I have had the privilege of working with them, not just in this country but also in New York.</P>
      <P>I may take this opportunity to tell the House that they had in 1982 an exceedingly efficient operation in New York.  I was in New York and throughout the United States broadcasting on radio and television trying to persuade people to come over here.  That raises a second problem.  We were, I might say, quite effective.  Subsequently I have developed something of a conscience because one element in this equation that has been noted by Members on all sides of the House is the fact of a product.</P>
      <P>This is a marketing exercise and we are marketing a product.  Various people are worried about the quality of that product in terms of the environment.  I remember very clearly being down at the General Council of County Councils in Ballybunion, County Kerry, and saying at that stage, early in June of last year, that I was concerned about things like bungalow blight, pig slurry spillages, and I was laughed out of the place, but those few of us who spoke on those issues proved sadly to be only too correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to narrow my focus to an area that has not been addressed. The Minister will probably only have a moral force in this &mdash; I am not sure that he has any direct legislative impact.  My colleague, Senator Haughey, I am glad to note, is wearing the millennium tie, and has drawn the attention of the House to the fact that this is the year of the celebration of the thousandth <Col N="1796" /> anniversary of the city of Dublin.  I am very sad that in my dealings with foreign journalists and people from the tourist industry of other countries, I detect consistently a feeling that civil servants and others involved in the tourist industry either consciously or inconsciously direct people away from the city of Dublin because they are so ashamed of it. Although I see the Minister shaking his head this was said directly to me over the last weekend: I know it to be a fact and I can tell him precisely why.  If he cares to consult page 10 of <i>The Irish Times</i> he will see why.  I was over there advertising the Dublin of James Joyce, No. 7 Eccles Street, the home of John Francis Byrne, friend of James Joyce, in fiction the home of Leopold Bloom in Joyce's great novel. What has happened to Eccles Street? That house is gone; thanks to the Mater Hospital that entire side of the street is gone.</P>
    <P>I would be very interested to hear what the Minister for Tourism has to say about the fate of that entire street, including the fate of the home of Francis Johnson. These are the kind of things people come from America to see.  It is under threat. It is under threat because the planning legislation and the interests of tourism of this country are not at all taken into consideration by operations like the Mater Hospital.  The House will be aware, of course, that an injunction was granted this morning against the students who are against the destruction of Dublin, and Dublin, the capital city, is a thing that is advertised on all the posters in America: right across them we have the doors of Dublin.  Well, my goodness, they will see the doors of Dublin when they get here.  One of the most important factors in tourism is return tourism.  If we disappoint people in this way, are they going to come back?  I am very much afraid that they are not.  This really worries me.  It worries me that a deliberate attempt should be made by the authorities of the Mater Hospital to circumvent the development plan of the corporation of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I am very <Col N="1797" /> slow to interrupt the Senator but in a motion like this the Chair would prefer if the speaker made only passing references to peripheral matters.  I do not think the Senator should confine his remarks to housing or any such aspect of it.  It would be helpful if the Senator tried to avoid mentioning specific names of institutions or people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect, in the present urgent and emergency situation it is very difficult to avoid mentioning those who are so clearly implicated and continue, regardless of the wishes of the people, regardless of planning legislation, regardless of the Dublin Draft Development Plan, to insist on demolishing our national assets.  I am sure that the Minister, who clearly has the good of the tourist industry at heart will use his influence in this area.  I shall take the strong hint from the Leas-Chathaoirleach, particularly because I intend speaking on a related matter in the debate on the Adjournment and it would not be my wish to abuse the privileges of this House.</P>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister and his Department as well as Bord Fáilte on what is a growth in tourism but, as my distinguished colleague, Senator O'Callaghan, has quite rightly pointed out, although there is growth on an international scale of calculation, our share of the market is actually dwindling.  This, without returning to the contentious issue that I raised is because of a perceived defect in our product.  Our product does not reside in the kind of areas that Senator O'Callaghan was talking about, which is good weather and sunny beaches; there is no point in Ireland pretending that it has the kind of climate that will be automatically attractive, although I am very glad to hear that Professor Murphy enjoys hill-walking in this particular climate and obviously finds it an invigorating and robust form of sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome very strongly the development of the national task force.  For this, <Col N="1798" /> I think, there has been an unanimous welcome.  We need that kind of entrepreneurial energy in the tourist industry. I congratulate the Government on having had the foresight and imagination to set it up.</P>
    <P>I will end with just my little hesitation about the way in which this motion is framed.  I would not like to see a kind of negative and destructive rivalry between the regions.  While it may well be appropriate to create regional interests and this, of course, has already been done with the creation, for example, of Dublin East Tourism, I am not too worried about SFADCo.  They have a remarkable track record of success.  If they can do it in the tourist industry, I would be inclined to welcome that, but perhaps I am not sufficiently informed on it.  It is perfectly clear to me that, once you go outside this country, there must be a super regional national authority with a coherent, consistent and determined attack on a market which has very very keen competition indeed.  I am not at all surprised to have heard this evening of the very large sums of money being expended by other national Governments.  I wish the Minister well in his attempts to secure an increase in tourism, an attempt which has the support not only I believe of his Government colleagues but of all the Members of this House and the Irish public.</P>

There were quite a large number of other motions which were deemed by the Cathaoirleach to be proper motions which must now go back into the pipeline.

      <P>I want to make the same point as Senator Norris has made, that there were quite a number of requests for a debate on the Adjournment that could not be facilitated today. The reason the other House is not meeting tomorrow, I understand, is that they have to equip it for television for the following day.  It is not for any other reason.  I do not see that as a reason for this House cutting short its sitting time tomorrow.  Even if the Deputy Leader of the House can convince us that there is a necessity to shorten the sitting time tomorrow, there are other ways of doing it.  It does not have to cut out the debate on the Adjournment matter.  Normally we sit until 5 o'clock so we could sit until 4.30 and have our Adjournment debate up to 5 o'clock.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>For the motion on the Adjournment of the House today I have received notice from Senator David Norris that he proposes to raise the following matter, the condition of the Turner Glasshouses at the Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a degree of consistency between what this House was discussing a few minutes ago and what I propose to introduce on the Adjournment this evening.  The Minister may not be aware that we were discussing the importance of the tourist industry here. This is not the first time I have spoken on this kind of matter.  The Minister is, no doubt, aware of the fact that this House gave an Adjournment debate, a matter of less than three weeks ago, to the subject of the condition of the paintings in the National Gallery of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I will not rehearse all the arguments I used on that occasion.  Suffice it to say that tourism has been signally recognised by the Government, in particular by the Minister for Tourism and Transport and the Taoiseach himself.  They have also indicated very clearly that that section of tourism possessing the greatest capacity for expansion and rapid growth &mdash; that also means money earned for this country &mdash; is becoming now almost a fashionable platitude, cultural tourism.  I see this as a very important potential growth area but I am worried about the quality of the product we have.</P>
      <P>We have some very fine paintings in the National Gallery.  We also possess in some other areas things that are quite unique to this country.  I speak about the Turner Glasshouses in the Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin, not just as a possession of Dublin, but as an item of absolute national importance.  It is not often that we can say, even in this great capital city, that we possess something that is of the very first international rank and importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the glasshouses by Richard <Col N="1802" /> Turner we have the greatest surviving examples of his important work in the world.  I am aware that Turner not only created the glasshouses at Glasnevin, in particular the great curvilinear range, but that he also built glasshouses in the Botanic Gardens in Belfast and at the Botanic Gardens at Kew outside London.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, he built glasshouses around this country.  For example, he produced a superb domed circular conservatory at Woodstock, County Kilkenny, which is now destroyed.  He produced conservatories in small ranges at St. Ann's, Clontarf, now destroyed, at Kilakee, County Dublin, now destroyed, at Áras An Uachtaráin in the Phoenix Park mercifully now restored, at Ballyfin, in County Laois, a very beautiful example which is in a considerable state of disrepair. We have less and less of his work but we have the greatest example in the heart of our city in the beautiful Botanic Gardens open to the public and open, which I think is very important in these days of recession and unemployment, free to the public.  I was there last Sunday and it was swarming with people, old age pensioners and the unemployed.  I spoke to many of those people and I also spoke to the staff who, I am glad to report, are in good heart despite the very adverse conditions in which they are working.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a little bit about Turner before I get on to the exact specific structural problems of the cave that exists there.  Turner is important to us as an Irishman and as a great Dubliner.  Not only is he a product of our city but he made use of his engineering background and his team of skilled Irish workmen, many of them from Dublin, from this city of ours, and doing this, his company produced a package deal answering requirements of international customers. He actually had this capacity to get out and earn money and establish the reputation of this country internationally.  He is somebody of whom we can be extremely proud.</P>
    <P>I return to the fact that the glasshouses in Glasnevin are, I would say, his finest work.  The Minister may wish to cavil a <Col N="1803" /> little bit with this.  I am sure he has been advised and has done his homework and he may feel, for example, that the glasshouses at Kew, which are more complex and certainly larger, are the greatest work.  I am sure the Minister also will acknowledge that those buildings were taken down and reconstructed, not in the original materials, not with architecture in mind, and not even with a proper balance between architecture and planned conservation, so that they now actually, to an architectural historian and as somebody who is interested in the history of the development of this particular form of art, are not the original Turner glasshouses. Thus, we here in Dublin have a completely unique possession.</P>
    <P>The Minister, to his grief I am sure, must know that these buildings are on the point of collapse.  I am absolutely astonished when I look at the condition of these buildings.  I have watched them over a number of years.  I always expected that they would be painted, repaired, but virtually nothing whatever has been done.  I draw the attention of the House to an article by Frank McDonald in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Wednesday, 18 May 1983, five years ago, illustrated with some frightening and horrific pictures.  The headline is &ldquo;Botanic Gardens Need Major Renovation Work&rdquo;.  In the article Mr. McDonald, who is well known to all who love and cherish the buildings of this city, starts by saying:</P>
    <P>Grave fears are being expressed that the Victorian planthouses in Glasnevin will collapse within the next ten years unless a major renovation programme is begun almost immediately.</P>
    <P>Nothing whatever has been done since then.</P>
    <P>We are half-way through our allotted time span to save this unique inheritance. The clock is still ticking and nothing has happened: well perhaps not quite nothing.  Something very Irish has happened. We printed a set of definitive commemorative stamps congratulating ourselves on our architectural heritage and inevitably the curvilinear range of <Col N="1804" /> the Turner glasshouses at the Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin are the most significant stamp in the collection.  How is that for hypocrisy?  How can we possibly do this?</P>
    <P>Reference was made earlier on to <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i>, a most distinguished journal for which I have occasionally written myself.  There in my collection of <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i>, when I went back to look, was a photograph of the curvilinear range.  It is dishonest to invite people, which is basically what we are tacitly doing, to come and look at these wonderful things we have if we are going to treat them with nothing other than contempt.</P>
    <P>I accept these are very difficult economic times but I would place this in the context of the concealed capacity of things like this to draw income into the country.  I can tell the Minister that there was some years ago a proposal by Belfast City Council to demolish the range of Turner Glasshouses in that city.  I am very glad to say it was defeated.  They were dismantled, repaired and reinstated and they are now one of the most major tourist attractions in that city, which needs tourism even more than the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I would like very briefly to explain to the House the present conditions at Glasnevin, as witnessed by me no later than last Sunday.  In the camellia and palm houses wooden struts have perished, wooden frames for the glass are broken and rotten.  That is bad enough but in other areas of these glasshouses where the frames are not wooden but either wrought or cast iron, the decay and the warping also serves to crack and destroy the glass it contains so that not only are they unsightly and potentially dangerous but they also let in the atmosphere which is extremely inimical to some of the sensitive and sub-tropical plants.  There is rust on all the railings in the palm house. Some panels of glass are broken here also.  There are rotting timbers to the main door at the south end.  In fact, the door is not even completely shut.  The door is simply hanging on by a few rotten <Col N="1805" /> hinges.  It is completely corroded in many places by damp rot, and if I dared I could have put a foot and a hand right through those structures.  There is a very serious problem of rot.</P>
    <P>I understand that some three years ago or so a small amount of work was done. This consisted, unfortunately, of merely painting over the decay.  I am sure that the Minister, as a very practical man, will realise that this kind of plastering over a sore, or as the Elizabethan dramatist would say, the careening of an old morphensed corpse, whiting a sepulchre to use a biblical allusion, actually increases the speed at which the buildings decay. It may titivate them to make them look a little bit more respectable for a while but, in fact, it only increases the decay.</P>
    <P>In the area known as the Range Border there is complete corrosion of many of the wrought-iron elements.  There are holes six inches wide in perished metal. The whole thing is completely unpainted. Fine decorative detailing is being destroyed and in some of the buildings groups of the stanchions supporting the roof seem to be in a dangerous condition. When I say they seem to be in a dangerous condition I do not just mean that they seem to be in a dangerous condition to me; they also appear so clearly to be in a dangerous condition to the Office of Public Works that I understand they have instructed that sections of these buildings be closed to the public because they are dangerous.  These are the buildings which we place on our national stamps.</P>
    <P>The main section of the curvilinear range is blocked off and there is a notice which says &ldquo;This section has been closed for repairs.  No entry&rdquo;.  I hope the Minister will be able to give me some details of these repairs.  I hope it is not a totally dishonest notice.  It has been there for some considerable time.  No repairs appear to be going on.  I would like to know when they will commence, how extensive they will be and what precisely they will consist of.  Even from the exterior you can see both the beauty and the distress, in particular of the curvilinear glasshouse range.  One main support <Col N="1806" /> pillar is almost rusted through, panes of glass are missing, flashing is gone, there is warping of frames, entire panels of glass have gone, meaning that there is a threat to the subtropical plants.</P>
    <P>I found, coming from this beautiful House in which we have the privilege to meet, a particular sadness, nothing the date inscribed in the wrought-iron, Royal Dublin Society 1843.  As the Minister knows, we owe a particular debt to that society who preserved this House, who used it as their headquarters, who gave us the National Gallery about the squandering of whose treasures and riches I spoke the other evening, who gave us a great library and a great showground which is also now in trouble, it gives me great sadness to feel that this precious inheritance of ours is also in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to convince the House and give us some news of plans in progress to rectify the situation, I know the Office of Public Works themselves are distressed.  I would like to put on record how very disheartening it is for people in the public service, in the Office of Public Works, to produce plans, do projections, work out detailed methods of restoration and then find that they are all brought to nought.</P>
    <P>In that context I ask the Minister what has happened to the special grant of £29,000 from the European Community that, as a result of a detailed submission from the Office of Public Works, was made available specifically for the restoration work which has not happened. It must have gone somewhere, or perhaps it has not and can be used next week to do some immediate repairs although, of course, a sum of £29,000 would, to use an old Dublin expression, &ldquo;get lost in a hole in your tooth&rdquo; in regard to that disaster.  I hope the Minister will be gracious enough to give this House an acknowledgment of the seriousness of the problem, an explanation of why money is not available, an explanation of where the £29,000 which was made available has gone, and an undertaking <Col N="1807" /> to initiate a phased programme of restoration.</P>
    <P>I am in possession of documentation which indicates very clearly why this is so necessary and I am sure the Minister has it as well.  It is confidential but I have my sources and I managed to get hold of it. It is about the curvilinear range.  There are photographs which are very distressing to see.  Even where repairs had been made, they have been made in unsympathetic metals and have led to further distortion.  The conclusion arrived at by the author of this work is that there must be restoration.  The restoration should comprise, first of all, the dismantling of the entire range and I gather that arrangements could be made for this to be done without threat to the very valuable and sometimes very venerable stock of rare plants; secondly, the examination of all the iron components; thirdly, the treatment of all iron parts or their replacement; fourthly, the re-erection of the range; fifthly, the refurbishment of the interior of the range and the replanting and rehousing of the plants; and finally, the renovation of ancillary buildings and the construction of new facilities for the public.  That is not just the Dublin public, it is also an international public.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in the year of the Millennium we will get increased attention and increased attendance from people from abroad if we complete this urgent and necessary work.  The work could and should commence immediately. It could be completed in three to five years.  I understand the cost over a period of years at present figures would be about £3 million.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record two points which are rather sad.  The first is that the director of the gardens is quoted in 1983 as saying: &ldquo;Frankly, we are at our wits' end trying to get them&rdquo;&mdash; the Office of Public Works and the Department of Agriculture and Food &mdash;&ldquo;to do something about it&rdquo;.  The Office of Public Works said they themselves were acutely aware of the situation.  It is a tragedy that there should be such structural and <Col N="1808" /> possibly permanent damage.  I am glad to tell the Minister that my advice is that it is not too late, that something can be done.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to give some positive news to the House this evening, in particular a commitment in this year of the Millennium.  I know he will agree with me what a tragedy, what an irony, what a blasphemy it would be and what a betrayal of the people of this city if in the year of its thousandth anniversary we disgrace ourselves internationally by allowing this collapse.  Five years ago we were warned we had ten years left, five years have gone and we must now, this very day, set about the restoration of these superbly brilliant buildings.  I am sure that the Minister will have visited them over the last week or so.  If not, I hope he will go and join the many hundreds of other Dubliners who will do so this weekend.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Senator Norris for his fine, comprehensive contribution on this problem of the Turner range of curvilinear glasshouses in the Botanic Gardens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the cultural and historic importance of the Turner range of curvilinear glasshouses in the National Botanic Gardens, quite apart from their primary function in providing a suitable environment in which many hundreds of rare and important botanical specimens can thrive and be displayed to best advantage to students and the general public. These houses are in use since the middle of the last century and have over the years suffered the inevitable occasional winter storm damage and the wear and tear of constant use.  The normal maintenance works arising in this way have been the responsibility of the Office of Public Works who have dealt with them in a competent and professional manner. However, a few years ago it became evident that because of the inherent susceptibility of the Victorian castiron work to the effects of metal fatigue, corrosion, rusting and so on, the houses were in need <Col N="1809" /> of a complete structural rehabilitation of the most fundamental character.</P>
    <P>The matter was taken up by my Department in 1983 with the Office of Public Works who commissioned an engineering firm with the specialised skills demanded by this particular assignment to carry out a detailed survey of the range and to submit a report with recommendations.  I should perhaps mention that Turner was a Dublin engineering craftsman who in the 1840s pioneered the use of curvilinear glass and structural wrought-iron ribs for building purposes.  Other fine examples of Turner-designed and fabricated conservatories from the same period are at Kew Gardens, London, and the Botanic Gardens, Belfast.  The condition of these better structures also had so deteriorated from the effects of age and corrosion over the years that a major and costly refurbishment scheme for their conservation had to be undertaken at both these locations.</P>
    <P>The conclusion drawn by the consultant engineers from their inspections of the Glasnevin range of glasshouses in 1984 and 1986 was that while it was inherently sound it nevertheless was in urgent need of a complete overhaul.  All cast-iron elements had suffered corrosion but until dismantled the actual condition of many elements would not be fully revealed.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have proposed a programme of restoration to be carried out in four phases at an estimated cost of £4 million.  The first phase would deal with the central pavilion, where deterioration has been most severe.  The restoration would comprise the dismantling of the structure section by section, the restoration or replacement of the cast-iron and wrought-iron elements and their re-erection.  Planning of this scheme was brought to an advanced stage during 1986 but invitations to tender have since been deferred due to the budgetary situation.  The fact is that there are too many competing claims for the limited financial resources available.  I might say at this point that the EC grant of £29,000 which Senator Norris inquired about is at <Col N="1810" /> present being held by the Office of Public Works for use in the major work, but it is only a very small part of the total cost and the resources which will be required to get them back into proper shape.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have already restored a small Turner propagation greenhouse in the nursery area at the gardens.  The work was carried out in 1985-86.  The work involved dismantling of the building, the restoration of the members and re-erection in a new location.  In addition, old service greenhouses which are in poor condition were demolished and replaced by new modular commercial types.  Ancillary works such as tarmacadaming, paving, ducting, etc., and replacement of boiler house were also carried out.  The total cost of the works was £330,000.  The work carried out to the Turner building has provided invaluable practical experience and information which has been of great assistance in the planning of the restoration of the curvilinear range houses.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works, who are responsible for day-to-day maintenance of the glasshouses, advised recently that deterioration of the curvilinear range, particularly the elevated centre section, had now accelerated and they recommended that this section be closed to the public for reasons of safety.  I have, therefore, directed my Department's officials to prepare an application for assistance from the heritage projects allocation in the national lottery fund to help finance the restoration work and I hope the application will be successful.  In the meantime, the director of the gardens has had all the plant specimens in the section now closed off transferred to suitable alternative quarters elsewhere at the gardens and the section cleared to facilitate the rehabilitation work going ahead.  The House can be assured that all possible steps will be taken with a view to securing the restoration of this splendid range of glasshouses to its original form and elegance.</P>

      <P>I welcome what the Minister has said.  Any support I can give in <Col N="1811" /> his application or the application he has directed his officials to make to the national lottery will be supported with all the vigour and what little rhetoric I possess.  If I can be of any assistance, I <Col N="1812" /> certainly will.  I welcome the general trend of what he says.  Thank you.</P>
