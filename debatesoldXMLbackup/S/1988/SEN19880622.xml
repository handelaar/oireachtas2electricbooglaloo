      <P>I understand that Senator Lydon and Senator Manning wish to make personal statements. Before I call on the Senators I want to make it clear that I will not allow any further debate.  Once the personal statements are made the matter is closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify something for the record.  I have been pilloried in the press for some time and in this House about an aside I made to Senator Mooney which was not intended for public consumption but has reached that level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little amazed at the indignation it caused because everybody in the House knows that I repudiate violence in every form, whether it comes from the British Army, the Provisional IRA or anywhere else, and I have said so many times.  There is no question about that.  The indignation is somewhat amazing to me because in the first debate in this House &mdash; it was held in the Dáil Chamber &mdash; on the Single European Act, I mentioned the occupation of our country by Britain.  Again in a debate on the Constitution I mentioned it.  When I expressed sympathy to the people who were blown to smithereens by the Provisionals at Enniskillen I mentioned it and nobody said anything <Col N="886" /> about it, so I am surprised that anything is said about it now.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote another little statement: &ldquo;Dáil Éireann ... calls upon the British Government and people to end the present occupation of our Six North Eastern Counties, and thereby enable the unity of Ireland to be restored and the age-long differences between the two nations brought to an end.&rdquo;  That statement was made by John A.  Costello and signed by Éamon de Valera.  I feel I am in fairly good company when I look at the way Britain is running the Six Counties at the moment.  That is my personal view and I do not expect anybody to agree or disagree with it.  I am deeply sorry for what happened to the British soldiers.</P>
    <P>I have been called a fellow traveller here, but anybody reading what I said in the debate on the Ethiopian motion will know I deplore the loss of even one human life.  When I stood up to express sympathy to the people who were bombed in Enniskillen I said: &ldquo;For the first time ever I feel that in most of the people I talk to there is a new awareness of the need to adopt peaceful means for reunification because that is the only way to go.  I will end by saying how sad I am about what happened.  They are hardly the words of a fellow traveller.  Where were some of the people sitting judging me here today after that horrific explosion in Enniskillen?  I did not intend to make this public but I see it was printed in one of the papers.</P>
    <P>Senator Willie Farrell and I, and I do not know who else, went to that town where I have cousins and relatives.  I stood in silent prayer at the place where the bomb went off and I visited people all over that town to sympathise with them.  I never intended to make that public but it is true.  Those are hardly the actions of a fellow traveller.</P>
    <P>I have always thought of Senator Manning as a gentleman inside and outside the House.  He may have been offended if the remark I made privately reached his ears publicly.  I do not think it reached his ears, but I do not want him to make any withdrawal or anything like that.  I am <Col N="887" /> not interested in that.  I just want to clear the record on where I stand on violence. As for Senator John A. Murphy's remark, I do not think that needs to be defended.  Nobody in this House supports the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I spoke in anger and in heat.  I accused the Senator of being a fellow traveller.  He now says I am wrong and I accept that I am wrong and I withdraw what I said.  I feel, however, that what he said last week was offensive and tasteless and that view I still maintain.  I regret that he could not have been more straightforward in his explanation this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to take Items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 today.  Item No. 4 will be taken between 6.30 p.m. and 8 p.m.  We will take the Housing Bill today and at some stage during the day we can discuss whether we will resume the Radio and Television Bill and the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill.  The House will adjourn at 10 o'clock tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House says he is taking the Housing Bill today. Is it just Second Stage?  There will be amendments from the Labour Party to this Bill and I do not want to have it rushed through today or tonight.  We want to know now exactly what programme the Leader of the House has for this legislation.  Is it proposed to conclude Second Stage today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate what Senator Ferris has said.  Another matter I will have to take up at another time is that I would like precise clarification on the intention of the Government side with regard to the Housing Bill.  Is it proposed to complete Second Stage today and when is it proposed to take Committee Stage and Report Stage?  I want to assure the Government that not only will I have <Col N="888" /> substantial amendments on Committee Stage, but I also anticipate having an equally substantial number of amendments on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The proper way is to separate each Stage by a substantial period of time to enable each Stage to be taken and prepared comprehensively, which is the way to deal with all legislation.  It behoves the Leader of the House to make it precisely clear and not tell us we will see later on and we will have the Whips' consultations later.  I do not want to claim to speak for my own group but I know they have been dissatisfied in the past with uncertainties and lack of clarity.  Can the Leader of the House tell us what he proposes to do? Does he intend to take the Radio and Television Bill at some stage today or is it simply there in the unlikely event of the debate on the Housing Bill finishing? Can he also tell us when is it proposed to adjourn this evening?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I propose that Item No. 8 be added to the Order of Business and I hope you will let me explain why I think it should be so added.  The matters mentioned there are of perennial concern.  As Senators will know, at one stage that item was very much on top of the Order of Business but it has been sliding down for quite some time.  I suggest that it is very urgent that we should discuss it now.  Notwithstanding what has been said earlier, there is a large question mark over what people in this House really mean by the phrase &ldquo;forces of occupation&rdquo; in the context of 1988.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is highly relevant. There is an additional relevance now that we should discuss this matter and so I propose that we add it to the Order of Business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is for you to judge when I have made it, a Chathaoirligh, not to anticipate, I suspect.  There was a procedural difficulty about putting motions on the Order Paper about subjects related to this between you, a Chathaoirligh, and me.  It seems that some of those motions which I put down were ruled out of order for a reason which I do not understand.  Under Standing Order 27 you ruled out of order certain motions which I put on the Order Paper.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling but presumably I am allowed to explain it to the House because it is an important point of order.  It is very difficult in this House to discuss Anglo-Irish relations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business remains as I have said.  Items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 are being ordered for today.  If the wish of the House is that Committee Stage and Report Stage of the Housing Bill should not be taken today, then so be it.  I think we should leave it open and consultations can take place later on <Col N="890" /> today on whether we will take Committee and Report Stages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem.  If Senator Ryan and myself happen to be out of the House for five minutes, the remaining Members in the House can decide to take all Stages of the Housing Bill, as happened on another Bill previously. We want to co-operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

      <P>Senator Ferris, I want to clear the Order of Business.  The consultations which went on since 1977 between the Whips went on outside and we did not have this pettiness on the floor here every day.  I appreciate that you have a problem.  It is not for me to fix it for you.  It is for you to go along and deal with the Whips.</P>

      <P>This Bill is the most important revision to date of the modern housing code which was set out in the Housing Act, 1966.  While it takes in a wide range of measures including an important amendment of conveyancing law, provision for the payment of new house grants to previous owner occupiers following marital breakdown and other housing grants and subsidies, the main thrust of the Bill is directed towards providing adequate and appropriate accommodation for persons unable to provide such accommodation from their own resources.  The Bill provides a new legal framework for the development over the coming years of social housing in its broadest sense, that is, including both local authority housing and voluntary housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of the Bill are, in summary: to revise and update the legal basis for the provision, improvement, management and letting of local authority housing, and to address particular housing needs such as those of the homeless, the aged, the disabled and travellers; to provide new powers to housing authorities in regard to the accommodation of homeless persons; to provide arrangements to facilitate the sale of local authority houses to tenants at prices which reflect the present condition and market value of the houses; to provide backing <Col N="896" /> for a number of schemes of grants, subsidies, loan guarantees and assistance for housing introduced in recent years; to provide a simplified procedure for discharging mortgages in certain cases; to amend the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, in relation to the provision of emergency accommodation and, in particular, in response to the accommodation needs of travellers; and to repeal the offence of &ldquo;wandering abroad&rdquo; which is contained in the Vagrancy Act of 1824.</P>
    <P>A number of amendments were made to the Bill by the other House and it may be helpful to draw the attention of Senators to these amendments at this stage.  Section 5 has been amended to provide that the granting of assistance by a housing authority to another housing authority or to an approved voluntary body shall be a reserved function.  This amendment will, in fact, continue the existing arrangements for the granting of assistance to voluntary housing projects under section 12 of the Housing Act, 1966.  I am hopeful that housing authorities will take every step to ensure that the processing of applications for assistance under the voluntary housing scheme is not delayed unnecessarily under the reserved function procedure which I understand has led to some delays in the past.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the estimates of overall housing requirements to be carried out by housing authorities.  The assessment of existing and prospective housing requirements is, of course, a major undertaking for which substantial preparatory work must be done in order that there is reasonable consistency between housing authorities, both in the methods used and in the judgments made, of what constitutes unfitness for example.  Section 8 was amended to provide that this major national estimate of housing requirements must be carried out within one year of the commencement of the section.  In addition, the report on housing requirements must now be adopted by the elected members of the authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> Section 9 of the Bill deals specifically with local authority housing needs and provided that an assessment of the need for the provision of accommodation would be carried out within one year and that subsequent assessment would be at the direction of the Minister.  The section has now been amended to provide that, after the first assessment, subsequent assessments must be carried out no less frequently than every three years. Section 9(2) has also been amended to specifically refer to &ldquo;young persons leaving institutional care or without family accommodation&rdquo; as a particular category of housing need.  Finally in regard to section 9, the organisations to which housing authorities are required to give notice of the making of an assessment of local authority housing needs now specifically include voluntary and nonprofit housing organisations.</P>
    <P>I think it would be reasonable to anticipate that much of the debate on this Bill will relate to homelessness.  I would, therefore, like to emphasise that the Government are serious in their approach to seeking a solution to the problem of homelessness.  I ask Senators to consider which is more likely to benefit the homeless &mdash; a Bill which contains far-reaching but largely unworkable provisions, or a reasonable measure that becomes the law of the land as the Government intend this Bill will do.  I would also point out that, even before the enactment of this Bill, the Government have fundamentally recast the voluntary housing scheme to enable, effectively, 95 per cent grants to be made available for modern accommodation for the homeless. The Government have provided £1 million for this extension of the voluntary housing scheme in 1988 and have also given a commitment to provide a further £1 million next year and again the following year.  This will allow voluntary housing organisations to plan projects to benefit the homeless with reasonable confidence that up to 95 per cent of the capital cost will be provided by my Department through the local housing authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="898" /> The problem of homelessness is a complex one, as complex as the reasons people become homeless in the first place.  The problem must be tackled with a variety of responses involving local authorities, health boards and voluntary agencies.  The suggestion that one type of agency, whether it be local authorities, health boards or voluntary bodies, has, or should have, all the answers cannot be supported.</P>
    <P>Some of those involved in the debate on the question of homelessness seem to argue that only the State or its agencies can solve the problem.  I do not accept this.  We must look at the problem of homelessness, as indeed all social or economic issues, in terms of what is to be achieved, not in terms of whether it should be achieved by the State, or by private enterprise, or by voluntary bodies.  Senators are well aware of both the powers and the limitations of legislation as a response to any problem.  In framing the homelessness provisions of this Bill, my objective has been to secure a real improvement in access by homeless persons to housing.  Clearly, this required different legislative proposals to those contained in the 1985 Bill, but it also required extra resources.</P>
    <P>I consider that it is critical to develop further the voluntary housing response to the problem of homelessness.  The voluntary housing scheme, which provided 80 per cent assistance for the provision of accommodation for a number of categories of housing need, through reasonably successful otherwise, achieved little for the homeless since its introduction in 1984.  The special £3 million allocation over the next three years and the increase in the rate of assistance available under the scheme in respect of accommodation for the homeless to which I have referred are positive steps in encouraging and developing the provision by voluntary bodies of modern, purpose built accommodation for homeless persons.</P>
    <P>The basic response by local authorities to the needs of the homeless is, and will remain, the direct provision of local authority rented accommodation.  There will always be limits to what a local authority <Col N="899" /> can do in this way and the speed with which the authority can respond.  How, for example, could an authority with no vacant dwellings respond to the urgent needs of a homeless person?  I consider that the powers of local authorities need to be expanded so that they will have new options to help them meet the needs of the homeless.  These new options are provided for in section 10 of the Bill.  They include a new power for housing authorities to secure accommodation for a homeless person with a voluntary housing organisation and to pay that organisation in respect of the accommodation so provided. In addition, housing authorities will be able to provide assistance, including financial assistance, to a homeless person in order that that person may secure accommodation and, finally, a housing authority will be able to rent accommodation or lodgings for a homeless person.</P>
    <P>The housing needs of some homeless persons may be best met by some form of supportive accommodation which offers a considerable degree of privacy, particularly in regard to sleeping accommodation, storage for personal belongings etc., but which also provides communal facilities such as shared dining and recreational areas.  This type of accommodation would seem suitable, for example, as interim accommodation for individuals with an institutional background, prior to their obtaining fully self-contained accommodation.  No doubt, there are others who would be suited by, and would wish to remain in, this type of shared accommodation on a long term basis.</P>
    <P>It may also, indeed, be a suitable form of accommodation for young single people who are now a significant component of overall housing requirements. There is, I believe, an important role for this type of accommodation and new standards and guidelines for the development of this type of accommodation were circulated recently by my Department to housing authorities in the context of the voluntary housing scheme.  These standards will, of course, also be of assistance <Col N="900" /> to those housing authorities who consider that there is a need to provide directly some supportive accommodation primarily for homeless persons.</P>
    <P>Homelessness is a very complex problem. For some homeless persons their homelessness is merely a symptom of other problems.  Clearly, the simple availability of a dwelling is not the solution in these cases and a response in terms of obligations in legislation is not the right way to tackle the problem.  Again I emphasise that a combined approach by local authorities, voluntary bodies and indeed health boards is required.  I believe that it is necessary both to extend the powers of local authorities in this area and at the same time to increase the capacity of the voluntary housing movement to respond to the problems of the homeless.</P>
    <P>Section 2 defines a homeless person for the purposes of the Bill.  Persons who have no accommodation and persons living in hospitals, county homes or night shelters solely because they have no other accommodation and are unable to provide accommodation from their own resources are regarded as homeless.  The latter stipulation has always been a requirement for eligibility for local authority housing.  That part of section 2 of the 1985 Bill which referred to deliberate homelessness has been omitted from the 1988 Bill as an unsatisfactory legislative provision but one that was a necessary consequence of the proposed statutory obligation contained in the 1985 Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition to their new powers under section 10, housing authorities will be obliged for the first time to integrate fully the needs of the homeless into the planning and provision of local authority housing.  Homeless persons have not previously been identified in housing legislation. The provisions of this Bill will, however, ensure that housing authorities will, in future, be required to take into account the needs of the homeless at every stage of the planning, provision and allocation of local authority housing. Under section 9 of the Bill, housing authorities, prior to carrying out their assessments of the need for local authority <Col N="901" /> housing, will also be required to notify other adjoining housing authorities, health boards and relevant voluntary organisations who will be able to bring the needs of any homeless person to the attention of the authority.  Under section 11, housing authorities will be able to set aside a specific number or proportion of houses specifically to meet the needs of the homeless or other categories.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that housing authorities are unsympathetic to the needs of the homeless and will not operate the new powers they are being given.  I would again point to the fact that housing authorities, even without these powers, provided accommodation for over 1,800 homeless persons in the past two years. I have no doubt that they will act responsibly in discharging their new powers and will seriously address the problem of the homeless in their areas both directly and in co-operation with the voluntary housing organisation and the health boards.</P>
    <P>Finally on the question of homelessness, I believe that a board approach involving the many agencies which can help homeless persons is the correct response to this complex problem.  The role of the voluntary housing organisations is especially important because of the experience and commitment they have brought and continue to bring to the care of the homeless.  In the past, these organisations have been unable, due to lack of resources, to provide modern suitable accommodation and I am hopeful that the availability of up to 95 per cent capital funding will encourage voluntary housing organisations to expand and develop the range and standard of accommodation which they provide for the homeless.</P>
    <P>A number of sections of the Bill relate specifically to the voluntary housing sector which will be of growing importance in meeting social housing needs in the coming years.  Section 5 in particular provides an updated statutory basis for the development of voluntary and nonprofit housing.  Voluntary housing organisations, in fact, predate local housing authorities as an organised response to the unacceptable housing conditions of <Col N="902" /> the ordinary people and in the provision of decent housing at affordable rents. The quality of these dwellings was extremely high by the standards of their time and the fact that many people still live in dwellings provided by these bodies in the last century and earlier this century is testimony to their extraordinary lasting contribution.</P>
    <P>However, the scale of the housing problem facing this country in its early years was such that the State through the local housing authorities began to play the predominant role in meeting social housing needs.  For many years, the potential and indeed need for an additional arm of social housing provision was lost sight of in the mistaken belief that the State could solve all housing problems.  In recent years, however, the Government have again been encouraging the provision of voluntary housing for specific categories of housing need. In March 1984, the existing scheme of assistance for voluntary housing accommodation was extended to include accommodation provided for homeless persons.  However, between March 1984 and the end of 1987, only six units of accommodation had been provided specifically for the homeless.</P>
    <P>I considered that it was necessary to encourage greater take-up of this scheme by organisations working on behalf of the homeless and, with this clear objective, I sought and obtained Government approval to modify the scheme so that accommodation for the homeless would attract in effect 95 per cent grant assistance rather than the 80 per cent that is available for the other eligible categories of housing need.  The technical standards and guidelines for accommodation under this scheme have also been revised to take account of the particular needs of homeless persons.</P>
    <P>Some £4 million has been provided this year for assisting voluntary organisations in the provision of housing accommodation including the additional £1 million for accommodation for homeless persons.  This allocation compares to expenditure of just £248,000 under this scheme in 1984.  There has been a great <Col N="903" /> response to the special provision of £1 million for accommodation for the homeless in 1988 and already one project which will provide accommodation for over 50 homeless persons has been approved in principle.</P>
    <P>In recent years, local authority housing has been available more or less on demand to families in bad housing conditions and new categories of housing need such as single parent families and single persons now dominate the waiting lists.  In the seventies and indeed in the early eighties, single persons, unless they were elderly, had little real prospect of local authority housing.  Recently there has been a dramatic change.  For example, two-thirds of lettings by Dublin Corporation last year were to one and two person households and 39 per cent of lettings went to one person households.</P>
    <P>I think it is widely acknowledged that great progress has been made on what is often referred to as the &ldquo;housing problem&rdquo;. Nevertheless, I do not claim that the housing problem has been entirely solved.  Such a claim can never realistically be sustained because housing is a dynamic and constantly evolving area of social policy.  As one category of housing need is addressed, new categories emerge.  At the individual level, as one household is provided with housing, new households emerge to take its place in the queue.  However, an important indicator of change in the degree of housing need is the number of households on local authority waiting lists who now feel they can refuse reasonable offers of accommodation from the authority and wait for a house in a location of their choice.  In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the choice available to, and expected by, many applicants for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>While the total number of approved applicants for local authority housing has fallen by one-third in recent years, this does not fully reflect the real decline in housing need which has shown itself more clearly in a situation where reasonable accommodation has to be offered to a number of applicants before it is <Col N="904" /> accepted.  A further consequence of the current supply position on local authority housing is the emergence of significant problems of vacant dwellings.  While some vacant dwelling are, of course, inevitable and indeed necessary, particularly in the case of a larger local authority, an excessive number of vacant dwellings is a serious waste of resources and presents a serious and expensive management problem for the local authorities. It is a problem that is not addressed by simply boarding up houses and this is an area where a more positive and creative approach by local authorities could yield significant benefits.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill provides a new procedure which is designed to ensure that the provision of local authority housing is in future more sensitively matched to the real needs of persons seeking accommodation.  There is little doubt that the emergence of smaller households as the dominent element in social and indeed overall housing needs was not adequately reflected in the local authority house-building programme, either in the type of housing unit provided or in the choice of location.  A local authority housing programme on a much smaller scale than that of the early eighties is now justified.</P>
    <P>However, this programme must be targeted at the needs now dominating the waiting lists and not directed at family type dwellings.  A one person household does not require a three bedroomed house or flat.  When almost 60 per cent of applicants for local authority housing consist of one and two person households, this must be reflected in the type of accommodation being provided.  All the demographic evidence is that average household size will continue to fall and this point must be clearly understood and addressed by housing authorities in presenting proposals for new local authority housing.  Section 20 of the Bill will oblige local authorities, in providing accommodation, to take into account the range of housing needs as revealed in their assessments under section 9 and, moreover, to maintain a reasonable balance <Col N="905" /> as between the different categories of need.</P>
    <P>The new tenant purchase scheme for local authority dwellings is now in operation and is attracting a very high level of response.  The major feature of the scheme is the use of market value with a flat rate discount of 40 per cent for all eligible tenants irrespective of the length of their tenancy.  Tenants of dwellings which were first occupied prior to 1 January 1960 receive an additional 10 per cent discount and, furthermore, a discount of £2,000 in lieu of the first time purchasers grant in respect of new houses is also allowable in virtually all cases.</P>
    <P>Under this scheme, the gross price of the house to the tenant is calculated in relation to market value and having regard to the structural condition of the house.  I regard market value as the fairest system of assessing the real value of a house.  It was introduced as an option into the tenant purchase scheme in 1986 and resulted in substantial reductions in prices particularly for recently built houses whose formula based prices could far exceed their market value.  Market value also reflects accurately factors such as the age, condition and location of houses.</P>
    <P>The continued operation of the requirement for pre-sale repairs contained in section 13 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, would be wrong in circumstances where house prices are being assessed on market value which takes the condition of the house into account.  Moreover, the procedure can be very costly to local authorities, can result in long delays in transferring houses and can be a serious impediment to attempts to speed up the sale process. Section 23 of the Bill accordingly provides for the repeal of section 13 of the 1979 Act and also for necessary transitional arrangements to ensure that the section 13 arrangements will continue to apply as necessary to houses currently being sold to tenants under earlier schemes.  Housing authorities should, of course, continue to process all applications under pre-1988 schemes, where <Col N="906" /> tenants are continuing with those applications. Any necessary structural works should be carried out as a matter of priority.  To do otherwise would be completely unfair to those tenants who are awaiting repairs to purchase their houses.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill provides for the scheme of remedial works to designated local authority housing estates.  For many years, the local housing programme has concentrated on the provision of new accommodation, with little if any attention being given to the need to modernise and improve the existing rented stock.  In recent years, however, the easing of the pressure of demand for new construction has allowed additional resources to be released to secure necessary improvements to the existing stock.  In this way, much-needed improvements to the living conditions of many tenants can be achieved, the State's investment in local authority housing can be protected and the premature loss of dwellings to the rented housing stock can be prevented.</P>
    <P>In 1988, the allocation for this scheme has again been increased and is now £10 million compared to expenditure of £7 million in 1987 and only £1.5 million in 1986.  While town commissioners legally remain housing authorities for the purposes of managing and maintaining their own housing, they do not have either the technical or financial resources to carry out necessary improvement works to their housing stock.  Section 20 of the Bill provides specifically for agreements between town commissioners and the relevant county council so that the council may undertake the management, maintenance and improvement of houses owned by the commissioners.</P>
    <P>The benefits which accrue from the injection of capital funds into the local authority housing stock through the remedial works scheme could be lost unless accompanied by improved estate management by local authorities.  In this regard, the role which the tenants themselves can play is of vital importance and authorities must now make every effort to foster and develop tenant interest and participation in the running of their estates.  The consultation process under <Col N="907" /> the remedial works scheme should prove to be an important headline in this regard.  There is already considerable evidence of a renewed vitality and pride in local authority estates which are being upgraded under the scheme.</P>
    <P>There are a number of sections in the Bill which relate to the provision of housing, halting sites and other services for the travelling community.  Section 6 provides statutory authority for the recoupment by the Minister of the salaries and expenses incurred by local authorities and certain approved bodies in the employment of social workers in connection with the accommodation of travellers. Section 13 deals with the provision of residential caravan sites and facilities. Section 9 requires housing authorities to have regard to the needs of travellers in their assessments of housing needs.</P>
    <P>Section 27 amends section 2 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, to enable a local authority manager to undertake works which he regards as urgent and necessary to provide a reasonable standard of accommodation for any person.  This measure is designed to facilitate the provision by local authorities of accommodation for travellers.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Bill clarifies and consolidates the power of the Minister to make grant assistance available towards the administrative and general expenses of a small number of representative, advisory or research organisations working in the housing area.  My Department have provided annual grant assistance to the National Association of Building Cooperatives, the Housing Centre and Threshold for a number of years now.  In addition, a grant of £45,000 has recently been made available towards the administrative and general expenses of Focus Point in 1988.  This grant is, of course, additional to the grant of £50,000 to Focus Point towards the cost of a project for the accommodation of homeless persons which was announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement. It is also quite separate from any assistance that may be given to Focus Point <Col N="908" /> for the provision of additional accommodation for the homeless under the terms of the voluntary housing scheme.</P>
    <P>While the main thrust of this Housing Bill is in the area of social housing and meeting social housing needs, there are a number of important measures related to the private housing sector.  Section 14 provides a more up-to-date basis for subsidising the site costs incurred by certain persons of modest means in providing or acquiring housing for their own occupation, for example, through a housing co-operative, the Rural Resource Organisation, or joint venture housing.  Under the provisions of the 1966 Act, a grant could not be made available to assist potential house purchasers in acquiring these sites but a loan charge subsidy could be given.</P>
    <P>This method of assistance, however, was found to be unsuited to the encouragement of joint venture housing particularly where undeveloped sites were made available to a builder by a housing authority.  If the authority had not incurred any borrowings on the land, which was often the situation in the case of unserviced sites, no subsidy could be paid by my Department to reduce the site cost and, ultimately, the house price to the purchaser.  It was necessary, therefore, to provide for a grant system rather than a loan charge subsidy system to encourage joint venture housing and a grant of £1,000 per site is currently available from my Department in respect of local authority sites made available for this purpose.  The benefit of this grant is passed on to the house purchaser.</P>
    <P>The Rural Resource Organisation is an approved body for the purposes of section 45 of the Housing Act, 1966, and was, therefore, eligible to secure the loan charge subsidy directly from my Department. The provisions of section 14 will mean that the Rural Resource Organisation will no longer have to incur borrowings in order to be eligible for assistance with site costs and may now be provided with a straight grant of £1,000 per site.</P>
    <P>It is an over-riding concern of housing policy to ensure an adequate supply of <Col N="909" /> mortgage finance for house purchase.  For many years, this objective has involved the Government in providing substantial mortgage finance through local authorities for persons of modest means. However, the development of the housing finance system in recent years, particularly the emergence of the commercial banks as major providers of mortgage finance and the availability to the building societies of significant capital repayments from loans advanced in the seventies and earlier years, has meant that house purchase finance is now readily available from commercial lending agencies.  This development presented the opportunity of transferring from public to private funding a significant proportion of demand for local authority house purchase loans.  Following discussions between my Department and the main commercial lending agencies, the associated banks and the building societies agreed to make £70 million available in 1988 to provide mortgage finance to persons who would otherwise require loans from the local authorities.  Local authority house purchase loans continue to be made available as heretofore to applicants who are unable to secure a loan from a bank or building society.</P>
    <P>As part of the arrangements to encourage commercial lending agencies to provide this additional mortgage finance for lower income groups, a partial guarantee may be given by a housing authority to cover, in the case of default, payment of the amount by which the loan advanced exceeded 75 per cent of the value of the house.  Section 16 of the Bill provides the statutory basis for this new loan guarantee scheme and also provides for recoupment by the Minister of all or part of any expenditure incurred by a housing authority on foot of any guarantee given. In effect, my Department will recoup all expenditure incurred by a housing authority under section 16.  However, experience in the operation of the scheme to date suggests that it is only in relatively few cases that the commercial lending agencies are seeking these guarantees as additional security.</P>
    <P>Although now terminated, significant <Col N="910" /> expenditure continues to arise under both the mortgage subsidy and the £5,000 surrender grant schemes.  The 1988 provision for the payment of mortgage subsidy is £23.3 million and the provision for the £5,000 grant scheme is £3.5 million.  Significant expenditure under the latter scheme should not arise beyond this year; however, payments under the mortgage subsidy scheme will continue up to 1992. These schemes are being given statutory backing by sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides that a new house grant may be paid in cases where a previous owner-occupier is providing a new house following marital breakdown if the person is in need of housing and refusal to pay the grant would cause hardship. This is a new statutory exception to the normal requirement that only a first time owner-occupier may be paid a new house grant.  Section 4 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, already provides for the payment of a new house grant to a previous owner-occupier providing a new house where the applicants's previous accommodation was destroyed by fire, explosion or act of God and where refusal to pay the grant would cause hardship.</P>
    <P>The offence of &ldquo;wandering abroad&rdquo; is contained in the Vagrancy Act of 1824. A number of groups have sought the repeal of this offence.  In addition, its repeal was recommended by the Law Reform Commission in their report on Vagrancy and Related Offences which was published in 1985.  While the Minister for Justice is primarily responsible for the Vagrancy Acts, I have taken the opportunity to include the repeal of this offence in this Housing Bill as an element in the Government's overall response to the problem of homelessness.</P>
    <P>Most of the remaining sections of the Bill are largely technical in their nature and do not involve significant policy considerations. Some of the more important of these are: Section 7 validates certain payments made before the enactment of this Bill to the extent that these payments would have been valid after its enactment; section 8 extends to all mortgages the simplified system for the discharge of <Col N="911" /> fully paid mortgages which has heretofore applied only to Building Society mortgages; section 29 deals with offences under the Act and provides for fines not exceeding £500 for knowingly furnishing false or misleading information or withholding material information in connection with obtaining accommodation or assistance from a housing authority. In concluding, I would like to make a few brief comments regarding the overall thrust of housing policy and legislation as indicated in the Housing Bill, 1988.</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State, the over-riding concern of housing policy has been directed at providing new accommodation to meet a persistent and often chronic housing shortage.  We can look with satisfaction at what has been achieved &mdash; over 40 per cent of the housing stock, or more than 400,000 new houses, have been built since 1971.  However, as I have already indicated, as one problem in the housing area appears to have been overcome, new problems emerge.  Problems such as homelessness and other special housing needs require more complex responses than merely setting a target for annual housing completions. Large scale local authority housing estates present difficult management problems for local authorities and offer little satisfaction to tenants.</P>
    <P>The 1988 tenant purchase scheme is, I believe, an important response to the alienation of local authority tenants in that it offers them the real prospect of becoming house owners.  We are all aware of the beneficial results that sales of houses to tenants can bring to the appearance, environment and, indeed, physical fabric of local authority housing estates.  However, other responses, too, are required to the vandalism and antisocial behaviour which plague some local authority estates.</P>
    <P>We require an enlightened approach by local authority housing managers to consultation with tenants and participation and involvement by tenants in the management of their estates.  I will be encouraging the larger housing authorities in this direction, as the problem is <Col N="912" /> clearly related to scale, with the larger local authorities having the greater problems.</P>
    <P>The question of how many houses need to be provided annually and subsequent issues such as how many of these houses should be provided by the public, private and voluntary sectors are of fundamental importance in avoiding any recurrence of a housing shortage.  Current levels of housing output, though much reduced on the levels of the early eighties are, nonetheless, very much in line with the real level of demand.  If demand should rise significantly in the coming years, we will have to respond accordingly. Sections 8 and 9 of the Bill will be particularly important in helping to set base line data on overall housing requirements and on local authority housing needs.</P>
    <P>Apart from numbers, the range, type and location of new housing are important and should be particularly targeted to meet deficiencies in the existing housing stock.  Greater emphasis must be given in the coming years to the accommodation needs of particular categories such as the homeless, frail elderly persons and young persons.  This Bill provides the framework for these developments.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will have the effect of updating the Housing Act, 1966.  Since the 1966 Act was passed, over 40 per cent of our total housing stock has been built. It is ironic that we should be debating a Housing Bill today when the Government's housing policy has almost come to a standstill.  The Government's housing policy, or lack of it, will result in a serious decline in public authority housing output and an inevitable increase in waiting lists over the next few years.  The only thing stopping these housing lists from increasing even further is the rapid increase in emigration, especially in urban areas.  I spoke to officials from Dublin Corporation recently and was told there is a continual handing back of houses in areas in Dublin where people are emigrating. That is operating as a safety valve at present on the housing list.  There are 2,850 applicants on the Dublin housing <Col N="913" /> list and there are 2,260 applicants on the transfer list.  Were it not for emigration that housing list would increase out of all proportion.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that by the end of the decade we will again read in the media of a housing crisis in Dublin.  I say that because the Minister said that if there was a significant rise in demand in the coming years the Government would respond accordingly.  If the Government's economic policies succeed &mdash; I sincerely hope they will &mdash; they will stem emigration because that is a test of Government policy.  If they succeed, as well as we hope they will, people who have emigrated in the past will come back.  There is no housing policy that can respond to an immediate situation.  It takes two or three years, and even longer, for housing policies to get off the ground. We experienced this in 1966 and I believe we will experience it once again.  This year the Minister saw fit not to give a capital allocation grant to Dublin Corporation. He provided £4 million to cover commitments we entered into last year.</P>
      <P>It is under this dark cloud that we are debating the Housing Bill, 1988.  The main provisions of the Bill are to provide for and update the letting of local authority houses to ensure that the needs of persons such as the homeless, the aged, the disabled and the travellers get due priority.  Yesterday I searched for a definition of &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; and I came across the following: &ldquo;Being homeless means having nowhere secure to go, no privacy and little or no basic comforts&rdquo;. It means belonging nowhere and often nobody to belong to, isolated, vulnerable and alone day and night.  Homeless people are forced to stay where they can, in prisons, in insecure and dangerous flats, on the streets or in large anonymous hostels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The newsheet, the newsletter of the Simon Community, called &ldquo;No Fixed Abode&rdquo; has given us the graphic details of the plight of 3,000 homeless people in Ireland who live roughly, people who live in squalor and discomfort, some sleeping rough in cars, in back streets and in dirty alleyways.  We must ask ourselves: <Col N="914" />&ldquo;What relief will this Bill give to the homeless?&rdquo;  First, it falls far short of the expectations of many people working with the homeless.  I am sure Senator Brendan Ryan will put forward that view. It is completely different in many ways from the Housing (Miscellaneous) Bill, 1985.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill gives additional powers to local authorities to meet the needs of homeless persons.  Housing authorities are being empowered, in addition to their existing powers, to make arrangements with voluntary bodies for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons.  This is welcome because voluntary bodies should be grant-aided in the provision of housing for the homeless.  This is a line the Minister took today.  However, I do not believe that £1 million per year, though a step in the right direction, is adequate to recognise the role played by the voluntary organisations and the amount of expenditure it will be necessary for them to incur to make a meaningful contribution to resolving the problem.  I believe the voluntary bodies have the best expertise in housing the homeless and they should be encouraged and properly financed to carry out the excellent work they have done in the past.  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate them on their involvement at all levels in this area over the years.</P>
    <P>There is a big difference between housing a homeless person who has been sleeping rough and a family who have just become homeless.  The provision of housing for many people in this category is not sufficient.  They must also be provided with the back-up social services. This can often be more costly than providing accommodation.  If we are serious about asking voluntary bodies to carry on this work, we must be serious about providing the necessary finance and not only provide accommodation but also the back-up social services which, in most cases, are very necessary.  Voluntary bodies have far more expertise in this area than local authorities and they should be given greater grant-aided assistance to carry out this work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> Of course, local authorities have a role to play in housing the homeless and I am glad to see under section 10 that they will provide assistance, including financial assistance, to homeless persons and, if necessary, rented accommodation or lodgings and contribute to the cost of such accommodation or lodgings.  A very important aspect of this section is that housing authorities may make lodgings or accommodation available or provide financial assistance to a person while making inquiries to determine if that person is homeless.  I notice also that the Minister may make regulations under this section.  I hope he will make it quite clear to the housing authorities the obligation on them in this area and that anyone calling to a housing section who claims to be homeless will not be turned away while his case is being examined.  That is a very important aspect of the Bill.  I welcome the fact that the local authority will have to provide accommodation while they are examining the case.</P>
    <P>Section 11 requires a local authority, when determining a scheme for the lettng of dwellings, to give priority to homeless persons.  They must also now provide a proportion of the dwellings at their disposal for the homeless.  This is a welcome move.  The Bill states that the local authority &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  We must be more definite with the local authorities and say that they &ldquo;must&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new provision in the scheme of letting priorities.  The housing authority may have reason to believe that an applicant has deliberately depressed his housing conditions in order to improve his prospects of obtaining a local authority house.  In such a case, the local authority may disregard the present housing conditions for the purpose of determining priority.  For far too long there has been abuse in this area.  Applicants on the housing list have left good accommodation to live with relatives in overcrowded conditions to enhance their chance of being accommodated from the housing list, from time to time at the expense of honest people who reside in accommodation that is considered unfit <Col N="916" /> and who take their turn on the waiting list.  I have often seen members of the same family rehoused from the same accommodation using the same method year after year.  This provision in the scheme of letting is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I believe also that under section 9 there should be an obligation on the housing authorities in the preparation of an assessment of the estimate of housing needs and requirements to have a special category known as the homeless built into these assessments and that this should be carried out on a regular basis.  The Minister said that there was an amendment in the Dáil to the effect that this should be carried out on a yearly basis.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the increasing problem of teenage homelessness. Many young people leave home nowadays for one reason or another and find themselves without accommodation. Sometimes there are social problems and sometimes they just cannot cope with or get on with their families.  It has come to my attention that the number of young boys and girls roaming the streets at night has been increasing over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>I consider myself very privileged in the last year to have become involved in a new organisation called Teenage Care which looks after homeless boys.  It is run by the Salesian Fathers.  They are carrying on the work of their founder, John Bosco.  They have a residential house in Dublin.  I always believe in giving credit where credit is due.  Due to the Minister's £1 million, they are now able to provide another house and also the Department of Social Welfare are giving them finance for a night shelter, which is essential if we are to care for teenagers properly.  Initially they go into a night shelter and then they can graduate to a residential home.</P>
    <P>It is not just the building of accommodation that we should consider but the cost of running and supervising these establishments.  If we are serious about voluntary organisations looking after the homeless we must provide the social and economic back-up that is necessary for these homes.  We are certainly changing <Col N="917" /> the Bill from the 1985 Bill.  A number of voluntary organisations are unhappy about some of these changes.  If the Government are serious about their commitment to the homeless, a greater allocation of resources must be made over the next three years to provide not just for accommodation but for the support and services that are required.</P>
    <P>The Bill's objects are housing for the homeless, the aged, the disabled and travellers.  I am disappointed that the Minister spent so little time dealing with the aged.  A great proportion of our people are in the senior citizen age group and these people are in need of special care and attention.  I want to go back to the figures that I quoted for Dublin and I am sure the same applies to other urban areas.  While we say that we have 2,850 applicants on the housing list and there are units of accommodation available, the same might not apply to the transfer list.  The most important figures in relation to the Bill are the 574 senior citizens on the waiting list and the 421 senior citizens on the transfer list.  Almost 1,000 people in the city of Dublin in the senior citizen category are seeking accommodation and there is no accommodation to give them.</P>
    <P>In completing the housing programme this year with the moneys the Minister made available plus the £4 million I mentioned earlier, in my area we built two housing complexes for senior citizens, one at Woodstock Gardens in Ranelagh and one on Oxford Road, Rathmines. I never saw such competition for these vacancies.  People with enormous numbers of points were refused.  It shows that there is a serious demand in the city for accommodation for senior citizens.  The Minister saw fit not to give capital allocation to Dublin this year and that was a mistake especially in relation to senior citizens.  In future I ask the Minister to give special consideration to that category when making finance available to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the disabled.  It has always been a policy of Dublin Corporation when building inner city housing to provide two units in each complex for <Col N="918" /> disabled people in normal housing and in senior citizen accommodation.  How can we provide for the disabled if there is no money for building houses?  The disabled were helped in the past, but there is no provision for them this year or next year.</P>
    <P>The fourth category is the travellers. This is a very difficult and sensitive area for all public representatives.  In the past, public representatives have faced up to this problem.  It is not easy as there is enormous pressure from communities. People do not want travelling sites near them.  I must pay tribute to the religious orders, especially in Dublin, who have made sites available.  These sites are very acceptable because they are usually well sheltered from the community but nevertheless there is opposition.  I was lucky to have the support of other public representatives in my area and we stood firm against all opposition to houses for travelling people.  Dublin Corporation recently had a proposal to build houses for travelling people at Finglas.  I regret to say that the Minister's party opposed it in Dublin Corporation but, fortunately on the casting vote of the Lord Mayor the housing site in question was approved.  It is now with the Minister's Department.  I hope the corporation will be thanked for that travellers site in the near future.</P>
    <P>One has to welcome the new tenant purchase scheme, although it gives certain advantages to people this year over people who had entered the scheme previously. It has been argued that people who bought houses under previous schemes should have the advantages of this scheme.  I do not agree with that.  If you buy your house under a particular scheme, that is the scheme and that is the end of it.  People this year are fortunate, although there can be winners and losers as the Minister knows and as some of the people are finding out.  Nevertheless there will be more winners than losers.</P>
    <P>It is a little unfair to allow corporation tenants to purchase their houses when in urban areas local authority flat residents have not got the same right.  There are many people in my area who are very anxious to buy local authority flats.  This <Col N="919" /> would be a very good thing.  It would help to build up better communities and people would have more respect for their own property.  There is a trend towards tenants associations developing in flat and housing complexes.  These are a great advantage to local authorities.  They help to give people a special interest in their own area.  I understand that the management of the corporation are endeavouring to prepare a scheme to overcome all the difficulties relating to the purchase of corporation flats.  This will allow tenants to avail of the tenant purchase scheme introduced by the Minister.  I hope the Department will give them every assistance if such a scheme can be developed.  There is also a question of housing maintenance.  Due to cutbacks in local authority funding there has been a serious deterioration in housing maintenance especially in repairs to roofs and flats and the maintenance required to keep the housing stock in a reasonable condition.  If this falls below a certain level it becomes a greater burden on the State.</P>
    <P>Housing policies have changed radically over recent years as the demographic make-up of society has changed. We need smaller one or two-bedroomed houses.  Local authorities are very slow to adapt to these changes.  The elected members of Dublin Corporation have been asking for smaller dwellings for a long number of years but we never got the necessary response.  We could foresee that the demand for one and two-bedroomed houses would be increasing, whereas the demands for three and four-bedroomed houses would be decreasing. The system which operates at local authority level is very slow and very difficult to change.  I hope that when we start building houses again we will be building houses of that type.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Department keep a careful eye on what local authorities do and that they make sure that the local authorities are building in accordance with the needs and the requirements as assessed.  There is a demand for more local authority houses <Col N="920" /> in the inner urban areas especially in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a continuing need for inner city housing especially in-fill housing.  Two-thirds of lettings by Dublin Corporation last year were to one and two person households and 39 per cent of lettings went to one person households. Unfortunately that is not true of the inner city.  A flat near where I live became vacant recently and I was interested in getting it for an unmarried mother and her child.  I was surprised that it was accepted by a husband and wife with five children who had come from Tallaght but were sub-tenants in the area.  Due to the high cost of travel and the lack of shopping facilities etc., in areas like Tallaght and Blanchardstown, people want to come and live in the inner city.</P>
      <P>There is a need for extra accommodation in the inner city areas.  I am sure that applies to other urban areas as well.  The figure I will quote from the transfer list is most interesting.  There are 2,260 applicants on our transfer list. These are husbands and wives with two, three and four children who want to transfer to larger accommodation but want to stay within a two mile radius of the city.  They were born and reared and worked there and it is reasonable that they should expect to be accommodated there.  The inner city housing programme has been a great success and because of that, there has always been a high demand for it.  I do not think it is more expensive than building in a green field because the infrastructure such as schools, roads etc., is already there.  This costs extra money when you build in undeveloped areas.  When that is taken into account I am sure houses built in the outer city areas can be almost as costly as houses in the inner city areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> The Minister referred to the management of local authority housing stock and housing estates.  I am very disappointed at the way local authorities care for their housing stock and look after their housing estates.  There is need for a radical change in local authority management in this area and there is an obligation on the Department of the Environment to set up new guidelines for the management of estates.</P>
    <P>One thing that is most worrying, and the Minister referred to it in his speech, is boarding up houses that have become vacant.  Naturally, as he said, we will always have some empty houses.  What saddens me most is the vandalism of these empty houses.  This is a real problem in society today and I cannot understand it. I remember in 1981-82 a young family who were successful in being housed in Tallaght crying for joy at being housed there.  The situation has changed rapidly since then.  Young people in these areas are allowed to vandalise what the taxpayer has built for other people.  Parents who benefited from local authority housing allow their children to do this and it has always caused me great concern.</P>
    <P>Boarding up houses has never been a success and has never been able to overcome the problem of vandalism.  A new technique has been developed recently called Sitex.  I have seen it and I am most interested in it.  It is being manufactured in England and is now on sale in Ireland.  A type of panel is sealed onto the doors and front windows of the house while it is vacant or while repairs are being carried out by the local authority. Environmentally it looks well.  You could live next door to it and be very happy about having a house next door with this kind of panel on it.  The good aspect of it is that when that house is finished, it can be taken off and transferred to another house.  It can be rented or bought by the local authority.  It has been on trial in Tallaght and has proved to be a great success.  The vandals did everything they could to break through it but they did not succeed.  Some of the officials of the corporation told me they regret it has come on the scene so late but <Col N="922" /> nevertheless it is better late than never.  It might help to combat the problem of vandalism which we have in our society. Local authority houses are costly and they should be protected to eliminate vandalism.</P>
    <P>I welcome the repeal in section 28 of the offence of &ldquo;wandering abroad&rdquo; under the Vagrancy Act, 1824.  I was on the Joint Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism which recommended that this should be repealed.  I am glad the Minister has introduced it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the Bill we are giving statutory sanction to the £5,000 grant and mortgage subsidy even though, as the Minister has pointed out, it has long since stopped. The £5,000 grant scheme was a success in its time.  It operated for tenants of both local authority housing and local authority flats.  I always saw a need to wind it down in relation to local authority houses but I always felt there was a need to continue it for people living in local authority flats.  There are people living in flats who deserve to live in houses. Unfortunately they do not have sufficient points under the priority scheme of lettings and have to remain in flats even though their families might be too large for the flats.  People in that category should be given an opportunity to live in a house.  I urge the Minister to consider some kind of scheme for people who dwell in flats to enable them to transfer to houses.  This would make flats available to smaller family units.  That is a reasonable request to make and it is one which should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>A Housing Bill should indicate precisely what the housing policy of the Government is.  This Bill does not answer that question.  We have to ask: do the Government intend to continue to refuse local authorities finance to provide badly needed houses in certain areas?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome this Bill because, while it may not be all things to all people, nevertheless, it is a considerable advance on any legislation we have on the Statute Book at present. I have no doubt that certain people involved in certain areas will be critical <Col N="923" /> and will be disappointed.  Very seldom is a Bill welcomed wholeheartedly as containing everything for everybody.  This Bill is a very considerable advance.  I have had the privilege over a long number of years of being able to help many people.</P>
      <P>In this country, as everybody knows, there is a concept that home ownership is the ideal.  Some years ago I read a thesis entitled &ldquo;The Myth of Home Ownership&rdquo; which advanced a considerable case for looking at the position obtaining in other countries&mdash;Sweden for example, where rented accommodation is available at reasonable rates.  Our history more or less precludes such consideration.  At least it did so in the past, because there was the possibility of people withdrawing from congested areas to perhaps a remote site where they could live in reasonable comfort without incurring heavy overheads. That position has now changed. No matter where people live now they must meet certain costs, for example, service costs.  Somebody living in an area where services are provided by a local authority &mdash; even though they do not avail of the service &mdash; must pay for it.  It would be easy to ride a hobby horse to death on this subject.  I do not intend to do so.  I simply want to make a few comments within the general parameters of the Bill on matters covered by its provisions.</P>
      <P>Housing and planning overlap to a considerable extent.  In some areas it is difficult to draw a distinction.  I was very pleased by the Minister's introductory remarks particularly the following:</P>
      <P>In this regard, the role which the tenants themselves can play is of vital importance and authorities must now make every effort to foster and develop tenant interest and participation in the running of their estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is very important.  I have made the case before on many occasions that, in relation to planning and housing people who live in certain areas do not have an input, unlike the position obtaining in other countries, taking Sweden as an example, where people are consulted <Col N="924" /> about housing schemes, in-fill schemes and so on.  They are asked at the earliest stage to make an input and consequently they are involved.  That input sadly has been missing here.  Although under the provisions of the Planning Acts theoretically people have an input to development plans that is, to a large extent, illusory.  The same applies to housing in the past in respect of which, like an advertisement for a particular beverage claiming to be good for one &mdash; a particular type house was thrust on people as being the best for them, for example, two rooms downstairs, two upstairs.  They had no input as regards the size of the house, its siting or into the overall planning of the area.  That was a fundamental flaw.  I am glad to note that the Minister has now provided or ensured that the people will be fully involved in the future.  Mistakes have been made over the years not alone here, but elsewhere.</P>
    <P>On another occasion I spoke at considerable length about schemes that were unsuccessful in other countries, apartments that had to be pulled down before the gloss on the medals awarded to their designers became dull.  I have spoken about the development of shanty towns where people's industry was complemented by Government funds resulting in successful schemes.  For example, there was a rather tragic mistake with regard to Ballymun.  This was mentioned on many occasions.  I am pleased to note that there is a great social spirit in Ballymun and that its inhabitants are coping with the problem.  When I first came to Dublin around 1956, there was a very important exhibition in the building centre on the works of Le Corbusier, the master architect of high rise apartments and buildings.  At that stage that was a concept accepted right across Europe.  I can recall reading an article at that time on the development of Ballymun in the British architects' journal, the only criticism being that there was no lobby from an external door with direct access to a room.  By and large we have benefited or learned from earlier mistakes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> Senators have spoken about the denuding of the inner city, a tragic mistake which should not be repeated.  Unfortunately, that error is not easily undone. The people of the inner city were a closely-knit community who were dependent on and helped one another.  They were torn from their roots and resettled in concrete jungles.  That uprooting led to other problems such as bad health, drugs addiction, and so on.  That was unfortunate. We had wrong concepts, indeed in some areas these wrong concepts still obtain.  I could mention many.  This is probably not the appropriate time but just to mention one or two, I might cite the example of a housing scheme completed in my own town of Kells some years back and which incorporated a well designed play area.  Shortly after the scheme was completed there were representations from the people who lived there to remove some of the swings and other such equipment because they were causing problems.</P>
    <P>It is agreed that generally in planning a mix is important.  Invariably there is an effort to have a mix of housing of elderly people with young people or young families. I know of two cases where elderly people have pleaded to be housed away from young people because young people were behaving in a manner causing them many problems.  These are some of the considerations that must be taken into account in planning, particularly that of housing schemes.  It is unfortunate that many of the problems encountered in large housing schemes and associated problems arose after the implementation of the Planning and Development Act, 1963, a very comprehensive Act.  Reading the relevant legislation would lead one to believe its provisions were capable of dealing with any problems that might arise with regard to planning.  However, problems have arisen which I am sure will be corrected in the planning of future developments.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute also to the Irish Land Commission and local authorities who have provided housing in the past.  While the Land Commission are <Col N="926" /> now defunct they missed a great opportunity with regard to the provision of housing schemes for families who could live in some kind of close relationship. Local authorities missed out to some extent in that regard also.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle spoke about vacant houses in the city and on schemes in other areas.  I agree with what he said.  There has been a problem over a long number of years in regard to vacant houses in rural areas.  As far as I can recall, the previous Government had some scheme in mind to tax vacant houses which never materialised.  To some extent it was a pity.  In the area that I know best &mdash; and I am sure this applies to every other Member of the House &mdash; over the years there have been houses which would have been suitable for people badly in need of housing.  Many were allowed to deteriorate or fall into ruin.  Perhaps there were reasons there.  Nevertheless it was unfortunate. Had people with vacant houses had to pay a tax or a fine that would have taken care of the problem to some extent.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note the provision of private sites by local authorities.  By and large grants given for any development may be regarded as a transfer of resources.  It is important that such transfer would result in some positive development. In the past in some instances grants were of greater benefit to commercial interests rather than their immediate recipients.  Much more could be done in regard to the provision of private sites.  I agree with what the Minister said about changing patterns, demographic changes, with smaller families and a considerable degree of emigration at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the market value also reflects accurately factors such as the age, condition and location of houses. An auctioneer friend of mine refers frequently to lectures he received on valuations in his training days when the lecturing professor noted that there were three important considerations.  The first one was location, the second was location and the third was location, in other <Col N="927" /> words, that location was of paramount importance.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the valuation of houses and making the point that a house in a local authority scheme, unfortunately, has a lower value than a house in a private scheme.  This is manifestly wrong.  There are reasons for it such as our class structured society which is not altogether as bad as in my young days; nevertheless we have a long journey to go yet.</P>
      <P>The last scheme the Minister introduced for the purchase of local authority houses will, to a large extent, be counteracted by these provisions because people will be encouraged to remain within schemes, to take care of their houses and bring them up to better standards if possible, and to deal with the vandalism in their areas spoken of by Senator Doyle.  The Minister should be commended on this very important, marvellous scheme where the houses are sold at a valuation which is very reasonable in every circumstance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome sections 9 and 10 of the Bill which deal with homeless people. Homelessness must be the ultimate in degradation and depths of despair but, no matter how hopeless a case seems, society can do much to help people to come to see the brighter side.  Even where crime has been committed &mdash; in few instances with regard to homelessness &mdash; people can be reformed.  They have a useful contribution to make no matter what their age or what area they come from.  I believe what we were taught when young and more idealistic: &ldquo;Though your sins be as red as scarlet they can be made whiter than snow.&rdquo;  Society owes all those people who are without shelter and without homes on opportunity to make a fresh start.  Representations were made to me and to all Members with regard to this problem.  In one instance all the Sisters attached to the Convent of Mercy, Kells, sent me a letter, signed by each nun.  Like many others involved in that area, they <Col N="929" /> are very concerned about the homeless. This Bill will go a long way towards what they want to achieve.  It may not be the ultimate and it may not give complete satisfaction to everybody; nevertheless it is an enormous step forward.  I welcome it and everybody who is sincerely concerned in that area, I am sure, welcomes it as well.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of sites for travellers.  My urban district council at one stage were involved in making provision for sites of this kind.  We visited sites around the country and saw they were very well conducted and very worthwhile. Unfortunately, it transpired after assessing the situation that there was no need for a site in the vicinity of the town of Kells and nothing happened in that regard.  I simply mention that to show that the urban council were very concerned and were prepared, without exception, to make provision if necessary. The travellers have been much maligned.  One could make a contribution on that aspect alone.  While considerable strides have been made with regard to the travellers, not enough has been done. Society could do a great deal more without legislation, but the legislation will focus people's minds on this area and we hope we will make greater progress in the years ahead than has been made in the past.  I understand the numbers of travellers, instead of decreasing, have increased.  I am talking about people who are still travelling and have not been integrated into the settled community.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that disabled person's grants are still available.  They have been very helpful and are quite generous, taking everything into consideration.  I made representations previously that the Minister might consider in this regard. Where planning permission is concerned, the local authority could undertake the necessary work to obtain planning permission or to organise it for the individuals concerned because, to a large extent, these people have not much knowledge of planning legislation or access to ordnance survey maps and plans.  I understand Dublin Corporation provide plans for such people.  I would <Col N="930" /> welcome that provision generally around the country.  The Minister might look at that aspect of it.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle referred to homeless teenagers.  The Minister might look at this area and perhaps do something on the lines Senator Doyle mentioned.  I understand from Senator Doyle that Teenage Care are doing great work in this regard.  I commend them and all the voluntary organisations who are involved in every area of housing and who, through the years, have done so much heroic work.</P>
    <P>Finally, I reiterate what I said at the outset, that generally this is a Bill on which we can come to grips with the details on Committee Stage rather than on Second Stage.  It is very important legislation.  While some people are not happy with the progress, it is a marked advance on the legislation we have on the Statute Book at the moment.  I welcome it.  I commend the Minister for it and I look forward to the further stages of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil cuid mhaith oibre déanta aige ar an gceist seo, gur dhein sé cuid mhaith oibre, gur dhein sé a lán cainte, gur chuaigh sé i dteangmháil lena lán daoine agus gur dhein sé iarracht comhar a fháil óna lán daoine &mdash; mise ina measc.  Chuir sé píosa fada dá chuid ama féin ar fáil domsa chun mo smaointe féin a chur a fáil.  Chuir sé fáilte romham agus gabhaim buíochas leis as sin.

    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of things in this Bill need to be commended.  It is significant and <Col N="931" /> welcome and, since he is the Minister who did it, it is to the credit of the present Minister in particular that the concept of homelessness is being awarded legislative recognition.  Later I will talk about the response in the Bill to dealing with that problem, but it is a significant step forward that an area of housing need which was, at best, looked at by administrative means, is now being written into legislation. That is &ldquo;prioritising&rdquo; the problem. We can talk again about possible deficiencies in the definition but there is no doubt that this Bill is a significant step forward and the Government and the Minister who are responsible for it deserve commendation for it.</P>
    <P>Implicit in the definition is a recognition of a problem at a time when the world is perhaps more affluent than it has been at any stage in its history.  Most of the Western economies, Britain, the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States are growing at a faster rate than they did for a number of years.  The capacity to sustain that growth is another matter.  I am well aware of the Minister's concern about the issue of our own public finances.  Nevertheless we are a more affluent society.  It is somewhat ironic that, in the context of that increasing affluence, homelessness should be becoming, not just in this country but in most of the countries in Western Europe and North America, a matter of serious political concern.</P>
    <P>Another very welcome aspect of the Bill is the carrying through by the Minister of a commitment he made a long time ago, soon after he became Minister, to repeal a particularly offensive section of the Vagrancy Act.  Perhaps one could argue that the whole of the Vagrancy Act needs to be repealed.  Nevertheless, it may be only symbolic but it is extremely important that nobody can be charged in future with &ldquo;wandering abroad&rdquo; and failing to give a good account of himself or herself.  This is an indication of a reassessment on a policy level of what it means to be homeless and wandering abroad.  The Minister deserves to be commended for that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" /> Since I had a small part to play in the development of the political concern about the issue of homelessness I would like to devote some time to stating why I now have the views I hold on the sort of policy response needed to the problem of homelessness.  In some ways the tragedy is that some of the development of the publicity by the voluntary sector about homelessness is perhaps at the root of some of the problems in this Bill.  When I and other people like me become involved with the problem of homelessness &mdash; in my case 16 or 17 years ago and in the case of many other people 20 or 25 years ago &mdash; we used particularly lurid imagery to draw people's attention to the problem of homelessness &mdash; lurid imagery of the dosser, the down and out, the wino and the alcoholic.  In that process we created an image of the homeless which has never been got rid of.  Contained in <i>Administration</i>, Volume 33, No. 1, is an extract from a letter to me from the Simon Community.  The letter describes a meeting between members of the Simon Community and representatives of the City and County Managers' Association:</P>
    <P>We were struck by some of the attitudes we encountered.  The three county managers seemed to take the view that most if not all, homeless people were alcoholics or psychiatrically ill.  Two of the managers insisted that in their county the alcoholism rate was 100 per cent.  The men were irretrievably alcoholic, so much so that only intensive medical and psychiatric care would be of value to them.  There was no way such people could ever be considered for housing. The chairman of the meeting insisted that drug-taking was widespread among the homeless.</P>
    <P>In a way we had sown the seeds of many of the problems I now see with this Bill, by feeding to public opinion, in particular to those who have a major influence in determining public policy, a prejudiced perception of who the homeless are. Unfortunately, no amount of subsequent research has entirely rid us of that image.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> At the time I worked directly with homeless people I began with a very similar image.  There is no doubt that there is a considerable incidence of alcoholism among homeless people.  There is no doubt that there is a considerable incidence of psychiatric illness among homeless people.  There is no doubt that there is a considerable incidence of physical illness among homeless people.  In fact, there is no doubt that there is a considerable incidence of virtually every malaise that can befall the human being among homeless people.  Given their physical living conditions, given their inadequate income and the pretty bad health care available to them, one can expect all the consequences of such deprivation will be manifest among them. Nobody, for instance, suggests that the appallingly high infant mortality rates among travelling children &mdash; I hope they are beginning to drop now &mdash; are the fault of the travellers.  They do not prove that travellers are somehow inferior to us in caring for their children, but are a consequence of their physical conditions.  It takes some time to realise this.  As one gets to know homeless people, one realises that many of them are alcoholics because they are homeless; not homeless because they are alcoholics.  Many of them have psychiatric conditions because they are homeless; they are not homeless because they have psychiatric conditions. Many of them have physical illness because the are homeless; they were not physically ill and they became homeless.</P>
    <P>Before the Simon Community were set up the St. Vincent de Paul Society were providing a quite extensive range of services for homeless people and although I am associated with one of the more romantically envisaged charities dealing with the homeless, I cannot get away from the fact that the St. Vincent de Paul Society have done an enormous amount of work for homeless people.  The Simon Community in Dublin would probably not exist nowadays were it not for the goodwill of the St. Vincent de Paul Society who engineered the provision of a premises to get the Simon Community off the ground.  Nobody should take that <Col N="934" /> credit away from them and there are a considerable number of other voluntary organisations.  All of those voluntary organisations in thinking through the problem have come to similar conclusions, not just in this country but in the United Kingdom, most of western Europe where I have contacts and North America.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problem &mdash; not the only problem &mdash; of homeless people is, and it sounds like tautology, that they are homeless.  They lack the guaranteed security of accommodation which is comfortable, reasonable, their own and in which they have security.  Almost all of their other problems spring from the lack of access to accommodation.  It is true that some people who are homeless will need some support.  It is a matter of opinion how many of us could function and, in the words of the previous Bill, could prove to somebody's satisfaction that we were capable of independent living.  Most of us marry because we are not particularly happy with the concept of living independently and on our own for the rest of our lives.  All of us, even the Minister, need support.  I would not like to be supporting the Minister, but we all need support.  The myth that somehow there is a person out there who is capable of living on his or her own indefinitely is at variance with human experience.</P>
    <P>That does not get us away from the fact that the fundamental problem of people who are homeless is that they lack accommodation. I do not mean they lack shelter because I do not like the concept of shelter. In other countries the problem of shelter has been dealt with by the provision of large barns and warehouses with, in some horrific cases in the United States, 1,000 beds or more in one large area.  That gets the homeless off the streets but it does not stop them being homeless.  Homelessness is about decent conditions, security and, above all, privacy and the right of a person to have a space somewhere he can be happy with, which is comfortable and which he can call his own.  In dealing with the policy issues which emanate from that, we must accept that we are not dealing with winos, <Col N="935" /> alcoholics or ex-psychiatric patients. Fundamentally we are dealing with people who have similar needs, perceptions and aspirations to those of us who are lucky, privileged or powerful enough to have access to decent housing.</P>
    <P>The collective experience of organisations dealing with the homeless is that homelessness springs from a combination of circumstances.  The first is inadequacy of income; in other words, people do not have sufficient money to provide accommodation for themselves.  We can deal with that later.  In some cases the lack of access to money to pay for accommodation is not because the money is not available but often because of poor administrative response, poor quality delivery, lack of understanding of what it is like to be homeless and an inadequate response to it.  The second problem is the declining provision of low-cost housing. Almost by definition low-cost housing is public sector housing.  The only other way to provide low-cost housing is by subsidising private housing implicitly or explicitly.  The Minister has advanced and extended a number of provisions, including the £3 million which is most welcome. We can discuss that later.</P>
    <P>There is more to it than simply handing money to voluntary organisations.  For instance, in the United Kingdom in 1975 public expenditure on defence and housing was about equal.  In 1985 public expenditure on defence was five times as high as public expenditure on housing. One of President Reagan's first decisions was to end all federal funding for public housing and the consequences of that I will deal with later because we should not pretend that the phenomenon of homelessness in the 27th richest country in the world is different from the phenomenon of homelessness in other richer countries in the western world.  It is a product of changes that are taking place.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom the number of people who are homeless has increased by a factor of two in the period in office of the present British Prime Minister. That has been partly because of Government housing policy, partly because of <Col N="936" /> reductions in Government housing expenditure and partly because of Government policy in other areas which has generated such a thrust of redevelopment that much of the low-cost private accommodation that was available, particularly in the south east, has been removed and replaced by high-cost, high-demand accommodation.  This has squeezed out those who would otherwise have lived in that accommodation and in many cases squeezed them onto the streets.</P>
    <P>The third problem that generates homelessness &mdash; usually the three go together &mdash; is the absence of family contact. If one has no money and one has access to one's family, one will not end up living on the street.  A person who has no access to public sector or low-cost housing and has family support will not lose money.  Even a person who lacks both money and access to housing will usually be sustained by family contacts. This is not my prescription but from Focus Point, Sister Stanislaus' organisation, who have done extraordinarily good quality research on the problem of homelessness.  Therefore, those three things together are necessary to create the problem of homelessness.</P>
    <P>If one starts from that assumption or that analysis, things begin to spring out of it such as challenges about policy and how people live.  Later I would like to talk about specific cases because these are unsung people, often unheard and their experiences deserve to be on the record of the Oireachtas.  We need to get away from much of the imagery of the homeless, the image of homeless people being dirty.  Many of them are, but that is because they are homeless.  People speak of their being ill.  Many of them are, but that again is because they are homeless.  People speak of their being drunk.  Many of the people whom I know who are chronically homeless do not drink at all.  Some of those who are chronically homeless drink far too much.  There is no common thread through all the homeless of drink, drugs, psychiatric or physical illness.  That needs to be disposed of once and for all.  The trouble is that an organisation like the Simon <Col N="937" /> Community, which has been vocal about the homeless, also tends to deal with some of the more extreme manifestations of homelessness.  Many other organisations deal with the homeless and their problems.  They also deal with the ordinary homeless people in the early stages before any other symptoms have developed.</P>
    <P>Sr. Stanislaus has spoken at length about the risks, particularly to homeless women, of exploitation of one kind or another.  We have recently heard talk about the possibilities for exploitation of homeless boys.  They are the extreme examples of what can happen.  They are extreme examples, but they are the examples of the consequences of homelessness. They are not the causes of homelessness; they are the products of homelessness.  That is why any legislation to deal with the problem of homelessness must be as much preventative as it is remedial.  It must endeavour to prevent people becoming homeless rather than attempt to remedy the problem and to deal with the problem when people are effectively homeless.</P>
    <P>In my own thinking, as I try to develop it on this issue, a number of things became apparent.  The first thing was that nobody accepted that there really was a problem of homelessness.  It was with considerable difficulty that one got it through to the Department of the Environment, local authorities and many politicians that there was a problem of homelessness separate from the problem of chronic alcoholism or the problems of ex-psychiatric patients, that there were actually people who were homeless in the terms defined in this Bill who did not have another problem as well.</P>
    <P>We succeeded for a while in getting that message across.  Then another form of confusion became apparent.  I was aware of health boards who said that housing homeless people was the responsibility of local authorities.  I was aware of local authorities who said the opposite: that the problem of dealing with homeless people was the responsibility of the health boards.</P>
    <P>In the earlier Fianna Fáil administration <Col N="938" /> in 1980 or 1981 the then Minister for Health set up a working party to deal with that problem.  The working party did not entirely resolve the problem, but it made a considerable amount of progress. It also identified the fact that there was serious confusion.  I remember a survey done of what were called then &ldquo;county homes&rdquo;.  That was about seven or eight years ago.  The people in those homes were asked to provide temporary accommodation for people passing through. They were asked did they think they had a legal obligation to provide shelter for people who were homeless.  Sixty per cent said yes and 40 per cent said no.  There did not seem to be a satisfactory policy response to such a difficult and controversial issue.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that it is almost 30 years since the decision was taken to phase out that area of concern of the county homes.  It is about 30 years since the commitment was given by a previous Minister that, as the provision of shelter in county homes was being phased out, alternative forms of provision would have to be introduced.  It was never done, of course.  It is a regrettable fact that that service has been removed and has in many cases resulted in a drift towards the cities of people who used to be chronically homeless but at least lived in their own areas.  The provision in rural areas via the county homes was, according to the Simon Community survey, reduced by about 60 per cent in a period of ten years.</P>
    <P>My views on homelessness began to crystallise on a number of things.  I realised that the issue was not recognised. I realised the fact that it was not clear who was responsible for dealing with the homeless.  Thirdly, it was not at all clear that whoever was responsible could be persuaded, encouraged, or coerced if necessary, into doing something about the problem.  Like all areas of minority concern where you have perhaps demand exceeding supply for any service, those who are least popular, those who are most stigmatised, those who are seen as <Col N="939" /> being least in their ability to swing political concern are those who tend to be excluded.</P>
    <P>We had to go through a phase of education and liberalisation of public opinion before it became acceptable that single parents should be given some priority in the provision of local authority housing. Regrettably, it is still true from time to time that certain politicians make a fair amount of cheap publicity out of side swipes at single parents.  One former Member of Dáil Éireann was particularly good at it.  We made that progress.  It is also true, notwithstanding our considerable concern for old people, that we took a long time to acknowledge the depth of deprivation of many old people. There are 40,000 or so of them living alone in this country.  It was the present Taoiseach who was responsible for the task force which was given the job of improving the physical conditions under which old people living alone were expected to exist.  Each minority group needs to be not only identified but positively supported if its housing rights are to be accepted.</P>
    <P>When you have a minority group which on the one hand is in a condition of extreme deprivation and when on the other hand you have a declining expenditure on public housing, and when there are other areas of need which are politically of greater influence and far more significant in numbers, it is difficult to believe that any expression of intent or goodwill of itself guarantees an adequate response to the needs of that minority group.  It can happen, but it need not necessarily happen.  For instance, the almost complete absence of halting sites for members of the travelling community in Limerick city is a good example of the difference between intent and fulfilment. The fact is that you can have all the enabling legislation, and have the funds available, but if you do not have the political will, or if the political resistance is of a particularly virulent kind, then you will not get the result however well intentioned the initial policy response <Col N="940" /> may have been.  That is the nub of the problem with this Bill.</P>
    <P>When one thinks about the problem of being homeless it is important &mdash; I do not want to get involved in tear-jerking stuff, because there is nobody here whose tears would be jerked by my eloquence; and apart from that I would prefer rational argument anyway &mdash; it is important to realise what it means to be homeless.  It needs to be said again and again and again that the lack of a secure base excludes you from everything.  It excludes you from everything, not just from accommodation. It excludes you from proper health care.  It excludes you from income, because neither the Department of Social Welfare nor the community welfare officers are prepared to pay one penny to somebody who does not have an address. You have the extraordinary position where we acknowledge now that there is a substantial problem of homelessness in our society but there is nobody on the books of any of the State support services who is categorised as being without an address.  There are no people receiving State benefit who have no fixed abode even though it is quite possible any day of the week in the saddest of all areas of concern &mdash; the courts &mdash; to see people being recorded as being of no fixed abode in terms of the address they give.  You will never find &mdash; and the Department of Social Welfare will have no record of &mdash; anybody without an address who qualifies for social welfare.  It is simple: if you do not have an address, you do not get anything.  Therefore, whether it is real or imaginary you create an address.  It is a particularly regrettable form of exclusion.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Simon Community published a report some years ago which was entitled &ldquo;Go Home to Bed for a couple of Days&rdquo;, the sort of sensible prescription most general practitioners or casualty officers in a hospital casualty department would recommend for somebody with a minor ailment.  If you have no home or if you are living in a night shelter or a hostel, you cannot go home to bed.  One of the assumed basic tenets of our general medical service which is that people have <Col N="941" /> a home to which they can go, is undermined and somebody with a minor ailment cannot deal with it.  The minor ailment deteriorates into a major ailment. That, in turn, necessitates people being hospitalised at enormous expense to the State and often used to result in people being hospitalised, then discharged back into their homeless condition, becoming ill again and being returned to the hospital again.  That was another issue that had to be fought &mdash; the issue of the conditions under which people were discharged out of hospitals. It took a considerable amount of thinking, as well.</P>
    <P>When you add to the absence of accommodation the deteriorating health conditions and also the extraordinary isolation of being homeless, you will end up in the company of those who are homeless and who will be left with the stigma that goes with being homeless.  To put it at its crudest, that means you will probably not be served in 95 per cent of the public houses of any of our larger cities and towns.  Therefore, you will effectively be seen, if you choose to drink occasionally, as one of the winos who sit on the benches in many of our city centres.</P>
    <P>The absence of a secure place to call your own is not just a housing problem. In that I agree with the Minister.  It is a human problem.  Lack of a secure base produces a long succession of other exclusions and deprivations which will, in the long term, result in the deterioration of the person unless that person is of exceptional character and quality.  From my knowledge of many people who are homeless I feel that the character, the strength of will and the determination to retain their dignity, pride and humour are the really inspiring sides of humanity you learn about from dealing with homeless people.</P>
    <P>I have never been anything other than amazed by the survival of a sense of humour, pride and dignity among people who have had so much taken from them and so much pinned on them in 15 or 20 <Col N="942" /> years' of homelessness.  I am not suggesting that there is some sort of a romantic image of the romantic vagrant everybody can identify with.  I am talking about imperfect people with many inadequacies. What I am talking about is the fact that, in spite of their imperfections, perhaps their drinking, perhaps their occasional runs in with the law, most of the homeless people I know remain very dignified, proud, good humoured and self-assertive human beings who need, and are entitled to, liberation from the sort of conditions which have broken them so far.</P>
    <P>Anybody who wants to see the real quality of homeless people should go and see the Simon Art Exhibition in the Temple Bar Gallery.  I know some of the artists involved in that exhibition.  When it was opened I used the phrase that the people had their artistic skills &ldquo;liberated&rdquo; by the experience of this painting workshop they were involved in.  The quality of what they did, the humour, imagination and talent in it, belies many of the images of homeless people.  These were not marginally homeless people.  These were chronically homeless people who have been homeless for long periods of years.  One of them, I know, has been homeless for almost 20 years now.  He produced a capacity to express himself in paint that would exceed that of the vast majority of ordinary citizens.  I have no doubt of that.  People who believe that homeless people are in some way inadequate or incomplete ought to go and see that sort of an exhibition.</P>
    <P>When your thinking evolves, when you realise the extent of exclusion that not having accommodation creates, and when you see what that extent of exclusion does to people, it is then that you are forced to consider a radical response to the problems.  The radical response means, first of all, that you define the problem.  That is what is being done in this Bill.  I disagree with the definition, but it is a step a long way along the road.  You then identify who is responsible for dealing with the problems. That is also contained fairly clearly in this Bill.  There is no point in defining <Col N="943" /> a problem, saying who is responsible and then not saying what they must do about it.  The third thing you must do with something as extreme as homelessness is clearly say that those who are responsible for dealing with the problem must &mdash; not &ldquo;should, might or may&rdquo;&mdash; do something about it and must not just count them, assess them, measure them, enumerate them or fit them into a programme.  He must do something specific and appropriate about the problems of those who are homeless.  That is a fundamental flaw in this Bill.  I do not know what happened to the Minister, but when I discussed the problem with him he accepted that people had a right to be housed.  When he spoke to the National Conference of Travelling People and was subsequently interviewed on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; not much more than 15 of 18 months go, he used the words that people who were homeless would be housed &ldquo;as of right&rdquo; under the proposed legislation.  I was extremely optimistic.  That is why section 10 of this Bill is such a disappointment. Something happened between September 1987 and the date of publication of this Bill.  That is something we can tease out later on.</P>
    <P>Much in this Bill is directed in the way that all those dealing with the homeless have suggested that public policy should go.  It is not a kind of naive, dreamy idea that people should have a right to a response from the housing authority.  It is a recognition of the extremity of the need and of the damage that need does to people's capacity to participate as full citizens.  I do not think people should have a right to semi-detached, three-bedroomed houses.  I do not think people should have a right to an enormous income, but I do think there are basic things people must be entitled to as of right or else our society cannot protect itself properly and cannot protect its citizens properly.</P>

      <P>May I be associated with your remarks, a Leas-Chathaoirligh?  I wish my Spanish was up to it, but I will not even try the 20 words I have because I might embarrass the House.</P>
      <P>The nub of the disagreement between myself and the Minister is that this Bill guarantees nothing to the homeless other than that they would be identified, counted and assessed.  That is a particular tragedy.  Having come so far in terms of identifying and quantifying the problem, the truth is that not since 1922, as far as I know, has a Minister for the Environment ever rejected a scheme of priorities produced by a housing authority. While the present Minister may well be full of good intentions he is not the master of his successors.  The truth is that while all sorts of intentions can be written into the legislation the housing authority chooses to be difficult.  There are good reasons why one could anticipate that a housing authority will choose to be difficult. I will talk about those in a moment also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill which will guarantee a homeless person accommodation. I do not understand that, because notwithstanding the fine words that the Minister and the Minister of State used in the Dáil about partnership with voluntary organisations, about the need to get away from the obsession that the State is the provider of the remedies to all our problems, the truth is that not one of the voluntary organisations &mdash; with housing authorities and Government Departments &mdash; with whom, I presume, the Minister intends he should set up a partnership accept the view of the <Col N="945" /> Government or the Minister and, presumably, of his Department, that this legislation can work without people being given a right to shelter.</P>
    <P>Somehow or other the Minister believes that he knows better than all the voluntary organisations, who have spent 20 years working with the homeless, what the response should be.  While he has talked at length about why giving shelter alone to people is not sufficient, he has not explained to me why giving people a right to shelter with whatever means he thinks are necessary, is inadequate.  It is not good enough to say that people have a right to shelter.  What you must do is say why a particular remedy you propose is more likely to work.  Let me remind the Minister again of the extract I read at the beginning of my remarks from <i>Administration</i> about the views of three county managers on the homeless.  It is difficult to believe that people requiring the length and extent of education that those three people needed are suddenly going to become the leaders of a revolution in concern and compassion for the homeless.  At a later stage I will propose a quite simple amendment to the Bill which might bring us a good way along the route.</P>
    <P>I would not be too woried if everything in this Bill was not to my satisfaction. What is not clear from this Bill is what can be done to a recalcitrant local authority who refuse to deal with the problem. We can do a lot about them having to assess the numbers, though I was a bit distressed to read in either section 9 or 10 that they do not necessarily have to do a comprehensive survey, and that a representative sample will do.  They can do that; they can produce their scheme of lettings for local authority housing, but I have never suggested that the total solution to the problem of homelessness rests in the provision of local authority housing.  Neither the Bill I introduced in 1983 not anything I have ever suggested since, has ever suggested that.  What I have always suggested is that it must be clear who is responsible for the provision of accommodation for homeless people, not who is responsible for building <Col N="946" /> accommodation for homeless people.  It must be clear who is responsible for ensuring that they are not without accommodation, who is responsible for ensuring that they get adequate accommodation and who is responsible for ensuring that the standards of that accommodation are adequate.</P>
    <P>I have never suggested that the way to deal with the problems of homeless people is by having them all accommodated in purpose-built local authority housing.  Since a substantial number of homeless people are single, it appears to me that it would be either necessary that local authorities would have to build a whole plethora of new single occupancy local authority accommodation or, alternatively, that a variety of other methods could be used.  The tragedy is that in section 10 of the Bill the sorts of methods that I think would be useful are there, but what is lacking is any reason to believe that a local authority would be motivated to do anything more than make a token provision in this direction. The Minister is, perhaps, a better and more experienced politician than I am. He ought to know, therefore, that you cannot sit back and wait on goodwill.</P>
    <P>In a world of competing priorities, competing demands and of increasing limited financial resources, those who are on the margins will be squeezed out.  It is because those of us dealing with homeless people have seen people squeezed out that we want people to be given a right to shelter.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that this is not something outrageously radical. We already have in our Constitution a right to free primary education which was enforced by the Supreme Court not so long ago when a long-standing national school dispute in my own adopted county lasted longer than people anticipated. The Supreme Court said the State was obliged to make provision for primary education for children in that small town.</P>
    <P>We also have a right to an income. Anybody in our society who has no income is entitled to one or other of the various income provision schemes that <Col N="947" /> are available.  It is important to remember that that is not a discretionary provision. It is a right subject to a means test.  Since all of us have talked about people who are homeless and cannot afford to provide accommodation for themselves, we are not talking about some absolute, unqualified right.  We give people a right to education.  We give people a right to an income, however inadequate that income might be, but we do guarantee them an income.  We also give people a right to decent health care, provided their income is below a certain limit.  The health boards are obliged to provide a reasonable standard of health care.  The idea of giving rights to people in areas of social provision is not something entirely new.  It is already there in the area of education.  It is already there in the area of income.  It is already there in the area of health.  The tragedy is that that which is necessary in order to guarantee people's health, in order to use their income to a reasonable extent and, perhaps, in order to make some provision for their own education &mdash; which is housing &mdash; will not be guaranteed to them by us.  I do not know how we can argue that housing, which is such a fundamental need, can be treated in a different way from education, income and health.  I look forward to the Minister elaborating on that.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental misapprehension behind much of the thinking here.  That is that this provision, or my concern, is about a static population of people who happen to be static and homeless.  What I and many other people are concerned about is introducing a policy position which prevents homelessness and which guarantees that people are integrated within society in a way which makes them part of society and which holds our society together. The problem with much of what is passing for public policy in this country today is that it is doing the exact opposite.  Instead of holding society together, it is driving society apart.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how the Minister <Col N="948" /> can be so sure that all the voluntary organisations and the Archbishop of Dublin, and so on can all be wrong about homelessness.  The Archbishop of Dublin criticised this Bill on the grounds that it did not give homeless people a right to accommodation.  It was a well publicised speech in the past couple of months.  I do not know how the Minister can be so sure that he is right and everybody else is wrong.  I do not think the difference between us is as enormous as people might imagine.  We could perhaps work out a middle road in which what is provided could at least be pushed along in the correct direction.</P>
    <P>Since I am talking about policy responses to homelessness it is important to realise that we are not operating, as I have said before, in a vacuum.  There are, for instance, a quarter of a million German citizens without accommodation, there are approximately 15,000 homeless people in Denmark, there are so many ex-psychiatric patients left on the streets of Italy that they have resulted in the coining of a new Italian word called the <i>abandonati</i> because they are effectively the abandoned.  Homelessness in the United States has exploded from 600,000 to 3,000,000 in the last seven or eight years.  The point of all that I am saying is that homelessness is not something that can be remedied by the exercise of goodwill alone.  It must be dealt with in terms of clear policy decisions by the State to do things for the homeless, not to enable things to be done but to guarantee that things will be done.</P>
    <P>At the world conference on homelessness in Boston in June 1987 &mdash; I am quoting from a report on that conference from the Simon Community national office &mdash; Professor Peter Marcuse, Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University, said:</P>
    <P>Western societies have so far developed three strategies for dealing with homelessness.  They consist of denying the problem, blaming the victims and hiding the consequences.</P>
    <P>We were making considerable progress in a different direction because we had <Col N="949" /> created a political consensus &mdash; the Fianna Fáil Party, in my view, in their period in Opposition contributed substantially to that &mdash; which did not choose to deny the problem.  Other voices in our society, the Church and voluntary organisations, contributed to that as well. So, we chose not to deny the problem. Once we have identified the problem there is an implicit tendency to blame the victims in the responses of many to this problem and also we may well be moving in the direction of attempting to hide the consequences.  That having been said, we can make choices.</P>
    <P>We do not necessarily have to rewrite this Bill to make those choices.  The response of one particular area in the United States to this is interesting.  I will explain the place in a moment.  In this particular state in the United States the causes of homelessness were identified as shortage of affordable suitable housing, the institutionalisation, poverty and low incomes, unemployment and the failure of professionals to provide suitable and relevant services.  That state developed a four-pronged policy to deal with homelessness, prevention services, emergency services, supportive services and aggressive policies designed to produce permament housing linked to employment. Prevention was the only way the state felt it could get ahead of the problem.  The governor of this state and his advisers were critical of other states that put all their energies into emergency services. That was the state of Massachusetts.  It is particularly interesting because the governor of that state will be, perhaps, the next President of the United States. He is identified as a pragmatic and practical man, neither an ideologist nor a dreamy idealist.</P>
    <P>The problem about not providing an obligation to make provision for homelessness in this Bill is that the area of prevention will be the underdeveloped area of any policy response.  We will be more and more moving into the area of emergency provision rather than of prevention because there is nothing like the prospect of an obligation to provide housing for people to concentrate the minds <Col N="950" /> of people into the area of preventing homelessness.  If you are liable to be left with the consequences of delay, poor planning and poor policy on your doorstep in the form of an obligation enforceable in court to make provision for people, then you will be more likely to identify the causes of homelessness, to do something about them and to deal with other agencies that perhaps can contribute to them.  If you do not do that, if you do not have an obligation to provide for people, you will let the matter run.</P>
    <P>Since figures are quoted a lot about people who are homeless it is important to get some case histories on the record, because as Governor Dukakis has demonstrated it is possible to be both successful politically, financially prudent and also radical in policy terms in dealing with the problem of the homeless.  Governor Dukakis's very practical response to the problem is one that I would commend to the Minister in his reading about the problem of homelessness because it appears to have worked and it appears to have been successful.  He was not swamped either with people who could not handle the housing, people who were trying to abuse the housing or anything like that.  He seems to have dealt with the problem remarkably well.</P>
    <P>I want to read a few cases on to the record of the House.  I am quoting from the annual street workers report of the Dublin Simon Community.  They stated:</P>
    <P>Joan's story.</P>
    <P>On Christmas Eve 1985 we met Joan, who is 25 years old and is originally from Ballymun.  She had been sleeping rough and staying with friends on and off for a few months.  Joan's family background is one of violence and for this reason she had to leave home.  She is a very capable but slightly nervous person and was extremely anxious to obtain a flat.  She applied to Dublin Corporation for housing.  Some months later we went along to the homeless section of the corporation with Joan.  We queued in a small room along with many other homeless people applying for housing.  Joan's <Col N="951" /> initial interview took place in front of the other applicants and did not afford any privacy.  This is standard practice. Joan was offered a flat in Ballymun but this was too near home for safety. Joan, supported by one of the street workers, explained why she did not want to live in Ballymun.  The officer dealing with her found this reason totally unacceptable and wondered why a woman of 25 years could not &ldquo;face up to her father&rdquo;.  At this stage Joan was in tears.  Due to the intervention of the street workers, Joan was eventually assigned a corporation flat in the city centre.  Joan is now settled happily into her flat and is surrounded by good and interesting neighbours.</P>
    <P>There is a limitless list of case histories. The Simon Community report stated of Ciaran's case:</P>
    <P>Ciaran is a man in his thirties who had worked as a merchant seaman. When we first met him in December 1985 he was sleeping rough.  We kept in regular contact with Ciaran and in April 1986 he was admitted to the No Fixed Abode Unit of St. Brendan's Hospital.  Following his discharge we helped him to obtain a private flat.  The rent was £17 per week.  Ciaran was receiving unemployment assistance of £36 per week.  He applied for a rent allowance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Two weeks later a community welfare officer came to visit him and, on seeing a note from the landlord's daughter stating the rent, he promised Ciaran a rent allowance of £5 a week without delay.  This allowance was to increase after a few weeks.  However, Ciaran was kept waiting a further four weeks before any payment whatsoever was made.  Ciaran enquired from the relevant health centre the reasons for the delay in payment and was told that the note was not valid because it was not signed by the landlord himself.  The reason given to us by the community welfare officer was that there had been a temporary change of personnel due to holidays. <Col N="952" /> Six weeks after moving into the flat, Ciaran received a rent allowance of £5 per week which was increased to £12 per week and back dated several weeks later.  This only happened after several visits and phone calls to the health centre and after Ciaran was visited a second time by another community welfare officer.</P>
    <P>The workers' comments are:</P>
    <P>Ciaran's story is one example of the long delays many homeless people have to endure before receiving the basic rent allowance.  If Ciaran had not got the support of the Simon Street Workers he could have become homeless again due to financial difficulties incurred in waiting to obtain his rent allowance.</P>
    <P>Members of this House ought to consider what it is like to actually have to live for six weeks on £19 a week.  I invite people to think about it because, as I said at the beginning of my remarks on this issue, I am not at all persuaded that the problem of homelessness is necessarily a problem of resources alone.  It is partly a problem of resources.  It is also a problem of administrative will, administrative efficiency and a willingness to provide flexible responses.</P>
    <P>I have tried to document that there is considerable evidence of a lack of flexibility and a lack of sensitivity in many of the administrative responses and, indeed, in many of the delivery agencies.  I hope it is easy to see why I am less than happy about resting on the shoulders of some of those agencies the responsibility to be flexible, to be imaginative and to be creative in dealing with the problems of the homeless.  The evidence up to now is sadly to the contrary.</P>
    <P>To conclude on the work of the street workers of the Dublin Simon Community, the Dublin Simon Community's annual report for 1987, which has just been published, says:</P>
    <P>Our street work service is designed to assist and befriend people with accommodation difficulties.  The two full-time street workers visit people known to Simon in flats, prisons and <Col N="953" /> hospitals.  The street workers identified through telling case histories some of the problems encountered by homeless people in search of accommodation. These include standards of accommodation in the private rented sector which are appallingly low and vulnerable people are charged high rents by landlords for squalid flats.  This situation continues because there is no control or regulation of this sector.</P>
    <P>This is an area to which I invite the Minister to direct his attention.  If there is a comprehensive response to the problem of homelessness, part of it must be an attempt to produce some sort of comprehensive enforceable sustainable standards for accommodation provision in the private sector.  The report goes on to say there is unnecessary hardship, as a result of long delays on the part of the Eastern Health Board in granting basic rent allowances and these delays can last up to 15 weeks.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make here is that the Eastern Health Board are familiar with and experienced in the provision of financial assistance to people through the community welfare officers and the supplementary welfare service.  What am I supposed then to make of section 10 of the Bill where housing authorities may provide a person with such assistance including assistance as the authority consider appropriate.  As of now, I am not aware of any function of a housing authority to provide people with financial assistance.  When I see the records of an agency experienced in and familiar with the provision of financial assistance I am entitled to be less than optimistic about how any agency who have no familiarity with or experience in this area will deal with the question of providing financial assistance to people.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of reason I have for being pessimistic about the effectiveness of section 10 of the Bill.  The Simon Community report said that there are little or no support services for people discharged from psychiatric hospitals.  I have often believed that people dealing with the homeless have been unduly defensive in <Col N="954" /> the sense that we have always argued that because we were trying to get them a right to be housed, we asserted that effectively the only ones we were concerned about were the ones who were not mentally ill, who were not alcholics or who were not mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>It should be said that people who are mentally ill, mentally handicapped or, indeed, who have other ailments are just as entitled to decent accommodation as those who are whole and that the wounded and the whole in our society are not some sort of two different degrees of need or of concern, that whoever is responsible for people who are mentally ill, whether it be the housing or the health authorities, cannot get away from the fact that somewhere it should be written down that any human being, irrespective of his or her physical or mental condition, is entitled to live in dignity in decent accommodation, of a decent standard, with a reasonable aspiration to security in that accommodation.</P>
    <P>The report by the inspector of mental hospitals on the largest hospital in the State, which was leaked some weeks ago, would not reassure one that even the so-called caring agencies do a particularly good job of looking after the most vulnerable in our society.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Simon Community report goes on:</P>
    <P>Impersonal and insensitive arrangements whereby applicants for local authority housing are interviewed through a hatch in a public office so that other applicants overhear details of their personal life.</P>
    <P>It is not necessarily relevant to the Bill but that sort of an experience underlines the reason so many voluntary organisations are so sceptical about the effectiveness of this Bill.  The organisational system which deals with people like that, the organisational system which does not understand people's need for privacy, which does not understand the urgency of people's needs, cannot really be expected to produce the sort of urgency of response that the prevention of homelessness requires or demands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> That is why I keep on coming back to the fundamental flaw in this Bill, the fact that there is no way of pushing, persuading or coercing a recalcitrant local authority to do anything they do not want to do.  It could be done quite simply without any surrender of any principle by simply enabling the Minister to instruct a housing authority, where he was satisfied that there was a homelessness problem, to do all or some of the things they are enabled to do.  It would not give people a right to housing, though I believe they should have one.  It would at least focus the minds of those who are given the job of making provision at local level on the fact that, if they identify a problem of homelessness, they can either deal with it themselves as they see fit or they can be instructed by the Minister to deal with it.  That would go a long way because it would crystalise responsibility and would identify a line of responsibility.  Otherwise we will have a very diffuse system where each local authority will respond in their own way and where it will not be possible to enforce other than through long and difficult campaigns the services that are meant to be provided for homeless people.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the only reason for the dilution of the right to shelter in this Bill has to do with policy towards the homeless.  I read the debates in the other House and there was a considerable reference to the future housing crisis which we are now effectively guaranteeing because of the reduction in funding for local authority housing.  I have figures here which suggest that local authority housing completions in 1980 were 5,984. This rose to 7,002 in 1984.  It is estimated to have dropped to 3,400 in 1987 and is estimated to drop to 1,600 in 1988.  Those figures are from the Dáil Official Report of 25 November 1987, column 1785.</P>
    <P>If you have a drop of almost 5,500 in four years for the maximum provision to what is now envisaged and if that persists for a number of years, quite clearly, even given demographic changes, even given emigration, one will have to accept the fact that we will have somewhere around <Col N="956" /> 200,000 to 250,000 unemployed, an increasing number of old people in our society, a large young population and a large marrying population.  That sort of a dramatic drop in local authority housing completions, coupled with the drop in income that unemployment and deflated wages will produce, will mean an astonishingly large housing crisis in a relatively short period.</P>
    <P>The Dáil Official Report of 27 April 1988 states:</P>
    <P>The allocation for new house starts to Cork Corporation for 1988 is nil, to Dublin Corporation nil, to Galway Corporation nil, to Limerick Corporation nil and to Waterford Corporation nil....</P>
    <P>We can see that even the figure of 1,600 for 1988 may well be substantially less in 1989 and 1990.  It is difficult, therefore, to see how one can have people who are without shelter, people who are homeless, guaranteed a right to shelter when, in fact, effectively there will not be any local authority housing carried out in the immediate future.  I have a funny feeling, even though I am sure the Minister will spiritedly deny it, that there is a connection between the substantial reduction in local authority housing construction and the reluctance to give people any sort of, however qualified, right to shelter.  There is a lot that could be said about the problem of homelessness but I have said it on three or four occasions already in this House.  I have said it to the Minister and to his officials and there is probably no need to repeat it again.  I have spoken at some length on the issue.</P>
    <P>I would like to begin to conclude, if I can use that phrase, by talking a bit about some of the things that are in the Bill. The most trenchant and most valid criticism, the best expressed criticism, is that of the Simon Community.  Like the Simon Community, I welcome what is positive in the Bill, but I am unhappy with many things that are missing from it.  I am not happy that the definition of homeless in section 2 is comprehensive enough.  In <Col N="957" /> particular, given my emphasis on prevention of homelessness, which I believe to be the proper way of guaranteeing that we do not have a problem nothing is being done about people who are threatened with homelessness.</P>
    <P>It seems entirely ludicrous that you have to wait until people are on the street before the provisions of this Bill, however inadequate I may take them to be, can be implemented.  I do not know why it is not possible given the discretionary nature of section 10, to extend it to people whom the local authority view as being threatened with homelessness.  Since the local authority are effectively God in relation to what they need to do, they could quite clearly make provision for people who are threatened with homelessness instead of having to wait until people are on the side of the road.</P>
    <P>The second concern I have with respect to the Bill relates to sections 8 and 9 in terms of the estimates of housing requirements. I do not understand why we cannot have a guarantee of estimates of housing requirements on a regular basis. Section 9 guarantees that a housing assessment will be carried out not less frequently than every three years.  If the housing assessment is being carried out not less frequently than every three years, why not the estimate of housing requirements?  It would be logical and sensible to conduct both together and to conduct both with an equal frequency.  I also think it is a considerable pity that it is not clear from section 8 or section 9 that the result of the estimate of housing requirements and the housing assessment will be made public.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why it is not clearly written into the Bill that such information should be made public.  I invite the Minister to agree with me that it should be published, or to explain why it should not be published.  It does not have to be published in any elaborate fashion.  There need not be any glossy publications.  The scheme of lettings for housing can be inspected by any member of the public at an office of the housing authority &mdash; that is contained in a later section of the Bill &mdash; and I cannot see <Col N="958" /> why the outcome of these assessments cannot be available for inspection by any member of the public.</P>
    <P>I suspect that it is not the intention that this material should be made public.  I suspect that parts of it may be made public, that nobody will be too happy with publishing every three years, or whatever it is, measures which show that housing authorities are actually not dealing with the problem, particularly in a period when on the basis of the allocations so far this year, we will not have any new house starts in most of our major urban areas.  I have reason to believe nobody really wants to make provision for the publication of this information. Perhaps the Minister can assure me that I am entirely mistaken.</P>
    <P>It is a pity also that section 10 does not contain, as I said previously, a guarantee of a response.  I am not even talking about a right to housing.  One of the interesting things about section 2 is that, notwithstanding my criticisms, it has one very useful aspect to it.  It states:</P>
    <P>A person shall be regarded by a housing authority as being homeless for the purposes of this Act if there is no accommodation available which, in the opinion of the authority he, together with... might reasonably be expected to reside...</P>
    <P>If the person has no accommodation, there is no real opinion that the housing authority can have and, therefore, that person must be regarded as homeless.  In many ways that definition of homelessness is more satisfactory than the qualified one contained in the Coalition Government's Bill because it does not enable people to use their own opinions to exclude people from being homeless so they have to accept them as being homeless.  The tragedy is that, once they have accepted people as being homeless, they do not necessarily have to do anything about it.  That is why the Minister ought to take to himself, either by regulation or in the Bill, the right to direct authorities who have assessed a problem of homelessness on whatever scale it is <Col N="959" /> and who are not doing the things they are entitled to do, to do them.</P>
    <P>There is, however, another problem in section 10 to which I direct the Minister's attention and which has not been commented on so far, that is, subsection (8) which states that where accommodation or lodgings are made available to a person by virtue of subsection (1) (a) the circumstances of that person change to the extent that, in the opinion of the housing authority, <i>inter alia</i>, if the accommodation or lodgings being made so available were no longer available, the person would not be homeless, or the person is now able to provide accommodation from his own resources, the authority may cease to have such accommodation or lodgings made so available.</P>
    <P>That sounds perfectly reasonable if you are talking about either direct subsidies or local authority housing, but subsection (1) (a) talks about the housing authority making arrangements with a body for the provision by that body of accommodation for a homeless person.  It appears that any voluntary organisation who enter into such an arrangement will have surrendered their autonomy to the housing authority because any person they are providing accommodation for whom they deem to be homeless can be put out of that accommodation if the housing authority come to that conclusion.</P>
    <P>The autonomy of voluntary organisations will be undermined by what is an unintentional provision of this Bill which will give the housing authority effectively the right to say to a voluntary organisation: &ldquo;We no longer think that person should be in your accommodation; out he goes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is the intention of the Bill.  It is something that should be amended and we can discuss it at some length.  The other unfortunate omission, particularly in the area of renting accommodation, arranging lodgings, or contributing to the cost of such accommodation, is the omission of any reference to standards that I could find in the Bill.  We have had enough evidence at this stage of the hotel for the homeless <Col N="960" /> syndrome in the United Kingdom, of some of the horrific stuff that was in the <i>Sunday Observer</i> about security staff in the so-called hotels, intimidating children and threatening residents that, if they spoke to the press about the conditions, they would be kicked out of the place. The last people who complained to the press about the conditions of one particular so-called hotel lost their accommodation two days later.</P>
    <P>We do not want people getting rich on the backs of the homeless.  The way to ensure that is to insist that decent standards be met.  Nobody is talking about excessive luxury, but reasonable standards in terms of privacy, sanitation, water, heating, absence of dampness etc. They are reasonable expectations.  They are expected in other areas of provision. Local authorities have obligations in many cases to insist on these standards but, whether they enforce them or not, is another matter.  That is another unfortunate omission from the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons said those sort of matters are best dealt with on Committee Stage.  I am not sure when we are proposing to have Committee Stage but it is suggested that we might have it tomorrow. I will have a substantial number of amendments on Committee Stage and I expect to have an equally substantial number of amendments on Report Stage. I look forward to the usual quality of reasonable response which the Minister gives to reasonable arguments.  It is a great pity that a considerable opportunity was lost to write into our legislation the right to shelter, to write into our legislation a guarantee that nobody who is homeless and who has not got the means to provide for himself or herself, should live on the side of the road.</P>
    <P>The problem about this Bill and the most upsetting part of it is that it accepts implicitly that people in our society will continue to live on the side of the road. If it is wrong for people to live on the side of the road, if it is wrong for people to live in the sort of accommodation provided in the night shelters I am most familiar with, it should be our objective to end it.  You cannot end it by hoping <Col N="961" /> that something will happen or by promising that you will do your best to see that it will happen.  You can only end it by guaranteeing that people will do something else.  That has been the considered view of every voluntary organisation in the country, every voluntary organisation that I am aware of in the United Kingdom and every voluntary organisation I have had any contact with in the rest of the European Communities.  It is also the view of many of those dealing with the homeless in the States, that you cannot do it either by market forces or by expressions of goodwill.  What provision there is for homeless people in New York city was fought for through the courts and the courts accepted that the State had an obligation to make provision for people.</P>
    <P>There is a body of legal opinion which suggests that there is an implied right to shelter in our Constitution.  It may well be that, if we do not succeed in getting the guarantee written into legislation, we may perhaps have to pursue the constitutional route.  That is one of the reasons I regret the fact that, after so much hard work, so much effort and so much thought on his part, somehow or other this Minister's good intentions were deflected and that a Bill that starts well and goes on well, ends so poorly with such a weak provision at the end of so much in terms of effort, definition and intent.  Nobody I know in the voluntary sector, dealing with the homeless, believes that this Bill will make a fundamental difference.  They believe it is a representation of thinking.  They believe it is a step forward but they do not believe it is the sort of necessary dramatic shift in priority which would be needed to deal with the problems of the homeless.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister for the things he has done which are very worth while.  I want to qualify heavily that compliment by saying that I believe section 10, as it stands, will not have the desired effect in local authority areas, where either housing, or funds, or goodwill, or all three of them or any of the three of them are in short supply.  Even if there is goodwill there, the fact that no specification as to minimum standards is <Col N="962" /> written into the Bill will leave homeless people open to provision in very inadequate accommodation.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to consider at least some amendments to section 10.  In order to facilitate those of us who want to ensure that local authorities do what they are enabled to do, I ask the Minister to ensure that the results of the surveys under sections 8 and 9 would be made public so that we can at least evaluate in an objective way the performance of the housing authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in welcoming the Minister to this House.  I welcome the new legislation. A large number of people recognise that the legislation will be helpful.  I do not think anybody could ever claim that ideal legislation can be introduced and that all the problems in an area as vast as housing will be automatically solved or covered.  I accept this.  This Bill is a useful improvement in general terms and goes a good part of the way.  The housing problem is vast.  Rural Ireland has different problems from the city problems.</P>
      <P>I listened to Senator Ryan's fine contribution. It is related mostly to the problems in the city with which I have very little contact, even though I have been a member of a local authority for 29 years. I read in the papers that all cities have a really serious problem of homeless people.  We could attribute it to the affluence of the society we are living in, or we could attribute it to many different aspects of our developing society.  Nevertheless, the problems to be covered in the Housing Bill are enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see this Bill as an improvement and as a step forward to meet the need.  Like any other legislation, its implementation depends on the funds available.  I see legislation in a totally different light.  The provisions are laid down but they are only paper provisions unless the Government have the will to finance them and the local authorities have the will to implement and deliver them on the ground.  I welcome the Minister's attitude <Col N="963" /> and his constructive approach to a difficult problem.  That is my general assessment.</P>
    <P>Like other Senators, I have my own difficulties coming from a rural area.  I hope this legislation will provide a framework that will enable local authorities and all the agencies involved in the provision of housing to embark on the development of a housing programme that will be never ending.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tremendous development we have had recently with the tenant purchase scheme.  That was a massive improvement.  I am a member of a local authority in rural Ireland where we were faced with the difficulty of continuing to repair houses.  It is very natural that people should wish to own their own house.  The decision to allow local authority houses to be purchased by the tenants at a reasonable price was a major breakthrough.  It is tragic to see local authorities providing houses and then having to meet repair bills which far exceed the rents of those houses.  The initial cost of the house is never recouped. If you look at that in practical terms you will see that there has to be an end to it &mdash; but when the end comes somebody who does not have a house may suffer. Finance for the provision of houses is a major problem for a country such as ours which does not have vast wealth.  It is tragic that the maintenance bill for a local authority house outstrips the total rent.</P>
    <P>There is another bad aspect to that kind of system.  When a person gets a local authority house all the repairs are carried out by the local authority who provided the House.  But the person becomes careless about the house.  It is not his own, and it is not his responsibility to keep and maintain the house.  I would say every member of a local authority has had occasion to baulk at being asked to bring out an engineer to clear a stopped drain or to do some small maintenance work which involved vast resources of money and manpower.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to see the new tenant purchase scheme being offered to people. There is a realistic assessment of the <Col N="964" /> value of the house.  I come from an area where there is a vast number of local authority houses and the response to that scheme was magnificent.  In my 29 years as a public representative I believe it was the best measure ever introduced by any Government or local government and it evoked the best response on the ground. It got people involved in ownership and maintenance of their own home.  It stopped the financial drag on resources, thereby automatically making more funds available to provide for further housing.  That was the intention behind the scheme.  I warmly welcome that measure.</P>
    <P>Recently, there was a new move by the Government to direct the financing of private housing away from local authorities and from central funds to those who are involved in the business of financing, whether it is housing agencies, banks or financial consortia.  That was a tremendous development and is welcomed in general terms by the vast number of people.  But it is not yet 100 per cent satisfactory.  There have been difficulties, perhaps more difficulties in rural Ireland, about the value of the house, the area where the house was being built and many other aspects that would not be very relevant in city areas. But, generally, the measure encourages the financial institutions within the State to become involved in the financing of houses.  It is, therefore, a good arrangement and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>The new measure has a major task. The provision of housing is ongoing and is a major difficulty.  The difficulty in rural Ireland is substantially different from that in the city of Dublin.  The Housing Bill, 1984, was not a great measure.  It was not very satisfactory so far as local authorities in rural Ireland were concerned.</P>
    <P>I am speaking mainly about the aspect of the 1984 Bill which provided for house improvement grants.  A reasonably wealthy person in the city could have a second house.  He could spend a lot of money on repairs, putting in PVC or aluminium windows, doors and porches and central heating, actually bringing up the standard <Col N="965" /> of an old house, and making it a financial proposition whether to retain or to sell it.  For people with the wealth and for the people who had a house on a valuable site in the city it was a very attractive proposition to repair that house.  When the measure was introduced people in the country had to get planning permission and they had to apply for finance.  It was harder to get finance to do housing repairs in rural Ireland and it also took longer.  Therefore, I believe that a number of people in rural Ireland who had applications, and still have applications, under the 1984 Act for house improvement grants were caught.  The number of people who were caught in rural Ireland is substantially greater than those who were caught in the city.  There were a number of areas in which people found themselves with a problem because they were not so quick off the mark, because they had more difficulties to surmount and were less confident in their ability to finance the project.  That highlights a serious difficulty in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must continue to build in rural Ireland.  We must continue to build single cottages.  It could be argued that they are not an economic proposition.  But look at the disadvantages and the problems when you allow people into the city &mdash; Senator Ryan is complaining about this &mdash; when we have to provide shelters and have to respond to homeless people on the street. I think it would be a lesser problem if people were supported and retained on the family farm &mdash; even if they are the last of the family, perhaps two elderly people living in the old homestead that needs repair or replacement.  I still see a need for cottages in rural Ireland.  I hope the Minister will continue to provide the local authority with finance to build rural cottages.</P>
    <P>I will not deal with the question of hard stands, camp sites and so on, because in rural Ireland, and certainly in my county, they do not present the same type of problem.  Our biggest difficulty at the moment is to segregate the travelling people.  Some of them are very well off, some are better off than the people in the settled communities and a big percentage <Col N="966" /> are in business.  The public at the moment could find it very easy to be hostile towards travelling people because of the impression the traders and the better-off section of the travelling people are giving. Most of them certainly in my part of the country, are trading very successfully. They have new vehicles and that in itself presents a problem for the less-well off section of the travelling people.  The local authorities and the many organisations in rural Ireland are doing a useful job and the provisions in this Bill will help that good work to continue.  I do not see that as a major problem in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The expressed intention in this Bill is good, as it is in any Bill, but all of us must recognise that the introduction of legislation is not in itself the complete answer.  The delivery, the performance, the financing of and the compliance with it are the real test of the Bill.  Local authorities will be anxious to work in accordance with the new legislation and to provide extra houses but I hope &mdash; and I say this in country terms &mdash; that those who are planning to develop housing in rural Ireland under the new legislation will not suck the hind teat as far as provision is concerned.  That expression is often used in the country.</P>
    <P>Because of my experience, commitment to and understanding of the difficulties of rural Ireland I believe that it is more difficult to provide housing there than in the cities.  I will support that by saying that the Bill will most benefit the cities of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, or other major centres of population where property value is higher.</P>
    <P>It is much easier to provide a house in these areas because the finance agency that will lend money, whether to a private builder or to a local authority, will always recognise the importance of the value of the house.  This is borne out by the fact that the National Building Agency in the past three or four years have not gone north of a line between Dundalk and Galway and the number of houses built privately by contractors has declined west of the Boyne.  I hope the Government will recognise the difference.  Perhaps it is more evident in my county.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" /> In County Donegal, the county manager, who has been there for 30 years, sanctioned the building of six houses when he should have sanctioned the building of 20.  The third of four stages now costs three or four times the price. As a result &mdash; and I believe this to be unique &mdash; we have a serious housing shortage.  This is a serious problem but not entirely brought about by any Government or by any legislation.  It is partly self-inflicted.  Therefore, we are very concerned about the introduction of new legislation and how it will affect us, how we can put the balance right and recover the ground that we have lost over so many years.  I believe we have a very substantial housing list and the National Building Agency are not contributing anything to the west.  That, in itself, makes it much more difficult.  In major centres there is private development, contractors building on &ldquo;spec&rdquo; and the National Building Agency and this has gone a long way towards solving the housing problem.  There is not the same approach towards meeting housing needs in other areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to housing grants, I want to say to the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, whom I believe is committed and conscientious and has been on top of this problem, that he has had a major problem in O'Connell Bridge House.  He has had to take on responsibility for an administration that was difficult, outdated and arrogant &mdash; and I do not use that word accidentally.  I will give three examples of house improvement grant decisions that I believe to be utterly unfair.  The Minister said that we would cut out the red tape and use a practical approach.</P>
    <P>I know of a family in Donegal who applied for a house improvement grant and the housing inspector did not call until almost a year later.  He called on a Saturday morning and put a card under the door saying that he had called when nobody was at home.  Four days later that applicant got a letter saying that as he was not at home when the housing inspector called that his grant application had <Col N="968" /> lapsed.  That is utterly unfair and I protest here in the strongest possible terms as it is the only forum that I have to protest in.  I have the letters with me here.  That is certainly not fulfilling the housing legislation in any manner.</P>
    <P>The Housing Memorandum part A &mdash; eligibility &mdash; section 2.4 states:</P>
    <P>Where the house is built on the applicant's own site under a contract to build &ldquo;self build&rdquo; the VAT registered work undertaken by the registered contractor(s) must not be less than £15,000.  More than one VAT registered contractor can contribute to make up the £15,000 minimum.</P>
    <P>I was informed of a case where a small contractor went to do a job.  The applicant, who had borrowed £20,000 from the housing agency, went with the contractor and bought the materials.  The invoice was made out in the applicant's name. There was no dishonesty.  It was done openly and fairly and the VAT was paid on £18,000 worth of materials.  The work cost about £5,000 to the contractor.  The invoice was submitted to the Department and a letter issued refusing the grant which was utterly disgusting and unacceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I raise it is that I recognise the difficulties and the good intentions when introducing legislation. However, I also recognise delivery on the ground.  If we do not succeed in implementing legislation, all the pious platitudes that can be inserted in a Bill based on parliamentary draftman's experience, on the best advice given are meaningless if there is not good intent on the part of everybody, the Minister and all others.  I am not availing of this occasion to embarrass the Minister.  Privately and publicly I acknowledged that I hold the <Col N="969" /> Minister in high esteem.  There is no bluff or no lack of intention on the part of the Minister to deliver.  I am criticising the structures, the system and the difficulties they present.  I said at the outset that I recognise that the Minister has inherited a problem at O'Connell Bridge House. No matter what legislation is introduced, if you cannot deliver, if the pipe is corroded, the full measure cannot be achieved. I am not questioning the Minister's intention for one minute.  I totally support him.  It is abundantly clear to all that he has done outstanding work.  The Minister should take aside those people who are complacent and say to them: I am satisfied that in introducing this Bill it was my firm intent to wipe out any sloppiness or bad procedure in the implementation of its provisions.</P>
      <P>If you sit down, allow red tape and bureaucracy to win, the poor will come off worst and those who are well-organised and well-financed, will do best.  They can more quickly and easily surmount any difficulties.  The greatest need at present is in pockets of rural Ireland.  I say that with total respect to Senator Ryan's passionate plea on behalf of the homeless people and those on the streets. For example, I could take members a distance of two miles and show them ten caravans with young children, with water running down the walls, leading to condensation, chest problems and doctors visits.  Should I be elected to a county council, to the Seanad five times and not air those serious matters that concern me?  I would be failing in my duty and would resign had I not the opportunity or the support of this House to do so.  I am hopeful that the provisions of this Bill will go part of the way to clearing up the housing problems in pockets in rural areas, in particular in my own county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see people removed from the squalor of caravans and bad housing.  I know it can be done by way of encouragement of local authorities and people generally to house themselves.  It can be done.  The provisions of this Bill are adequate and welcome.  Perhaps I am not being sufficiently eloquent but I am trying <Col N="970" /> to get the message across that I am concerned about delivery and implementation on the ground.  I am saying to the Minister that probably he would be my choice as the man to deliver the goods.  I am merely helping him to identify difficult areas.  I trust that the Minister will recognise that I am sincere and that I have some experience in these matters.  I hope the provisions of the Bill will go some way to meeting some of the needs.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to investigate the possibility of local authorities buying houses from small contractors.  This is not done at present, but we are now looking at matters afresh.  We should not be afraid of addressing procedural difficulties. I am asking the Minister to encourage local authorities &mdash; if they are satisfied beyond doubt that they can buy a group of two or, say, ten houses &mdash; to buy ready built from a contractor particularly if access roads are developed, the site acquired, services laid on and the houses meet the building standards, VAT has been paid and the contractor is 100 per cent above board.  With the provisions of this Bill I am asking the Minister to encourage local authorities to buy houses from small contractors, or large contractors, where it is proven beyond doubt that they are getting good value.</P>
    <P>Perhaps as a more revolutionary idea in today's world, as Europeans, and representing a county with a housing problem, I ask the Minister to allow local authorities to borrow money, whether from the European Investment Bank or wherever.  I know that probably the Central Bank and others would frown on that proposal.  I regard housing of people as a valuable investment.  I regard local authorities as experienced bodies in that respect.  Part of the problem in rural Ireland could be solved if local authorities were allowed to borrow directly.  They should have no difficulty whatever in getting the money.  For example, my local authority, Donegal County Council, could raise funds and bring about a substantial improvement in the housing position in Donegal if the Government allowed them to raise funds within legitimate, recognised, financial structures in <Col N="971" /> Europe.  The Minister might examine that suggestion.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I went into too much detail but I did so with the sincere intention to encouraging the Minister to support needy areas in respect of which all the legislation in the world will achieve little if we cannot deliver and implement its provisions on the ground.</P>
    <P>I want to say this in sincerity without being parochial, local or rural to the extent that I do not recognise we have a lovely city here in Dublin.  I drive out by Donnybrook and I see the marvellous development there, as good as any in the world, far superior to anything in America, with cutstone pillars and gates and lively housing schemes.  I visit them, I even stop my car and see the staff of the local authority watering the flowers and replacing plants on the road between here and Donnybrook.  Then I go back down to Donegal, I see the difference and I say to myself: &ldquo;You have a long way to go, McGowan&rdquo;.  You know you have a heavy task and even those coming after you have a task, if ever we are to get equal status, if we are ever to get the people out of living in rotten caravans on the hillside in Donegal.  That is the problem I have to tackle.  Having an opportunity to air it here and to get it off my chest is a help.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution aspires to cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  I have not used that expression very much. I see how unequal we are.  I see the need at least to provide decent housing for all our people.  If decent housing with running water, electricity and education are provided in rural areas they will survive. Is it not better to do that and give them some degree of support for basics than allowing them reach the stage when they no longer believe in themselves, when those who are living in the city centre with their roads covered with flowers, are taxed to death to send vanloads of money, guarded by the Army, down to sustain those on the side of the hill?  That is my simple philosophy.</P>
    <P>I hope the provisions of this Bill work. I hope it goes part of the way to solving <Col N="972" /> those problems.  I call on the Minister to ensure that rural areas get their fair share of allocation of moneys for housing, whether by way of grants for essential repairs, disabled persons housing, a rural cottage, whether it involves a private builder, a local authority or whatever aspect of housing development.  I hope the Minister will ensure rural areas get their fair share of the cake and that attention is given to the serious difficulties obtaining with regard to housing in rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In general the Labour Party welcome the Bill and see its provisions as being progressive.  The main argument with the Minister would be that there is no obligation or duty on local authorities to house homeless people; rather it is still simply a requirement.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with what I consider to be some omissions from the Bill. I was glad to hear Senator McGowan speak frankly and sincerely about the problem of the travellers.  In Waterford city we also have a problem with travellers. We have succeeded over the years in housing quite a few travelling families but at present there are three or four families who do not particularly want housing, who are camped on the side of the road and frequent the area for most of the year.  We call these the permanent travellers.  The Minister's Department have approved in principle £170,000 for the provision of a hard stand in Waterford. Very recently a revised proposed lay-out by his Department was agreed by Waterford Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to put one point to the Minister.  The planning committee of Waterford Corporation went to a great deal of trouble to investigate this matter, to learn from what had been done in other areas, to make the halting site or hard stand as successful as possible.  The official who deals with such matters in Dublin County Council came to a meeting of the planning committee and outlined to us what was happening in Dublin. Likewise members of that planning committee went to Cork city and visited the halting sites there.  One point that came <Col N="973" /> across to us very clearly was the need for a caretaker on each of the halting sites. Waterford Corporation sought this provision from the Minister's Department but they were not able to agree to their request.  We are genuinely concerned about this matter.</P>
    <P>The three or four families about whom I spoke would be the so-called permanent traveller families.  Probably there are another nine traveller families who could be described as transient.  The latter would frequent the Waterford area for a part of the year only.  Then there are the group Senator McGowan described as traders, some of whom can have adequate housing accommodation in other areas, who come to the area when there are pickings to be had for a local festival, race meeting or whatever. Mixing permanent traveller families and transient families on a halting site can present difficulties.  Groups dealing with the travellers have pointed out these difficulties to us.</P>
    <P>The role of the caretaker is important in ensuring that problems do not arise when permanent traveller families and transient families are mixed.  If there could be a provision included in this Bill that, where a halting site is provided, a caretaker should be also provided, that would be an important progressive step. I have seen halting sites where, because a certain family moved in and there was no caretaker there, feuding broke out resulting in all the families leaving that halting site.  It is a difficult problem.  But in terms of State investment, the extra money needed for the provision of a caretaker would be vital and well spent.  If the Minister examines the position he will find that those local authorities who have made progress in this respect have been those who provided caretakers on such halting sites.</P>
    <P>Another matter that concerns me and in respect of which there is no provision in the Bill, is that part of our national housing stock without bathrooms.  In Waterford city there are 300 to 400 houses which do not have bathrooms. There is no grant system to assist the local authority in the provision of such <Col N="974" /> bathrooms.  It is a crying shame that, in this day and age families are forced to live, not alone in cities but in rural areas, in some cases, without running water and in others without bathrooms.  This deficiency in the Bill concerns me enormously and is something I would ask the Minister to consider rectifying.  On Committee Stage we shall be tabling amendments to the Bill.  In this day and age any State-provided house which is without running water or bathroom is just not good enough.</P>
    <P>Recently I obtained a report on the homeless from the Dungarvan Social Action Group in County Waterford.  The figures emanating from a survey they carried out on the problems of the homeless in Dungarvan and its environs are fairly shocking.  I have not had an opportunity to check those figures.  Between April 1986 and April 1987 questionnaires were sent to school principals, clergy, gardaí, voluntary and non-voluntary social workers and medical personnel.  The information supplied showed that there were 70 young people at risk in a town where the approximate population would be 7,000; that there were 30 battered wives, 23 unmarried mothers and 48 men on the road, homeless and in need of emergency accommodation and support services.  Those figures paint a very bleak and alarming picture.</P>
    <P>This gets me back to the part of the Bill that deals with homelessness.  Let me again state the Labour Party's concern that if and when this Bill is passed there is not an obligation or duty on local authorities to provide housing for the homeless. The Labour Party will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage.  One will be in relation to section 2, which deals with the definition of homeless persons. We shall be seeking the insertion of the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; in that section.  Our definition of a &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; would be multiple accommodation constructed for the purpose of providing a refuge, aid, facilities or services for a person who would not otherwise have accommodation readily available to him or her for occupation but shall not include hostel accommodation for students, professional trainees or <Col N="975" /> youth hostels.  Some people who go into hostels &mdash; and I have seen this in my area &mdash; do not settle there.  They are excellent occupants but invariably feel they need independent accommodation, an independent place for themselves.  We would be very concerned that, in terms of the definition of &ldquo;homelesness&rdquo;, hostels would be included as I have defined them.</P>
    <P>Whenever a report on the housing needs of an area are being defined the Labour Party would contend that young persons leaving institutional care, without family accommodation, and single persons should be considered.  In my area there are at present quite a number of single men and women living in very inadequate accommodation.  I am talking now about people on fixed incomes, be they unemployment assistance, disability benefit, single woman's allowance or whatever. When such people are forced to seek private accommodation invariably there are two alternatives available to them.  They can pay for decent accommodation but, in terms of food and entertainment, their budgets are severely restricted.  Alternatively, they can opt for very inadequate accommodation when they will have a little more money for food and clothing.  Neither of those alternatives is a happy one.  This group should be favourably treated in regard to housing because they are becoming more numerous in our society.</P>
    <P>The whole question of local authority housing, and loans was dealt with last week on a Labour Party Private Members' motion in regard to the funding of local authorities.  At that time I stressed the point that the reason the 1988 local authority house purchase scheme was so attractive to tenants was that in 1987 the rates support grant to local authorities was cut by 9 per cent and this year was cut by a further 18 per cent.  The effect of these cuts is that local authorities have neither the personnel nor the materials to carry out necessary repairs to their housing stock.  I might cite the position obtaining in County Waterford, where there is one tradesman and one <Col N="976" /> labourer for east Waterford, one tradesman and one labourer for west Waterford. It will be appreciated that the real reason for the introduction of this scheme was that local authorities &mdash; with present funding and manning levels &mdash; could not carry out the necessary repairs to their housing stock.</P>
    <P>An interesting anomaly arises here.  A point was brought to my attention this morning, that someone who had purchased under a previous house purchase scheme could be paying £20 a week more than a neighbour purchasing under the provisions of the present scheme.  If we take that argument to a logical conclusion it means that the tenant who purchased under the provisions of our earlier scheme, to some extent is subsidising the tenant purchasing under this latest scheme.  The anomaly becomes clearer when one notes that a local authority tenant, on 1 January 1988, is entitled to purchase his house but people with many years tenancy who purchased under the provisions of earlier schemes pay a lot more for theirs.  For instance, there is an urban renewal scheme in Waterford city whose houses were offered under the old scheme at approximately £39,000 and are now being offered at £22,000.  That is inequitable treatment of people who were transferred to these houses because their existing homes had been demolished and who had had many years of local authority tenancy and now in spite of that tenancy they find they are paying an awful lot more than those people opting to purchase under the new scheme.  This is not a criticism of the provisions of the new scheme.  But I believe the Minister should address himself to the question of restoring equity to the system.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the Minister's comments this morning when he spoke of £70 million being made available by banks and building societies to finance people on moderate incomes to provide their own homes.  One of the most retrograde steps taken by any Government in the matter of housing was that taken by this Government in October last when they abolished the fixed interest rate on <Col N="977" /> local authority loans.  If we take the lowest rate of interest that applied during the eighties and the highest rate of interest that applied on the maximum ordinary loan from a local authority, there could be a difference of £90 a month in repayments.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about loans available to people who have an income of less than £10,000 a year.  Young people come to me now for advice regarding local authority loans.  If they came to me 12 months ago, in some cases I would have said &ldquo;yes, I think it is a good prospect for you.  It is fixed interest.  What you are paying now will continue throughout the term of your repayment&rdquo;.  However, they could be on the margin and not have much disposable income to play with.  We never know when interest rates are going to go up again.  The interest rate on local authority loans since the change last October will now go up and down with the market.  The mortgage subsidy is now gone.  International interest rates can rise due to factors beyond the control of this or any other Government and our interest rates will follow.  All these matters could and will cause very severe hardship to young people who are providing their own houses and not proving to be a burden on the State.</P>
    <P>As the 1988 house purchase scheme stands, the final say as regards valuation rests with the local authority.  We intend to put down an amendment on Committee Stage seeking outside independent arbitration where there is a dispute between the tenant who intends to purchase and the local authority.  The amendment is to provide that, where a dispute arises between the purchaser and the local authority as to the open market value, the dispute may be referred by either party to an independent arbitrator. The costs involved in the arbitration shall form part of the purchase price of the dwelling and shall be included in the terms of the mortgage.  We believe that in assessing the market value tenants who intend to purchase should have the right and the safeguard to go to independent arbitration if they so desire.</P>
    <P>The terms of this purchase scheme are <Col N="978" /> very attractive and, as I said to the Minister here last week, councillors of every political persuasion are encouraging their constituents to avail of the scheme. However, it is going to reduce dramatically the housing stock of local authorities. This Government have dramatically cut back on the provision of local authority houses.  I instance the example of Dublin County Council, who are getting enough money to provide approximately three £40,000 houses this year, when they have a waiting list of 722 approved applicants.  Dublin city is even worse, with a waiting list of 3,696 and no money provided.  In my own area Waterford City Council in the past two years have been allocated no money for new starts, and we have a waiting list of 448 applications.  In the county council area, where 50 houses a year were built throughout the life of the last Government, enough money has been provided to start six houses towards the end of this year, and we have a waiting list of 106.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's major concern &mdash; and it reaches beyond this Bill in some senses&mdash;is that by 1990 on present trends we are going to have a very severe housing crisis unless the Government start to put money back into the provision of local authority houses.  We are selling off much of our housing stock and we are not providing the houses to replace that. By changing the terms of local authority loans we are making it more and more difficult for young people on modest means to provide their own houses and therefore not be on local authority housing lists as approved applicants.</P>
    <P>I will conclude there.  Our intention is to put down quite a number of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make some comments on the generality of the Bill as I respond to it and to take up one or two points which I have heard other Senators making.  Firstly, I would like to pay a tribute to the Simon Community for the great work they have done in this area and to record that shortly after I came into the Seanad, when there was an interest in mounting a Homeless Persons <Col N="979" /> Bill, I took it upon myself to go around late at night in Dublin to the various hostels and hostelries where the homeless persons abide.  In one sense it was quite an appalling experience and in another sense it was very uplifting.  It was appalling because one found so many people were driven through homelessness to seeking shelter in hostels.  I can well remember the entry into the Simon Community hostel on the quays.  In order to gain entry you kicked the metal door three resounding bangs and it was opened.  The uplifting part was the person who opened it and the people who were behind him.  Those were the young people who staffed that hostel and who gave of their time, service, energies and devotion to the down-and-out, the deprived and the sick.  I always recollect finding on the very top floor an old man with his wee dog in his bed.</P>
      <P>I remember visiting another place in Sean McDermott Street and going to O'Connell Bridge, when most respectable Dubliners were probably tucked up in nice comfortable beds, to participate in a soup kitchen which had resonant notes of times past in Ireland and times which we hope will some day be past forever.  Finally, I visited at the back of the Custom House where people were climbing into cardboard boxes.  At another place I saw folk getting into old, broken down cars.  Another uplifting experience was a visit to the Salvation Army home.  The Salvation Army has done magnificent work for down-and-outs for many years not only in Dublin but throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to share in the tribute that was paid to the voluntary housing organisations.  The removal of the phrase &ldquo;deliberate homelessness&rdquo; is a move in the right direction, because that term always conjured up in one's mind a condition of manipulative homelessness.  I do not think anyone, even someone who might be guilty of some manipulation in certain circumstances, could be said to be &ldquo;in a homely way of going&rdquo; if in fact he is trying to manipulate such labels. There is a difference between a house <Col N="980" /> and a home.  You can put a roof over someone's head but you certainly cannot by legislation alone provide the homely, heartfelt sense of being in a real home.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan raised the problem of the lack of a secure base people have who feel homeless for one reason or another.  Without a secure base a person lacks confidence and a sense of purpose and has a generally constricted attitude to participating in the society to which he rightfully belongs and into which he should be reintegrated if at all possible. There seems little doubt, therefore, that the homeless person is one of the increasing numbers of marginalised sections we see in this day and age of increasing centralisation. We must reverse that centralising trend and make the decision makers at local community level more accountable to the whole scene and not just parts of it.  This trend in marginalisation is much more acute in today's Britain than it is here.  Certainly the effects of it seem to be much more marked in Britain.  A fundamental human right should be the right to shelter.</P>
    <P>In my clinical experience I see many people who, if not homeless, are on the margins of homelessness.  They become involved in drunken brawls and gang fighting.  They have been violent in the home and have been thrown out of the home and because they have been thrown out of the home, in despair they have been reduced to violence.  They feel excluded, they are marginalised; they have nowhere to go.  Sometimes they even create symptoms so they can gain admission to hospital for a night, preferably short of the surgeon's knife, although sometimes that has been known to slip if the symptoms are sufficiently convincing.  You can have the down and out, and the out and down.  Alcohol, conflict in the home, psychological problems, depression and so on have been mentioned. I was delighted to see the travellers mentioned and taken into account again.</P>
    <P>It seems that there is a dearth of money and resources to meet what may be an expanding and difficult need to respond <Col N="981" /> to.  Therefore, we have to look once again at the question of the second house. People holding Irish passports hold second houses in the 26 southern counties of the Irish Republic.  There are also people who do not hold Irish passports who own a second house or another house in this part of the country.  To be fair to the people who have purchased the second house, it seems not unreasonable that, when they come to sell it, if they can get their original price plus whatever is required to even up for the change in the cost of living, that should be adequate to recompense them for the privilege of having that second house, but it is high time we looked at what happens to the remainder of the profit.</P>
    <P>Is it right that those who do not pay taxes in this jurisdiction, for example, can make a profit using a house as a form of currency, leave the jurisdiction with that profit and put nothing back into the community which they visited for a very short time in the year?  The Minister should look into this area as a possible source of income when it comes to the need to build, restore or repair houses.  I happen to have a second house and I feel very privileged to have it.  I have always felt it is an odd quirk in the way we manage our affairs that you can be in that house for such a short time in the year, the community in which it is placed gets so little from you, and you can then sell it perhaps at enormous profit and leave the State that much worse off and the community no better off.  It would seem perfectly fair and right that people so privileged should have some form of tax imposed on them to ensure that the money can be shifted in the direction of those who need houses.  Furthermore, the fact that you have a second house inevitably inflates the value of the housing stock.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the commitment to repeal the offensive section in the Vagrancy Act.  Let me mention the problem of homelessness and houselessness. There is a distinction.  You can go into a very humble home where there is great warmth and where the house in itself is not particularly sophisticated.  You can <Col N="982" /> go into a very well appointed house and find a fairly heartless hearth and a great deal of tension and anxiety there.  We are dealing here mainly with the creation of shelter, but we will never deal with the whole state of homelessness unless we go beyond the need to provide shelter.  In a sense, therefore, we must try to raise awareness about the problem and involve people in its solution.  Therefore we get back again to the whole business of community politics in a country which is trying to struggle towards some type of more decentralised philosophy.</P>
    <P>Why could there not be in each community a forum in which the various important aspects of Irish life could be discussed from time to time or raised for discussion?  Homelessness might be one of these aspects.  Perhaps two or three times a year there could be a community forum.  Health could be discussed at one meeting, homelessness at the next, education at the one after that, and so on.  In any community a network of agencies are available which never come together in an organic sense collectively to discuss the problems or a particular problem as it relates to that community as a whole.</P>
    <P>If all the statutory and voluntary agencies related to the problems of the homeless were obliged to meet even once a year in each community, we would begin to know better what the resources are and would become much more aware of different areas of problems.  By talking them through and becoming aware of them, they would seem less threatening and we might begin to have much more constructive thinking thrown into the general pool of thought to deal with social problems such as homelessness.  Therefore we must also address the problems of community powerlessness, community politics, more accountability of the decision makers to the people, more involvement of the people and a much wider framework in which to operate so that we get a feeling of the collective that makes up the community rather than individual fragments of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the limitations of legislation.  That bears out what I have just been saying.  I have often <Col N="983" /> reflected on the limitations of the Litter Bill passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas to such acclaim six or seven years ago and yet, except in those areas where the local community have taken action, Ireland is fairly scattered with litter.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to read about the need to relate to the adjoining housing authorities to bring about an integrated approach to ensure that the responsibility is shared and is not seen as a responsibility only of a small local community. Those who have resources share them and those who have not ask for them; I assume that is what is intended.  I support the setting aside of houses for special categories.  The other area which seemed to be a move in the right direction was the assessment of need and the inventory of the housing stock, but I implore the Minister to realise that that should be done on an annual basis.  We have the machines now that can store the data. We have all sorts of means of determining the parameters we want to select.  It should not be too difficult, once the base work has been done, to accumulate and have on-going information on the state of the housing stock throughout the country, community by community, and the state of the special needs, general needs, marginalised needs and so on, but it requires commitment and openness. That again comes back to what Senator Ryan suggested, that information should be published clearly.  We are trying to create a much more open society than we were accustomed to heretofore in the country as a whole and it will be to the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>Pursue accurate information in regard to housing stock and people's needs, publish that information, look at the whole problem in the context of the lack of awareness &mdash; indeed the great apathy &mdash; that exists, try to make people more aware consider how we can create the structures throughout Ireland to do that, look again at the need to involve people locally and bring together the voluntary and statutory agencies to discuss this subject much more widely than has been the <Col N="984" /> case.  Finally, I implore the Minister &mdash; I am sure people will be dealing with this on Committee Stage &mdash; to ensure an element of compliance in the local authorities in meeting the very laudable aspirations of this Bill, which I fully support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the provisions of this Bill.  I see it as having very far-reaching consequences. It is legislation that will serve the people well for the next 20 or 25 years and I congratulate all concerned for bringing it forward.  We had made great progress over the years in the area of local authority housing and the letting of houses.  I am proud to have been a member of a local authority for 21 years this June and I have seen the great progress which has been made in the area of the SDA, the Housing Finance Agency and the letting of houses.  Whereas in the past people were years on a housing waiting list, now in nearly any local authority almost certainly a family in need of rehousing will get a house on demand. That is progress in itself.</P>
      <P>This Bill sets out to revise, update and improve the management and letting of local authority housing and to ensure in particular that the needs of categories of people such as the homeless, the aged, the disabled and the travellers are getting their due priority.  It makes provision to increase the powers of housing authorities in regard to the accommodation of homeless persons.  Those are very laudable proposals one which I, naturally will support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to the provisions in the Bill in regard to the housing of the homeless.  We as a local authority have been housing homeless people for years. The Minister indicated in his speech that 1,800 people of no abode were housed within the last two years by the various local authorities.  I have no objection to housing homeless persons and have been helping to do so for years; but I maintain that the homeless person ought not have priority over the family unit.  The family who need rehousing should continue to be the priority.  Obviously, if a three-bedroomed house become vacant it will <Col N="985" /> not go to a single homeless person.  Surely the county manager of the area concerned would be seeking to house a family in it and at the end of the day, no matter what we say or think, it is the county manager of the local authority who makes the allocation and has the final say.</P>
    <P>It has been said time and time again that housing authorities in Ireland have been unsympathetic to the needs of the homeless.  I do not think so.  We in Westmeath in the Athlone Urban District Council have been quite active in this area.  A new departure seems to be that the interest lies in single people rather than families seeking homes, and this is what part of this Bill is all about.</P>
    <P>The tenant purchase scheme has been referred to by many speakers.  It is mentioned in the Bill and in the Minister's speech.  The tenant purchase scheme introduced in February of this year was well received by the tenants of the local authorities, and why not?  For example, Athlone Urban District Council built a new scheme of beautiful houses three to four years ago which can now be purchased by tenants for a total of £11,200 net &mdash; 40 per cent off plus the £2,000 grant.  That is the bargain of a lifetime.</P>
    <P>I would encourage as many tenants as possible to avail of the scheme.  I know the Government are saying that it will relieve them of the repair bill at the end of the year.  Governments will never deny that that is what it is about, but it is a very attractive offer and tenants will jump at it.  They have the facility of a 100 per cent loan and reduced legal costs.  Throughout the country as many people as possible should avail of the scheme.  I welcome it very much indeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in his address that the building societies and banks have agreed to make £70 million available in 1988 to provide mortgage finance to persons who would otherwise require loans from the local authorities for house purchase. Local authority loans continue to be made available as previously to applicants who are unable to secure a loan from a bank or a building society.  That £70 million is a correct figure, but I assure <Col N="986" /> the Minister that the amount of money available for buying or building houses by the banks and the building societies far exceeds £70 million.  There is extreme and intense competition in the marketplace between groupings providing money for this exercise.  The intention was that the local authorities should not become involved except where banks and building societies have confirmed their refusal.  I found out this morning in my county of Westmeath that from January to now there have been a mere 17 applications for housing loans whereas two years ago, in 1986, there was an average of 60 applications per month or a total of 360 for the year.  Clearly, this exercise is working.  The role of the bank and the building society is now predominant in mortgage finance provisions.</P>
    <P>Other technical measures in the Bill will be debated on Committee Stage. This Bill has much to commend it.  I congratulate the Minister heartily for bringing it forward and I have no doubt that it will be very successful and will serve the needs of the people for many many years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome this Housing Bill, 1988.  This is a debate on a Bill which has been looked forward to eagerly for many years in this House.  I welcome this Bill because it contains many very significant improvements.  I accept that it does not meet all the points, all the cases and all the situations.</P>
      <P>I do not want to deal with local authority housing to any great extent, except to say that, as far as our county is concerned, there has been a drastic change in the emphasis on local authority housing by virtue of the fact that the funds for the schemes in operation up to last year have been curtailed drastically or withdrawn. At the same time, I must acknowledge that the housing situation at least in some counties was such that the young people, whether married or not, could be provided with local authority houses on demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see at least one significant change, especially while local <Col N="987" /> authority resources are scarce.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider having a provision in the tenancy agreement whereby tenants of local authority houses would undertake to provide the day-to-day maintenance on heavily subsidised local authority housing.  They would start off into a new £25,000, £26,000 or £40,000 local authority house, as the case might be, in the sure knowledge that they would be expected to keep in the glass, or put in the screws in the door handles, and to paint it.  In the local authorities I am familiar with, it is nonsense that funds are not available for repairs, through redundancy schemes or whatever.  The repair team on the local authority have been diminished to a position where they cannot possibly do all the work that is required to be carried out and the council still sign tenancy agreements undertaking to repair houses.</P>
    <P>I would make only two exceptions to that rule, old age pensioners and physically disabled persons.  The others, if they are getting a new house from the beginning, should have an obligation.  I agree that people have a right to be housed but with every right there goes a responsibility.  The duty of people who are in benefit of such heavily subsidised houses should be to maintain them, not in the interest of the council but in the interest of the comfort of their own families. That is not provided for in the Bill. The Minister could do it by regulation. Since it is not possible for the councils to carry out repairs because they neither have the money nor the craftsmen, I ask the Minister and the Department to look seriously at that change, which would remove a lot of problems from members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fairly new provisions in this Bill for the homeless.  I welcome the provision the Minister has made for a greater input by community and voluntary organisations to assist in this very important work.  I compliment the Minister and his predecessors, Deputy Fergus O'Brien was a Minister of State in 1984 when the special scheme was introduced whereby voluntary housing agencies <Col N="988" /> could be grant-assisted to the tune of 80 per cent of loan charges.  The Minister made reference to the fact that, while the scheme was successful, it did not do a lot for the homeless.  I submit to the Minister that, when that scheme was introduced, £1 million a year was allocated.  That £1 million a year grew to £3 million which the Minister has provided this year.  In this Bill a further £3 million is allocated.</P>
    <P>I have the privilege of being the chairman of the Sue Ryder Foundation of Ireland who share with the Care organisation dedicated to the relief of suffering in providing accommodation for terminally ill people.  We have availed of the generous assistance &mdash; not just the grants &mdash; of personnel from the Department of the Environment in the provision of housing accommodation for people living alone.  We have two projects, one in Ballyroan, Laois, and one near Carrick-on-Suir in south Kilkenny.  I hope the Minister will come down in the next couple of months to assist at the official openings. While the money has been paid &mdash; and, might I say, more than matched two to one on a voluntary basis &mdash; these schemes are just coming on-stream.  They are a completely new concept of communities providing for and assisting people to live out their lives in their own environment and in their own community with the minimum amount of support for them to do that.</P>
    <P>We acquired a new premises here in the Dublin area quite recently.  The units are to have relatively small numbers &mdash; 25 or 30 &mdash; so the occupants will not become institutionalised.  As soon as people become institutionalised, they become helpless and then there is a problem for the State.  While the Minister says they are giving 80 per cent grants, that still does not represent the cost of maintaining a geriatric patient in one of our health board geriatric homes for a year. I am not downgrading the scheme but I think we should put it in perspective.</P>
    <P>If we support the local community to look after themselves and their own people, the capital grant scheme is very good.  The present scheme supports actual units of accommodation only with <Col N="989" /> the ancillary activities of a common living room, laundry facilities, or a kitchen which is necessary for elderly people who must have a balanced diet and at least one substantial meal provided for them. There is a tendency for elderly people, or for anyone living on his own, not to go to the trouble of preparing a substantial meal if dining alone.  In so far as the Sue Ryder Foundation of Ireland is concerned, we would propose to provide that kind of quietly supportive background wherein people would be quite independent living alone.  Nevertheless they would have professional assistance at the end of a bell push.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the problem of supporting to some degree the ancillary services that are provided.  This Bill will make it possible for every community, with a considerable amount of effort and fund raising, to provide sufficient resources to ensure that their own people will be looked after in their own community and that they will be able to maintain their independence and their own standards of living.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on this Bill. I hope that he will be able to implement the proposals he has outlined in his speech.  They are very important.  I hope the local authorities will be able to avail of the Minister's offer to appoint social workers.  This is very important, especially on the question of section 13. Section 13 deals with the itinerant problem. In the work that has been done over the last four or five years in the town of Tullamore and in Portlaoise both prototype councils have been eminently successful. The scheme represents money well spent.  I hope that, so far as possible, additional resources will be put into that area.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well with this Bill. There are a number of points which I will raise and go into detail on at Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to thank all the Members of the House for their contributions.  Since I <Col N="990" /> came in to relieve the Minister I have noted all the comments.</P>
      <P>Housing, as we all know, is very close to the hearts of all our people.  We are faced now with a new situation in regard to housing.  We have unmarried mothers, we have smaller families.  I think there should now be a change in the design and possibly the layout of housing.  I do not like very large housing estates.  I think they cause problems.  I like to see small, compact estates.  I never like to see very large estates.  I have no doubt that they were built with every good intention.</P>
      <P>Senators will be glad to know that the NESC are at present finalising a report on housing policy which, I suggest, will contain revised and somewhat lowered projections compared with those prepared in the early 1980s.  In the meantime I suggest that Senators might read an independent analysis of Ireland's changing population structure published in September last year by a well known firm of economic consultants.  The study, which has been widely reported, suggests that the level of output may be 16,000 completions this year.  I am satisfied, as of now, that our target will be met.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald referred to the maintenance of houses.  I could not agree with him more when he said that the taxpayer, the local authority and the corporation are allocating very good houses to tenants.  The houses are costing on average between £25,000 and £30,000. They are well built.  The estates are very well completed by the local authorities. In some cases, I am sorry to say, the houses did not get the proper respect from their tenants.  Do not expect me or the Department of the Environment or the Minister to give any local authority money to replace broken panes in windows or doors or to tighten screws.  It is not on, and I will not wear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every one of us has to do some type of maintenance on our homes, possibly yearly.  We are glad to be able to do it.  I want to say here this evening &mdash; and I hope the press will take note &mdash; that there is an overall responsibility on every person who is allocated a house to take care of it.  Do Senators realise that a local <Col N="991" /> authority house is costing the taxpayer approximately £70 a week to subsidise it? I do not begrudge that to those who are in need, but a little more care is needed. I know that all the Members of this House agree with me on this, because in talking to them privately they informed me that there should be more care.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald said that possibly it should be written into the Bill that maintenance of a local authority house should be the duty of the tenant.  There may be legal complications here.  They would have to be examined, but I will look into that.  I want to put it on record that in many housing estates throughout the country the tenants have taken great pride in their houses and in the maintenance and upkeep of the estates.  I sincerely thank them.  There is a tiny minority who want us to do everything and who want you, as members of local authorities and corporations to do everything. That is not on.  It is not on with the local authority members and it is certianly not on with me.</P>
    <P>The subject of homelessness is a sensitive matter.  We are endeavouring now to go as far as we can to look after those who are in need.  We had an excellent debate on Committee Stage on the Bill in the Dáil.  I have no doubt, knowing the calibre of the Members of this House, that we will have another very good, perhaps even better, debate on this Bill.  We will be able to tease out the matters on the sections of the Bill.  Senators will need to discuss and to go into some detail, on which both the Minister and I will be glad to do and explain as best we possibly can.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Members for their goodwill and also for the manner in which they welcomed the tenant purchase scheme.  This is a very good scheme.  The valuation of the house that we have asked the local authorities to decide on is the market value of the house, taking into account what repairs may have to be carried out.  So far I have been informed that local authorities are acting responsibly and are doing everything they possibly can to inform the tenant of the conditions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> The legal arrangements we have made are attractive.  There is a 100 per cent loan available, the interest rate of 6 per cent is attractive.  Even if interest rates rise to 18 per cent again &mdash; I hope they never do &mdash; that rate is fixed.  The person knows exactly what they have to pay for their house while they own it.  Irrespective of what type of employment they might have in the future it will still remain the same.  There is also a tax concession for those paying some tax.  I would ask everybody to give the scheme full support.</P>
    <P>There are roughly 120,000 houses involved.  Taking income and expenditure into account, there was a shortfall of approximately £24 million.  The Minister and I are trying to relieve the taxpayer of as much of this as we possibly can.  We are also giving the tenants an opportunity to decide in future years what they want to do with their houses with regard to improvements.</P>
    <P>I want to thank all the Members of the House for their goodwill for the scheme. If there is any weakness in it, let me know and I will see what I can do about it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, on Committee Stage we will be able to deal with it section by section and go into all the relevant details.  The Members of the Dáil have done so and I have no doubt we will do the same here.  If there is confirmation needed on any issue with regard to the wording we will be able to let you know exactly the position.  In introducing the Bill we had to strike a balance because there is a limit to the money that is available. All Members will be aware of the financial climate that exists, but we will be as fair as possible in helping those in need.  That has always been our aim and that shall be our aim in the future.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be expected of me to be critical of what is contained particularly in the Radio and Television Bill.  I want to put it on record first of all that I am not.  I am a somewhat disappointed supporter of public service broadcasting in this country.  First, I would like to compliment the Minister on getting something moving in this area. We have sat back for a number of years and allowed total anarchy to develop on the radio side of the airwaves.  Up until recently we have chosen to pretend and fool ourselves that nothing was happening with satellite television broadcasting. I am aware, although I do not want to appear to be in any way critical, that the Minister's Department were <Col N="994" /> informed well in advance because on a few occasions in recent years I have found them extremely helpful on queries that had nothing to do with legislation but on matters I was interested in.  Officials of the Minister's Department were extremely helpful on matters to do with satellite broadcasting.  They seemed to be well informed, confident and assured and not in the least what I would have expected from the stereotype civil servants. They were more than forthcoming with information and assistance, maybe they told me more than the Minister would have wanted them to tell me.  I may have let out a serious secret now and caused trouble between the Minister and his officials.  Giving me information might not be part of their game at all.</P>
      <P>There are serious philosophical questions to be addressed, I am not going to deal with the details of these Bills.  Other people, and perhaps myself, can do this on Committee Stage.  The principles of these Bills are well worth addressing. There has been considerable and vocal criticism of these Bills from the Left on the grounds that they are breaking the public sector monopoly on broadcasting. I am not aware of any socialist canon which dictates that broadcasting, as distinct from other forms of the media, should somehow be the monopoly of the State.  What I and many other people are unhappy about is the possibility of people, who have simply got money and not much else to offer, identifying the media as another method of making lucrative progress and making a lot of money out of something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can I, totally speculatively, draw a contrast?  In terms of the future of broadcasting there is an interesting contrast to be made.  It appears from what we read in the newspapers that satellite broadcasting and cable broadcasting, particularly of a specialist nature, has been something of a commercial success in the United States.  The proliferation of cable services, the multiplicity of services provided by pay channels etc. in the United States has been used by people here as a model of what they assume would happen <Col N="995" /> here with the advent of satellite broadcasting.</P>
    <P>People have presumed similar proliferations. There has been a similar willingness to pay for such services by people in Europe.  There is a fundamental mistake here.  This is a sort of compliment that I would like to pay to public service broadcasts.  We have the distinct advantage in this island of growing up with a standard of radio and in particular of television service probably second to none.  I particularly want to mention not only our own national broadcasting services but also those of the United Kingdom, our nearest island.  We have got accustomed to a high standard of news, current affairs, drama, documentaries, nature programmes etc.</P>
    <P>Comparing the quality that we are used to from the products of these islands with the quality of much that is imported from the United States might perhaps be an indicator of why specialist satellite broadcasting and cable broadcasting in the United States has been so successful, because the higher quality type of programmes have followed on from a lowest common denominator style of television in the United States, whereas we have started off with a high standard of broadcasting which some of the satellite broadcasts seem to be intent on diluting now. It is an interesting fact, which I am sure the Minister knows better than I do, because he probably has the results of the market surveys done by the cable services, that the vast majority of those who have had the dubious privilege of watching ten different satellite channels for the last 18 months have made one thing perfectly clear &mdash; if they are asked to pay for them they do not want them. The cable services have discovered this.</P>
    <P>There is no prospect of people paying for Sky, Super or any of the other channels which are supposed to be the harbingers of the future.  There is also the fact that the cable services have shown a remarkable reluctance to ask people to pay for them and that the Minister has directed them that they cannot charge for them.  I am always happy when Ministers <Col N="996" /> tell people they must not charge for things.  The Minister was doing the inevitable anyway.  If the vast majority of the Irish public were asked to pay for what they have seen on satellite television they would have refused point blank to pay a penny for it.  My children are very fond of Sky channel, but that is because they are seeing serials that I saw as a child 20 years ago and which Sky now recycle with great abandon and which the children who have never seen them before find very entertaining.  That is about it.</P>
    <P>We may well be talking ourselves into a crisis or a perception about satellite broadcasting, in particular, which is not real.  You can go on multiplying the number of programmes, because, for instance, there is so much sporting activity going on in the world that you could probably fill four channels with specialised sports reports.  At present there seems to be almost a limitless amount of wrestling available on a limitless number of channels on almost a limitless number of nights.  It presumably has the one thing in common, that it costs the broadcasters very little to purchase it.  Whatever can or need be said about satellite broadcasting, it can be said that, as of now, the mainstream satellite channels are not any threat to any of the two Irish channels or to any of the United Kingdom channels.</P>
    <P>There may well be a miraculous new supply of high quality programmes about to be generated by Rupert Murdock, Robert Maxwell, etc., in the immediate future which will tempt us all away from the high standards we are used to from the British and Irish services.  However, I doubt it, because the extent of investment and expertise involved in those, the standards demanded are so different from the standards those channels have so far produced, that I am not sure we will have anything other than a large expanding balloon which, sooner or later, will do what balloons which expand indefinitely do, that is, it will burst.</P>
    <P>If I were a high risk investor or a gambler I would not put my money into satellite broadcasting as one of the guarantees of future lucrative returns, in <Col N="997" /> these islands at least.  The people of these islands have got used to a high standard of broadcasting and, so far, they have seen absolutely nothing from the new challenge from satellite broadcasting that will influence them in the least to change their tastes in broadcasting.  I hope we will not have any attempts, covert or overt, to persuade people to change. There are indications in some of the British newspapers that the British Government are so concerned about public resistence to satellite broadcasting that they are talking about moving the goal posts as it were and making some of the land based stations available to those whom it was expected would be the entrepreneurs of the satellites in order to persuade people to begin to use satellite broadcasting.</P>
    <P>They are concealing that the quality of television programming available in these islands at present is so high that no commercial operator, operating on purely commercial terms and given the capital investment required, could possibly be expected to compete.  It is a backhanded compliment, given Mrs. Thatcher's ideology, but nevertheless it may well be a compliment which is so sincere that it will actually result in the undermining of the quality of broadcasting available to us.</P>
    <P>That is one of the philosophical considerations that lies behind the issues we are debating.  I do not think the issues are simply whether we should or should not have an extra television channel.  Provided there are no hidden subsidies and provided RTE are not hamstrung in any way &mdash; and I trust the Minister not to do either &mdash; we can wait and see whether the market can sustain an extra television channel or not.  There are some indications that it can.  It has been suggested that RTE, particularly at peak times, could charge an awful lot more for television advertising than they do and would still be able to fill all the slots, that the demand for television advertising, particularly for peak television advertising, well exceeds the supply.  I do not know if that is true.  RTE seem to believe that they could charge a lot more for their <Col N="998" /> advertising if they were let.  The market is the place to decide that.</P>
    <P>All that being said, let us see what happens.  RTE will hardly close down or collapse because of the change.  If there is a market for a third television channel, if it can be funded by commercial means and can operate in a strictly commercial fashion, let us see what happens.  I am not concerned anymore that we will have the battle of the lowest common denominator. I used to be.  Having observed the satellites occasionally for the last number of months, having observed them less and less as the months went on and having the choice at last thanks to one of the Minister's predecessors, from a Fianna Fáil Government of all of the channels in my adopted city, I am not convinced at all that there is necessarily a dilution in standards created by a reasonably free amount of competition.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that RTE without competition, in the days when they were a monopoly in places like Cork city, produced a remarkably high standard.  One of the common views that one will hear expressed in Cork is that people there who thought they were being deprived of something because they did not have access to the British channels have now come to a grudging but, nevertheless, sincere appreciation that RTE provide a reasonably good service most of the time on most issues.  We can all list them. As a particularly frequent user of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission I can list a lot of RTE's deficiencies.  Nevertheless RTE do a good job.  Their faults are not in the quality of their programming. The faults I would identify are perhaps in their excessive willingness to reflect what I would regard as a nonexistent consensus in some areas.  I know the Minister and I have very different views.  I believe RTE are loaded on the right.  I suspect the Minister thinks that RTE are loaded in the opposite direction. RTE would regard that as proving that they are quite sensible.  That is not for today or tonight to be settled.</P>
    <P>The idea that if we had a proliferation of channels we would have a dilution of standards is not true and is not likely, <Col N="999" /> simply because we have an educated public who are educated to expect this standard and will not be deflected from it.  I am not sure what will happen.  I hope our third television channel will be successful.  I hope, in particular, that they will be successful in encouraging independent programme making in this country. This country has a substantial body of talent in many areas of creative activity and, in particular, in film making and programme making, much of which feels a little bit stifled within the structures of RTE, much of which feels that it could operate on a much more economical budget outside RTE.  That does not mean the new channel will have to be a lower standard or that they have to be either more conformist or more challenging.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting fact that on some of the issues this House has been concerned about, for instance in Britain the cases of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six, it was the commercial television channel which went ahead and broadcast the programmes which challenged those convictions.  In recent times it was the IBA which went ahead and raised serious questions about what happened in Gibraltar and it was the BBC which followed.</P>
    <P>The equation of public service with independence from pressure and of commercial channels with capitulation to pressure is far too simple.  It is the question of how commercial broadcasting is regulated, not whether it is commercial or not, RTE are to a large extent a commercial organisation and, perhaps because we have a smaller pool of advertisers some of whom would be major contributors in terms of expenditure advertising, RTE are more open to pressure than many commercial organisations elsewhere.  If some of our major brewers, for instance, withdrew advertising from RTE, they could do more damage to RTE's budget than a refusal of a licence fee increase would do.</P>
    <P>If we are to develop in the way we are doing in the area of television, it is altogether too simplistic simply to <Col N="1000" /> denounce the whole activity as a capitulation to the big buck merchants.  At the same time there are dangers involved, not the dangers of dilution of standards, the usual ones which are referred to, but the dangers of crypto-monopolies.  I understand that, in economic terms, anything over one-third of the market share is regarded as an effective monopoly.  If the individual who controls the largest newspaper group in this country were to become the controlling force in either an independent radio station or an independent television station and, given the extent to which the newspaper group he owns feel obliged to reflect his views, his opinions and his perceptions and, in some cases, his economic interests, one would be most concerned about how that would be reflected in a television service or a radio service.  It is a pity that the legislation does not specifically and in detail preclude monopolies from developing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Minister. I am relying on newspaper reports. I stand corrected and I compliment the Minister.  My major apology is that I was landed into this at somewhat shorter notice than I had intended.</P>
      <P>Moving away, if I may, from monopolies, since the Minister is satisfied that people on the left are a little bit too glib with some of the cliches they throw out about radio and television, we should have the maximum possible number of radio stations consistent with the technical limitations imposed on us by the fact that we cannot have an infinite number.  I would have a similar view on broadcasting to the view I have about print media.  I regret about the print media the concentration of power in the hands of a small number of people in Britain and, to an increasing extent in this country, and, to a considerable extent, in some other countries as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ideal situation is a multiplicity of opinions, expressions of opinion and technical methods of making those opinions known.  It is a matter for the State to regulate and to ensure that no <Col N="1001" /> dominant position exists, I am of the opinion that something close to an effective monopoly now exists in the United Kingdom in the newspaper area, a monopoly in terms of an economist's definition of one-third of market share.  I regard that as unacceptable.  I am not sure that it will be possible for us to prevent it here. Independent Newspapers own close to 40 per cent of the total newspaper production in this country now.  That is a monopoly.</P>
    <P>Subject to that regulation my feeling is that everybody who is prepared to operate within the laws on crime and decency should be able to have access to the broadcasting media.  Some people regard splintering of the media as destroying the cohesion of a society.  Our society's cohesion goes much deeper than access to the electronic media.  I believe that the degree to which you tolerate diversity in a society is a measure of the degree to which a society is actually genuinely pluralist.</P>
    <P>I hope that, when the radio services become available, they will represent, at local level at least, a genuine diversity of opinions and that they will not all feel obliged to look over their shoulders at the independent Authority and project a middle of the road blandness.  There are many issues in our society, some controversial, some so unknown that they are not controversial, that deserve an airing.  There are many local issues, particularly in this city, which, because many of the papers in this city are effectively national newspapers except the free papers, do not get sufficient coverage.  It is strange that my city can have a morning paper, an evening paper, a local radio station and areas of this city of a similar population rely on what are effectively national media of communication for most of the information they ought to have.  Local broadcasting services would begin to create a sense of identity amongst communities who do not experience one at present.</P>
    <P>I have no problems with this legislation in terms of its intent or what I perceive to be its practicalities.  I am not sure that we can sustain in commercial terms the <Col N="1002" /> range of broadcasting services which seems to be envisaged by the legislation. The figures from the United Kingdom suggest that radio stations do not exactly make the fortune in money they were supposed to make.  It is necessary that, whatever number of radio stations we have, they should operate within the law. The spectacle of this country tolerating anarchy on the air-waves, making ourselves foolish in the eyes of the world, perhaps interfering with other people's broadcasting, is something that we should bring to an end.</P>
    <P>I discovered yet another illegal radio station in my home area recently.  Somebody has opened a gospel station and I can now be entertained to 24 hours a day religious inspiration if I so wish.  I am not sure what good they hope to do.  There is a good case for a radio station controlled and owned by the Churches.  But they have expressed total disinterest in it and I do not understand why.  They are much better at cribbing that the other media do not give them proper and fair coverage than they are at undertaking the prospect of broadcasting and competing themselves.  I have the funny feeling that the churches would prefer to have other people create the market niches and then, if you like, insert themselves into those stations once they have created the market niches, thus avoiding the tough competition of actually persuading people to listen to them in the first place. In a country with a strong tradition of church-going there is a logical case for such a major force.  The trade unions could do with a radio station as well. Business could do with a radio station. Many people could do with a means of taking to each other, talking to their own groups and taking to other groups.</P>
    <P>There is a need for vigilance in a number of areas in this development, not so much in terms of a general dilution of standards.  I am not that concerned about that.  I am more concerned about areas of minority and marginal interest.  I know the intent is there and that it is written into the Bill.  I am somewhat concerned about the Gaeltachtaí and the influence of broadcasting services which cover their <Col N="1003" /> area and which may well be, though not exclusively, predominantly broadcasting in English since they will cover a larger catchment area.  I am aware, of course, that Raidio na Gaeltachta exists; but the Gaeltachtaí and the people of the Gaeltacht are entitled to a reasonable guarantee that they will have the same standard of service as everybody else and that that standard of service will be available to them in the language they freely choose to use.</P>
    <P>That is equally true about some of the minority interest radio programmes that RTE put on at night.  The listening audience may not be large; I understand that it is fewer than 100,000, but it is not the same 100,000 people who listen at all times.  My understanding of the radio audience at night is that it is a large number of segments of our population rather than the same section of the population listening all the time, depending on whether the programme is a classical programme, a traditional music programme, an Irish language programme, an educational programme, or whatever it is.  From my experience there seems to be a particular section of the population, larger than one's vanity would suggest even, who listen to both the Dáil and Seanad proceedings every night of the week.  I am perpetually amazed at the number of people who hear RTE's half hour or 20 minutes on the proceedings of this House and of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>It is not the first time that the Cathaoirleach and I are in total agreement on that.  The only problem is that far too little of the time is devoted to this House and far too much to the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no great problem about the principles in these Bills.  I am concerned, however, that they should be subject to constant reappraisal, not because of a general dilution of standards but because in the scramble for novelty and the scramble of novelty many of the precious but <Col N="1004" /> small characteristics of our broadcasting service may be lost.  While RTE have quite clearly produced a remarkably high standard, they are becoming something of an institution.  Like all the institutions of the State, they need fairly frequent reassessment and challenge.  Speaking as a professional subversive with considerable scepticism for most of the institutions of the State, I cannot really withhold similar subversive intent about our national broadcasting station.  RTE need a good shake-up and they will get it out of this.  It will not do anybody any harm.  I have always felt that two of the principal centres of a certain unreality in this city are this House and another place in Donnybrook.  Perhaps the reason we and the media people do not get on too well is that we have a lot in common. The Minister, being a different kind of politician from me, probably will not agree with me.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will succeed in his intent of closing down pirate radio stations. May I say also &mdash; I do not want to abuse the privileges of this House &mdash; that as far as the city I live in is concerned the Commission should thread very carefully in deciding to whom they will give the radio franchise in that city.  RTE local radio in Cork have done a remarkably good job with remarkably limited resources and have pioneered local broadcasting extremely well and with a considerable amount of bravery in terms of their willingness to deal with quite controversial issues.  On the other hand, all of the commercial stations we have seen until recently were, for 59 minutes out of 60, music stations and until recently what passed for news was verbatim plagiarism of the national broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>The fact that people suddenly realised, since this Minister came to power, that there was a real intent to do something and they suddenly reformed themselves should not blind us to earlier behaviour. I think it extremely important that, not just recent behaviour, but the general willingness of these stations to pay for the creative talents of artists that they have effectively stolen, when they do not <Col N="1005" /> pay royalties, or to pay for the work of other journalists or other stations when they steal news reporting &mdash; that sort of lack of ethics should not be ignored simply because people have behaved themselves for the past six months.  If somebody puts on a reasonable broadcasting service and attempts to make provision for royalties, attempts to create his own news gathering service, that is one thing; but many of them did not do that. I have heard RTE's grammatical errors repeated on pirate radio stations.  I do not regard these sort of people as acceptable people to run broadcasting services.  They are not the sort of people I would trust with this country's media.  I think we have better people available to us.</P>
    <P>We are in for an interesting and exciting time.  As I said earlier, I am not persuaded about the scale of the broadcasting revolution that is around the corner.  Our tastes may turn out to be to a considerable degree more conservative and indeed more satisfied than many of the apostles of satellite broadcasting imagine.  Therefore, we may well discover inside five or six years that we are effectively stuck with RTE 1, RTE 2 and possibly one or two other channels, a number of high cost specialist satellite services &mdash; in other words, total news or total films &mdash; but not a multiplicity of channels similar to those we have at present.  I look forward to the period. Whatever my comments on detail may be when we get on to Committee Stage of the Broadcasting Bill, I compliment the Minister again for getting it moving and perhaps in the process giving jobs to a few people who are unemployed in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ryan for the last comment.  I believe there will be jobs.  It is an aspect of this legislation which has not received the type of attention to which it is entitled.  I believe there will be up to 700 to 800 jobs available on the radio side alone in the national radio and the local radio stations.  Sometimes they will be part time in the sense of part time broadcasting, but mainly they will be full <Col N="1006" /> time jobs.  I believe this is an aspect of this legislation which did not receive the attention it deserves and warrants until it was mentioned by the Senator.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to all the Senators who contributed to this debate for the thoughtful consideration they have given to the proposals put forward.  We have had a very worth while debate here. It is fair to say that it would be quite difficult to find any other set of legislative proposals which have been the subject of such public debate as the various proposals put forward over the years to provide a legal framework for independent broadcasting services.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention at this stage to go over the ground again but perhaps there was some merit in the delays that occurred.  At least we have had the opportunity to watch how broadcasting has developed elsewhere and to adapt our thinking to extracting what best suits the Irish environment.  I firmly believe that the proposals contained in the Radio and Television Bill create the environment and afford the opportunities for all who wish to become involved in broadcasting to do so legitimately.  Public reaction to my proposals confirm me in my belief.  Indeed, when the legislation has been enacted and passes into law, I can assure this House that the Government will waste no time in appointing people of the highest calibre to serve on the Commission and to get on with the task of allowing legal independent broadcasting to happen.</P>
      <P>The other side of the coin is that, if illegal stations do not go off the air voluntarily before the provisions of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill become law, my Department will have no alternative but to use the strength and powers contained in the Bill to clear the air-waves for legal broadcasting.  If they do not go off &mdash; I hope they will go off voluntarily &mdash; I leave this House under no illusion that the general public know there is no doubt that the new powers in the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill will be rigorously enforced if there is a need to do so.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls upon the Government to establish an independent authority to determine the manner in which allocations of National Lottery funds will be made and disbursed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing the motion on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  I am doing this for a variety of reasons which I will go into in depth at a later stage in my contribution. First, I will give a broad outline of the <Col N="1008" /> initial setting up of the national lottery, its proposed function and how we have strayed from the original idea, particularly when funds from the lottery have greatly surpassed all expectations.</P>
    <P>The establishment in Ireland of a national lottery is not, in international terms, a very unusual step.  State lotteries exist today in over 80 countries with different economic, cultural and religious characteristics.  Countries as varied in political and economic terms as the United States, Australia, Sweden, Brazil and China all have successful state lotteries. Among other partners in the European Communities, national lotteries are established in the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Denmark, Spain and Portugal.  Britain, of course, has its football pools.</P>
    <P>The function of the lottery was to generate surplus funds that would benefit our community in a number of ways, without the need for recourse to taxation or other compulsory revenue raising measures. This surplus would be generated through the purchase of tickets by those who wished of their own accord to participate in the national lottery, and not through any increase in the tax burden.  In the other countries I have mentioned lottery proceeds are applied to a variety of purposes including sport, health care, the arts and other cultural activities.  State lotteries are, therefore a widespread and advantageous phenomenon.  The countries I have mentioned are not less sensible than ourselves, and would not operate official lotteries were they not profitable, socially useful and popular.</P>
    <P>At the start of 1987 who would have thought that scratching small brightly coloured cardboard tickets would become a national obsession?  Yet today this is what half of the adult population do almost once a fortnight.  They scratch card products of the national lottery which has been one of the most successful commercial launches in this country for years.  In its first week, six million instant pay lottery cards were sold, with sales exceeding the first year's target of £25 million just five weeks later.  Admittedly, <Col N="1009" /> this figure was a conservative estimate of the lottery's potential but later more optimistic targets of 50 million to 60 million sales were more than doubled in the first year's trading, making the venture the second fastest growing lottery in the world.</P>
    <P>The national lottery appeals to different types of taste.  Instant games are for those who want immediate excitement and there is a wide variety of these. Lotto, the latest game, caters for people who like to hold on to numbers for up to a week.  The success of the first game, Instant Three, was followed up within weeks by the launch of an almost identical second product called Windfall which offered a £10,000 instant prize and better prospects for higher winnings at the weekly grand prize draw.  Windfall chalked up sales of £28.72 million.  This was over £8 million more than its predecessor and in turn it was followed by a range of similarly successful games, Extra Chance at £29.9 million, Double Up at £18.3 million.  Cash Drive at £21.4 million as well as the newly launched Celebration Bonus and Lotto, the most ambitious project so far.</P>
    <P>Lotto is based on a formula dating back to Renaissance Italy where an enterprising Genoan took bets on the selection of a five member council from a panel of 90 nobles.  Today it is played in 70 countries worldwide including all 12 EC States.  Lotto Irish style is the first fully computerised national lottery on the Continent.  It is the biggest dedicated data transmission network in Ireland, linking a 1,000 outlet nation-wide to a central computer.  It is an on-line and interactive system.  When an agent in-puts a number, it immediately registers on the national lottery's main computer.  This means that entries can be accepted up to ten minutes before the weekly draw takes place, thus practically eliminating dead time that had previously eaten into sales.</P>
    <P>The computerised Lotto system already operates successfully in the US, Australia and New Zealand but Ireland is the first European country to have such a modern system.  In its first annual report which covers the period to 31 December <Col N="1010" /> 1987 the national lottery records a net surplus of £41.69 million, all of which was paid into the national lottery fund.  From this, £26.3 million was allocated for sport, youth and recreational facilities, £8 million for culture and the arts, the Irish language was to receive £4 million and £6 millions was to go into the health projects. A further £700,000 was set aside for projects linked to Dublin's Millenium.</P>
    <P>The idea of a national lottery was mooted as far back as 1979 when a submission was presented to the then Minister with responsibility for sport, Deputy Tunney.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and Deputy Keating had a concept of a national lottery for sport and so had other people.  They brought it a certain distance, but there was no lottery.  It was not unitl such time as Deputy Donal Creed, my constituency colleague, became Minister of State with responsibility for sport that the national lottery was taken seriously.  I wish to congratulate him on his courage and conviction in initiating what is now a very successful lottery.</P>
    <P>However, Deputy Creed's vision of how the proceeds of the national lottery should be distributed has not come to fruition.  He envisaged that a minimum of 75 per cent of the proceeds would go directly to sport and to sporting organisations. It was never intended that funds from the national lottery would go to Departments which would normally have been funded by Exchequer payments. Sport and sporting organisations have always been very badly treated by all Governments over the years.  We have some excellent athletes who have done us proud on the world stage.  They have been excellent ambassadors for our country &mdash; people like Stephen Roche, Seán Kelly, John Treacy, Barry McGuigan and others.</P>
    <P>It is also opportune to mention the Irish soccer team who did us proud in Germany during the week and have been our greatest ever ambassadors in promoting this green isle of ours.  We should remember the tremendous success we had abroad in the area of sport.  Likewise <Col N="1011" /> we should remember that we are handicapped through lack of facilities, proper training and funding for those people who cannot afford it themselves.</P>
    <P>The wording of the motion tonight deals with the way the money is being allocated and calls for an independent commission to be set up to monitor its distribution.  The way in which profits are distributed is to be looked at.  First, the national lottery has become a mini bank which Ministers and Ministers of State raid when there is a public demand for a service which is not provided for in departmental Estimates.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in relation to grants for community activities, political considerations are the major if not the only criteria on which these allocations are judged.  It is regrettable that in distributing the proceeds, Ministers and Ministers of State are seeking to give the impression that they themselves or their Departments have provided the funds.  This is nothing more than short-sighted political expediency. Apart from any other consideration, it is no way to promote the advantages and the benefits of the national lottery.  If Fianna Fáil continue with their present operation of looting national lottery funds in order to provide &ldquo;hello money&rdquo; for their anxious backbenchers, the days of the national lottery are numbered.</P>
    <P>Figures of disbursements up to the end of April 1988 provide hard evidence that the moneys are being distributed by politcal whim, as a national Fianna Fáil reelection slush fund, and that the era of the stroke politics has returned.  It is a fact that the average level of pay-out of lottery funds to date has been £10 per head of population nationwide.  It is also true that the levels vary from county to county in accordance with the political demand of the governing Fianna Fáil Party.  Sligo, the base of the Minister, Deputy MacSharry, has received a massive £27 per head of population which is nearly three times the national average. The entire Dublin region, the base of five further Cabinet Members has received £18 per head of its population and this is <Col N="1012" /> nearly twice the national average.  It also received future commitments of further substantial amounts in order to fund the proposed national sports centre.  Galway, the base of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, a curator of some of the lottery funds, has received £16 per head of its population, also well above the national average.  My own native county of Cork has received the derisory sum of £4 per head of its population and if we are to believe what we read in <i>The Cork Examiner</i>, we would have not got any of this expert for the hard work of Deputy Batt O'Keeffe who claims to have brought practically all of the lottery money to County Cork.  He even claims to have brought money to clubs that did not even contact him with a request for lottery funds, much to the annoyance of his Fianna Fáil colleagues in County Cork.</P>
    <P>It is this kind of political one-up-manship or political hypocrisy that has given politicians a bad name.  We read in the national papers practically every day how lottery funds are being misused and abused.  A banner heading in <i>The Cork Examiner</i>, dated 20 April 1988 reads: &ldquo;O'Keeffe Claims Big Grant Coup&rdquo;.  The article went on to state that the Cork TD claimed that by his personal efforts he had secured grants totalling £125,000 for the area.  Fianna Fáil Deputy Batt O'Keeffe contacted <i>The Cork Examiner</i> to say that he had got £50,000 for Riverstick Community Centre in amenity grants from the Department of the Environment. When asked to explain his role in the allocation of the money given by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, Deputy O'Keeffe said he had processed the matter on behalf of the local people who had applied for the grant.  Asked if he was suggesting that the grant would not have been forthcoming but for his efforts he replied: &ldquo;You can take that as being absolutely certain&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He went on to state that he got £40,000 from the same Department for the regional park in Ballincollig and also that he secured £25,000 for the Grange Frankfield Community Centre in Douglas. When commenting on the grants as a <Col N="1013" /> whole he said: &ldquo;I am absolutely delighted that as one Deputy I have ensured that £125,000 has come into the area from the Department&rdquo;.  Also he was hoping to have over £100,000 coming from other Departments.</P>
    <P>On the following day, 21 April, <i>The Cork Examiner</i> again carried a big heading which stated: &ldquo;Cork TD's Grand Claims Rejected&rdquo;.  The article went on to say that claims by a Cork Deputy that he had personally secured £125,000 in grants for his local area were yesterday knocked by other Dáil Deputies and led to further allegations that national lottery money was being abused by Fianna Fáil Deputies and Ministers.  Deputy Batt O'Keeffe told <i>The Cork Examiner</i> that a £50,000 remedial grant for the Riverstick Community Association, amongst others, would not have been forthcoming but for his efforts.  <i>The Cork Examiner</i> were told that the £50,000 was national lottery money channelled through the Department of the Environment.  The article went on to state that the annoyance at Deputy O'Keeffe's claim was not just confined to Opposition parties and inside Fianna Fáil it was known there was considerable private resentment at this attempt at stroke politics.</P>
    <P>In another front page article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 26 May the heading was &ldquo;Lottery Forked Out Unrequested £175,000&rdquo;.  In the article Fine Gael accused the Government of abusing the system and claimed that £175,000 had been misappropriated in the County Dublin area.  It accused the Government of allocating money to 23 projects for which no official applications were made. Surely this is ridiculous when we are talking about taxpayers' money being dished out without any accountability whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I have in my possession a letter from the Department of the Environment, signed by Mr. P. Sweeney, Assistant Principal Officer, to the Manager of Dublin County Council.  It relates to a number of projects which are being grant-aided and he was informing the manager of Dublin County Council of this.  The letter states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> Dear Manager,</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for the Environment to refer to previous correspondence regarding grants under this Department's 1988 amenity grant scheme finance from National Lottery surplus funds and to inform you that grant allocations have been made by the Minister for the following projects in your area....</P>
    <P>The letter specifically deals with a total of 49 projects and includes the 23 which I have already mentioned, where there was no proper application form for them. I hope to mention a few of them in passing. The list is as follows: first, the Malahide Castle Regional Playground Park and the allocation was £15,000; followed by improvements at Kingfisher site, Portmarnock, £10,000; Inisfails GAA Club, Balgriffin, £15,000; St. Bridget's GAA Club, Navan Road, £50,000; Coolmine RFC, Palmerstown, £15,000; planting at St. Anne's National School, Esker, £500; CBSI provision of trees at Larch Hill, £500; Knocklyon Community Centre, £5,000; shrub and tree planting at Seagrange, £100; Donabate Scouts, £10,000; Garristown Hall, £5,000; Loughshinny Motor Cycle Club, £3,000; Lusk United FC, £5,000; Naul Hall, £2,000; St. Maurs Boxing Club, Rush, £1,000; Rush Scouts, £1,000; Swords Family Care, £2,000; Swords Historical Society, £2,500; Swords Tennis Club, £3,000; Broadmeadow Anglers' Association, £1,000; St. Colmcille's CBSI Swords, £3,000; Tallaght United Football Club £25,000; Loughshinny CYMS, £1,000.  The letter goes on to state:</P>
    <P>...To assist in administering the scheme, copies of the application forms submitted to the Department in respect of the projects being grant-aided are also enclosed.</P>
    <P>The next line of the letter is the important line.  It states:</P>
    <P>In some cases fully completed application forms are still awaited from project sponsors.  These are especially indicated in the list above.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> These are the 23 projects that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Another item to which I would like to draw attention is the grant conditions whereby national lottery money is being given out to amenities.  This is covered under a list of conditions &mdash; 12 in all &mdash; from the Amenity Grant Scheme, 1988 (Finance from National Lottery).  Condition No. 2 on that list states:</P>
    <P>The grant allocation is made on the understanding that a local contribution of at least 30 per cent will be made towards the cost of the project.</P>
    <P>This has led to a section 4 motion being put down in the names of Councillors Nora Owen, Joan Maher and Tom Hand on 13 June 1988.  It states:</P>
    <P>We the members of Dublin County Council pursuant to Section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act 1955, hereby require and direct the Dublin City and County Manager or any Assistant Manager having delegated powers to report to the Council how he proposes to spend the £15,000 from the Lottery for provision of a playgound in Malahide Demesne indicating in his reply:</P>
    <P>(a)  where the Council will find the 30 per cent of costs for the project as required under condition 2 of the Lottery grant conditions published by the Department of the Environment and</P>
    <P>(b)  the total cost of the provision of this playground.</P>
    <P>In his reply, Mr. G.W. Redmond, Assistant City and County Manager stated:</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of providing the proposed playground at Malahide Demesne is £45,000.  Portion of the Council's contribution will relate to wages of existing staff for which provision has already been made in the current year's estimate.</P>
    <P>I reject that.  The provision could not have been made already because the Malahide Demesne was a new project <Col N="1016" /> being financed by the national lottery. The new project would not have been taken into account when deciding the estimates and indeed striking the rate.  In other words, the money referred to must cover existing work which must be dropped and the staff redeployed, or else if that work did not exist, the money was being provided to pay people who were idle.  Because the Malahide Demesne is a new project, that statement could not be correct.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify that point for me.  The reply continues:</P>
    <P>On the assumption that it would be the wish of the Council to avail of the opportunity presented by the grant, it is the intention to meet the additional expenditure involved, by overspending in the programme to which the project will be charged and reporting the over-expenditure involved before the end of the year to the County Council, seeking consent of the members under Section 11 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955.  The over-expenditure involved will be in the region of £23,000.</P>
    <P>This is totally contrary to a letter sent out by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, last October or November. The Minister's letter sent out to all the local authority areas stated: that under no circumstances was there to be an over-run of expenditure in the moneys allocated to local authorities.  Each local authority area would have to live within its means.  Now we have a different story. In order to avail of national lottery funds, local authorities are being encouraged to borrow money.</P>
    <P>The heading in the <i>Tipperary Star</i> of 20 May 1988 was &ldquo;Corrupt and Immoral Lottery Allocations Create Uproar.&rdquo;  It states:</P>
    <P>The distribution of national lottery funds by Fianna Fáil Ministers to organisations in County Tipperary, seven of which had not fully completed application forms was described during a heated debate in North Tipperary <Col N="1017" /> County Council's Chamber as bordering on the corrupt and certainly immoral.  The Council had been told that a total of £162,500 had been allocated to 21 projects in the county, seven of which had received £47,500, but had still not furnished fully completed application forms.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Kerryman/Corkman</i> dated 6 May the leading article states: &ldquo;The game is up for the lottery politicians.&rdquo;  It further states:</P>
    <P>The manner in which grants from the proceeds of the national lottery are being announced are wholly unacceptable. The affair has taken on all the worst connotations of base political opportunism.  Political stroke pulling should have no part to play in the distribution of these funds.  Huge cash windfalls which belong to us all, and which should be distributed according to the most stringent and correct conditions should not be rifled by politicians in the narrow interest of personal political capital.  It is the unseemly rush back to the constituencies by Fianna Fáil Oireachtas members to announce the goodies which causes concern and annoyance. By the behaviour of some members of the governing party, one would not be surprised if they had the outstanding temerity to claim that the money belonged to them, a kind of personal vote getting slush fund.  This tomfoolery must cease at once.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on Tuesday, 24 May the heading was &ldquo;Lottery Methods Criticised&rdquo;.  In the article it was stated that lottery funds had clearly fallen into political hands, a political slush fund is what the national lottery has become.  I could go on and on and give plenty more examples or more extracts from the different papers around the country but the message is the same.</P>
    <P>The Government must surely recognise that there is a danger that the general public could become very cynical about the way lottery moneys are disbursed. <Col N="1018" /> They do not have to have a specific example in mind, merely a suspicion that no Government could pass up the chance of making political capital out of lottery disbursements.  This is an issue which will not go away.  The lottery is drawing in millions of pounds every month, far more than had ever been expected.  In view of that, perhaps the time has come to review the criteria applicable to disbursements. One of the most worrying aspects of the national lottery is the absence of a single application form, or procedure, whereby groups or communities could apply for funds.  Another worrying aspect is the extent of ministerial involvement in the decisions taken and the announcements on how the funds will be allocated.  This is the case particularly in the Department of Education because of the size of its allocation.</P>
    <P>The national lottery is one of the most significant legacies bequeathed by the Coalition Government to the present Administration.  I appeal to the Minister not to undo its success to date and urge him to accept the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a long contribution from Senator Kelleher on this motion endeavouring to establish an independent authority to determine the manner in which allocations from the national lottery funds are made and disbursed. I can recall clearly when the National Lottery Bill was being passed in this House and in the Dáil about two years ago there was a good debate in both Houses and much public comment from many sections of the community.  One of the main criticisms of its provisions related to the powers being given to the Minister.  Of the 36 sections of that Act there are about eight or ten in which the Minister is mentioned specifically as having extremely important powers.  As the then Opposition party that formed part of our normal opposition.  We did <Col N="1019" /> not oppose the Bill overall.  I can recall that the only section we did oppose at the time was section 5 (1) which reads:</P>
      <P>Moneys paid into the Central Fund pursuant to section 8 of this Act shall be applied for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The purposes of such one or more of the following, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time, that is to say, sport and other recreation, national culture (including the Irish language), the arts (within the meaning of the Arts Act, 1951) and the health of the community, and</P>
      <P>(b)  Such (if any) other purposes, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Government, in accordance with section 5 (b), have included youth and welfare as areas deserving of financial aid, which is totally in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (1) and (2) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall cause to be established in the Central Bank of Ireland a fund which shall be known as the National Lottery Fund and is referred to in this Act as &ldquo;the Fund&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Fund shall be managed and controlled by the Minister and shall consist of a current account and an investment account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years ago the then Government introduced this Bill.  Clearly they wanted the Minister to manage the fund and control the fund.  It was their Bill.  I cannot, for the life of me, understand why, a short time later, they want to change its provisions to include an independent authority.  Given the inclusion of an independent authority or commission is no guarantee that all will be well in that area, if that is what worries the Opposition. Supposing, for example, there was an independent commission comprised of sporting, cultural and other groupings <Col N="1020" /> they would be a neutral, faceless grouping. If that provision had been included in the Bill, we could not have a debate of this type because they would not be responsible to the Minister.  Certainly questions could not be tabled in the Dáil regarding the running of the national lottery. The essence of any democracy is that, in regard to funding like this, there must be ministerial responsibility, public accountability.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the use of the money or what is wrong with its use. I see very little wrong.  I know of no cause that has received or is about to receive financial aid that does not deserve it.  The example, what is wrong with helping a local GAA club, a soccer club, basketball or rugby club or the other sporting organisations that have been part and parcel of our society for years.  What is wrong with improving the pitches of Ireland?  What is wrong with building or improving pavilions or dressing rooms?</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher referred to the success of the national lottery.  It is a success for two reasons.  It is a success because the Irish like a gamble.  It is a success because the Irish people know that money is being allocated to projects in their town, village or city.  Therefore they know they are helping, by buying lottery tickets, to provide additional sporting and other facilities for their area.  I do not know why there should be a suggestion even of criticism of organisations, youth clubs, residents' associations getting funding from the national lottery.  It provides an opportunity for community and residents groups to avail of its funding and, in so doing, to improve their areas giving them a sense of pride in their local surroundings and workplaces.  Application for such funding is a well-known, established procedure.  You complete an application form.  The property, by way of gymnasium, pavilion, dressingroom, pitch, or whatever is subsequently inspected by the appropriate departmental inspector.  He may make one or two visits; I am not sure.  Certainly any application is investigated at that level by various departmental inspectors.  I do not <Col N="1021" /> see anything wrong with that; it is perfectly legitimate and normal.  This Government are spending the money totally in accordance with the provisions of the legislation passed two years ago.  They are spending such moneys totally in accordance with what was then a controversial section, section 5.</P>
    <P>I had the honour and pleasure of being in Germany last week for the three Irish matches.  It is perhaps appropriate that we are debating this matter this evening. We know that a steering committee has been organised within the Government to develop an indoor national complex in Dublin with a 50 metre pool.  This is why I think this debate is appropriate, I suggest to the Government also that they should prepare plans as soon as possible for a national stadium, whether that be an upgrading of existing facilties in the city, on virgin territory or wherever but it is a must for the future.  I accept that Germany is a much wealthier country than ours.  We are light years away from them in terms of sporting facilities.  I would have to pay a very fine tribute to the Irish team who, possibly, were lacking in some of the skills of their opponents but were all heart; they gave of their very best and certainly let no one down.  The Irish supporters, who enjoyed the matches in full carnival atmosphere at the event, as Senator Kelleher said, were the finest ambassadors this country ever produced.</P>
    <P>The allocation of national lottery funds to an indoor sports complex, a proper national stadium is totally in accordance with the wishes of the people buying the national lottery tickets.  That is what they want.  The Government know what is required.  I am in no doubt that, in time, both of those sporting facilities will be available to our people.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the motion I must reiterate that the then Government had their chance to establish an independent authority if that was what they wanted.  It was they who drafted the Bill, who prepared it and piloted it through both Houses.  If they missed the boat two years ago so be it.  I do not wish to be unfair in any way but there is very little point in crying <Col N="1022" /> about it now.  There may be an element of jealousy on the part of the Opposition that the present Government are implementing the provision in section 8 (2) (a) that the fund should be managed and controlled by the Minister.  That is what the Government are doing.  The Opposition had their chance and did not avail of it.  Therefore, they must now live with what is happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very interesting to hear Senator Fallon's contribution. However, I think he was living somewhat in cloud cuckooland.  It is not a question of the Government who introduced this legislation missing the boat or that those who were members of the Government at that time are now suffering a form of jealousy.  The fact remains that were that Government still in office, it would not be necessary to have this motion before us.</P>
      <P>There was much discussion over many years on whether we should have a national lottery here.  While many favoured it, many others opposed it.  I was not in favour of a national lottery because I feared the consequences it might have for our gambling public.  We are a gambling nation and each of us takes a gamble of some kind or another practically every day.  Some of us are inclined to go overboard in our gambling.  The national lottery has got a great deal of people into trouble on the spending end.  I have witnessed the purchase of as many as 24 lottery tickets by one person.  That person was on social welfare and it was on the day that he received his social welfare payment that he purchased 24 tickets. However, that can be left for another day.  That is not what we are here to discuss this evening; we are discussing the effect of the funds being disbursed by Ministers of State and the perception that Deputies and Fianna Fáil councillors have been handing out the money from this purse over the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national lottery has been a success beyond our wildest dreams.  I do not think anybody envisaged that the amount of money that has come in from the national lottery would have come in in the short <Col N="1023" /> time it has been in existence.  It has given the Government a handsome purse from which to distribute money throughout the country, but I am afraid the Government Ministers and Ministers of State and the Fianna Fáil Party generally have lost their heads.</P>

The links between Ireland and Australia were forged by the problems associated with the start of the Australian State.  In their bi-centennial year it is fitting that we should have people coming to us from Australia.  A very eminent historian in Senator Cooney's party, Dr. Portia Robinson has written much about the Irish Australian connection and we also welcome her to the House.  The Australian bi-centennial might seem to be inappropriate in the year in which Dublin is celebrating its millennium; nevertheless, we are proud of the part we played in setting up the great country that Australia is.  We welcome them to the House.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Government and on my own behalf I would like to welcome Senator Cooney <Col N="1024" /> to the Seanad and say how delighted we are that he is here.  There was a great bond of friendship between Ireland and Australia over the years which culminated in the visit of the Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Hawke, to Ireland earlier this year.  We are delighted that the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, will be reciprocating that visit during the summer.</P>
      <P>As regards my own county, I am delighted to say that Robert O'Hara Burke, whose statue stands in Melbourne, was the first man to sail from west to east which illustrates clearly the great connection there is between Ireland and Australia.  We are delighted you are with us and we hope you enjoy your stay.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with all those remarks and to say that in my young days Australia was a distant land but today the world seems much smaller than it seemed then.  Anybody the Senator or any member of his party may come in contact with here in Dublin will have some relation, however distant, in Australia.  I have very close relations in Australia.  I have first cousins there whom I have never met.  Today I am glad to say that Australia is much closer to us, let me pay tribute to the co-operation between Australia and this country particularly in student exchanges.  We all know many Irish students who have benefited from their trips to Australia and taking part in the farming and other activities there.  Long may our relationship and friendship last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party in Government find themselves with a fattening purse and money at their disposal for the sporting, arts and community projects etc., this money was intended for.  I would not like to accuse the Government of spending that money on any project that was not deserving of it.  There is a long list of projects which can be and are assisted by Government aid.  In my perusal of the long list of those who have benefited since the Government began disbursing money in practically every parish in the country, like Senator Fallon, I cannot find any organisation that was <Col N="1025" /> not worthy of grant-aid, but I can find many organisations more worthy of assistance than many of those who got it. This is where the trouble starts and that is the reason this motion is before us today.</P>
    <P>Insufficient attention has been paid to this by the Government and the various Ministers and Ministers of State who have taken down the piece of paper to their constituencies and passed it to numbers of organisations &mdash; some of them not even organisations.  I know of one instance not far from my area of assistance given for the planting of trees at a primary school.  That is very worthy, particularly in County Dublin where many trees have disappeared in the past few years.  There is also the Kilnamanagh Family Recreation Centre Limited who for 15 years have been accumulating funds in a not so well off area where the unemployment ratio is nearly the highest in the country.  Eight years ago they embarked on the building of a community centre.  From almost 2,000 houses those people have to date collected the sum of £240 per house.  They collected a total of £288,000 from a not so well off area of County Dublin.  They were given a site by the local authority and last October they signed a contract for the building of that centre costing £588,000.  People in that general area are baffled as to why they were excluded from this handout or any previous handouts.  They have their contract signed; they have their firm on site working to built the community centre.  They need grant-aid, and £60,000 was promised to them by Dublin County Council but this had to be cut at the estimates meeting last year because of the action of Fianna Fáil in refusing to impose charges for the county.</P>
    <P>In other words, they were promised £60,000 and they budgeted for that £60,000 in the contract they had signed with the contractor to build the community centre.  Then the county council reneged on that deal, which means they were worse off than they would have been had it never been promised to them. Despite that they have not figured in any of the handouts that I have seen over the <Col N="1026" /> past 12 months.  I was bitterly disappointed, and I think I speak for all public representatives in the area.  Perhaps the Fianna Fáil representation was not strong enough.  Perhaps those who were on the committee of the Kilnamanagh Family Recreation Centre were apolitical.  If they had Fianna Fáil cumann members running the matter they might have got their allocation &mdash; that is the impression that is abroad.  That is the qualification for disbursement for these funds.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher mentioned &mdash; and I have evidence of this &mdash; that some organisations, committees and clubs have been notified that they are to get an allocation from these funds and they have not even filled in an application form.  I am sorry Senator Fallon is not here to hear that but surely he heard Senator Kelleher make that point.  I do not know how it arrives on the Minister's desk.  Is it through the Fianna Fáil cumann or the local Fianna Fáil TD?  Somehow many allocations have been made to clubs throughout the country, a number of them in my area, who have not applied, yet the Kilnamanagh family recreation centre have been approaching public representatives of all shades and lobbying Dublin County Council for financial assistance.  If they do not get it, this project, a £588,000 contract can easily fall by the wayside.  In all 126 people have worked voluntarily for years to gather £288,000 locally in an area where there is high unemployment and they have been completely ignored.  There is no justification for this.</P>
    <P>I do not begrudge the money that has been given to any organisation or any primary school to plant trees on their campus.  They are entitled to it, but that is not the Minister's responsibility.  The Minister's responsibility is to see that he gets fair value for the money being given to these clubs.  If you can tell me that planting trees around a primary school is more important than building a community centre for a 2,000 house estate in Kilnamanagh, Tallaght, then the Minister is not fit to be a Minister.  Any Minister who could hand out funds to an <Col N="1027" /> organisation who had not even applied for it and then ignore an organisation who have been lobbying public representatives for two, three of four years to finance their project&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not referring to any one in particular because a number of them are involved and these grants are being thrown around like confetti to wherever they happen to fall.  At least it appears so to some people.  I suspect that, if there was a strong Fianna Fáil element within that organisation, irrespective of how deserving they were as against another organisation in the area, they would get the allocation.  This is not how a Minister should behave.  When any Deputy becomes a Minister he should legislate for the country and for the people, not for particular organisations. As I have said, some of them did not get on his desk; they did not make an application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £150,000 Clondalkin community centre is now closed for renovation and waiting for finance which the local authority cannot give to it because of Fianna Fáil's attitude on the local authority. Another major project has been ignored either by the Minister for the Environment or whatever Ministers dispersed these funds.  It is about time the Government sat down and had a look at what is happening, if they are not going to accept this motion this evening.  I do not believe there is any political gain in it.  People will not be fooled by that kind of behaviour any more and they are not being fooled by it.  For every one you satisfy ten are not satisfied and, the case can be made that the ten organisations who are not receiving the grant are more entitled <Col N="1028" /> to it than many of the organisations who got it.

      <P>I will not take up to 8.15 p.m.  I suppose this is a political arena and one has to resign oneself to having political debates.  There is a great lack of political reality about this whole debate.  The Bill was debated at great length in June 1986, two years ago.  I listened with great interest to Senator McMahon's revelation that his group were waiting four years for grant-aid for the project about which he was concerned. This Bill was before the House in June 1986 and obviously others were neglected before this Government took office.</P>
      <P>There is a great level of political unreality about this business.  If I wanted to be politically crude I could say that what is happening now is exactly what happens when Governments change.  I will quote from Deputy Michael O'Kennedy's comments as reported in the Official Report of 26 June 1986, column 1220, volume 368: &ldquo;The Minister must think this House very naive if he thinks it will give this Government or any Government such all embracing powers on the basis of general statements of intent from the Minister of State introducing the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was expressing concern that the <Col N="1029" /> content of the Bill as introduced by the Coalition in 1986 was such that it could conceivably be abused but it is a fact of life that the Government and the Minister have responsibility to disburse funds and Solomon in all his majesty could not solve every problem.  If we contrast the expenditure of £100 for the planting of trees in a primary school with a sizeable development such as Senator McMahon referred to, the debate lacks balance. That £100 would not put a knob on the front door of a community centre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was £500 in one case and £100 in another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even £500.  We should not carp.  This Administration have responsibility and the Minister has to make the ultimate decision in all these cases.  I am quite certain everybody who comes to me in my clinics or in my place of residence goes to all parties in the constituency either before visiting me or afterwards.  I cannot claim a monopoly in my constituency in relation to submissions made to any Minister.  I concede to Senator Kelleher that it is unfortunate and probably a little simplistic that Deputies should be racing home waving documents and saying: &ldquo;I did this because Johnston does not buy that any more and, God knows, he has not bought it for a long time.&rdquo;  Recent election results have indicated that quite conclusively.  The citizens of this country are quite competent to make up their own minds and they do not buy the pig in the poke any more of people claiming to have got this or that grant.  One party are in Government and another are out and that kind of musical chairs is the essence of politics. It is the reality of the day.  There could be an election in a week's time and this Government could be put out of office &mdash; I do not think they could but it is conceivable that they might &mdash; and we could be here this time next year complaining about the next Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reading extracts from Deputy O'Kennedy's comments when he was quite displeased with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's contribution to the debate.  We have to be political here. I am disappointed that Senator Kelleher is not here because he threw great bouquets to former Minister of State, Deputy Creed.  I sat in an area in my constituency four years ago when there was no national lottery and the Minister put his hand in his pocket and produced a cheque for £30,000 from his Department for a project and it was indeed very welcome.  I had to sit over in the corner and say: &ldquo;Fair play to you Donal, that was a very nice piece of work&rdquo;.  I admired it from afar and my only regret was that my party were not in office.  There was no lottery specifically designed by all parties to support and assist sporting organisations and so on.  Let us not be nitpicking about the national lottery.</P>
      <P>When he made his submission on this Bill, Deputy Creed said he hoped that 75 per cent of the total figure disbursed would go towards sport.  I subscribe to that kind of sentiment because at long last we see funds available for sporting organisations.  Senator McMahon referred to an area in his own constituency where there are 2,000 houses.  I live in a part of the world where there are not even 2,000 people.  We are striving with might and main to keep the young people on the land in rural Ireland. Assistance in the shape of grant-aid from the national lottery will assist a local GAA club, a handball club, a branch of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, or whatever the case may be, to improve the quality of life in these places so that young boys and girls do not have to go to Australia, the United Kingdom or the United States of America to find the kind of facilities we hope to provide &mdash; and are providing at present &mdash; in rural Ireland as well as in urban Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We attach great significance to the athletic achievements of the people, and so we should.  For example, last Sunday in excess of a quarter of a million people turned out to welcome home our national soccer team.  This is an indication of the <Col N="1031" /> importance people attach to international achievement by our sportsmen, which is arrived at in extraordinarily difficult circumstances.  We do not have all-weather playing facilities, or enough swimming pools, tennis courts and football pitches.  I could go right across the spectrum.  At least now there is light at the end of the tunnel, and we should not go down on the road of point scoring because clubs do not want to be embroiled in political point scoring.  They do not need that kind of thing.  They are volunteers in the business of providing facilities for the young or, quite often, the old and we should be striving with might and main to assist them.</P>
    <P>At least now we have funds.  The lottery has exceeded our wildest expectations in monetary return and I hope that, under whatever heading, sporting, cultural, health or whatever, we can exhort clubs with some degree of confidence to apply for lottery funds.</P>
    <P>I live in a part of this country which was suffering from a dwindling population. Young people were running from the land, even before the present emigration crisis, simply because there was nothing to keep them here.  They could see on television the kind of facilities provided abroad; now we can provide them ourselves. I only hope that in 25 years' time, if any of us are in this House to debate it, we can say we achieved so much with the funds accruing from the national lottery. Let us not get bogged down in political nitpicking because in a year, three years or even a month somebody else could be disbursing the funds and our party possibly complaining.  Tonight we should be praising the Minister for what he has achieved.  If he were Solomon himself he could not solve the problems of all the applicants.</P>

    <P>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 3 may I say at the outset &mdash; and I am sure the Minister agrees with me &mdash; that the sooner this Bill is on the Statute Book the better and the long gestation period this Bill has had was used to good effect.  Certainly, I share the frustration of very many people because the legislation did not get through, but the time which intervened has been used very constructively.  There has been a pretty genuine national debate.  Most of the points about which I was uneasy have been taken on board. Section 3 is a very good example of this. The one great flaw in the original proposals of the Minister concerned the composition of the board and the sense that the board would ultimately be responsible for deciding on the licence, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister assured the Dáil &mdash; and has written into the legislation &mdash; that the members have been drawn from specific areas of expertise.  The Minister goes a bit further than I would ask for in this specification.  What is crucial is that the country will have a very well balanced, sensible, informed and genuinely independent Commission.  It is right that the <Col N="1033" /> Minister of the day should nominate the members of that board.</P>
    <P>I also believe because a person is a member of a political party, or is a known supporter of a political party, that person should not be disqualified from membership of the Commission.  There is a great obligation on all of us to try to attract into public life people of the highest possible calibre.  I do not believe that, because a person is a member of a political party, that person's judgment or integrity is thereby impigned.  It is very much to the contrary.  It is strange that, if we are inviting people into politics, we make it impossible for them to serve on boards of this sort, or immediately the only tag by which they are referred to is that they are a member of a political party.  We have many examples of very good people in politics &mdash; Mr. Frank Flannery on the RTE Authority, Mr. Paul Kavanagh on a number of boards &mdash; people whose political colours are well known, but who have been exellent public servants as far as membership of commissions are concerned.</P>
    <P>If the Minister appoints one or two people with strong political views, so long as their competence and integrity is not in question, there will be no complaints from me.  I do not believe that political abstention is a virtue in itself.  Quality is all important for this Commission.  I do not know the politics of Mr. Jim Culliton, Chairman of the RTE Authority, but I know he has credibility with the public and a sense of achievement which lends credibility to the very stature of the RTE Authority.  I hope that the Minister, in appointing the Commission, will be going in for people of this calibre.  Quality is important.</P>
    <P>I also agree with the points the Minister made in the Dáil when he said he hoped this new Commission will not become bureaucratic, and that it will be a small, lean institution which will be able to do its job effectively without becoming a burden on the new service.  In section 3 the Minister is being sensible.  There is the framework here for a very, very good Commission.  All that is needed is the <Col N="1034" /> judgment of the Minister in making the appointments.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 are related and may be discussed together.  I wish to clarify that there are three separate lists of amendments. Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 are on the yellow printed list, and in amendment No. 3 on page 6 at paragraph (a) the word &ldquo;wise&rdquo; should read &ldquo;wide&rdquo;.  We are now dealing with amendments Nos. 1 and 3 together to section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 29, to delete &ldquo;one television programme service&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;television programme services&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I thought it was a Freudian slip and I was very happy to accept it.  I thought it improved the Bill to have the word &ldquo;wise&rdquo; written in.  I had no objection at all.</P>
      <P>Section 4 is probably the most radical departure in the Bill which makes possible a third television channel.  As the Minister is aware, there is some debate on this and some concern as to whether or not a third television channel is even a starter as far as we are concerned.  Estimates I have had from people in the business indicate that we are talking about an investment of about £12 million for a channel of this sort.  I wonder if that sort of money is available.  I certainly wonder if the return would be there from that sort of investment.  We may well be talking about something which is not a licence to print money and may take a long time to get off the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, my amendment goes almost in the opposite direction.  My concern in all of this would be that the Commission would be under pressure to licence a third television channel.  We could end up with something which fell <Col N="1035" /> very far below the standards which the Bill specifies.  We could end up with some sort of a sub-quality satellite operation. My amendment states the opposite.  If in fact I am wrong, if there is a demand for an extra television channel, if it is a success, if in the process it creates employment and does all the things we want this legislation to do, why should we be restrictive?  Why should we simply not open ourselves to the possibility of there being two or three such channels? I really wanted to raise the point and I will not be pressing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Manning in respect of this amendment.  I want to refer back to some of the points I raised yesterday evening on the sort of regional type of television service which I felt we should consider. In confining ourselves to the one extra channel we are, in a sense, confining that channel to the same source of advertisement revenue as is available at present to the two RTE channels.  It is most important that, if extra channels are to be commercially successful, they can branch into new fields of advertising revenue. I made the point that I felt channels operating on a regional basis would be better able to get into this new field of advertising revenue.  We must look very closely at some system of regional television. There is a market for it.  I hope the Minister gives it serious consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a different interpretation of the section.  I thought it could be run on the type of model that the IBA are running in Britain and that a television service did not necessarily mean that the same output had to be broadcast to every region at the same time.  I am sure the Minister will explain it.  The Bill needs to be changed to encompass the argument put forward in proposing the amendment.  I understood it was a television service in the sense that the IBA are a television service in the UK.  They can split up their services at odd hours of the day such as a particular programme for Ulster, UTV, or another <Col N="1036" /> different programme for Wales or a different programme for Midland or Central. Maybe that is not the case.  I do not know, but I would like to hear it explained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is exactly as Senator O'Toole has just mentioned.  The primary objective is to have a third television channel established, which will be essentially national in nature.  However, there is absolutely nothing to debar &mdash; I tried to cover this in my Second Stage speech here in the House &mdash; any of the individual cable companies, for example, in Dublin, Cork or Galway or any of the individual MMDS operators in particular regions, from opting out for an hour or two during the day with their own regional programmes to meet exactly the point Senator Manning mentioned so that we can have a regional character to it and it can be encompassed.  Consequently, the amendment is unnecessary because the exact ideas that are mentioned can be accommodated within the Bill as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem at all with amendment No. 3, which is being taken in conjunction with this.  I am concerned about the first amendment we are dealing with.  I have a reservation about the need for this one additional television station, which is now going to be referred to as the third channel.  Unless the Minister has information in this area that I am not privy to, we are now speaking in a vacuum.  Obviously, the Minister would not have put in this section unless he was aware that there is a need for and a possibility of a take-up of this section, because it has been added to his original idea.  If there is a need for it, we will then have to see how it goes.  Certainly, I would not agree to extending that remit beyond this one the Minister feels there is a need for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I honestly believe that opening up this additional channel could put the financing of RTE in jeopardy.  That is my only reservation.  You can call it competition or what you like, but in the area of advertising revenue, there is only a limited <Col N="1037" /> amount of money available in this country. People might opt for a new channel as an advertising outlet out of curiosity alone.  That might put the funding of RTE in jeopardy.  They are giving an excellent service as it is on their two channels.  If the Minister has other information available, fair enough, but given the actual provision as I read it, this amendment would give the Commission power to have anything up to three or four additional television services, apart from the regional position outlined by Senator Bradford.  I have no objection to that at regional level, but I object to a proliferation of independent, private television stations being set up by this new Commission. That is my reservation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to apologise to the Minister.  I missed his Second Stage speech.  Therefore, if I am duplicating or wasting his time, no doubt he will tell me. As I understand section 4, what he means by one television programme service is one broadcast service.  Is it possible to have a number of broadcast services?  If it is, why the emphasis on one, at all?  I would like to know the reason for the form of words there, if it is as simple as it appears to be to opt out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, the specific demand I am aware of for broadcasts of what you could call a regional nature is the quite insistent demand from the Gaeltachtaí for a television service for the Gaeltacht as distinct entirely from television programmes in Irish.  What they are actually talking about is a local television service for three, four or five communities who are scattered. They are separated from each other by fairly long distances.  What I would like to know in clear &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answers from the Minister, is whether it is possible, under this legislation to set up an independent television service for the people of the Gaeltacht communities who have a fairly consistent and well-articulated demand for such a service.  I do not want to get involved in the practicalities of it.  I simply want to know if this legislation or existing broadcasting legislation makes such a thing possible. <Col N="1038" /> If it does not, we ought at least to make it possible under the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible under RTE legislation.  The Senator will be aware that we have been looking at the propsect of a pilot scheme for the Gaeltacht areas. That is being examined.  It is not a simple matter, but it is being examined in detail. There has been a provisional allocation agreed in relation to lottery funds.  The whole prospect of it is being examined. As far as this legislation is concerned, the principle of one extra commercial station within our limited advertising budget is on the borderline as far as liability is concerned.  It will be viable.  I believe it will be very effective and a quality programme.  The point that the Senators were making to me was that they wanted a regional aspect.  All I am saying is that this regional aspect can be given in the same way as Senator Ryan's adopted city of Cork has an &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; capacity.  It has an &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; capacity at the moment on cable television where you can have Corkabout and things like that.  That is exactly what we will be doing, as I envisage it happening in cablelink land, in Dublin, Waterford and other areas.  It is not necessary to amend the legislation for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 21 to 53 and in page 8, lines 1 to 7, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Authority shall publish the name and address of each applicant and other details of the application, including the services proposed to be <Col N="1039" /> provided but excluding commercial details that should be kept private.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The guidelines laid down in section 6 are important.  They are very broad and I do not think anybody could disagree with any of them.  These are the guidelines under which the awards for the sound broadcasting contracts will be made.</P>
    <P>The problem is that they are a bit subjective. While one could leave them there, there is the question of public confidence and openness about all of this.  If the Commission are under an obligation to declare publicly who the applicants are, what are the claimed resources of each of the applicants, what did each applicant promise to offer the particular community, the public would at least be in a position to know with confidence that the best candidate is chosen or that the candidate chosen is in a position of equality with the others and whatever other factors came into account were factors of judgment at the end of the day.  This is to ensure that everything will be fully above board.  Otherwise there could be some undermining of the credibility of the Commission.</P>
    <P>This is a great country for rumours and innuendoes.  There could be a belief that, even though there were three or four very strong candidates, it was the fourth candidate who, for political or other reasons, actually got the contract.  If the names and some of the details &mdash; obviously there are certain commerical criteria which would be excluded &mdash; are published, there is a greater sense of openness and there is a extra layer of vigilance as far as the workings of the Commission are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe, with respect to the Senator's proposal, that the edge of transparency which I have already proposed for this legislation is almost unprecedented in legislation in this country, in particular the full disclosure of the licences and the contracts.  There will be full details of every licence for the successful applicant and the full contract <Col N="1040" /> between the Commission and the contractor are on public display.  Copies of them can be received from the Commission by any member of the general public.  To go any further than that would be to make the task of the Commission quite impossible.</P>
      <P>If Senator Manning thinks about it for a moment he will see the difficulty with it.  He is suggesting that all of the applications should be published in advance of a decision by the Commission.  Somebody could be putting forward an application, perhaps one of the better known pesonalities in RTE.  He would want the fact that he is associated with an application to be kept totally secret on the basis that, if he is unsuccessful, he will want to stay with RTE.  If all the information is made public in advance, it could compromise an individual application.  If somebody applies and is unsuccessful in a commercial sense, nobody wants to be seen to be associated with a failed application. For example, if it is a public company, it can be damaging to their interests on the Stock Exchange.  If it is a well-known personality in the media world it can be damaging to that person's reputation.</P>
      <P>As far as the question of everything being seen to be above board is concerned, there is nothing to stop an unsuccessful applicant at the end of the day, publishing the details of his or her application if unsuccessful and then saying to the media generally: &ldquo;This Commission have not behaved correctly.  This is a better application and you can see it is a better application because here are the full details of the applicant and the contract of the unsuccessful applicant&rdquo;.  It is open to any individual, if that person feels aggrieved, to publish his or her details. What is happening here is the same as happens in any contract, whether it is the construction of a road, the construction of a sanitary services scheme or the construction of any other project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only the successful applicant is made known to the public, not the unsuccessful ones.  If somebody feels aggrieved there is nothing to stop that person highlighting and publishing the details of his or her tenders or application with all of the <Col N="1041" /> details of programming.  It would be going totally against all the normal criteria to try to go further in relation to confidentiality.  It would be damaging to confidentiality and might result in the best applicants not coming forward because people would not want to be seen to be associated with failure.</P>
    <P>I have tried to ensure, in a way which is not normal in legislation in this country, that the successful applications will be the best on the basis of the criteria for the type of personnel who are to be appointed to the Commission.  They will be people of high calibre with particular qualities.  Having picked a successful applicant, the application will stand public scrutiny.  All of the details of the application, the directors, the full beneficiaries, the shareholdings, all of the details of programming and all of the details of financial arrangements will be available for public scrutiny and a copy can be had by any member of the general public by merely going to the office of the Commission after the decision is made. That is a degree of transparency which is unique in Irish legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has met the case very fully.  I thank him for his very comprehensive reply.  I suppose, Dublin being Dublin and Cork being Cork, these details will become public anyway in the normal course of events.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has dealt with the amendment in the correct way.  The Commission will publish the details of the successful applicant.  In his Second Stage speech I understood the Minister to say that the Commission will be deciding on when, how and from whom to invite applications for tender for contract for particular areas.  That will be done on a technical basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a lot of discussion here, especially in relation to radio broadcasting. Is it county, half county or existing areas that are covered illegally at the moment?  Where mountains run through a county, naturally, on the eye to eye level of radio signals it might not necessarily beam into the other part of the <Col N="1042" /> county.  There are some, like Tipperary Community Radio, who have a fairly restricted broadcasting base because of the Galtees which run right down through the centre of the county and separate us from Limerick and the Cork border.  Will this new Commission set up the technical areas which they consider, from the information available to them, are the appropriate areas to be covered by community radio?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain the procedure that will be followed.  First, the Commission will be appointed.  They will immediately advertise in what has become known as a trawl arrangement. They will place an advertisement asking for tenders but asking if, out there in the community, somebody is interested in providing a radio service or a television service and in what areas they are interested in providing the services.  For example, the Senator mentioned Tipperary. That could include part of Tipperary, Cork and adjoining counties.  It could be the north Cork area that was mentioned earlier and could include Limerick and Tipperary.  Somebody could be interested in Sligo-Leitrim as a joint unit. The idea is to bring forward as much information as possible from the general public on what is the interest and who is interested in providing radio.  This is particular to radio rather than television.</P>
      <P>The Commission will then examine the information that comes in and make recommendations to me.  I will discuss it with them in relation to what sort of break-up they suggest.  They may suggest two stations in Cork or maybe one station in Cork, maybe three stations in Dublin or maybe two stations in Dublin.  They may suggest a station covering Connacht or maybe three stations in Connacht. They will make the recommendations, at which stage those recommendations will be considered by myself with my technical people in the Department.  We are tied by international regulations in relation to frequencies and in relation to power, and so on, of particular transmitters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will then, in consultation with the <Col N="1043" /> Commission, make the decision in relation to the number of stations there will be in a particular area covering a region, a county, a combination of a couple of counties and, having decided on that in consultation, mainly on the basis of frequency allocations and interests that have come from the trawl, the Commission will then advertise for applications for the regions that are decided upon.  That is the procedure that will be followed.  The Commission will then decide on the applications that come in for that region.  They will decide on the successful applicant and then the successful application is available to the general public to stand the test of public examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I now understand more clearly the kind of procedures that will be followed, but it could happen that the person who responds to the original request from the Commission may not be the successful applicant.  Once they have done the ground work, based on experience they may not necessarily be the only ones who apply formally at that second stage.  The more we talk about this the more clear it becomes to us and we will be able to communicate with people who are interested, particularly in the radio area, because they will be confined to minimum power outputs on international regulations.</P>
      <P>This will probably not apply to the same extent in the television area except in regard to the new microwave signal the Minister talked about and about which there is a lot of controversy in relation to health and so on.  Does the Minister intend to impose that type of signalling on the new television network or will they be working on the same frequency as RTE are at present?  How do we relate that to the existing cable link or, indeed, other means of transmitting television programmes which is going on widely throughout the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the only other means that is going on around the country. It is illegal deflection and I am sure <Col N="1044" /> the Senator would not want to be in any way associated with any illegal operation. Part of the other Bill we will be discussing later on, which has already received the unanimous support of this House, deals with illegal operators.  I know the Senator would not wish to be associated with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this amendment is to increase the use of the Irish language in broadcasting.  I would like to address myself particularly to amendment No. 4a.  Ag moladh an Rúin agus chun é a mhíniú agus a chur i gcéill i gceart, an rud atá i gceist anseo ná go mbeadh trian de na craolacháin sna réigiúin sin a bhfuil Gaeltacht ina mease tugtha i nGaeilge. Níl mé ag iarraidh pribhléide do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, níl mé ag iarraidh go mbeadh aon rud speisialta déanta dóibh. Táim ag rá gur chóir é seo a thabhairt dóibh ó cheart, gur chóir go mbeadh sé acu de cheart, go mbeadh seirbhís i nGaeilge ar fáil acu, agus más iad muintir Chorca Dhuibhne nó muintir Chonamara nó muintir Thír Chonaill atá i gceist tá siad siúd ag brath, agus go deimhin tá <Col N="1045" /> siad ag súil leis an mBille um Chraolacháin seo, agus ba chóir dúinne gach tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh ag an am seo. Fiú féin san Eoraip tá polasaithe ag an EC chun tacaíocht agus cúnamh a thabhairt do na mionlaigh chiníocha, ethnic minorities.  B'fhéidir gur cúrsaí ceoil a bheadh i gceist nó cúrsaí nuachta nó cúrsaí comhrá; cibé rud a bheadh i gceist tá siad ag súil go mbeadh seirbhís Ghaelach agus seirbhís i nGaeilge ar fáil acu.</P>
    <P>Anois, b'fhéidir gur féidir teacht timpeall ar an rud seo.  Agus an tAire ag tabhairt amach ceadúnais do áit, dá bhféadfaí é a dhéanamh sa tslí go mbeadh an réigiún craolacháin chomh teoranta leis an nGaeltacht, mar shampla, ansin d'fhéadfaí a rá go mbeadh an tseirbhís sin ag freastal ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta go mórmhór, agus go bhféadfaí, fiú féin níos mó ná aon trian amháin den am a thabhairt don Ghaeilge.  Go mórmhór, is dócha gur chóir dúinne gach tacaíocht a thabhairt don teanga, gur chóir go mbeadh an tacaíocht sin ag dul i dtreise, ag dul i láidreacht, agus go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach dúinn anois gach seans a thabhairt di.  An rud atá i gceist agam, is dócha, go bhfuil go leor ráite ag páirtithe, ag polaiteoirí, agam féin gan amhras, admhaím sin, agus go bhfuil sé in am anois, b'fhéidir comhartha, gesture, a thabhairt di.</P>
    <P>An deis nó an seans atá anseo againn ná an teanga, cultúr, saol na Gaeltachta, cúnamh a thabhairt dó, tacaíocht a thabhairt dó chun é a fhorbairt agus a chur chun cinn.  Ba mhaith linn a fhios a bheith againn go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta ag maireachtaint, go bhfuil siad ag caitheamh a saoil, a lán acu, trí Ghaeilge agus go bhfuil siad ag brath agus ag éisteacht le cibé rud atá á chraoladh ón raidio, ón teilifís, nó cibé áit óna bhfuil sé ag teacht, agus go bhfuil sé de cheart acu siúd an méid atá á chloisint acu a chloisint ina dteanga féin, agus gur chóir dúinn an deis sin a thabhairt dóibh, an tacaíocht sin a thabhairt dóibh</P>
    <P>Nílim ag rá go gcaithfí Gaeilge a chaitheamh siar sa scomach orthusan nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu agus a chaitheann a saol trí Bhéarla.  Ní aontaím in aon chor gur chóir an Ghaeilge a bhrú ar dhaoine <Col N="1046" /> mar sin.  B'fhéidir nach mbeadh sé féaráilte dóibh siúd nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu a bheith ag éisteacht le Gaeilge an t-am ar fad.  Mar gheall air sin, mholfainn féin don Aire, chomh fada agus is féidir é, go mbeadh réigiún craolacháin ar chósta thiar na tíre seo, go mbeadh sé, más féidir in aon chor é, chomh teoranta leis an réigiún craolacháin a bhfuil ceadúnas á thabhairt amach dó.</P>
    <P>If these people are spending 24 hours a day speaking the Irish language and living that life, they are entitled to hear radio services in the Irish language.  I am not looking for this as a favour for the people who conduct their lives and businesses through Irish.  It is their right to have this service from the State.  I have been saying quite clearly that, whether they are in Chorea Dhuibhne, Connemara or Donegal, we should look after their special interests and their needs.</P>
    <P>Cultural values are very special.  I said on Second Stage how important it is to be confident that Irish culture and the Irish language will not be threatened by 16, 20 or 100 broadcasting satellites and that I firmly believe that they are strong enough to hold their own in any sort of cultural medium.  I am not asking for something special here.  I am not talking about protectionism.  I am not talking about something that will keep the people of the Gaeltacht cut off from the rest of the country.  Quite the opposite, I am saying we should let them live their lives naturally in the Irish language.  If we are providing local radio broadcasting that should also be available.</P>
    <P>This in no way reflects on the very fine service provided by Raidio na Gaeltachta. I am speaking on the basis that, if we need this Bill and if a choice is to be offered to people all over the country, that choice should also be available to muintir na Gaeltachta.  I am trying to present it in a way that is not purist.  I do not support this view of people pushing the Irish language down the throats of people who are not interested in it.  I am totally opposed to that.  That type of fanatical approach has done more damage to the language than anything else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> We should look at the special needs of the people in the Gaeltacht.  In issuing the licences can we try to ensure that the area of broadcasting is co-terminus with the Gaeltacht area.  In other words, they would cover the same area.  That would get us away from the difficulty of imposing Irish on people who are not interested in it.</P>
    <P>Similarly, it would also allow us to provide an all-Irish service in parts of the Gaeltacht, rather than 35 per cent.  If you take a whole county, the county of Kerry or Galway, all those areas are not Irish speaking.  It would be unfair to try to impose it, but it would make more sense in those areas to offer the people of the smaller and the local regions a service in their own language.  Chun deireadh a chur leis an méid atá le rá agam, a Chathaoirligh, tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire gach tacaíocht a thabhairt do smaoineamh, go mór mhór, agus an rud atá ráite agam sa rún, go mbeadh sé in ann, tá súil agam, tacú leis agus ligean leis an uair seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá aird tugtha ar an cheist seo cheana féin.  The points raised by the Senator were very close to my heart in the drafting of this legislation but I believe I have covered it very well in the Bill.  There are specific requirements relating to the Irish language.  The quality, range and type of programmes to be provided in the Irish language are some of the criteria in section 6 and also the general requirement relating to the preservation of the language as a spoken language in areas which embrace a Gaeltacht area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that it is well to leave this flexibility to the Commission, to allow the Commission, hopefully, to provide the framework where groups within the Gaeltacht areas will come forward with local independent radio within their own region.  I believe we would be going the wrong road in accepting the minimum-maximum type ideas of the Senator.  I do not disagree with his aims.  I am fully supportive of it but I believe that we should leave it to the flexibility of the Commission.  This flexibility provides <Col N="1048" /> great scope for the emergence of a significant amount of Irish language broadcasting. For instance, it presents the opportunity for Irish language interests to come together and to establish stations particularly at community level.</P>
    <P>This is very much what we have in mind in the reference to communities of interests in section 6 (2) (g).  We see them doing this either on their own initiative, or in association with other interests in the community, thereby ensuring a significant input of Irish language programme and cultural programmes into such services.  As well as that, the Senator will be aware that recently I sanctioned an extra three hours a day broadcasting time for Raidio na Gaeltachta which will leave them with a full service from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., so that they will be geared for and well capable of coping with any competition that comes from outside their areas.  In regard to Raidio na Gaeltachta, with the criteria concentrating as they do in section 6 on the quality, range and type of programmes etc., in the Irish language, and the general requirement relating to the preservation of the language in particular in the Gaeltacht areas, we should leave it that way rather than going down the road proposed by the Senator.  I do not disagree with the aim he is trying to achieve, but I believe the flexibility and the manner in which we have already approached it are the correct way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, ní fheadar an bhfuil mórán difríochta idir an Seanadóir O'Toole agus an Aire ó thaobh aidhmeanna de, ach má cheapann an tAire gur féidir daoine a mhealladh chun seirbhís as Gaeilge a chur ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí, nó cuid den tseirbhís a chur ar fáil as Gaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí, agus má tá sé cinnte go gcuirfear seirbhís mar sin ar fáil, níl aon leithscéal aige gan céatadán bunúsach a chur isteach sa reachtaíocht atá os ár gcomhair chun é sin a leagan síos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is confident that the Commission will be able to ensure a minimum and an acceptable level of Irish <Col N="1049" /> language broadcasting in those radio stations that will serve a community which will be to a greater or lesser extent Irish speaking, it ought to be possible to insert a condition, a minimum figure into the legislation.  If, on the other hand, the Minister is not confident of that, that is a reason for inserting a minimum level to ensure that his objective is met.  Whether you see it as something that is likely to happen, in which case we simply want to clarify the thinking of the Commission, or something that is liable to be squeezed out by commercial pressures, in which case a desirable objective, which is shared by almost all Members of the Oireachtas, should be met.</P>
    <P>Let me put this in very clear terms. This is not just a matter of our national language.  This is a very important matter of minority rights in a community that is much given to talking about pluralism and divergence of cultures.  There is more than one divergence of culture in this island.  There is not just the Protestant-Catholic divergence.  There is an important cultural divergence between that small community who speak Irish on a day to day basis, who represent in or around 4 per cent or 5 per cent of the population, and the remaining part of the community who do not.  It is important to remember, for instance, that the Irish language community is as big as the nonofficial Roman Catholic community in this country and is, therefore, entitled to a similar degree of concern and sensitivity.</P>
    <P>For that reason it is most regrettable that the Minister is not prepared to specify a minimum level.  One would hope that a minimum level would represent a base line and that the Commission would be looking for people who were imaginative enough and broadly based enough in their outlook to extend beyond that. It appears to me, for instance, that in a station serving the western part of County Galway, one ought to expect something well in excess of 35 per cent from that station, given the population structure and given the extent to which Irish is a spoken language in County Galway.  There is a large area in Donegal <Col N="1050" /> of which the same would be true.  Places like County Kerry would be somewhat more difficult.  Those communities are entitled to demand a service in Irish.  This is not just a nice cultural thing or a commitment to our diversity or historical culture. This is a community which is entitled to expect and demand services in their own language.</P>
    <P>Many of us believe it is our own language as well, but for these communities it is their language and it has survived remarkably well under extraordinary pressures. They are entitled to the choice they have made and at this stage a choice they make freely because, as I can testify from correcting exams recently, as far as I can see the products of the Gaeltachtaí now can produce a far better standard of English than any of the products of the schools where English is not properly taught to them any more.  I have a student from the Gaeltacht and his English is well above the standard of most of those from what we call the Galltacht.</P>
    <P>The people of the Gaeltacht who now choose to use Irish as a freely spoken day to day language are entitled to more from us than a well-intentioned but nevertheless vague aspiration to a reasonable commitment.  They are entitled to a specified percentage which is representative of their proportion of the population in the areas where these local services will exist.  I regret that the Minister cannot see his way to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are very anxious to meet the aims and desires as stated by Senators O'Toole and Ryan while, at the same time, retaining the flexibility of this Bill &mdash; and flexibility is the keynote to it.</P>
      <P>In drafting the criteria in section 6, the determination of applications for award of sound broadcasting contracts is specified. Section 6 (2) (d) states:</P>
      <P>The quantity, quality, range and type of programmes in the Irish language and the extent of programmes relating to Irish culture proposed to be provided;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> Section 6 (3) states:</P>
    <P>In considering the suitability of any applicant for the award of a sound broadcasting contract to provide a sound broadcasting service in respect of an area which includes a Gaeltacht area,</P>
    <P>exactly the point Senator Ryan made</P>
    <P>the Commission shall have particular regard to the preservation as a spoken language of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>In relation to the point made about minorities and minority communities, we have covered this in section 6 (2) (i): the extent to which the service proposed serves communities of interest.  They are all geared towards the exact area Senator Ryan wishes to aim for.  This is much more than just about the Gaeltacht regions as we know them.  I believe there will be great scope, for example, within the Dublin region and within the other cities and also in rural Ireland, for Irish language groups to come together and develop a town station which can provide for their needs for Irish language programmes for a certain number of days in a week or a certain number of hours.</P>
    <P>The key to this Bill is flexibility.  I believe the needs of the lovers of the language, those who live in the Gaeltacht areas and those who would love to understand more of the language, can be met and are more than adequately met by the various provisions as laid out in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I found myself broadly in agreement with the point taken by the Minister in his reply.  We would all share the objectives but I wonder if the Minister could give some commitment that one year down the line we would have some provision for a review of the operation of this section of the Bill.  If there was genuine concern in the Gaeltacht areas, if the points made by Senators Ryan and O'Toole were not being met, and if it was clear that the expressed desire of all parties in the Oireachtas was not being met, there could be a provision for a revision at that stage.</P>

      <P>It is already written into the Bill in the broadcasting obligations of any particular contractor.  When the successful contractor receives his contract from the Commission, he will have received that contract on the basis of special obligations in relation to music, language and all of the criteria laid down in the Bill.  It is not a question of monitoring this on an annual basis to see that the contractor is meeting his obligations. It will be a responsibility of the Commission to monitor continually the operation and the situation where the contractor will meet his obligations in relation to all of the criteria laid down.</P>
      <P>If the general public are not satisfied that the contractor at any time is not meeting his obligations, there is a mechanism within the Bill whereby they can go and make a complaint to the Commission that the contractor is not meeting his obligations.  I have no doubt that the people involved in the language movement will be very vigilant in relation to the monitoring of the obligations as laid down in the contracts that are received by any operators from the Commission.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments about the Irish language and the provisions for it in the Bill.  I disagree with the amendment for a number of reasons.  We are dealing here with private commercial local radio.  By its nature it has to be responsive to the needs of the people it is serving.  I know from my own experience that Raidio na Gaeltachta has a huge listenership in the Gaeltacht areas.  I suggest that, if a station which represented a Gaeltacht area did not provide an adequate number of programmes in the Irish language, they would soon get the message.  The nature of the new radio stations is that they have to be responsive to the needs of the people.  It is wrong to stipulate a particular percentage and I do not think the mover of the amendment explained adequately why 35 per cent should be the figure.  It is wrong to come up with a figure like that.  I would be happy if we got an assurance from the Minister that somebody who has the Irish language <Col N="1053" /> close to his heart will be appointed to this Commission to ensure that the Irish language gets a fair deal.</P>

      <P>Chun a mhíniú conas a tháinig mé ar an bhfigiúr trian leis an gceist a chuir an Seanadóir Haughey orm: ag féachaint ar na contaetha Ciarraí, Gaillimh agus Tír Conaill, ó thaobh acraí de tá tuairim is trian de na contaetha sin sna Gaeltachtaí.  It was just that way and no other way &mdash; roughly one-third of those counties.  Any figure can be argued. I am not going out to bat on the one figure.  I am very pleased with the response and the debate on this amendment.</P>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an méid atá ráite ag an Aire go raibh sé sásta éisteacht leis an méid a bhí le rá agam agus a chur leis agus a aontú leis.  Aontaím go mór go gcaithfidh Bille mar seo a bheith, mar a dúras, solúbtha chun déileáil leis an tír ar fad.</P>
      <P>Ar an bpointe sin a chuir Senator Manning, in ar mhol sé gur chóir go mbeadh athbhreith ar na socruithe atá déanta, tar éis bliana, tá mé ar aon intinn leis sa rud sin.  Is docha, mar a dúirt an tAire, go bhfuil sé sin ag dul ar aghaidh an t-am ar fad agus go bhfuil an coimisiún ann i gcónaí le monatóireacht de shórt éigin a dhéanamh ar an tseirbhís atá á cur ar fáil.</P>
      <P>Mar sin, dá mbeadh muintir na Gaeltachta nó muintir áit áirithe sa Ghaeltacht ag gearán nach raibh go leor Gaeilge ar fáil acu, dá gcuirfidís an pointe sin os comhair an choimsiúin agus go ndéanfadh an coimisiún athscrúdú agus athbhreith ar an tseirbhís a bhí ar fáil, dá mba rud é go raibh sé sin ann is dócha go mbeadh sórt cosanta ansin, agus caithfidh mé a rá go mbeinn sásta ar shlí éigin leis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pointe amháin deireanach ar an rud agus is é seo é, tá chomh maith le séirbhís Ghaeilge agus seirbhís Bhéarla, sórt seirbhíse dhátheangaí.  Ceann de na rudaí a théann go mór i bhfeidhm orm féin, ag <Col N="1054" /> taisteal timpeall na hEorpa agus ag éisteacht le stáisiúin raidió sa Fhrainc nó sa Ghearmáin nó an lodáil nó aon áit eile, is féidir éisteacht le clár, abraimís ceoil, agus is féidir leis an D.J. Fraincis nó lodáilis nó cibé teanga eile á úsáid, agus ansin, b'fhéidir, rock song éigin Béarla a chur ar siúl.</P>
    <P>That is my only complaint about Raidió na Gaeltachta at the moment and I have taken it up with them.  The fact that they have confined themselves in their purity to pure Irish culture in the sense of almost protecting the people, imprisoning the people in one culture, is also wrong.  It is chauvinistic in the extreme.  I welcome the comments of some DJs on Raidió na Gaeltachta who have bemoaned the fact that they are not allowed to play popular music, introduce them in Irish and if the song happens to be sung in English they should also be able to present it.  All over Europe that is the case.  You can listen to a rock station in Germany or Holland and it is more than likely to be an English language record that is playing.  That, in fact, has not in any sense taken from or threatened the cultural values of those countries.</P>
    <P>I look forward to that spreading.  That is one of the reasons I feel there is room for a mix, as well as for all-Irish or all-English stations.  However, it has been adequately debated.  I would have liked the amendment to be accepted.  The Minister has given it serious thought and it has been considered.  The suggestion put forward by Senator Haughey might be taken up and somebody representing the Irish language constituency, as it were might be appointed.  That is one of the things that might be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, tá mé thar a bheith sásta leis an bplé atá déanta againn ar an rún seo.  Tá brón orm nach raibh an tAire in ann é a ligean leis, ach sin mar atá. Fáiltím roimh an méid atá ráite aige.  Is áthas liom gur aontaigh sé leis na hargóintí a chuir mé féin faoi bhráid an Tí. Beidh mé ag féachaint agus ag faire cosúil <Col N="1055" /> leis an <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> ar cad a thitfidh amach.</P>

      <Col N="1057" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4b not moved.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get in plain language some sort of assurance on sections 9, 11 and 13.  These are the sections which deal, among other things, with impartiality, with questions of taste, with invasions of privacy of the individual, the possibility of the manipulation of the air-waves for whatever purpose, be it political, financial or whatever.  Central to all of this is the status of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.</P>
      <P>Without going into this at any length, one of the most frightening aspects of modern times is the extent to which the media can be manipulated.  In Britain we see in its classic form the fact that nobody with a left-wing point of view will get a fair hearing from large sections of the British press.  Examining why Mrs. Thatcher has been so successful over such a long period, undoubtedly the press barons have come to her rescue, and actively and in a very systematic way destroyed her political opponents through the way in which they control their own aspects of the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way &mdash; there is equal balance &mdash; many journalists, but broadcasters in particular, feel they have a God-given right, a duty to democracy, to attack and expose politicians, to undermine what they would regard as the Establishment, the Houses of Parliament, to take an anti-Establishment line in every possible way, to stir things up and to be agents of change.  RTE in the past have not been free, at least in part, of this sort of thinking when, especially in the seventies, a coterie of producers and journalists came in who seemed to have as part of their general philosophy on broadcasting that it was <Col N="1058" /> the duty of the broadcaster to challenge existing society.  In so doing they were frequently extremely selective in the institutions they actually challenged.  I am not saying there was a conspiracy to bring people in &mdash; there may have been an element of that.  I also believe that there was a genuine view that the best type of broadcasting was confrontational broadcasting; that was a way of grabbing the viewer and of stirring things up.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that, in the public perception, RTE's credibility as a public service institution suffered damage during that period, and there were many people, and some politicians, who felt that frequently it was not possible to get a fair hearing from RTE.  Indeed, we had a Member of this House awarded significant damages in court recently as a result of a programme which was adjudged in the Circuit Court to have been biased and unfair and certainly did damage.  I am wrong about that.  A Member of this House was associated with the programme and was vilified in a programme in respect of which damages were awarded.</P>
    <P>It must also be said that in RTE there is also a very strong sense of professionalism. They have some of the best and most professional journalists in the country.  There is a very strong sense of balance within RTE and of ensuring that no one tendency will ever run riot and that there must be countervailing pressures within it.  Certainly RTE have some of the most superbly professional broadcasters, people like Seán Duignan, Donal Kelly, Mike Burns, Kevin Healy, Shane Kenny, people who have an acceptance in the community that what they say is as objective and as accurate as can possibly be.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that RTE in recent years, as our main public service broadcasting institution, suffered a drop in their credibility.  Charges have been made; some of them have been documented; others probably have no foundation in fact.  Nonetheless the absence, <Col N="1059" /> or the apparent absence, of an effective complaints commission has done damage there.  I believe that central to the success of this legislation must be public acceptance that it is fair, that it is not being manipulated by politicians, by financial interests, or by pressure groups of any sort.  At local level this could be particularly important because all of us know provincial papers that felt no obligation in the past to be impartial between one political party and other parties, between one politician and other politicians. There is not a strong sense of impartiality so I hope the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, as envisaged in this Bill, will first of all be accessible to the public, will be seen to have powers which are effective and that this new broadcating does have a strong sense of accountability in the way in which it is operated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to section 9 (1) (c) which says &ldquo;not less than 20 per cent of the broadcasting time&rdquo; shall deal with current affairs.  In my Second Stage speech yesterday I suggested to the Minister that this would be an ideal opportunity for meetings of councillors and town commissioners and urban councils around the country to broadcast live on the air for local radio current affairs programmes. It would be a tremendous way of promoting the meetings and letting the people know how important they were and how they were dealt with in the same way as the Oireachtas.  The Seanad and Dáil reports are being well received since Radio Éireann were allowed broadcast the day's proceedings that evening.  I strongly recommend that the Commission should look at this.  The question I want to ask is whether the county councils, the towns commissioners and urban councils are empowered to let their meetings be broadcast under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the last point first.  That is absolutely a matter for the local contractor in the area and <Col N="1060" /> whether he wants to give time, and is prepared to put in microphones, etc., for county council meetings.  Having been a member of a county council for many years and having had the honour to chair the council for some considerable time, on the basis that the contractors will be operating on advertising time alone I am not sure whether it is really riveting radio, to put it mildly, but that is a matter for each individual area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they the power?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They have the power. Nobody is stopping them.  They have the power but whether they wish to exercise it is a matter that is strictly for themselves.</P>
      <P>The general question of impartiality raised by Senator Manning is a very key element of this whole legislation.  This section deals with the programming obligations of the station operators.  It provides that all news shall be reported and presented in an objective and impartial manner and without expression of the contractor's own views.  To cover the point made by Senator Manning it is important that we should have the principles of impartiality and objectivity further elaborated upon rather than just having them down as general principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 (1) (b) relates to the broadcast treatment of current affairs including matters of public controversy and provides that such matters are to be treated in a manner that is fair to all interests concerned.  It also provides that, if the foregoing requirement cannot be met in a single broadcast &ldquo;two or more related broadcasts may be considered as a whole, if the broadcasts are transmitted within a reasonable period of each other&rdquo;.  What we want to see is that it there is a public controversy in a local area, in the construction of a factory or any issue where there could be vested interests involved, both sides of the argument get a fair hearing.  If they do not get it in one programme, the person who feels aggrieved <Col N="1061" /> has the right to get a further programme on the issue to get a balanced point of view across.  That is very important.  If the contractor is not meeting his obligations, the person who feels aggrieved has the right to complain much more so than in RTE.  The contractor is operating on a basis of a contract with the Commission. The Commission can rescind the contract and that is a very important penalty.  I believe there will be impartiality in the independent stations that will set a headline for everybody else in the media world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same point and same question, one of the problems is often that of speed.  Unless a complaint of this sort can be dealt with, heard and adjudicated on fairly quickly, an unfair impression may well be left lingering, or by the time the complaint has been dealt with the matter is no longer of currency and importance.  Nonetheless one party has been damaged so a speedy resolution of these complaints is of the essence.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully welcome the comments made by Senator Manning on the whole area of impartiality.  Indeed I was surprised to hear him say so, but I fully agree with him particularly in relation to RTE who have come under serious scrutiny over the past couple of years.  Perhaps I might cite one example. <i>Today Tonight</i> did a programme on the abolition of the housing grants immediately after the budget last year.  They spent an hour on that programme and not once did they mention the total devastation which these housing grants were causing in estates like Darndale and huge suburbs of Dublin.  That is just one example.  We could offer several others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister had to say about impartiality and the fact that he is satisfied that will be the case.  I want to ask one quick question about party political broadcasts.  Does the Minister <Col N="1062" /> envisage political parties buying time for party political broadcasts, or will they be a matter of course?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be barred from buying time.  You cannot have advertisements for political or for religious purposes on television and radio.  The party political broadcast structure, as we know it in RTE, will be transferred to the independent stations and the same rules on balance and everything else that we know within RTE will apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of consistency of codes of practice and standards between the independent broadcasting Commission and RTE, how does the Minister propose to achieve it? Section 9 (1) (d) says: &ldquo;anything which may reasonably be regarded as offending against good taste or decency, or as being likely to promote, or incite to, crime ...&rdquo; etc.  I presume that is virtually verbatim what is in the broadcasting Act?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister propose to ensure that the interpretation of that is somehow consistent between the Commission for the independent services and the RTE Authority?  Has this question arisen?  They are very much matters of opinion and we could have very different standards being applied.  It applies equally to section 10 with regard to the code of standards governing advertising. How does the Minister propose to ensure that similar codes of standards for advertising are applied by the RTE Authority and the broadcasting Commission? There is no point in writing these things down if there is not some equivalence.  Obviously we do not want people tied down in detail, but does the Minister propose to make any formal arrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be codes of practice and, as well as that, common <Col N="1063" /> sense is the great arbiter in this.  I believe it is in large measure in Ireland, and common sense will prevail in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 (3) deals with the question of advertisement of party political broadcasts, industrial disputes and so on.  One issue that is going to become much more central from now on is that of takeovers, takeovers of one company by another and bids for these companies.  Could a company take advertising time to make its case on radio, in the case of a takeover bid, or is that forbidden under the heading of industrial disputes?  It is something which is probably going to become much more a feature of our commercial life over the next four, five or six years.  Perhaps this is the first time this has been raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the first time it has been raised.  I must say I had not given it any thought at all.  Industrial disputes, meaning strikes as we know them, are not barred.  There is no question of them being debarred from making their point. If, for example, Irish Distillers want to fight it out with their competitors on the air, by way of advertisements, I am sure the independent national station will be delighted to accept them as, I am sure, would RTE.  I do not know whether they are debarred from RTE; I do not imagine they are.</P>

      <P>May I ask why section 10 (3) is necessary?  Why are the broadcast media different from the print media? We do not prohibit people from buying advertising for political or religious purposes in print media.  We do not prevent people from buying full-page advertisements in the newspapers when there are industrial disputes on.  Why is it presumed that the broadcasting media are different?  These are the sort of provisions that get struck into legislation because nobody thinks about them.  Why should the provision be there at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I could give the Senator a long, detailed reply, but because of the time constraints on us, I will refrain from doing so.  For example, take the question of religion.  It would seem quite inappropriate to reduce spiritual values to pure commercial terms.  Furthermore, bearing in mind the numerous sects that exist these days &mdash; many of which have no shortage of funds &mdash; it would seem to be in the public interest to prevent them exploiting the new broadcast media to get their messages across.</P>

    <P>Again, on political questions, it would not seem to be in the public interest or in the interest of democracy, that political ends should be sold across broadcast media.  Provision has been made separately for party political broadcasts in a fair and balanced way and in accordance with codes of practice which the commission may draw up.  Again, the use of paid advertising time to have particular points of view put across relating to industrial relations disputes would not be generally conducive to the fostering of good industrial relations, or to the resolution of industrial disputes particularly in circumstances in which there might be a wide disparity between the resources <Col N="1065" /> available to either side in any such dispute.</P>

      <P>I do not want to keep us here all night but that is not a very satisfactory answer.  We should leave it to the religious orders to decide whether buying advertising is contrary to their religious affiliations or convictions.  We should not decide it.  Politicians in particular are somewhat over-powered by the broadcasting media in the sense that we have got used to the print media.  It is as true of the reluctance with which we allowed ourselves to be broadcast on radio with which many people allowed television cameras into the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In a similar way we seem to believe there is something specifically threatening about the broadcast media that is not true of the print media.  Presumably all these restrictions were thought about in the printing media in the days before the whole idea of a fairly free press was accepted.</P>
      <P>There is a little bit of fear of the media involved in this.  My feeling is that, if there is something inherently threatening to democracy in advertising in relation to religious or political purposes or in relation to industrial disputes, they should be banned everywhere.  People should not be able to use the muscle of money to do these things.  To pick on the broadcast media shows a little bit of an inferiority complex on our part towards those media.</P>

      <P>The Broadcasting Complaints Commission now have a remit to deal with the two television channels and two radio stations.  Subsection (3) says that the Minister may, by regulations direct and so on.  I hope the Minister will <Col N="1067" /> clarify whether the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is there simply to enable him, or whether he intends to do it and do it fairly quickly, because I think he should.  It would be one way of ensuring reasonable parity of interpretations if the Broadcasting Complaints Commission have a remit extending to all these broadcasting services.</P>
      <P>The Minister might remind the Broadcasting Complaints Commisison that it would be an awful lot easier to make complaints if people knew about their existence.  At the best of times they are a rather difficult body to find.  They exist under a post office box number.  I discovered to my amazement at one time, when I was making a complaint, that they actually had an office in the same building as myself.  I was three months into my complaint, writing letters to them, which went out of the building, went half way around Dublin and came back to the same building before I discovered that. They do not have a telephone number. They do not have an identifiable person one can contact.  They are a rather peculiar body.  If you actually succeed in making contact with them which involves a fair amount of determination anyway, the guidance they offer you about making a complaint would be sufficient to put off anyone other than the most determined. In fact, one of the tasks I have set myself over the summer is to provide a two-page layman's guide on how to make a complaint to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  The Broadcasting Complaints Commission appear to be singularly reluctant to do it themselves. Given that they have not any legal obligations or accountability I should have thought they could have simplified the whole matter a good deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental question is: how does the Minister propose to ensure that the Broadcasting Complaints Commission have the resources to deal, first, with the volume of complaints and, second, with the perhaps specific and local nature of many complaints that may be made about <Col N="1068" /> the multiplicity of local stations that may well obtain under the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The systems provided for under the provisions of this Bill will be more effective than anything we have had in the past.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is inserted deliberately.  I believe the relationship between members of the general public, the listening audience of these independent stations, will be a very intimate one <i>vis-a-vis</i> the relevant companies because they will be immediately accessible.  If a complaint is to be logged it can be logged immediately.  It then goes to the Commission.  Because of the contractor-principal relationship between the Commission and the contractor, the Commission will be able to put far greater pressure on a contractor &mdash; being the broadcaster &mdash; to respond effectively and speedily to a complaint than will ever happen in the case of RTE, a much larger organisation.  Because it is the Commission who actually hand out the licences to contractors I believe it will be a very effective way of lodging a complaint.  If it does not work &mdash; although I believe it will work much more effectively &mdash; we can bring in the Commission. I can assure the Senator that the necessary resources will be made available to the Commission.</P>

      <P>I have a funny feeling that there is an agreement here to rush this Bill through in a hurry.  I am not trying to be in the least disruptive.  The Minister is somewhat optimistic about that fact that, because something is local, it will be responsible and will be something close to a local monopoly.  Those of us living in Cork, having watched the operations of the local monopoly who produce local television, and their apparent capacity to ride roughshod over people's feelings in recent months, would not be that optimistic that simple local protests will interfere with something like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> The Minister's Department could have a word in the ear of the people who provide cable television in Cork about the way they deal with their customers. They do not exactly respond with sensitivity and immediacy to the complaints of their customers; quite the opposite in fact.  I am quite happy that the Minister is prepared to allow the Broadcasting Complaints Commission to investigate complaints and to provide them with the necessary resources.  Since they are actually there to serve the public the Minister might remind them of their responsibilities. They would do well to avoid hiding from the public.</P>

      <P>I do not like section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, its provisions had the logic of being confined to State-owned broadcasting services. We now have a directive issued by a Government which will be extended not just to a national television or radio channel but to every single broadcast medium.  The Minister, in the imaginative way he has drawn up this legislation, envisages a large number of different kinds of radio stations at different levels. It appears that this will extend even to the institutional contractors about whom he spoke in a hospital or other such institution. Directives under section 31 will apply to all of those.  It is a very serious precedent, that something that was envisaged, first, to deal with a State-owned national broadcasting service, is now being extended to everybody who is involved in broadcasting, much of which <Col N="1070" /> will be privately-owned, privately-funded, run by advertising in which the State, as the Minister said when he was introducing this legislation some months ago, will have only a very light regulatory hand.  It will not be a day-to-day State monopoly; it will be a commercial operation. Effectively we are now extending the provisions of section 31 &mdash; which in my view are offensive in the way they operate at present &mdash; into a huge area of broadcasting activity.  I find that inherently unacceptable.  The same principles should apply as apply elsewhere.  No radio station should be allowed to incite people to commit crime, to encourage people to commit crime, similar provisions to those contained in section 9 (1) (d) in relation to anything or any activity likely to undermine the authority of the State.</P>
      <P>In my view the section 31 mentality has as much to do with attempting to maintain control over the media as it has to do with its ostensible objectives.  I find section 12 objectionable.  It is a wrong concept.  The censorship mentality behind it is wrong.  The idea of extending the provisions of section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, and the way they are now operating to every contractor who will receive a licence for sound broadcasting or for a television channel is completely wrong and unacceptable. I am opposed to section 12.</P>

      <P>I speak as somebody who philosophically supports section 31. I do not like it; I regret the inhibitions it places but I believe &mdash; and I will say it in one sentence &mdash; that the State has a right to defend itself against those who would attempt to subvert it.  Having said that, I can see enormous difficulties in its practical application in day-to-day broadcasting because the emphasis will be so much more on the local element.  Sinn Féin councillors, known members of Sinn Féin, who will have a strong local profile, will be concerned with local issues.  I presume the assumption is that these people, <Col N="1071" /> if they are known to be members of Sinn Féin or elected officials of Sinn Féin, will not be able to take part in programmes. I can see this causing genuine problems on the ground.  However, having said that I will support this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We all have our views about section 31.  In the circumstances in which we live, section 31 is in existence. It would be totally illogical to have RTE operating under one set of rules, and others on the air-waves under a different set of rules.  Therefore, it is totally consistent to have section 12 here, as we had section 31.  We could not have RTE operating in one way and the independent stations operating in another different way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that if and when the Irish direct broadcasting satellite is launched it will be the Government's intention also to extend the provisions of section 31 to programmes transmitted from that, because that would be the logical conclusion?  If that is the case, why not extend this logic and debar the newspapers from doing it as well?  There is not that much difference between the newspapers and privately-owned, commercial broadcasting stations. The argument used to be that RTE were a State body, and therefore there was a particular reason why a State body should be debarred from doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One hopes that, by and large, local stations will devote their activities to local issues and concerns.  What happens if a local expert on gardening happens to be a member of Sinn Féin?  A local station would be able to talk to that person about gardening and nothing else, because that is the apparent interpretation of the directive under section 31.  It is quite ludicrous and sinister.  To talk about section 31 and the way it operates in defence of the State is making a mountain out of a molehill.  I regard it as perfectly acceptable that no broadcasting service should <Col N="1072" /> conduct interviews with members of the Provisional IRA or related bodies.  It might even be reasonable to suggest that people who are official spokesmen for Sinn Féin should not be interviewed.  I do not find that acceptable.  If Sinn Féin are a subversive organisation they should be banned; if they are a legitimate political party, they should not.  The Supreme Court, in its judgment on section 31 and the way it has operated, invited the State to ban Sinn Féin on the grounds that they were an organisation dedicated to the over-throwing of the State.</P>
    <P>What I resent most is the ambivalance that goes through all of this.  If Sinn Féin are a subversive organisation, they should be banned under the Offences Against the State Act.  If not, they should be allowed to participate in the activities of the State and should not be put in this never-never land.  My own feeling has been and continues to be that that is the best way to deal with them.  I believe in the power of ideas.  I believe in the power of argument.  I believe in the ultimate triumph of good argument over bad argument and of truth over falsehood.  I do not believe that people who set out to break the law, and who break the law, should be given access to the media or the air-waves.  The best way to deal with people who have extreme points of view is to believe in democracy and to deal with them in that way.  I cannot see any reason either for section 31 or its extension into this section.</P>

It would be illogical not to have the same rules applicable to them as apply to the national station.</P>

    <P>The important word there is &ldquo;culpably&rdquo;.

It may well have resulted in manipulation <Col N="1074" /> in a certain way.  If that happens, I do not believe the State should be obliged, or in this case the public should be obliged, to bear the cost.

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - FÁS Training Course Allowances.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my third week in <Col N="1075" /> a row on the Adjourment Matter.  I have probably been pushing my luck.  I thank you for allowing me to raise this question of the reduction in allowances for trainees on courses for which the Minister for Labour has responsibility.  I am referring in particular to courses under the general aegis of FÁS at this stage &mdash; they would have been under the aegis of AnCO in a previous world &mdash; and to people under the aegis of CERT.</P>
      <P>The allowances were cut by figures which varied from about £10 a week for 15 to 16 year-olds to £3.30 a week for 25 to 66 year-olds.  Social welfare rates vary and allowance rates vary, but the fundamental principle that allowances have been cut, and cut in a way which bears heaviest on younger people, is without dispute.  It is bad enough that any allowance should be cut because no allowances payable in our society are all that generous.  The allowances prior to these slashing cuts were, to say the least, minuscule. They did not provide people with anything like an income.  In the case of people over 18 they did not provide, even in their pre-cut condition, any real encouragement to people to do these courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cutbacks must be seen in the context of the report of the Youth Forum of the European Commission in their policy document <i>A European Perspective on Vocational Training</i> which called on member states to pay an allowance to trainees sufficient to allow them to feed, clothe and house themselves and to enjoy some leisure activities.  That was the perspective of the Community of which we claim, when it suits us, to be a committed and dedicated member.  We have left people with the sort of sum of money which will guarantee that, if they are to feed themselves they will not clothe themselves, if they are to clothe themselves they will not be able to feed themselves, and if they choose to feed and clothe themselves, they will not be able to house themselves.  One thing I can <Col N="1076" /> guarantee the Minister is that the trainees will not be able to feed, clothe and house themselves.</P>
    <P>I do not want to attribute this personally to the Minister.  The Minister is a friend of mine.  Therefore, I will not get involved in any sort of personal abuse. The Government's perspective, which the Minister must loyally defend, on somebody coming from probably a deprived background and a less than adequate educational background, someone we are hoping to entice into a new vision, under the whole glorious title of the social guarantee, of doing something useful is to provide such a person with that sort of income.  The younger have the choice of either starving or accepting whatever is handed out to them because they do not qualify for social welfare.  For the 18 year-olds and over we are simply saying: &ldquo;You have no choice.  Therefore, you take it or you leave it.&rdquo;  The cutbacks effectively have eliminated any positive incentive for the unemployed to gain a foothold in the labour market by undertaking training.  It is reasonable to say that, instead of the allowances being an incentive to undertake training, they are actually a disincentive and a barrier.</P>
    <P>One ought to look in particular at the allowances for adults.  Even though the training allowance is, in theory, equivalent to the unemployment assistance payment, it is not because extra deductions are made from it.  FÁS make some deductions from these meagre allowances. They can be made, for instance, in respect of absences and late attendances. When you have the misfortune to be signing on the dole you have to sign on once a week but, effectively, when you are on one of these training schemes which are meant to be helping you, you are effectively signing on perhaps twice a day and you may be penalised in respect of any absences.  In addition, if FÁS choose to believe that somebody is absent without good cause and arrange to have money deducted from the person, there is no independent appeals procedure, whereas <Col N="1077" /> if somebody signing on the dole has money deducted, there is, ostensibly at least, an independent appeals procedure. The perception is not so, but there is a formalised appeals procedure.</P>
    <P>That does not create the climate in which these training schemes become more attractive.  Unlike the social welfare system, a FÁS trainee has no right of complaint to the Ombudsman.  The Minister will recall that he rejected allowing the Ombudsman the power to investigate complaints about FÁS during the debate in the Seanad in July 1987.</P>
    <P>Deductions can be made for meals given to trainees in excess of the value of £3 per week.  Trainees have to attend AnCO centres at 8.30 a.m.  On dark winter mornings many need to use public transport to arrive.  Where travel allowances are paid, they are often inadequate. I have seen figures which suggest that somebody from Enniskerry in County Wicklow who has to travel to the city centre to a training scheme will be out of pocket, after the travel allowances are paid, to the tune of almost £2 a week. There is a certain unreality about figures like £1 or £2 a week in a place like this, which is a bit like the great Lord Lane in the Court of Appeal in London wondering about the Birmingham Six wondering about a couple of pounds.  To the Minister and myself £1 or £2 may not be an enormous sum.  To somebody on £35 a week the absence of £1 or £2 a week is the difference between one meal in the week being there or not being there.</P>
    <P>In addition to the cash benefits people lose, they are not eligible for many of the additional benefits that go with unemployment assistance.  They are not paid a Christmas bonus.  They are excluded from the national fuel scheme and they lose eligibility to EC social assistance butter vouchers.  They can also lose help under supplementary welfare with ESB bills, etc.</P>
    <P>It would be easy for the Minister to tell me that these are somebody else's problems, but he is a member of the <Col N="1078" /> Government.  He has collective responsibility and, if decisions are taken about areas within his jurisdiction, it is his responsibility to know the impact of those decisions on those people for whom he has the responsibility.  In addition, he has a responsibility to know what other benefits available to trainees from other Departments are being removed.</P>
    <P>I would like to talk about the cuts in allowances as they affect the under 18 year-olds.  In column 2311, Volume 368 of the Official Report of 3 July 1986 the Minister present, then Opposition spokesman, asked the then Minister:</P>
    <P>Would the Minister agree that people between the ages of 15 and 18 years who are on these courses are normally from deprived backgrounds and are encouraged by community leaders and others to avail of these courses?  They are the last people who should be affected by these cuts and whoever was responsible for making this suggestion should be brought to account.</P>
    <P>That last suggestion is one I should like to endorse &mdash; whoever was responsible for making this suggestion and, indeed, whoever was responsible for accepting that it should be implemented, ought to be brought to account.</P>
    <P>The Association for Community-based Training and Educational Development, of whom I am sure the Minister is aware, made a considerable and convincing case about the damage these cuts will do.  The reduced rates will clearly act as a disincentive to young trainees and will lessen their motivation to participate in training courses to their fullest capacity.  The low training rates will possibly encourage young people to participate in the black economy.  The reductions will clearly affect family income in the most deprived and disadvantaged areas and, while it is true that the vast majority of young people in any area are law abiding, there is no doubt that reductions in income will <Col N="1079" /> encourage some young people to participate in anti-social or criminal activities.</P>
    <P>The less obvious consequence of such cutbacks is to undermine any development in personal responsibility, because a young person with that limited source of income will not be in a position to make any reasonable contribution to the family income or else will not be able to retain a reasonable proportion of personal disposable income.  The really painful part of this is that what has been adjudicated to be realpolitick is that, since 16 to 18 year-olds who are not in school, or in general have no access to State support, effectively one can offer them what one likes because it will be more than what they had previously.  One can judge what is an acceptable level of support for a person in two ways.  It can be judged on the basis of the minimum needed to provide for their basic needs which is the humane, compassionate Christian democratic way to do it, or we can say we will give them the minimum we can get away with and that will be the most we wish to pay and it can be reduced.</P>
    <P>If people have no access to income the income that society chooses to give them can be determined by different criteria.  I would have thought the humane criteria were what would give people a minimum standard of living.  By a minimum standard of living, I mean one that is vastly lower than, say, you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, the Minister and I are used to.  We are not talking about anything like the standard of living we are accustomed to. We are talking about something that is light years away from the standard of living we take for granted.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency have made clear a very deep concern about the implications of these cutbacks.  They said these cuts would hit young people in great need and pointed out that, relating these allowances to social welfare levels, in many ways flies in the face of the spirit <Col N="1080" /> of the Commission on Social Welfare report which clearly accepted that levels of social welfare payments were grossly inadequate.  To begin to develop a base line of income support based on incomes which are identified as being utterly inadequate is not even a matter of equalisation. It is a matter of regression backwards.  Therefore, instead of beginning to raise the levels of income support which have been identified as being inadequate we are choosing to reduce the levels of income support which are somewhat in excess of the inadequate base levels.</P>
    <P>So much could be said on this issue that I do not know if I want to elaborate on it all.  I have volumes of stuff in front of me and I am only telling it to the Minister who knows most of it already.  I want to make the point that these cuts are not unconnected with Jobsearch because, for most people who have been unemployed for any longish period, the threat of Jobsearch &mdash; and I use the word &ldquo;threat&rdquo; deliberately &mdash; hangs over them more or less permanently.  They know that, irrespective of the hardship that may be caused, to refuse a Jobsearch offer means the end of unemployment assistance.  They may know that to accept a Jobsearch offer means moving from one degree of poverty into a worse degree of poverty but, to decline a Jobsearch offer, means moving from a degree of poverty into absolute destitution.  Since virtually the entire media plus most of the political parties refuse to accept all of the evidence that has been assembled to show that Jobsearch has done nothing other than make much of the unemployment worse than it already was, and since unsubstantiated &mdash; that is without the methodology or the specific facts made available &mdash; assertions by the Minister for Social Welfare have become dogma on this issue, it is almost impossible to get this through to Irish public opinion.</P>
    <P>There are very different views about Jobsearch.  In another place I have already <Col N="1081" /> indicated the depths of hostility in all of the centres of the unemployed around the country to Jobsearch.  The Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice have documented in fairly comprehensive fashion the perceptions of Jobsearch and, indeed, the misuse of statistics to justify Jobsearch. In each case, those quite clear challenges to the established view have gone unheard and the unsubstantiated assertions by the Government have been taken as fact.  I see a direct connection between the capacity to threaten and the capacity to lower allowances.  The one thing said to me consistently about Jobsearch was that it was the same as the old AnCO or FÁS course except that it was now mandatory.  If we can threaten to take away £40 a week from a person, it is easy to force him to work for £37 a week.</P>
    <P>Hidden in the middle of this, apart from the obvious penalty on young deprived people, is an implied discrimination against women.  Any woman who has a child will quite happily be available for work while she can afford to pay a child minder and is, therefore, clearly both actively seeking employment and available for work and, therefore, entitled to unemployment assistance.  She cannot go out of the home to do what is effectively a mandatory Jobsearch job at £37.80 per week because on £37.80 a week she could not afford to pay somebody to look after her child.  There is effectively a systematic exclusion of women with children from the register of unemployment assistance, not because they are not available for work because they are, not because they are not actively seeking employment because they are, but because we will not pay them enough on a training scheme which takes them out of the home to support a child or their children.  That is gross discrimination and is contrary to the spirit of both the employment equality legislation and much of what the Minister has said on many occasions in recent times about equality between the sexes.</P>

      <P>The Senator will not need even one minute because the Senator is about to conclude anyway.  I think the Minister has a case to answer. I have tried not to be emotional about it. I have tried simply to ask him to explain to this House what, other than the overall alleged exigencies of national finances, have justified these cutbacks.  I would like him to explain how the Government's alleged number one objective &mdash; which was to protect the most under-privileged and the most deprived, from the effects of these cutbacks &mdash; can be reconciled with taking £10 a week off a kid from a poor background whose only opportunity to make progress would have been these training schemes but now it is hardly worth his while to do them because of the costs involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I acknowledge Senator Ryan's interest in the FÁS schemes and the programmes generally, the conditions for young people and other schemes for unemployed people.  The Senator has asked me some valid questions.  I am very glad of the opportunity to put on the record of this House some of the background to this issue which is now practically a year old and there have been a number of developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, it is my policy that training allowances be set at a level not less than an individual's entitlement to social welfare at the time of commencement of his or her training.  Where trainees are entitled to unemployment benefit at the time of recruitment to training, entitlement to training allowance equivalent to this level is maintained for the duration of the course regardless of whether their entitlement would otherwise have expired during the duration of the training course.  I share the Senator's concern in this matter.  It was out of this concern that I took action to harmonise and rationalise <Col N="1083" /> the different levels of allowances on the various programmes and schemes.  I was conscious of criticism, especially from the educational sector, about the high level of allowances being paid on Manpower programmes which could attract young people out of the school system.  I was also determined to maintain the level of throughputs on programmes, and when faced with the option of reducing allowances or cutting numbers I opted to reduce allowances.  Because of the limited Exchequer resources, I am continuously faced with this choice of increased participation or increased allowances.</P>
    <P>Secondly, a very important point which the Senator did not mention has to be taken into account.  The former Minister of State at the Department took the initiative in relation to young people in both education and training and the level of allowances and he formed a social guarantee board during his term of office. Included in the terms of reference was a provision to advise the Youth Employment Agency on the level of allowances for participants in youth training programmes. A sub-committee of this board examined the matter and the recommendations included a link to social welfare unemployment assistance rates for over 18 year olds, age related uniform rates for those between the ages of 16 and 18, travel and meal allowances to be paid at the time at current AnCO rates and no change in allowances paid for programmes operated in the education system.  It was advocated that a uniform and consistent approach be taken in regard to any changes in the level of allowances on individual programmes.</P>
    <P>The board were representative of AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency, the National Manpower Service, CERT, education interests, the National Youth Council of Ireland, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers.</P>
    <P>For young people in the labour market <Col N="1084" /> who are unemployed I believe the level of allowances paid should be such as to make participation in programmes more attractive than continued unemployment and persons entering training should not be penalised through loss of welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The issue of allowances needs to be seen in the wider context of resources available and the quality of the training. Trainees benefit from training in the form of increased employability and earning potential.  For this reason it should not be necessary to provide financial inducements to undertake training over and above the general levels of welfare benefits. I am conscious of the fact that some young people are the most disadvantaged in terms of their lack of qualifications and lack of skills and often because of their family circumstances with the adult members of the family also unemployed. These people are in the most need of attention and training.  For many of these young people the choice often is between unemployment or unskilled, unstable, often casual, poorly paid employment. Training can provide them with vocational skills, work experience and a stepping stone into the world of work.  It can also provide them with social and life skills in being part of and contributing to their community's welfare.  It helps them to feel wanted and useful, and that is a fact of life.</P>
    <P>There is a clear link between educational qualifications and employment experience.  All surveys show that the higher the level of education the lower the unemployment rate.  I do not want people being attracted out of the education system by higher allowances &mdash; it is a fact that that is so &mdash; to go on six month training courses and then become unemployed.  It is a ludicrous position which I have spoken about many times. It would be better to encourage these young people to stay in the educational system.  At several recent meetings with <Col N="1085" /> the bodies who are involved in the training workshops, the vocational educational committees, and the trade unions representing the vocational educational committees, I have stressed that point.  The social guarantee, as currently structured, provides unqualified school leavers with a six month period of training and work experience.  I do not believe that programmes of such limited duration without sufficient linkages or progressions to other forms of development programmes are adequate to meet the needs of these young people.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education, and I are developing proposals to provide a package of integrated measures of, we hope, up to two years' duration to facilitate the transition from school to working life and to provide young people involved in social guarantee programmes with opportunities for further progression to training for specific skills.  The establishment of FÁS is a major step towards the integration of programmes. In 1988 FAS aim to achieve a throughput of over 69,000 on training courses and schemes.  At my request, FÁS have begun a far-reaching review of the scope for rationalising the existing range of employment and training programmes. This will help provide a more responsive service to individual clients, ensure that the appropriate target group are attracted to each programme and present a more simplified service to the public.</P>
    <P>To summarise, there are two strands to our policy and allowances.  The first is for people under the age of 18 to provide allowances which will encourage them to take training rather than continued unemployment as an option, but at the same time ensuring that the level of allowances does not attract young people out of full time education at too early an age.  The second is for older workers to ensure that they do not lose out relative to their welfare entitlements by undertaking a Manpower programme.  This is ensured by paying them as a minimum a sum equal to their previous benefits; in <Col N="1086" /> addition, travel and meal allowances are often paid.  Finally, where it is drawn to my attention that individual trainees lose occasional social welfare payments, such as the Christmas bonus for which there is no formal provision within our training programmes, I have ensured that the equivalent payments are made.</P>
    <P>Of the people who are genuinely interested in this matter I know Senator Ryan would be one of the first in the Houses of the Oireachtas or anywhere else to try to beat the trap for the young people whose prospects are gloomy.  In the new two-year scheme which we hope to get up and running late this year or early next year we hope to provide a link to the educational system.  As I said in the other House there was direct evidence that in areas where some training workshops operated, including parts of my own constituency and other areas I am familiar with, there was almost a canvass to take people out of the education system to provide them with short-term courses which did them immense damage for their long-term future.  That is a system that I abhor, and within the financial constraints we have to live in I think the system we will bring forward will be far better, far more attractive and useful to young people.  If resources were unlimited needless to say we would be paying far more allowances for everything as the Senator said.  Unfortunately that is not what pertains.  Within the resources I think the changes we are making will help those people who opted out of the education system younger than we would wish.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Senator for raising the issue and allowing me to put my position in the Seanad.  Thank you, Sir, for the time.</P>

      <P>This would all be fine if it were not for the fact that the VPTS payments have been abolished.  Children are being paid £30 a week to go to the vocational preparation and training schemes in schools.  The schools, by and <Col N="1087" /> large, are staffed by members of my own union which, I note, is not represented on this advisory body.  They made these recommendations and choose to ignore or not be interested in the income maintenance side of these allowances.  I notice that the Teachers' Union of Ireland, which teaches in the schools where most of the deprived children of this country are, are not members of that body.  I also note that the schemes which they provide, which are the VPTS, are no longer funded by the Department of Education. An enormous amount of what the Minister is talking about is quite ludicrous nonsense.  The truth is that children who were doing courses which were useful to them in vocational schools will not go anymore.  They will leave the educational system because the Government have abolished payments completely.  The nice, benevolent philosophy that is underlined is that these children are the victims of cutbacks.  There was a judgment made that they could afford to be sacrificed.  They did not have the clout, <Col N="1088" /> and that is what was done.  All the dressing up in terms of philosophical decisions is a load of nonsense.  They are victims of the cutbacks.  They will suffer and in the long term we will suffer from it.</P>

      <P>On a final line, because the vocational education committees and the TUI are very much involved in these schemes in the inner city, I have attended the presentation of the certificates and have spoken to the individuals concerned. The people the Senator is saying were not on this committee are saying to me that over recent years this planned, crazy action of having training schemes for six months and pulling the children out of the educational system without any checkback was detrimental to their whole future.  I am glad and I hope that in the short-term there is a chance of stopping this scourge on young children in recent years.</P>
