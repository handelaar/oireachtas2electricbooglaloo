      <P>I have notice from Senator Gerry Reynolds that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need to establish a wood pulp factory in County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jack Daly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The proposed selling off of IDA land banks by direction of the Government.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Reynolds and Daly as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Reynolds' motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Daly may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to ask the Deputy Leader of the House about the current state of the promised Adoption (No. 2) <Col N="98" /> Bill.  We are still waiting.  We would like to get some indication as to when this will be taken.  Have arrangements been made for the taking of the Social Welfare Bill? What are those arrangements?  On the question of the promised discussion on Northern Ireland, what has the Leader of the House in mind on that?</P>

      <P>On Item No. 10, the one referred to by Senator Manning that Seanad Éireann takes note of recent events affecting Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations &mdash; we had an agreement some weeks back to take that for discussion.  All parties agreed that it should be discussed.  In the meantime we have seen a grave deterioration in the situation affecting the whole area of Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations.  Discussion has never been more urgent than at present and I ask the Deputy Leader of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if he could indicate the reason this item has now gone further down the Order Paper.  When is it envisaged that we will discuss this item of grave importance?  I also asked the Leader of the House, at our last get-together about the Adoption (No. 2) Bill. It is grossly unfair that we have to stand up here week after week asking questions about the Adoption (No. 2) Bill.  I am putting it to the Cathaoirleach that we are entitled to a straight answer.  If the Government are having genuine difficulties of a constitutional nature we should be told so, and we should not have to ask the same questions week in, week out.  There are families and children suffering while waiting for this Bill to be implemented.  I would like an answer which would clarify the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to that appeal.  We have all, on this side of the House, sought some information about the Adoption (No. 2) Bill. I would like to remind the Opposition <Col N="99" /> that my party brought out a very good and appropriate Bill to amend the adoption law and enable the adoption of illegitimate children to take place.  The Government saw fit to have this voted down and did not accept it.  It is absolutely reprehensible that we are waiting so long to have this legislation introduced.  I agree with the last speaker.  We should be told why.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I agree with the previous speakers on the Adoption (No. 2) Bill.  Can I give notice to the Government that, on the next sitting day, I will propose that the Adoption (No. 2) Bill should be taken as the first item on the agenda?  I will call a vote on it, if necessary.  I can do nothing more to register my dissatisfaction.  I know of the dissatisfaction of many Members on the Government side with the Government's unsatisfactory record on this issue.</P>
      <P>In regard to Item No. 3, could the Leader of the House clarify whether it is proposed to begin Item No. 3 at 6.30 p.m. and go on for two hours and five minutes, or is it proposed to begin earlier and finish at 8 o'clock?  Secondly, on Item No. 60, members of my group have asked that this motion, which is an attempt to annual a directive under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act should be discussed. Could I ask the Deputy Leader of the House if he would be prepared to give time to have this matter discussed in view of the appalling victimisation of a journalist by RTE this week?  It badly needs to be discussed.</P>

      <P>I should like to disagree with what Senator Ryan has said.  I do not want Item No. 60 taken.  Item No. 60 refers to the Broadcasting Act.  In the Light of what happened on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; it would be highly inappropriate to try to repeal the Broadcasting Act and section 31.</P>

      <P>I should like to support what Senator O'Toole said about Item No. 10, which is the Anglo-Irish debate.  It has been put off twice already when there was an agreement between the Whips that it should be held.  It was put off two weeks ago because of the B &amp; I Bill. It appears to have been put off on the promise that it would be discussed for a second time now.  I wonder what has to happen in Northern Ireland or in the Republic for the Seanad to discuss Anglo-Irish affairs?  What has to happen for it to be a matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business appears to be in something of a mess, not just because of the Anglo-Irish debate which I have referred to but because, as Senator Manning and Senator O'Toole have said, the Adoption (No. 2) Bill &mdash; for which we have not been given a reason &mdash; has not been taken, and the Companies (No. 2) Bill has not been taken. A few weeks ago we had no legislation and we were almost stuck for business. Now, we have two major substantive Bills which, apparently, we cannot discuss. I would like to know when they are going to be discussed and why they have not been discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the Senators who have raised a question on the Adoption Bill (No. 2) 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="101" /> As has already been mentioned, this Bill was brought forward because there was, in fact, another Bill proposed and we had the Second Stage debate on it a very considerable time ago.  It is unusual in this House to have such a delay in taking Committee Stage, particularly when the Bill is urgent and when the matter is one that must be dealt with as a matter of urgent family law.  This House is owed an explanation as to why there has been such a delay.  I would like to serve notice, as Senator Brendan Ryan has done, that this is a matter which should be ordered by this House because there has been no explanation of the delay.  We should vote to take Committee Stage, if necessary against the order which is proposed by the Leader of the House.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I wish to raise, namely, the proposal that this House would discuss issues relating to Northern Ireland.  I supported that proposal on the Order of Business when it was put forward and I understood we would have a debate on it.  I do not share the view of those who feel that matters are too sensitive or difficult.  It is important that we would debate Northern Ireland at an early date and I should like to have it, perhaps, on Tuesday of next week.  There is no reason this House should not sit on Tuesday next in order to have a debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The third point I wish to make is on a matter that has been raised by other Senators and on which there has been some disagreement that is, Item No. 60 in the names of a number of Independent Senators including my own name.  It states:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann hereby annuls the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 (Section 31) (No. 2) Order, 1987 (S.I. No. 337 of 1987).</P>
    <P>The reason I feel there is an urgency about that matter is that the annulment must be within a defined number of sitting days.  It has been a tradition in this House that time is provided well within that period of sitting days.  Therefore, when there is a motion which could have an <Col N="102" /> effect &mdash; it could have the effect of annulling the order &mdash; this House has traditionally provided time.  It is important that time be provided at an early stage for a debate on Item No. 60.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>On Item No. 60, I support the call that this motion be brought forward and debated, if only to reaffirm that section 31 should be observed.  We had recently a breach of section 31 deliberately. We have, less deliberately, had a breach of section 31 each Sunday night since Christmas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Item No. 10 refers to recent events involving Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations.  With reference to what Senator O'Toole has said, I think these recent events are so terrible that it is very doubtful that this is the proper time to insist that Item No. 10 should be taken.  Rather, indeed, it should be a matter for Seanad Éireann to express its anguished concern about these events and to encourage both Governments to realise the seriousness of the situation.  This is not the exact time for a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the other Senators who have spoken in favour of a debate on the situation in Northern Ireland.  I have consistently <Col N="103" /> done so.  I believe, as I think many people in the country do, that the democratic institutions of the State must be given the opportunity to discuss these issues. Otherwise the initiative goes back to the men of violence.  I would like also to support the proposal to take Item No. 60.  I will not rehearse the arguments. They have been very ably made by my colleague Senator Mary Robinson, and by others.</P>
      <P>I would like finally to say with regard to Item No. 7 &mdash; the Adoption (No. 2) Bill 1987 that it must be taken.  We are now at the point where we are just about to break up for the Easter Recess.  I would like formally to propose that the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1987, be taken on the Order of Business as the first item today, because I take a very serious view of the Government's shilly-shallying in this matter.  I would appeal right across the party lines that, when I call for a vote, as I shall do, members of all parties will support this Bill because there are families waiting for the progress of this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not often find myself sharing sentiments expressed by Senator Murphy, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland.  I have to say, however, that there have been several arguments on the other side of the House in favour of a debate on Northern Ireland.  I share Senator Murphy's opinion and the reasons for his opinion.  It is a time for all responsible politicians in this island, particularly in the southern part of the country, to support the Government in their attempts to diffuse the situation. Unless Senators in this House on all sides have some specific solutions to offer to the appalling tragedy of Northern Ireland, I believe that it would be most inopportune in the present climate to <Col N="104" /> have a debate that could only exacerbate the situation in the North.</P>
      <P>On Item No. 60, as a member of the National Union of Journalists and, indeed, specifically the broadcasting branch of RTE, I, too, express my regret at the decision of the RTE authority to dismiss&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Adoption (No. 2) Bill has been mentioned here quite a lot today.  I agree with everything that has been said about the delay so far as this Bill is concerned.  I have gone faithfully every day after leaving this House to the Department of Health to find out when we were getting this Bill.  I have been told up to now that they had some constitutional difficulties with the Bill and that it had to be referred to the Attorney General.  Up to a week ago it had not come back from the Attorney General. The only guarantee I can give today is that the Bill will be taken on the first sitting day after Easter.  Whether that will satisfy Members I do not know.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill was also mentioned. We are taking the Social Welfare Bill on Friday of this week.  If it is not concluded on Friday we will meet again on Tuesday to complete the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean the Friday of this week.  That is not Good Friday. Regarding the motion relating to Anglo-Irish affairs, a few speakers have said as I would also say, that now is not the time <Col N="105" /> to speak in this House on that motion because the Anglo-Irish Agreement is being discussed at much higher levels. We would prefer to leave it to those people at present.</P>
      <P>Tomorrow we will be taking a Bill which has not yet been passed in the Dáil, the Agricultural Credit Bill.  It is being passed in the Dáil today.  We will be taking that Bill tomorrow because it is a money Bill, and they want it passed rather urgently.</P>
      <P>A few people asked why we are not taking item No. 60.  It is not our fault. That motion was put down in the names of Senators Brendan Ryan, Joe O'Toole, Mary Robinson and John A. Murphy. they are free to take that motion any time they have a Private Members' motion. For instance, the motions for this week and last week were their motions.  This motion was put down about two weeks ago.  They are taking today's motion before it.  It is not our business to take item No. 60.  It is their business to select which item to take in their time.  I am sure there will be no objection to that.  I think I have answered all the questions.</P>

It has not been left to the selection of a particular group in Private Members' <Col N="106" /> time, because it affects Government business. It is a decisive matter for this House.

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following regulations in draft &mdash;</P>
      <P>Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1988</P>
      <P>a copy of which regulations in draft was laid before the House on 16th March, 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, Senators, it is an honour to address this House on this motion relating to health contributions &mdash; the Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsections (2) and (3) of section 9 of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, provide that the Minister for Health may vary the income ceiling which determines the amount payable by an individual, in a particular contribution year.  Subsection (5) of section 9 of the Act requires that a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before both Houses of the <Col N="107" /> Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution has been passed, by each House, approving of the draft regulations.  The draft regulations now before this House shall apply in relation to the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1988.</P>
    <P>The income ceiling is at present £15,000, and it is proposed to increase this to £15,500.  This £15,000 at 1.25 per cent gives a total contribution at the maximum level now of £187.50 per year. The proposed increase to £15,500 at the rate of 1.25 per cent will bring in £193.75 at the maximum.  This is a very modest increase of £6.25 per year.  The following categories are totally exempt under the Health Contributions Act, 1979: medical card holders, widows contributory pensioners, widows non-contributory pensioners, deserted wife's benefit, deserted wife's allowance, death benefit under the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966 and social assistance allowance under the Social Welfare Act, 1973, section 8.</P>
    <P>In determining the proposed increase in the income ceiling I have taken into account &mdash; as required by the Act &mdash; the most recent information available regarding the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries since the last income ceiling was adopted.  The latest recorded information on average weekly earnings in those industries relates to June 1987 when the average figure was £196.76, which was an increase of 5.2 per cent on the June 1986 figure of £186.92.</P>
    <P>When this percentage increase is applied to the current £15,000 ceiling a new ceiling of £15,780 emerges. However, it is proposed to set the new ceiling at £15,500, which is more in line with the 3.2 per cent increase in the Consumer Price Index to mid-August, 1987. The effect of this increase in the ceiling is to increase the maximum amount of health contributions payable by persons with incomes in excess of £15,000 per annum, who will pay only an additional £6.25.  Persons with incomes of £15,000, <Col N="108" /> or less, will not be affected by this increase.</P>
    <P>The proposed increase in the income ceiling will bring in about an additional £1 million in the contribution year 1988-89. Of this, about £250,000 whould arise in the financial year 1988.  The balance of the additional yield, about £750,000, will come in the first quarter of 1989.  Bearing in mind the overall cost of the health services &mdash; £1,300 million &mdash; this is a very modest increase.  This levy contribution brings in £110 million in a full year.  This increase, as I have stated, will bring in £1 million extra in a full contribution year.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the collection of current health contributions from all sectors.  The health boards remain responsible for the collection of arrears due from farmers for periods up to 6 April 1984.  The total amount owed by farmers to health boards at 31 December 1987 was about £5.7 million. While the amount which is still outstanding is a cause for concern, there has been an encouraging response to the efforts of the health boards to recover these arrears.  A total of £1.4 million was collected in 1985, £1.1 million in 1986 and a further £426,000 in 1987.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that health boards can retain these arrears, including any arrears collected in future years, as additional revenue to be applied to local health services needs and most of the health boards have now initiated legal proceedings to recover arrears.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Health (Hospital In-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1984, came into effect on 1 June 1984.  These regulations allowed for an admission charge of £100 &mdash; which sum was subsequently increased to £150 on 1 July 1986 &mdash; to be levied on persons admitted for hospital in-patient treatment in a public hospital who are in arrears with health contributions.  This has proved to be quite an effective measure in inducing defaulters to pay their health contributions. However, I should mention that persons in arrears are not refused admission to hospitals, but the collection of the admission charge and the arrears is pursued later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> I am anxious that outstanding arrears should be collected as soon as possible as it is clearly unfair that those who do not honour their obligations with regard to health contributions should continue to obtain health services at the expense of others.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Government have decided to change the basis of income tax assessment for the self-employed and to extend liability to this sector for PRSI contributions.  They have also stated their intention to apply the same assessment, collection and enforcement procedures as will apply henceforth to income tax also to PRSI, health contributions and to youth employment levies paid by the self-employed. I would now like to take this opportunity to inform the House that I am at present having regulations drawn up in my Department to give effect to this decision in relation to health contributions. When these regulations, together with other appropriate legislative provisions sponsored by the Ministers for Finance and Labour, are in place, health contributions together with PRSI and the youth employment levy will be aggregated with a self-employed individual's income tax liability and will be demanded and collected in a single sum.</P>
    <P>At the same time the regulations which I propose to make will, in accordance with the budget announcement, also provide for the deduction of capital allowances in the calculation of the reckonable income of self-employed persons who are liable for health contributions.  I am sure all Senators will welcome the main thrust of these measures which will, to a very great extent, streamline the assessment and collection of tax, levy, PRSI and, what I am primarily concerned with, health contributions, by removing any duplication at present inherent in the assessment and collection system.  The individual taxpayer will also benefit from being able to discharge his full taxation and contribution liability to the State in one transaction.</P>
    <P>Senators may wish to know that I shall be reviewing shortly the income limit for <Col N="110" /> free consultants' services.  I am not, as yet, in a position to say what the limit will be.  I now ask the House to approve the regulations before it in draft.</P>

      <P>I accept these regulations. The Minister's statement is very brief and very specific.  It is very important that most of the population should be entitled to have hospital benefit.  We heard from the Minister that the farming community once more have an outstanding bill of £5.7 million in respect of the health contributions.  This is to be very much regretted.  Farmers are evading their responsibility to pay a very essential sum.  While the amount still outstanding is a cause for concern, there has been an encouraging response to the efforts of the health boards to recover these arrears.  This is in stark contrast to the position of PAYE workers who have no option in regard to this contribution because it is deducted from their pay.</P>
      <P>With regard to the argument based on the average wage, the latest recorded information on average weekly earnings in the transportable goods industries related to June 1987 when the figure was £196.76.  That is the average wage.  I am wondering if that is the male or the female rate, or is it the men's average rather than the women's because there is a disparity.  As we know, women earn only 60 per cent of the male rate.  That is just a query I have.</P>
      <P>I recognise it is necessary to make this increase and we do not oppose it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that this is an annual thing, that regulations must be made and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It also gives us an opportunity to look at the hospital services and what value the public are getting for this percentage of their income which is given over to the health services.  I recognise the fact that we are spending £1,300 million on our health services but I should also like to point out that our health services have been very gravely curtailed and that our public are not getting good <Col N="111" /> value for money.  They are paying very heavily for it.</P>
      <P>When the original Bill came before the House in 1970, the late Deputy Erskine Childers, who was Minister for Health at the time, made it clear that this was to provide an improved health service for the public and that they were paying a percentage of their income for it.  Up to then manual workers who were insured and had insurance numbers could get full health services free.  This was their right under the law and that is what their social welfare contributions covered.  Unfortunately, this right was taken away from them.  This was a right that was there for 50 years up to 1970.  They had the right to free hospital services and free consultant services and this was taken away from them.</P>
      <P>I was amazed that the trade union movement did not take the case to court on their behalf.  I thought they were rather reticent and dilatory in not challenging it but they did not challenge it and I thought that was very wrong.  We could argue that the services were improved when this percentage of a person's income was paid for a health service but then, in the past few years, we had a very curtailed service, hospitals closing down, beds closing down.  The services provided at out-patients and hospital levels are very inferior at the moment.  I am speaking as a doctor now in saying that if a patient wants to be seen by a consultant that patient may have to wait six to eight months.  If you ask a doctor to get an appointment for you with a consultant in a Dublin city teaching hospital the answer you will get at the present time is: &ldquo;in August, September or October next&rdquo;.  I am not exaggerating in saying this.  I do not think that is a good service for the percentage of the person's income that paid for a health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On top of this you pay the out-patient charge and also the hospital charge for in-patient services.  It was argued that you could take out voluntary health insurance but that was done to try to save you the cost and the burden.  What was the health <Col N="112" /> contribution for?  I wonder are we over-looking the fact here that people are suffering, people are having great hardship. People who are bringing two or three children to a hospital and who must pay to be seen by a consultant have to pay £10 for each child.  This is a lot of money to hand out and people are scared to attend hospitals because of the cost involved.</P>
    <P>We have a growing population over the age of 65 for whom it is impossible to get a bed; it is absolutely impossible.  This is happening not just in the past year but it has been going on for the past three or four years.  We are not making provision in any way for these people who are over the age of 65.  Because of the way the services and health in general over the years have improved due to developments in technology and medicine many people will live longer.  They become a burden on the community.  Many of them need health services and hospitalisation for periods ranging perhaps for a month, a week or two months but they cannot get them.  This is something that we have to look at.  This is an opportunity for another look at this whole matter.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am out of order in discussing the health services because we are talking about health contributions which come within the ambit of this motion.  I wonder why the ceiling below which the health contributions apply should be £15,500.  If we had income tax stopping at £15,500 I wonder what kind of an outcry there would be.  If you paid tax up to £15,500 and paid nothing after that, I dare say there would be a public outcry.  I am wondering if we should have no limit, no ceiling on the health contributions, so that those with £50,000, £60,000 or £70,000 a year might pay appropriately and in this way we might get a little more for those who are in need.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us why it was decided to put a ceiling on the health contribution and if they did not put a ceiling on it, what would be the consequences for the health services. Everyone knows that the big burdens on the health services and the hospital services are those among the lower income <Col N="113" /> group.  Having no ceiling would not put an extra burden on the health services other than taxing those with higher incomes.  I do not think any of us would be adverse to that.  The Minister might care to give us an answer to that.</P>
    <P>I would also like to hear the actual figure for revenue from the health contributions in a year and if the Minister is satisfied that all sections of the community, other than the farmers are making a fair contribution.  I often wonder, with regard to the farmers, why there could not be a closer liaison between the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture and Food so that where farmers are not paying the health contribution, the Department of Agriculture and Food could, on behalf of the Department of Finance, deduct the necessary health contribution in paying out certain grants.  It is not fair to single out farmers.  The same argument would apply to other groups not paying their share.  In that way we would avoid the tremendous division between city and rural people because it is widely believed in the city &mdash; I do not agree with it because I think a lot of it is due to ignorance &mdash; that the farmers just pay nothing, get everything and make a fortune.  This is totally untrue.  If there is money going to that section of the community by way of grants or subsidies, a closer liaison between the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Finance could rectify the situation very quickly and stop the carping that is going on.</P>
    <P>There are areas like this we should look at.  I would like to know the rationale for a £15,500 ceiling and I would also like to know the revenue from it.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us if he is satisfied that the public are receiving the service for which they are paying this very high contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government need not devise charges to pay for what is left of the health service.  It is of such a poor quality now that it would be difficult to give it away, not to mention charging people for using it.  The list of complaints is endless at this stage.  Let me give a little <Col N="114" /> example &mdash; it cannot entirely be laid at the feet of this Government &mdash; but it is a classic example.  I happened to come into contact recently with the cases of two children, one of them my own who had a relatively minor ear ailment.  The other was a child of a relatively poor family. My child was from a relatively affluent family.  The operation did not require an overnight stay in hospital but the consequence of a long delay before the operation would be that the children would be likely to become deaf.  My child, of course, had the operation.  The taxpayer paid for two-thirds of it <i>via</i> my VHI which is tax-allowable and, therefore, I who am well-off, got a service for which two-thirds of the case was paid by the taxpayer. The other child, who happened to be the child of a caretaker in a school, would have done without the operation if the teachers in the school had not the concern and compassion to actually organise a collection to pay for private health care for the child because there was a two-year delay on that operation and, by the time the operation could take place the child would be likely to have been permanently and seriously damaged in his health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are increasing indications of similar problems.  The Southern Health Board, for instance, have obviously identified the less sensitive areas to decimate the health service.  Most of the voluntary redundancies in the nursing sector have been in the psychiatric area, that area having the classic symptom that people will not protest or complain. Nobody is going to get up and say: &ldquo;I was psychiatrically ill and I could not get into hospital&rdquo;.  People who have physical ailments will happily get up and say: &ldquo;I had a serious illness or a debilitating illness and I could not get into hospital&rdquo;.  You will find few enough people who will get up and say: &ldquo;I was mentally ill and could not get into hospital&rdquo;.  You can, therefore, count on the psychiatric patients to remain quiet.  There is increasing concern about the people who are being discharged from psychiatric hospitals, about the quality of care, about whether our long stay psychiatric hospitals are any <Col N="115" /> more now than institutions of containment rather than institutions of care.</P>
    <P>I predict that within the next two years we will find our extremely creditable record of infant mortality beginning to deteriorate.  You cannot provide high quality pre-natal and ante-natal services on the cheap.  If you begin to cut back on the services and on the numbers, you have the consequence which is that more babies will die and that is an appalling price to pay for financial rectitude.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell made a very interesting speech.  The only thing I can say about it is that I am not sure what he is doing sitting where he is.  He should be back where his original allegiance lay, with those of us on the left who always knew that when Fianna Fáil were in Government they would obey &ldquo;capital&rdquo; before they would look after the welfare of ordinary people.  It has been their history since 1960 to be the servants of capital rather than the servants of labour which is not their original history.</P>

I am entitled to make comments about other Members of the House and their views and how consistent or otherwise they are.  I have the great privilege of speaking in this House.  I would be in jail over something else if it were not for the privilege of this House, I hasten to add.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of questions which <Col N="116" /> need to be pursued.  Can the Minister tell me what proportion of national income is actually not covered by the health charges? In other words, how much of the total income that is liable for income tax, for instance, is not covered by the health charges?  Is it 10 per cent, 20 per cent, 30 per cent or 40 per cent?  It would be interesting to see what proportion of the total income, not the numbers of people, that is excluded from the health contributions.</P>
    <P>Also, if one is going to suggest that certain people, because they cannot get the services or because they can afford to pay for them, should be excluded, then one should be logical and carry this through to its conclusion.  At the risk of alienating half of my own constituents I think there is no case for allowing private health insurance or voluntary health insurance contributions to be allowed against tax at the top rate.  The very best that could be argued is that it should be allowed against tax at the standard rate which is what two-thirds or 63 per cent of taxpayers will be paying after 6 April. It appears to me that the other 37 per cent &mdash; myself included &mdash; do not deserve and should not be given a subsidy from the State to the extent that I am given for my voluntary health contributions.  Now, if I were a saint I would follow that to its logical conclusion and not claim it.  I am not a saint and I shall claim it.  I invite the Minister to address that problem.</P>
    <P>If we are cutting back on health expenditure we should not simply cut back on direct expenditure: we should cut back on indirect subsidy, indirect supports which, by an large, benefit the most well-off.  We also, incidentally, might have a look at multinational operations in the area of health contributions and the profits that are being exported outside the country. I refer in particular to what boasts about being the largest private hospital in Europe, which is a religious-run hospital in my own city which is effectively a multinational which makes profits which are then transferred to the head office of the Order in Paris.  I object to the idea that a large part of the taxpayers' contribution to the voluntary health <Col N="117" /> insurance is being used to create a profit for what is effectively a multinational, although it calls itself a religious order, and is exporting the profits from a private hospital out of this country to finance the activities of a religious order.  I do not think that is the function of the Irish health services.  That it is an area which ought to be scrutinised and examined by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Let me warn the Minister and the Government that the idea that privatising the health service generates greater efficiency or generates a more responsible use of money is a palpable load of nonsense.  The country in the world which spends the greatest proportion of its gross national product on health services is actually the United States of America.  In the US they spend 10¼ per cent of their GNP on health expenditure.  A large proportion of that is private but they spend more than any of the Western European social democracies, most of whom have socialised medicine in one form or another.  In the US they spend all that money to produce a health service which is in no visible or measurable way better than what we have here.  Their life expectancies, for instance, are dramatically less than those of the northern European social democracies.  Equally infant mortality in the United States is a disgrace to that country; it is closer to Third World countries than it is to First World countries.  Infant mortality, for instance, amongst minority groups in the United States is dramatically higher than it is amongst the population of Cuba.  The United States is no model for a future health service and those in our health services, or in Government, or in politics, or in economics who suggest a privatised health service as a substitute for what we currently have are deceiving the Irish people.  It would be a costly failure and that is why there is so much wrong with the philosophy behind this Bill.</P>
    <P>Health services ought to be free at point of delivery to everybody in our population.  General practitioner services, hospital services should be free at point of delivery to everybody and we should be prepared to raise the taxation <Col N="118" /> to pay for that.  The idea that we produce these mickey mouse, half-way-house contributions which exclude the delicate sensitivities of the already well-off and penalise further the marginally poor in order to force them to pay for an inadequate health service is not a philosophy for a national health service; it is a philosophy for collapse.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other questions that arise in the Minister's speech.  He inform us, and he obviously takes great pride in the fact, that persons who are in arrears on health contributions are not refused hospital services if they need them.  Now, I would be the last to object to that because I believe that nobody should ever be deterred in any way from using a hospital service he needs because of the fact that he cannot afford to pay for it.  What is the position of somebody who perhaps &mdash; and I know of a case myself &mdash; through a lack of personal ability to organise himself does not have a medical card and needs those medical services, particularly general practitioner services?  It is not the general practitioner's fault.  He or she has to make a living but if a person does not have a medical card and is seriously ill he will not get general practitioner services without a medical card and if he does not have a medical card, he can either depend on the goodwill or charity of the GP or he will not get it.</P>
    <P>I know of an unemployed man who has been buying drugs for a psychiatric illness because he did not have a medical card. I cannot understand why those who are relatively well off, i.e., the farming community, and who do not bother paying their contributions, should be treated more favourably than those who are poor, disorganised and possibly not feeling very well and neglect to renew their medical cards.  I do not see why one group who are sick should be treated with sensitivity and other groups who are sick should be told: &ldquo;That is tough, but you will have to pay or you will not get the service.&rdquo;  I find that reprehensible and I think it is more to do with the political clout of one group than with any evidence of evenhandedness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> Regarding the arrears of the farming community, I noticed the Minister told us what the arrears were at the end of 1987.  I would like to know what the arrears were at the end of 1986.  He gave us an interesting combination of figures but he did not make it clear in his speech whether the arrears at the end of 1987 were bigger than the arrears at the end of 1986.  Whether or not a particular sum of money was collected in 1986 or 1987 is not the issue.  What is the issue is whether the amount of arrears at the end of 1987 was larger or smaller than the arrears at the end of 1986.  If it was smaller, I congratulate both the Government and the health boards.  The health boards have shown a marked reluctance to do anything about it but I am delighted that they are now doing it.  If the arrears are going up then the amount being collected is an indication that the problem is getting worse more slowly than it was before and that is not any real substitute.</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters about which I should like to talk.  I would like the Minister to reflect on the conditions of hospitals and the increasingly frequent charges.  The Minister and his Department must get journals like the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> which, after a slow beginning, has now begun to talk a lot about the health cutbacks and begun to tabulate and document the increasing concern of the medical profession about these cutbacks. I would also invite the Department of Health, and the Minister in particular, to consider this: cutting back on the size of an inefficient organisation is no guarantee that the resultant organisation will be any more efficient.  It will simply be smaller and equally inefficient and, therefore, produce an equally inefficient service which will simply be available to a smaller number of people.</P>
    <P>It is a myth to imagine that simply cutting back on the funds available to a health board will improve their efficiency.  That is a presumption about the quality of management, about the quality of control, about the quality of organisation which is not justified on any objective grounds.  It is a presumption <Col N="120" /> that is based on perceptions of how people operate, which I do not think are justified by the facts.</P>
    <P>If you want to run a more efficient health service you must create the structures on management and control which make it more efficient.  That involves dealing with some of the most important vested interests.  I do not know how many Members of this House &mdash; and I do not know if the Minister is in this position &mdash; have actually read the common contract for consultants, because there cannot be a more extraordinary document defining the relationship between a public service employee and his employers than the common contract of the consultants.  It is a series of escape clauses to avoid accountability by the consultant, to avoid any sort of accountability between the consultant and his or her employer.  They cannot be expected to be there at a particular time; they can be expected to do certain things provided they are consistent with their obligations as a doctor. It is a most extraordinary contract and, may I say, it is no credit to the person who is responsible for it who, unfortunately, is the present Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>One of the great ironies is to hear the Taoiseach talking about the extraordinary expenditures in the health service when a lot of it was presided over by his good self.  I would find it much easier to take seriously a lot of what is being said by the Government if they were prepared to deal with the issue of the common contract for consultants which is a recipe for abuse, a recipe for privateering and a recipe for people to do a minimum in public hospitals in order to guarantee what they would regard as the minimum, which is £28,000 a year, and leave them with ample scope to carry on expanding private practices.</P>
    <P>I find it astonishing that nobody regards it as peculiar that people who are supposed to be consultants in the public service hospitals have the time, resources and energy to be involved in large scale private hospitals themselves.  As far as I am concerned, if we want to pay our consultants 50 per cent more, let us do it <Col N="121" /> on condition that they become exclusively employees of the public health service. This mixture of public and private health service many of our consultants are providing is an absolute disgrace and if we are talking about equity, if we are talking about efficiency and if we are talking about justice, we must talk about those who are a critical and fundamental part of the health service.</P>
    <P>On another occasion, if I have more time, I would like to talk about the consultant ethos, the remarkable, almost Godlike apparitions who descend upon hospital wards every morning.  Everybody must fawn before the consultant and this person becomes God, the deity, and a lot of other incarnations as well for a couple of hours.  I do not accept that any profession is entitled to that sort of obeisance and if we are to develop an efficient health service one of the myths that has to be disposed of is the myth of the all-powerful consultant.</P>
    <P>The truth is that in most public hospitals most of the hard slog is done by junior doctors, irrespective of who gets the credit for the work at the end of it.  I say that as one who is married to somebody who has been both a junior doctor and a consultant; so, I am not taking a particular brief on this.  I am simply repeating what I know to be the case, which is that the real work in most of our public hospitals and most of our public wards is done by junior doctors.  Most of the information I have about how consultants operate I have from the same source to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>It would be very tempting to oppose these regulations, but the point has been made to me that, however minuscule it is, it is a step in the direction of equity.  It is a step, though admittedly a pathetically small step.  I do not see why somebody with the income of, say, myself, which is substantially in excess of the income limit here, should be exempted from paying a health contribution while somebody else on a lesser income and with greater pressure on that income should be expected to pay it on all his income.  I cannot understand how that could be just, proper or equitable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> May I, in conclusion, refer to one thing and that, of course, is that this used to be a contribution which guaranteed people free health services.  It no longer guarantees that because they must pay the hospital services charge if they are in-patients and they must pay a charge if they are out-patients.  Can I inquire of the Minister what his Department have to say to that particularly vulnerable group of people, older people, people who are above the age limit for entering the voluntary health insurance service who now have to pay the £10 a day because they do not have medical cards although they are eligible for hospital services?  I understand that about 30 per cent of our old population would be in that category.  They are not acceptable, because they are too old, in the VHI and they are now stuck with the prospect late in life of having to pay for what is a deteriorating health service.</P>
    <P>The VHI will not accept them because they are too old.  They are not eligible for a medical card because their income is in excess of the income limit for a medical card, so they are actually stuck.  They are a particularly vulnerable group, a group who will quite clearly be in greater need of health services than other age groups in our society and yet they will be stuck with paying for those services because no provision has been made for them.  It would not be so difficult and it would not be so expensive to exempt persons over 65 years from the charges for hospital services.</P>
    <P>The regulations should probably be accepted.  I find it more and more painful to ask people to pay for such a deteriorating service but it is a step towards equity and, indeed, it is quite possible that, if we were to get all of our population to pay on all of our income, we would not need these appalling cutbacks in the health service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will not be opposing these regulations on the basis that they represent a move in the right direction.  I had a certain feeling of nostalgia listening to Senator O'Connell earlier when he proposed, what would be <Col N="123" /> very dear to my own heart, that there should be no limit on the income assessable for health contributions.  I will not be opposing the measures, but they do not go nearly far enough.</P>
      <P>Generally, the Labour Party's greatest worry is that at the moment a two-tiered health service is emerging.  We find that if you have VHI cover or if you have money you get the service; if you do not have money you do not get the service. A case came to my notice recently of a four year old child with a very serious heart condition.  The parents were told last November that the child needed an operation to remove an obstruction that will cause his health to deteriorate gradually. They were told that the operation would be carried out in five to six months. They discovered a couple of weeks ago that the child is not even on the waiting list in the hospital.  These parents, obviously and quite rightly, are very distraught. I came across the case yesterday of an old man who is in great discomfort and requires surgery.  His family were informed that he will get to see a consultant in 12 to 18 months time.</P>
      <P>Seven hospitals have closed in the south eastern region.  We have supposedly a new regional hospital under construction at Ardkeen but I would like to put a question to the Minister on this. At the prices that obtained in 1984 the construction of the hospital was scheduled to cost £40 million, the equipping of the hospital to cost £10 million and that to staff and run the hospital would cost £26 million.  The South Eastern Health Board in their budget last year allocated £34 million for hospitals generally.  This year £31.5 million was allocated, with about £20 million allocated to Ardkeen. The question I seek an answer to is: where are the funds to come from to staff and run this regional hospital, if and when it is finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a more general level, I believe that large areas of the services relating to senior citizens and to the handicapped have not been tackled heretofore.  It has come home to me very much, in the <Col N="124" /> region where I live, that the speech therapy services for disabled children are very defective.  Disabled children, in particular those with Down's Syndrome get something like nine-and-a-half minutes speech therapy per week.  There is an ongoing problem resulting from this.  Some children require therapy in order to develop their facility to speak.  They understand speech but become totally frustrated because they are unable to express themselves.  They are unable to speak because of the lack of specialist help.  They will become less adjusted and less fulfilled adults and, in many ways if we look at it purely in monetary terms, they will cost the State much more because there was no input at the time they most needed it.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about the provision of day care for the severely and profoundly handicapped, in particular as severely and profoundly handicapped people get older.  As they become older their parents need to get a rest during the day and day care for the handicapped becomes more and more important. There is a very great need for such a facility in my area.  Early in 1987 we had 84 acute surgical beds in Waterford city &mdash; the capital of the south-eastern region. When cutbacks which the health board have decided to effect come into operation the number of acute surgical beds in Waterford will be reduced by 50 per cent in 12 months.  There is a huge waiting list.  At a recent meeting in Waterford we were informed by the medical staff in Adrkeen that only absolute emergency procedures are being carried out and that people who have less important or less pressing surgical needs will not have their needs met.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party support this very minor adjustment towards equity.  I hope Senator O'Connell will make his views heard within the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party that there should be no limit on the income on which health contributions are assessed.  I hope he will press that point strongly and fully inside the party.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, a two-tiered health system is evolving.  There is absolutely no <Col N="125" /> doubt about this.  The evidence is quite clear to me in my own area.  Private patients who have VHI cover or who can pay their way get the treatment.  The people who are actually paying the health contribution, the people who avail of the hospital services card are getting a reduced service.  This is totally unjust and the Government stand totally condemned for what has happened to the health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome the introduction of these regulations.  As Senator O'Shea has pointed out, they are a step in the right direction.  I wish to ask the Minister seriously to consider what Senator O'Connell said in view of his medical experience and his deep knowledge of the health services over the years, of the various difficulties he sees and which all of us know are arising.  I hope the Minister is fully aware of the grave deterioration in the health service and, in particular, the service which is provided for vulnerable people in our community, the old and the handicapped.</P>
      <P>I am extremely concerned about the deterioration in the health service in the south-eastern region.  Seven hospitals have closed in a matter of nine months in the south-eastern region.  Several wards have been closed in other hospitals including a gynaecological unit in St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny.  Women seem to be taking the severe brunt of the cutbacks in the south-eastern region this year.</P>
      <P>It is not surprising that health board members are put in the unenviable position of having to make very difficult choices between the closure of hospitals or the curtailment of services when the Minister's Department have made a cutback of £10 million in the budget allocation for the South Eastern Health Board in 1987 and 1988.  That is a savage cutback.  Administrators and health board members find it very difficult to balance the books at the end of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health service in the south eastern region has deteriorated to such a degree that ministerial intervention may be necessary to provide finance in the latter <Col N="126" /> part of the year to keep the present appalling service going.  I was taken aback recently by the closure of a district hospital in New Ross, County Wexford. The health board members were asked to make the difficult choice between maintaining the existing service in Wexford County Hospital or closing a district hospital in New Ross.  On receiving the news of its closure the patients at the district hospital were caused considerable distress.  It is notable &mdash; and the hospital can verify this &mdash; that a number of deaths occurred in that hospital following the announcement of its closure, a greater number than was normal.  I appeal to the Minister to look at the various cuts and savings he is trying to implement in the health boards and to be a little more caring about the degree to which these cuts are being implemented.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the controversy about the collection of the health charges.  The Minister referred in his contribution today to the moneys owed to the health boards by the farmers and the self-employed. There has been an argument between the farmers, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and the health boards over the collection of that money.  I suggest that matter could be resolved easily.  The difference arises over the difference between gross income and net income.  People have now developed hang-ups about this terminology. If the words &ldquo;total income&rdquo; were used as in accountancy systems &mdash; in accountancy terms total income has a much different meaning from gross income &mdash; it would take into account the capital allowances which are subtracted from the gross income in order to arrive at the contribution they should make. The investment made by farmers and the self-employed &mdash; and anybody in business will tell you this &mdash; is essential if you are going to keep a business going.  There is no way that anybody in a Government Department or any public representative can legitimately say that an investment in a business, no matter what it is, is not necessary and is something which should not be taken account of as a source of <Col N="127" /> income.  After all, these people are creating much needed employment in the community.  They are prepared to pay their contribution but they will pay it on the same basis as everybody else.  That does not exonerate anybody from not paying their share of the health contribution. I am glad to see that substantial inroads are being made by the Revenue Commissioners and the health boards into getting that money in which is so essential to keep the very basic health services intact.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to the VHI and to the consultants.  The VHI are facing a very serious problem.  We have had such an emphasis on the voluntary health insurance scheme that many people have joined it over the past year.  Many claims are being made on the VHI and, because of this, there will be a severe financial crisis in the VHI in the next couple of years.  There is no way the VHI can withstand the number of claims being made on them at the moment.  The recent statement by the Minister for Finance in the budget that he is going to clawback 35 per cent from the people who introduced the service to the patients will certainly reduce the acceptability and the attractiveness of that scheme for medical personnel who are taking the pressure off the public hospitals.</P>
    <P>I have no hangups about public or private care.  Where people are in a position to afford private care, the resources saved as a result should be pumped into the public hospital system.  We should be able to maintain essential patient care for people who are not so fortunate as to be in a position to afford the Blackrock Clinics of this world.  In order to assist the VHI we should impose a ceiling on each service given and claimed for under the VHI system.</P>
    <P>The system is being abused by some people.  The general public seem to think that consultants can just think of a figure which the patient claims from the VHI. Checks and balances in claiming hospital benefit from the VHI do not seem to exist.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Board and the consultants seem to be <Col N="128" /> able to do what they like, without any ministerial intervention or any ministerial misgivings about the claims being made. There are indications in the media that the VHI are looking for an 8½ to 9 per cent increase in their premiums.  I would like the Minister to confirm or reject that when replying.  No increase should be given to the VHI until the Department of Health have carried out a total investigation into the running of the affairs of the VHI.  The policyholders in the VHI system should be seen to get better value for money and the health system should be seen to get better value for money. The general public should not see the VHI as a rip-off for consultants.  I urge the Minister to carry out a detailed investigation into this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the introduction of PRSI for the self-employed.  I also have misgivings about this system because the introduction of PRSI for the self-employed is suggested in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> on the basis of social equity.  The people who signed that programme did not know the full impact this measure will have on the Exchequer in the years ahead.  The Government are getting a once-off income from the self-employed which is perhaps essential to the Exchequer at present.  When we start to pay out pay-related benefits and contributory old age pensions to the self-employed, how much will that cost the Exchequer and the general taxation system in the years ahead? The Exchequer will lose considerably more than it expects to lose.</P>
    <P>No thought whatsoever has gone into the introduction of the PRSI system for the self-employed.  It is estimated by some commentators that it would take 15 per cent of income to bring about a self-financing scheme of PRSI for the self-employed rather than 3 per cent this year, 4 per cent in 1989 and 5 per cent in 1990. I would appeal to the Minister to have a rethink about the introduction of PRSI for the self-employed and to see the full impact of this measure in ten years time. Enormous resources will have to be taken out of general taxpayers' pockets, at a time when we are punch drunk with high <Col N="129" /> taxation.  We should rethink this scheme. Perhaps the present system is catering adequately for social equity.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Ryan said about consultants.  I am glad he clarified the position with his detailed information about consultants.  I certainly would not like to contradict anything he said, in view of the intimate knowledge he would have of that sector of the community.  I am very sad that more effort is not made by the Department to put the emphasis on patient care, rather than being seen to adopt a sledgehammer approach, an ill-thought out approach, an ill-planned approach to bring about the savings necessary in all Government Departments at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am sad that as a nation we must look now in many instances to the national lottery to finance various projects in the health services.  That has severe connotations for everybody.  The basic essential requirement of any country should be to provide essential health care for the old, the sick, the infirm and the handicapped. The national lottery now seems to be the source of finance for many services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately waste in the health service still continues with the over-prescribing of drugs and duplication in administration.  We have eight health boards for a small population.  Still the Minister arbitrarily gives a figure to each health board each year and asks administrators and health board members to make difficult choices about hospital closures rather than about cuts that could take place elsewhere to eliminate waste. If the Minister took on board only one proposal that the Fine Gael Party are making, a prescription charge, this would bring in £3 million to the health boards <Col N="130" /> and save about £16 million in the over-prescribing of drugs.  We have a punch drunk society in relation to the amount of drugs being given out indiscriminately by the medical profession.  I appeal to the Minister to bring the views of Senators here today to the Department and to rethink some of the ill-thought out decisions that are being put into operation by the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">

      <P>I wish to express to the Senators who have participated in this debate the general consensus that exists in relation to the Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1988.  From the contributions I have heard there seems to be total support for the proposals before the Seanad today.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to Senator Fennell's comments, first of all, in relation to the £5.7 million outstanding from the farmers.  I have the details here of the action taken by the health boards. Senator Fennell was interested to know exactly what was happening in relation to the work being carried out by the boards. The calculation of the average earnings in transportable goods industries is based on both male and female earnings, that is, an average of both is taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the action being taken by the health boards Senator Fennell will be interested to know the following details. The Southern Health Board have initiated proceedings against those with arrears in excess of £600 and at a later date those owing lesser amounts will be tackled.  The South Eastern Health Board have decided upon a figure of £50 and proceeding have been taken against about 9,000 farmers.  The Mid-Western Health Board have issued solicitors' letters to all those in arrears and for the present proceedings are being taken against those owing more than £100, about 2,100 defaulters.  The North Western Health Board have decided to take legal proceedings against all those with arrears exceeding £10.  The Western <Col N="131" /> Health Board have initiated civil proceedings against 444 farmers for whom details of reckonable income were available. While no cases have yet been heard, there has been a very good response to this course of action.  On 1 September 1987 these farmers owed £193,500.  This figure was revised to £147,000 when actual accounts were produced and estimates were re-examined and, since then, a total of £47,000 has been collected from those 444 farmers.</P>
    <P>The North Eastern Health Board are taking two courses of action to collect arrears.  Civil proceedings are being taken against the seven or eight farmers from each county who owe the greatest amounts based on reckonable income. Fifty farmers from each county who owe the greatest amounts based on the health boards' assessments have been referred to Dun and Bradstreet &mdash; Stubbs Gazette &mdash; and there has been a very good response to this course of action.  The Midland Health Board are also taking two courses of action to collect arrears. Civil bills were issued to about 300 farmers and about 650 cases have been referred to Dun and Bradstreet.  The Eastern Health Board have billed all those with arrears of at least £200 and there has been a good response either in payment or in the provision of additional information on which revised assessments can be based.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell made a point in relation to the ceiling figure.  It is related to the question of entitlements to free consultant services.  If you were to remove the ceiling, you could find yourself with demands for free consultant services from people over the ceiling figures. The number of people earning in excess of £15,500 is fairly small, say about 15 per cent of the workforce.  Amounts coming in by removing the ceiling would be very small now &mdash; a rough estimate would be between £3 million and £4 million. We would have to do a lot of calculation to get it exactly right.  It is the estimated figure and I want to make that clear.  This must be viewed against the £110 million now being brought in by way <Col N="132" /> of health contributions.  I take special note of the general consensus in the Seanad in relation to removing this ceiling, provided that removing this ceiling would not give rise to further demands for public beds.  That is the balancing decision we have to make in the Department and the views being expressed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  The point has been raised again about the use of having a debate in the Seanad on these matters.  Points put forward by the Senators are certainly taken into consideration by myself, the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, and the Department officials who are here at present.  All of the population is entitled to accommodation in public wards.  That is a point made by Senator O'Connell.  The charge of £10 per day to a maximum of £100 a year is very modest when the real cost of hospitalisation can be as high as £150 per day.  Those who can afford to pay consultants' fees, that is the top 15 per cent of the population as was said earlier, are required to pay.</P>
      <P>We are all concerned about this whole question of waiting lists, but we find waiting lists arise only in the case of elective procedures.  Urgent cases are dealt with as a priority, and that is a fact.  With the rapid explosion in health services costs in every country in the developed world, every avenue must be explored to achieve savings without the diminution of services to patients.  I am satisfied that Ireland maintains, by international standards, a health service which is second to none.</P>
      <P>We should be more positive.  There is a tendency to highlight the negative side of the health services.  That is very easy to do and it can be very emotive at times. I think it is an awful pity.  We should also commend the work being carried out in our hospitals and by the health service generally.  We can compare it with the service in the most developed democracy in the world, America, and I would say we have a far better service than is available there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> The yield from the health contributions, as Senator O'Connell mentioned, is actually £110 million in a full year.  The 1988 figure will be in that region.  If we bear in mind that the overall cost of the services is £1,300 million, this gives us some idea of the cost of the health services.  This increase will bring in just £1 million which is a very small increase and means only £6.25 per week to any person who has £15,500 a year or over.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan, who is not here at present, mentioned admission to public hospitals.  Admission is based on the assessed medical priority and it is a matter for the medical professions involved.  It is a clinical decision and it is one that has to be made by the medical personnel who are in charge at a particular time.  I disagree totally with Senator Ryan's view on the infant mortality rate.  This has been declining and I see no reason why these alarmist comments are being made.  They are unfounded.  They only tend to disturb the public generally who have problems.  I am sorry Senator Ryan is not here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for that but I wish to make the point that I do not like referring to a Senator or making comments on his comments unless he can refute them.  I am making a case for privatisation and I feel that Senator Ryan should consult with his colleagues or his fellow people in the Labour Party or The Workers' Party who voted in Dáil Éireann for privatisation of a hospital.  In fact, under a previous Labour Minister, privatisation blossomed over that period. I am not criticising that.  I am only stating an actual fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point also made by Senator Ryan in relation to the tax relief on VHI subscriptions, this now costs the Exchequer about £40 million per annum as against the VHI contribution of about £30 million to the public hospitals.  You have to take into account VHI payments <Col N="134" /> which support private hospitals.  If the private hospitals were not there patients would have to go to public hospitals thus bringing heavier charges to the Exchequer.  All in all, the income tax relief on VHI subscriptions does not impose a net burden on the Exchequer. This should be borne in mind.  It was considered very carefully and it was decided to retain this particular tax incentive. I think it is a reasonable point because people are making voluntary contributions to provide the services.</P>
    <P>Of course, we would all like health services to be free but, unfortunately, somebody has to pay at the end of the day and those who can afford to pay should pay.  We cannot afford a free service in this country, and that is simply it.  Health contributions serve to focus attention on the vast cost of the health services and we have to bear in mind that the actual cost has to be collected in income tax and other taxes which are such a heavy burden on the State.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred also to the common contract for consultants.  He must be aware that this is being renegotiated at present.  We are all aware of some of the problems associated with the existing common contract.  In fact, meetings are taking place at present.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also referred to cutbacks. The Senator and this House are well aware of the critical fiscal situation facing this country.  We were faced with an impossible burden when we took office in 1987.  We had to take the action we took to save the system.  Savings have been effected in such a way as to minimise the effect on the patients.  We should also bear in mind that the actual allocation for the health services is still very high.</P>
    <P>The public-private mix has served the country well to date.  Private practice has allowed the best professionals to be attracted into the public system.  This can only benefit the overall system.  Charges for health services are not required from medical cardholders.  Senator Ryan expressed some concern about people making formal application for medical cards.  In relation to any charges, the chief <Col N="135" /> executive officers of the health boards have discretionary powers, which they use quite often.  He made a point in relation to people over 65 years of age but many of them have medical cards. Those who have not got medical cards can be treated on a discretionary basis. We have a very humane approach to these matters when they arise.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Shea referred to Ardkeen Hospital in Waterford.  This is not relevant to the debate here today.  It is a matter for further discussion.  Senator O'Shea referred to private hospitals.  I want to make this point clear because people are criticising private hospitalisation. The Labour Party and The Workers' Party will have to realise that they voted in Dáil Éireann for privatisation. I want to remind them that there was an increase in private hospitalisation during the period of the last Coalition Government, under a Labour Minister.  Let us be fair about it and not have this hypocrisy about private hospitalisation. When a party vote for something in this House it is a public statement of their real political affiliations and let them stick by that.</P>
    <P>Senators Ryan and O'Shea also referred to the cutbacks in beds.  They always sound dramatic, but when you look behind the scenes there is a far more economic use of the beds now.  Acute beds should be used for acute patients. That is the case.  Unfortunately, the occupancy of beds in some hospitals was excessive.  The present restrictions have concentrated the minds of the professionals and the consultants, and far better use is now being made of the acute beds in the hospitals.  Furthermore, I believe that patients are being treated very well.  It is alarmist to talk about the type of problems which arise.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan referred to hospital closures and cutbacks.  This is not really relevant to the debate here today.  In reality, every country in the world is in the same position.  The cost of health care has exploded throughout the world and every country is making a determined effort to cut expenditure.  We have to <Col N="136" /> take that approach.  We have no alternative. The numbers in the health services had increased dramatically over the years.  It is clear that the quality of services did not improve in proportion to the increase in the number of people employed in the services and the additional costs being imposed on the public by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Regarding another point made by Senator Hogan, the capital allowances will be deductible, when the new regulations are passed, from 6 April 1988 by the self-employed.  This was announced in the budget.  This is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Finance.  I am not that convinced about the opposition to the contributions from the self-employed.</P>
    <P>As a person who was self-employed before coming into Dáil Éireann, I consider that to make a contribution to the Exchequer entitles you to a contributory old age pension on reaching 66 years of age.  Some years ago I was a member of an old age pensions committee and some Members of this House may also have been members of old age pensions committees. I found that those who did not take any action to preserve their future were rewarded and those who had taken steps to provide some sort of security for the future were handicapped.  Basically the maximum pension was awarded to a person who took no action whatsoever to have savings and anyone who had savings had them deducted from the pension.</P>
    <P>In this case this will remove the demeaning system of assessment.  In my own constituency farmers and the self-employed generally have to go through this demeaning means test.  At present pensions are being awarded from the Exchequer without any contribution. Surely, in the years ahead, when this really comes into operation, pensions will be paid across the board to those who contribute.  I think it is a welcome development and I am delighted the Government are proceeding with it.  I feel I can justify it to the self-employed.  In relation to farmers and others, the capital allowances will be deducted when the <Col N="137" /> new regulations are passed.  That concession was announced in the budget and it should be very welcome.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan referred also to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  He made the point that they were getting into financial difficulties.  I would remind Senators that last year their reserves stood at over £30 million, the highest recorded by the VHI to date.  I realise that they have a certain draw on their reserves at this stage.  Nevertheless, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are in a very secure position.  The reserves cover all their costs and liabilities.  I can state categorically that we have not received any further application for an increase in subscriptions because, as Senators are aware, an increase was given recently.  I presume Senator Hogan was referring to the last increase which has now probably been sent out to VHI policyholders. Senator Hogan also mentioned that it was roughly a 9 per cent increase.  This is a cumulative increase over a period.  We granted an increase in the region of 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I did not know the protocol in relation to absent Senators but I always like to confront Senators and not speak behind their backs.  That is why I made the point.  Again, I express my appreciation to this House for the comments made here today.  We will have them considered and assessed.  Some very good points were put forward here in relation to the ceiling which should certainly be considered very carefully.</P>

    <Title>Insurance Bill, 1987: Committee Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 simply refers to the fact that the Act may be cited as the Insurance Act and that it is to be taken together with the earlier Insurance Acts and construed as one code and that it will come into operation on the day <Col N="138" /> appointed by the Minister.  It really ties into the long title of the Bill that it is an Act to amend and extend the Insurance Acts 1909 to 1985.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned at the fact that, although there are a considerable number of Government amendments to the Bill &mdash; which shows that there has been serious consideration presumably of representations made and of issues that have arisen and a willingness to come forward with amendments &mdash; we still have what I consider to be a very unsatisfactory situation in the apporoach to our insurance law.  It is undesirable that our insurance law should be covered partly by Acts of the Oireachtas, including this Bill which is proposed to be part of that code, and partly by ministerial regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972.  The thrust of those European Communities regulations is in many ways more far-reaching for our insurance law than the Acts of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>We have a sort of two-speed approach and it is something about which the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities were very critical.  Indeed, when the joint committee considered the two regulations under the European Communities Act which are referred to in the next section, that is, the regulations of 1976 and the regulations of 1984, they recommended that when there was an Insurance Bill before the Oireachtas the opportunity should be taken to incorporate those statutory instruments into an Act of the Oireachtas.  The reason I have risen at the commencement of the debate on this Bill to raise the matter and even at this somewhat late stage to ask the Minister to consider bringing in further amendments to incorporate those regulations is that in a further recent report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities the same issue arose and the joint committee referred expressly to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to that report.  It is Report No. 3 on Council Directives relating to credit, suretyship and legal expenses insurance.  It was adopted by the joint <Col N="139" /> committee recently on foot of a report from a subcommittee which I chair. Therefore, I have to confess that I had a hand in the drafting of the report.  Nonetheless the views are those of the full joint committee when the report was adopted.</P>
    <P>I will refer the Minister to paragraph 5 of that report which makes specific reference to this Bill and the view expressed is an important one which I hope the Minister will take on board during this Committee Stage.  The joint committee stated as follows:</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce has indicated that it is the intention to implement both Directives by a statutory instrument made under the European Communities Act, 1972. While the Joint Committee accepts that this course of action is open to the Minister it does not consider it satisfactory that the main statutory provisions regulating the conduct of the insurance business should be found in subordinate legislation which has never been considered by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This position has come about in particular by the implementation of EEC Directives by the European Communities (Non-Life Insurance) Regulations, 1976 and the European Communities (Life Assurance) Regulations, 1984.  A previous Joint Committee recommended that these Regulations be replaced by an Act of the Oireachtas when opportunity offered but this opportunity has not been availed of in the Insurance Bill, 1987 currently before the Seanad. The Joint Committee is informed that at one time it was hoped that this Bill would be a consolidating measure but that the resources available within the Department were inadequate for the task.</P>
    <P>That was a view expressed to the joint committee but we are now considering the Insurance Bill, 1987, on Committee Stage and important Government amendments are tabled.  In my view, and I think this is the view of the joint committee, the most important Government <Col N="140" /> proposal would be to consolidate our insurance law in this Bill.  I will refer to other matters that could also be dealt with.  It is important to consolidate the law because we have at the moment two different ways in which we are regulating our insurance law, one by Acts of the Oireachtas and the other by regulations under the European Communities Act where the Minister does have very wide powers to amend or vary an Act of the Oireachtas.  This is particularly important because of the implications of European Community law, both the directives that are coming out and also, as the Minister will be well aware, the case law of the Court of Justice on freedom to provide services.</P>
    <P>I will mention later on this Committee Stage some other problems I think are important that are not dealt with in this Bill as it stands at present but I would hope could be the subject of amendment also.  Before coming to that I would like to hear the Minister comment on whether it would be possible to bring in further amendments to have one code in this Insurance Bill.  If it is not possible to do it in this Bill &mdash; as I would hope it will be while it is still at a relatively early stage of its parliamentary scrutiny having been introduced in the Seanad &mdash; I hope the Minister can give an undertaking that it is intended, within a very short time and before any more European Communities ministerial regulations are adopted in the insurance field, that there will be a consolidating code in order that we will have an Act of the Oireachtas or Acts of the Oireachtas to be read together which govern the law in this very important area.  I would welcome the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty whatsoever with the Senator's aspirations and objectives in this area.  It is a question of resources obviously and a question of priorities which the Government and the Department have to set.  Consolidation in any area is obviously desirable and it is particularly desirable in the insurance area with <Col N="141" /> the plethora of EC directives and so on. I share the Senator's objective but (a) it is a question of resources and (b) it is a question of attempting to consolidate the legislation.  If one were to take on board all the EC directives, for example, and the regulations in this legislation one would obviously need to do considerable consolidating work in advance.  Quite frankly and quite bluntly that work has not been given the priority which perhaps it should.</P>
      <P>I have had to set other priorities to do with the business of developing the insurance industry.  I am using it as an economic tool and an economic instrument rather than allocating the resources in that area at present.  I will certainly keep an eye on it and I hope we can get some solid consolidation work done as quickly as possible.  Obviously the import of various EC directives is in this legislation and the appropriate ones are obviously taken on board fully in particular legislation.  It is not on the front burner but it is on the long list of work which has to be undertaken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could pursue the point a little further in view of the Minister's recognition of the importance of having insurance law governed by primary legislation by an Act of the Oireachtas and his reference to the difficulties of resources and whether it is a priority.  That leads me to the other point I want to refer to at this preliminary stage on Committee Stage.  During the examination by the joint committee of the European Community Directives an issue arose that seemed to be of fundamental importance.  It arose precisely because there are the Acts of the Oireachtas, there are the European Communities regulations and there is an uncertainty in a fundamental area of law. It is a technical area and I do not want to take up much time on it but it is important to identify it and to refer again to the full treatment of it in this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The doubt which was expressed to the joint committee by the representative of the banks standing committee &mdash; in other words representing the banks &mdash; was <Col N="142" /> whether guarantees which are given by Irish banks in relation to business which may be carried on are caught by the Insurance Acts.  That is the net point. The problem arises by virtue of the provision of section 9 of the Insurance Act, 1936.  As the Minister will be aware, section 9 of the Insurance Act, 1936, makes it unlawful for a person, except in the course of reinsurance, to effect or endeavour to effect a contract of insurance with an unlicensed insurer.  The question is whether the business being carried out by banks is caught by that section.  There have been some attempts by statute to amend that.  What has happened is that there have been certain exemptions in the Insurance Act, 1978, but those exemptions have compounded the problem for banks.  I want to refer to the remarks of the joint committee in paragraph 11 of the report:</P>
    <P>By virtue of the definition of guarantee insurance business in the 1936 Act therefore it may be that some contracts of guarantee entered into in the course of business by undertakings such as banks which are not authorised insurers which might not be regarded by the Courts as contracts of insurance at all may be rendered illegal.  For example a bank might be regarded as entitled to guarantee payment of a rental under a leasing of equipment agreement because empowered to do so by the 1978 Act but not the performance of other clauses in the lease.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 12 states:</P>
    <P>Judging by the Department's memorandum this situation has not been brought about by any positive policy decision but arises from a provision in the 1936 Act the effect of which is not clear.  Nevertheless it has been thought necessary to deal with it not by amending the 1936 Act so as to exclude banking business from the provisions of the Act but by enacting legislation exempting certain specified contracts of guarantee from the provisions of the Insurance Acts.  The Joint Committee is informed that in the United Kingdom <Col N="143" /> such contracts entered into in the course of banking business are exempt from the requirements of legislation implementing EEC law and insurance. It can hardly have been the intention of Council Directive 73/239/EEC that the scope of suretyship should vary between Member States.</P>
    <P>The joint committee went on to refer to the views of the banks and insurers as represented to the sub-committee which I chaired.  Mr. Mandall, on behalf of the banks, said that this was not an occasional problem.  He said that this was a very frequent problem encountered by the banks in relation to guarantees where major financial steps would be taken in partnership with international banks elsewhere where there would be an involvement of Irish banks and that the Irish banks have found themselves in difficulty as to whether they were prohibited by section 9 of the Insurance Act from being able to offer that type of guarantee.  Mr. Mandall's views, as represented to the joint committee, are that it is constantly creating difficulties for Irish banks, not occasionally.</P>
    <P>It is continually necessary to refer back to the 1978 Act to see if a service requested by a customer can be reconciled by the wording of the Act.  There are doubts about the legality of business banks are expected to transact for the benefit of the State, for example, guarantees for deferred payment of customs duties; something which the banks fulfil on behalf of the Government, but there are doubts about the legality of it.  Moreover, where in an international transaction an Irish firm is required to provide a guarantee by a foreign bank for which exchange control approval is forthcoming, it must incur the additional expense of involving an Irish bank in the transaction.  It was Mr. Mandall's view, as urged upon the joint committee, that Irish banks should be placed in the same position as their British counterparts and that legislation along the British lines should be enacted in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> The interesting thing about the sub-committee discussion on this point was that it appeared that the representatives of the Department who were present had not been aware of the seriousness of the problem.  For one reason or another they had not appreciated the seriousness of the problem from the point of view of the banks in seeking to undertake this kind of business.</P>
    <P>There was also a very interesting response from the representative of the insurance companies who came to give evidence and make representations before the joint committee, Mr. Kemp, because he informed the subcommittee that the federation would not object to the banks' request being met provided the Irish insurers continue to be allowed to write the suretyship business as they were now doing.</P>
    <P>There was no objection by the federation on behalf of insurance companies but there is a small problem which came up in the context of a technical directive. It is a mainstream problem which should be dealt with in this Insurance Act.  It should be dealt with either by the repeal of section 9 of the 1936 Act, which was introduced at a time when it was intended to restrict Irish insurance to only two firms and to license very strictly who might carry it out because of the needs and the economic pressures of that time but it has no bearing on a country that is offering itself as a centre for financial services and is seeking to develop in that area.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should take the opportunity in an insurance Bill to deal with genuine problems for banks engaging in this type of transaction.  I hope the Minister will take the opportunity to accept that recommendation of the joint committee, and that is why I put it forward at this early stage in the debate, that he will have that report examined and come forward with an appropriate amendment to deal with the issue later on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should say here is that this is one of the Bills which deals with short title, citation and <Col N="145" /> commencement.  Section 24 of the Bill proposes, as the House may be aware to extend the banking facilities to the Industrial Credit Corporation and Fóir Teoranta in the area of bonds, suretyship and guarantees.  It may or may not be the right place to discuss it.  I will leave that to the House to decide.  In fairness I should respond to the substance of what the Senator has said.  I am not clear that it is pertinent to section 1.  We are aware of this problem.</P>
      <P>Until very recently we had no representation from the banks telling us they had any problem in this area.  We have written to the banks standing committee and we got a response from them in which they now indicate that there may be some areas which could be examined.  We are now seeking to do that.  It is clear from the Senator's comments that it is a very complicated area.  We are now aware of that.  We will give some thought to whether any amendments are required. That is the most practical thing I can say at this stage.  We are aware also of the views of Mr. Kemp and I have followed carefully the views of the joint committee on the matter.  We are giving some thought to whether legislation is needed but I stress that, until recently, the banks did not make any representations to the Department on the matter.  I have taken full account of the Senator's comments today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. S. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a comment which is not directly relevant to section 1 but I examined the Bill and section 24 was as near as one could come to a section where this matter might be raised and it was not even strictly relevant to section 24.  I take this opportunity to raise an issue which was certainly represented to the subcommittee as being a matter of frequent occurrence for the banking sector, that was causing additional expense and was frustrating the banks in seeking to offer the type of guarantee which national banks were offering as part of a package and which they felt strongly about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would tend to agree with the Minister. It did appear that this matter had <Col N="146" /> not been raised or that representations had not been made directly and that to some extent it came out or was debated at the subcommittee session.  It is appropriate, if it is possible, to deal with it in this Insurance Bill because it does seem to be a matter of urgency.  I hope that the Government will bring in an amendment to tackle the matter.  Am I to assume that the section dealing with the supervision of insurers would automatically come into law from day one and that other parts of the Bill, for example, that part dealing with the agents and brokers could come into force subsequently in a two-year period?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very practical point.  Different parts of the Bill can be brought into effect by ministerial order. The section the Senator is worried about is in Part IV where we are permitting a two-year period for adjustment.  We have not finalised Part IV amendments yet but, as soon as that is done, we will take full account of that two-year gap.  The answer to the Senator's question is yes, we can bring onstream different parts of the Bill on different dates.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 27 to delete &ldquo;broker&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;intermediary&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This change is necessitated because of the proposed extension in Part IV of the Bill of the provisions in relation to the holding of an insurance bond to agents as well as brokers in section 39.  The effect of the change is to include those members of the public who deal with insurance agents within the <Col N="147" /> definition of &ldquo;clients&rdquo; for the purpose of the Bill.  It is in the nature of a technical amendment only.  It has not any wider implications.  For example, it will not affect the general law of agencies between principals and their clients.</P>
      <P>The reason for amendment No. 2 is that the scope of the existing definition in the Bill as published is unintentionally too wide.  As it stands, it would catch, for example, surveyors, engineers, assessors who also act in certain circumstances on behalf of an insurer in respect of a person proposing to effect a policy of insurance. The purpose of the provisions in Parts III and IV of the Bill is simply to introduce safeguards for the public in their dealings with insurance agents <i>per se</i> who arrange insurance contracts with insurance companies on behalf of the public and who may be entrusted increasingly with premium remittances.</P>
      <P>It was never the intention to include, for example, surveyors, engineers and so on in this net as there is no exposure to members of the public involved.  Indeed, members of the public do not deal with these people who are retained or employed by insurance companies on their own behalf.  The amendment is, therefore, in the nature of a refinement of wording to reflect more precisely the intention of the provision itself.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 proposes a revised definition of &ldquo;insurance broker&rdquo; which is essentially an adapted version of an EC definition which is used in a Council Directive of 13 December 1976.  We have adapted an EC definition to Irish conditions. The amendment has been put forward having regard to the views expressed by the insurance broking representative bodies and to the need to distinguish as far as possible from a definition point of view between insurance brokers, on the one hand, and other categories of insurance intermediaries and agents on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment put forward by us seeks to link the concept of freedom of choice for insurance brokers in regard to whom they do business with on behalf of their clients to the number of agencies <Col N="148" /> required to be held by brokers under section 37 of this Bill.  Thus, in the case of insurance brokers, the concept of freedom of choice of undertaking is related specifically to Part IV of the Bill rather than acting with complete freedom as it were, which I note is the terminology employed by Senators Mulroy and Fallon in their associated amendment.</P>
    <P>The reason for linking freedom of choice to the number of agencies required to be held by brokers rather than to the notion of acting with complete freedom as to the choice of undertaking is as follows: first, I should say that insurance companies invariably only accept business from insurance brokers with whom they have concluded written agency agreements.  Any broker not holding agency agreements with all companies operating in the Irish market would, under a definition incorporating &ldquo;complete freedom&rdquo; as to choice of undertaking, effectively be debarred from holding himself out as a broker as he would not be acting with complete freedom as to the choice of undertaking if he did not have the whole range.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, insurance brokers would have a stark choice either to seek to obtain agency agreements with all insurance companies operating in the Irish market or else relinquish a certain number of agencies and be forced to revert to insurance agent status.  I am certain that this was not the Senators' intention.  The Government amendment gets around this difficulty and is also legally consistent with the requirements laid down in Part IV of the Bill which we will deal with later.</P>
    <P>I will also point out that the definition proposed by the Government does not include reference to re-insurance for the reason that Part IV of the Bill does not apply to contracts of re-insurance or to insurance intermediaries engaged solely in relation to the business of effecting contracts of insurance.  The legal advice is that it would be essential to avoid any potential inconsistency or contradictory approach in the definition section and the body of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> In summary, therefore, the amendment in the Government's name proposing the revised definition of &ldquo;insurance broker&rdquo; will distinguish more clearly between insurance brokers, on the one hand, and insurance agents on the other hand for the purpose of this Bill.  I trust that will be welcomed by the House.</P>
    <P>As regards amendment No. 5, the original definitions of &ldquo;insurance intermediary&rdquo; and &ldquo;intermediary&rdquo; in the published Bill are too wide for the same reason as outlined in relation to &ldquo;insurance agent&rdquo;.  Furthermore, when one reads the definition of &ldquo;commission payment&rdquo; in section 2, (1) in conjunction with Part III of the Bill, it is clear that the powers to be taken would extend to persons other than genuine insurance intermediaries.  This was never the intention. It is therefore proposed to define insurance &ldquo;intermediary&rdquo; as an insurance broker, an insurance agent or a person acting in any equivalent or corresponding capacity.  We do not wish to go further than this.  It should be pointed out at this stage that this amendment will not prevent insurers from paying remuneration to persons such as surveyors and engineers who carry out work from time to time for insurers in relation to insurance business.  These payments will not be regarded as commission for the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer to the definition of &ldquo;insurance agent&rdquo; as any person who holds an appointment in writing from an insurer.  It does not include an insurance broker or an employee of an insurer when the employee is acting for that insurer.  A number of words are deleted from the section.  Subsequently in the Bill we know that an agent is defined as an agent of the insurer.  Does it now mean that insurance companies will be compelled to rewrite the contracts they may have with the agents?  The deletion of the term &ldquo;insurance broker&rdquo; and the substitution of &ldquo;intermediary&rdquo; is appropriate and correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 which Senator Mulroy and I put forward might well be <Col N="150" /> seen perhaps as a more international definition of the term &ldquo;insurance broker&rdquo;.  I understand it is used extensively as a definition in EC countries by European brokers and it is certainly appropriate here.  We are a member of the EC and we should bring our administration and our insurance laws up to date.  I can see the thinking behind the Minister's definition of &ldquo;insurance broker&rdquo;.  It is a diluted form of the definition put forward by me and Senator Mulroy.  The important words in our amendment are &ldquo;complete freedom&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;complete&rdquo; is omitted in the Minister's definition and I can see the reason.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is a problem peculiar to Irish insurance brokers that they may not have an agency with every insurance company and, therefore, you could arguably say that they are not working with total complete freedom.  I would naturally prefer our amendment to be accepted but certainly the Minister's amendment is close to our thinking on the matter and is a slightly diluted version.  If the Minister feels this is what is appropriate and if he has got a legal opinion, obviously we will not stand in the way.  It is certainly a big improvement on the original definition and far more acceptable.  The fact that we now refer specifically to freedom of choice is very important.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the reference to section 37 (1) of the Bill in the Minister's amendment might have been separate because I would regard that as standing on its own.  The definition should also stand on its own but it does not raise any problems for me.  However, I am sure Senator Mulroy would agree that whilst we would prefer for the reasons given to have our own amendment we can understand the thinking behind the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 defines an &ldquo;insurance intermediary&rdquo; or &ldquo;intermediary&rdquo; to mean an insurance agent, an insurance broker or a person acting in any equivalent or corresponding capacity.  What exactly is meant by corresponding capacity?  I would have thought that the amendment could have <Col N="151" /> stopped at &ldquo;insurance broker&rdquo;, rather than adding &ldquo;a person acting in any equivalent or corresponding capacity&rdquo;.  I would like some further clarification as to why it is necessary.  Perhaps the Minister would advise me on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point Senator Fallon raised was in regard to the &ldquo;insurance agent&rdquo; definition and I assure the Senator it will not require insurers to rewrite their agency agreements.  I wish to state that categorically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  They will not be required to do so.  If they wish to do so, that is a commercial matter.  In regard to Senator Fallon and Senator Mulroy's amendment, I understand fully what the Senators are trying to achieve. With the technical expertise available in the Department and the draftsman's office we actually come closer to achieving what they want than they have found it possible to do.  The key word here is the word &ldquo;complete&rdquo;.  The Government amendment uses the phrase &ldquo;freedom of choice&rdquo;, while amendment No. 4 uses the phrase &ldquo;complete freedom of choice&rdquo;. Our difficulty is that legislation is interpreted very strictly and, as pointed out earlier, complete freedom of choice could be seen by somebody interpreting legislation as meaning that a person must have the full range of companies.  If that person were short one or two, a court might decide that there was not complete freedom of choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;complete&rdquo; is a very strong word in legislation like this where we are dealing with a situation where one can actually measure &ldquo;complete&rdquo;.  The danger of putting it in is that we could undo the very objective which we are trying to achieve, i.e. a substantial measure of independence.  I believe when we get to Part IV of the Bill Senators will see that we have gone to a considerable length to build an independent profession of insurance broker.  That is the import <Col N="152" /> of Part IV.  While I admire the aspiration behind amendment No. 4, the wording which we have finally crafted is more accurate and more likely to stand the test of time.  It is also an adapted version of the EC Council directive.  Both amendments are very close indeed, but I would be worried about putting in the word &ldquo;complete&rdquo; because that could have the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>The Senator asked me about corresponding capacity.  What we are trying to do here is throw the net wide so that we will prevent people who use other titles from getting around the legislative requirements and stipulations, for example, somebody who calls himself an insurance consultant, or a financial consultant, or financial adviser.  We want to make sure people in that area do not slip out of the legislative requirements laid on brokers because they do not call themselves brokers, as such.  They may call themselves consultants, or advisers, or use some other buzz words which are appearing in the financial services industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the insurance industry &ldquo;consultant&rdquo; is not defined.  It is either going to be &ldquo;insurance agent&rdquo; or &ldquo;insurance broker&rdquo;.  That is what the definition is. Whilst I understand the Minister's thinking totally, there is no mention of &ldquo;consultant&rdquo; within the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only limited by imagination and creativity.  If we look at the way the financial services industry has developed over the past decade or so, particularly in the past couple of years, the number of titles being used by people offering services is becoming quite vast. People are offering all sorts of quite sophisticated financial products to do with the whole range of financial services.  I had <Col N="153" /> no difficulty putting in &ldquo;insurance consultant&rdquo;. As soon as you do that you run the risk of forgetting about some other one or a new one is invented such as adviser, or non-executive adviser, or non-executive consultant.  It would go on and on and it could not be stopped.  We thought the phrase &ldquo;an equivalent or corresponding capacity&rdquo; would be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to amendment No. 1 and welcome the fact that the Minister deleted the word &ldquo;broker&rdquo; and substituted &ldquo;intermediary&rdquo; because I wondered how the Minister would catch an agent in the same way as a broker would be caught in relation to the definition of &ldquo;client&rdquo;.  The Minister has certainly plugged that loophole in relation to the definition of &ldquo;client&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 2, I am often puzzled by the fact that there is a category of people getting themselves involved in the sale of insurance or insurance intermediary activity who have absolutely no qualification or experience whatsoever.  They call themselves consultants and financial advisers and set up firms next door to their present place of practice, be it as accountants or solicitors. They call the new enterprise a financial services firm limited and seek to sell insurance and offer insurance policies to the public and establish a tied agency contract with a particular company.  I do not think the definitions in section 2 would satisfy me that we are embracing all those people who are going around the country <i>ad nauseam</i>, knocking on doors at all hours of the day and night and seeking to garner insurance business under the heading of insurance consultant, adviser, or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firms involved in the life assurance business have set up various sub-offices and they are advertising in local newspapers looking for people with little or no qualification, but who have a car, a nice demeanour and personality and seek to be employed selling life insurance policies on a cold canvass basis throughout the country.  I would ask the Minister if he has incorporated these people in the definitions so as to ensure that they will <Col N="154" /> have to comply with the necessary regulations, particularly under the Third Schedule of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify the reason for the amendments and the definitions of insurance agent, insurance broker and insurance intermediary which are now being proposed.  I am not sure that I fully understand the reason for the amendments proposed.  It is proposed by the amendments to define &ldquo;insurance broker&rdquo; in a manner which does not include the formula &ldquo;or a person acting in an equivalent or corresponding capacity.&rdquo;  That was in the original Bill but it will not be in the amendment.  We are also slightly altering the definition of insurance agent and again it does not include that formula &ldquo;or a person acting in an equivalent or corresponding capacity.&rdquo;  When we come to the insertion of this new definition of &ldquo;insurance intermediary&rdquo;, it is to be defined as &ldquo;an insurance agent, an insurance broker or a person acting in any equivalent or corresponding capacity.&rdquo;  Not being an expert in this area, I hasten to add, are we talking about four entities when we talk about an insurance intermediary? Are we talking about an insurance agent, or a person acting in an equivalent or corresponding capacity, or an insurance broker or a person acting in an equivalent or corresponding capacity?  If an insurance intermediary means any of these four categories, why do we not define &ldquo;broker&rdquo; and &ldquo;agent&rdquo; as including a person acting in an equivalent or corresponding capacity?</P>

      <P>First I will deal with Senator Hogan's points about people selling insurance products.  The position is that no matter what you call yourself there is a very clear line drawn, based on the number of agencies held.  If you hold more than five, no matter what you call yourself you are a broker.  If you hold fewer than five, no matter what you call yourself you are an agent.  The legislation defines the position in regard to brokers and agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the question of financial <Col N="155" /> protection and so on, when we come to the matter of bonding arrangements, it will be seen that we have made considerable progress in that area.  Section 48 of the Bill permits the Minister to lay down a code of conduct for all intermediaries. It would be our hope and intention to work on such a code of conduct and to produce it under the Bill. The code of conduct would deal with behaviour and the general manner in which the public are dealt with.  It would deal with the minutiae of the conduct of intermediaries <i>vis-à-vis</i> the customer and the person publicly.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson's point is related in the sense that we are not talking about four different types of people here.  Without getting bogged down in the wording, we are talking about agents and brokers. We are trying to develop on the one hand a professional body of insurance brokers and to bring forward legislation so that when the public approach an insurance intermediary they will know whether that person is a broker who acts for the customer and can offer the whole range of services to the customer across the board &mdash; so there is a protection element in that &mdash; or whether they are dealing with an agent who would have a smaller number of agencies and, basically, is a company's person.</P>
    <P>That was a fundamental decision to be taken in the whole Bill.  It was one of the reasons for the delay in the legislation. Part IV deals with all of that.  The Government took a policy decision to divide the waters into the building down the road after a two-year period of a broking profession, purely from the point of view that the public are entitled to know whether they are dealing with an independent profession who can offer the whole range of services, or whether they are dealing with people who are primarily representing individual companies. There are basically only two.  The reason it appears as if there are more is the tendency in recent years for people to call themselves other names like financial consultant or insurance consultant.  I am satisfied that the legislation makes that <Col N="156" /> clear but, if it does not, we will have a look at it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I did not make myself clear on the type of people I am speaking about.  I am talking about tied agents to companies who are in the life business, or they might have a particular agency with a life company.  They try to sell their life assurance to two, three, four or five people right around the country. They are people with no experience and very little training.  It is a hard sell for the general, unsuspecting public.  The person who hires those people might be classified as the insurance agent.  What safeguards are we putting into this Bill that will stamp out the indiscriminate sale of life assurance products right around the country?  Even though they are employed by an insurance agent they might have no experience or no agency themselves with an insurance company.  They are one step removed from the legislation.  Does the Minister know what I am talking about?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, share the frustration felt by Senator Hogan, because I have seen it over the years.  Anyone can sell life assurance.  It is unbelievable the kind of people I have seen selling life assurance to an unsuspecting public.  They have no knowledge of the insurance industry.  They have no knowledge of the kind of principles that the insurance industry adhere to.  Any Tom, Dick or Harry can set up, as Senator Hogan said, and sell life assurance in particular but also general insurance, and that is wrong. The Minister will say, and Senator Hogan will agree, that this is what this Bill is all <Col N="157" /> about.  The Minister hopes to resolve the problems and end the kind of mushrooming of agents and intermediaries that have been there in the past.  He hopes to stop people who have no knowledge of the industry selling insurance left, right and centre.  They may be given a two hour crash course and told to go off and sell endowment insurance, unit links, or whatever.  That is no longer on. That is what the Bill is about.  I hope this matter will be resolved at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Hogan regarding the tied agency.  That is in section 43 of the Bill.  We will discuss it when we come to it.  That is where the real cowboys are operating within the business.  The whole tied agency principle has to be examined in great detail.  From what I have seen of it throughout the country &mdash; and I am sure Senator Hogan and other Senators will agree &mdash; it is very, very unsatisfactory at present.  That is for another day.  I can understand Senator Hogan's concern.  I share that concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come back one more time to the definitions, in the light of the Minister's response to what I said.  The Minister has made it clear that it is intended to have two categories &mdash; the insurance broker and the insurance agent.  That is why I am puzzled that the amended definitions exclude from the definition of insurance broker or insurance agent the person who is acting in an equivalent or corresponding capacity.  When you come to the definition of an insurance intermediary &mdash; amendment No. 5 &mdash; it is proposed that &ldquo;insurance intermediary&rdquo; or &ldquo;intermediary&rdquo; means an insurance agent, an insurance broker or a person acting in any equivalent or corresponding capacity.  One could read that it was an insurance agent, an insurance broker, or a person acting in an equivalent or corresponding capacity to the insurance broker, but is it also a person acting in a corresponding or equivalent capacity to an insurance agent?  They are four types of people.  If you exclude from the definition of &ldquo;insurance broker&rdquo; a person <Col N="158" /> acting in an equivalent or corresponding capacity then you have got two different things.  You have got an insurance broker and a person acting in an equivalent or corresponding capacity.  They may both be insurance intermediaries, but they are not both insurance brokers.  Similarly, if you have got an insurance agent and a person acting in an equivalent or corresponding capacity, you have got two different things.  They may both be insurance intermediaries, but they are not both insurance agents.</P>
      <P>My real question is whether it would be possible to simplify the matter by including in the definition of &ldquo;insurance broker&rdquo;, as reconstituted here in amendment No. 3, the additional phrase &ldquo;or person acting in an equivalent or corresponding capacity but within the original definition&rdquo;.  Similarly, could it be included in the definition of insurance agent, and then the definition of insurance intermediary would be very simple?  It would mean an insurance agent or insurance broker, full stop, because those definitions would import a person acting in an equivalent or corresponding capacity.  It may be all semantics but it is very strange to use &ldquo;insurance intermediary&rdquo; to define categories that are not defined as primary categories.</P>

      <P>This is one we could have a long discussion on, particularly if the parliamentary draftsman were here. In section 2 (1) it is proposed that we say: &ldquo;insurance intermediary' or `intermediary' means an insurance agent, an insurance broker or a person acting in any equivalent or corresponding capacity&rdquo;. The advice we have from the draftsman's office is that does what we want to do, which is to ensure that it applies to both, and that if you are acting in an equivalent or corresponding capacity through an agent or a broker it locks you into one or both of those definitions.  It is meant to apply to both.  You could make an argument on an interpretational basis that it does not.  It is clearly our intention that it will apply to both.  The advice I have is that amendment No. 5 &mdash; insurance intermediary meaning an agent or a <Col N="159" /> broker or a person acting in an equivalent capacity &mdash; makes it clear that it applies to both.</P>

      <P>As I say, it is not an area I am familiar enough with on the ground to know if this is a significant difference.  Looking at it legally, it appears to me that the way in which the amendments approach the definition of the concept of insurance broker, insurance agent and insurance intermediary means that an insurance intermediary covers four potential categories of persons.  An insurance broker as defined, an insurance agent as defined, somebody who is recognised as not being an insurance broker but as somebody who is acting in an equivalent or corresponding capacity and somebody who is not an insurance agent but as somebody acting in a equivalent or corresponding capacity.  There may be some reason for concern about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a fairly technical amendment designed to maintain consistency with the wording used in section 31 of the Bill which refers to &ldquo;any benefit in kind.&rdquo;  The phrase &ldquo;benefit in kind&rdquo; is also used in a life commission's agreement operated by the Irish <Col N="161" /> Insurance Federation on a voluntary basis.  The powers in Part III of the Bill are intended as reserve powers to be used only if the voluntary market self-regulation of commission levels does not continue to operate satisfactorily in the future, in which case it is considered desirable to refer to benefits in kind, which is a commonly used description in relation to non-monetary assistance provided from time to time by insurers to intermediaries.</P>
      <P>The amendment will also cater for commissions paid indirectly by virtue of the new phrase, or on behalf of the holder.  That is to maintain consistency with the provisions of section 45 of the Bill.  The words &ldquo;in respect of work carried out by the intermediary&rdquo; are also being deleted by the amendment so as to ensure that indemnity commission, which is commission paid by an insurer in advance of any work being done by the intermediary, is also covered by the powers vested in the Minister to control commission levels, if necessary.  This will clarify absolutely that the commission controls in Part III of the Bill will include all payments by insurers in advance of any work actually carried out by an intermediary; for example, contributions by an insurer to an intermediary's start-up costs.  The intention here is to provide a definition which will ensure that all payments in whatever form will be reckonable as commission.  I trust that, among other things, this amendment will meet Senator Hogan's intention, for example, in framing his own amendment to that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has brought forward this amendment.  I was extremely concerned that no reference was made in the definition of commission payment to the many auxiliary features of the insurance business which assisted people over the years in order to provide a certain level of customer satisfaction and insurance company satisfaction from the point of view of the agent or the broker.  You had situations where you had what was known as &ldquo;indemnity commission&rdquo; of a certain amount of the <Col N="162" /> annual commission paid up front to a particular insurance intermediary.  This, of course, was a facility offered by various life assurance companies in particular who wanted their product promoted more heavily than the product of their competitors.  Relationships were developed between insurance intermediaries and life offices in order to boost the sales of their particular product.  It often took the form of holidays, loan facilities, office expenses or secretarial expenses.</P>
      <P>There is one part which also forms part of the life offices agreement which I welcome &mdash; and the Minister called for it on a number of occasions.  It is that the life offices themselves should introduce a self-regulatory code of discipline in order to streamline the entire operation of these particular incentives, to eliminate them and to have all life offices and commission payments and benefits in kind on an even keel.  I am glad to say that the life offices heeded the Minister's appeal. They came together last August and drew up a very comprehensive package of agreed procedures.  They were very certain about one aspect of what we would call &ldquo;benefit in kind&rdquo; to which I would draw your attention, namely, the technology aspect.</P>
      <P>We are living in an age of great improvements in technology.  Many insurance intermediaries and brokers will be introducing computerisation into their offices, whereby they will be able to link with various general insurance companies and life insurance companies in order to get on-the-spot quotations and up-to-date information in relation to the best available product for the customer and for their client.  I would ask the Minister to clarify the position in relation to technology arrangements that would from time to time be entered into between insurance companies and insurance intermediaries. Does this come under the heading of &ldquo;benefit in kind&rdquo; under the amendment being proposed here this evening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to query this amendment.  Commission payment <Col N="163" /> has a meaning given to it in subsection (3).  It is defined.  The words &ldquo;benefit in kind&rdquo; could have different meanings and I ask the Minister if he would consider that it, too, should be properly defined in the Bill.  Benefit in kind is also referred to in section 31 (1) of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Senator Hogan that any assistance of the nature you describe would be deemed benefit in kind.  Any assistance over and above the ordinary commission which would be seen to be in place of, or additional to, the ordinary commission would be deemed to be benefit in kind.  Senator Fallon also made the same point.  We have not sought to define the phrase &ldquo;benefit in kind&rdquo; in the legislation.  We are relying on the commonly used description and the commonly used interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;benefit in kind&rdquo;.  This is not an argument for saying one should define every word in the Bill.  The phrase is well known and most people understand its meaning.  It is not obviously a technical term.  Benefit in kind, as is commonly used, will suffice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly familiar with &ldquo;benefit in kind&rdquo; in the social welfare field, for example.  It seems as though there is a narrowing here of what is constituted in &ldquo;benefit in kind&rdquo; because section 2 (3) (a) as it stands says a commission payment for the purpose of this Act is a payment, including a commission or other remuneration, reward or benefit in kind.  It has to be benefit in kind that is of a payment nature.  It seems to me, if I understood Senator Hogan's intervention, that he was talking about broader potential benefits than just matters which were the subject of actual payments. It does seems, on the wording as we now have it, that the benefit in kind must come in the form in some way of a payment to the person and, therefore, it might not be a technology advance, or whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Robinson for her intervention because she has certainly reminded me <Col N="164" /> of another point.  The fact that the word &ldquo;payment&rdquo; is only mentioned in the subsection we are dealing with causes me even more distress, in that it was referred to earlier on in the form of the inducements and the indemnity commissions, the holidays in the sun and the other inducements which have been introduced by various insurance companies and they may be excluded from the definition of &ldquo;commission&rdquo; payment or may be included in another section of the Bill.  I want clarification on it at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator wants clarification of the precise area covered by &ldquo;benefit in kind&rdquo;?  Section 2 (3) (a) says that it is benefit in kind, and so on, in connection with the insurance business of the holder, so clearly if there are non-monetary inducements of any description, which are additional to the ordinary payment situation between the insurer and the intermediary and it is in connection with the insurance business of the holder, that would be deemed to be benefit in kind.  The difficulty I have in trying to define &ldquo;benefit in kind&rdquo; is the difficulty in finding an exhaustive list of &ldquo;benefits in kind&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I do not know that it is defined.  I am just inquiring as to whether it is defined in the Finance Act, or in the taxation legislation.  I do not believe it is.  I will certainly check that point.  Perhaps there is a definition that we can use.  I have no difficulty in defining it if there is a neat definition, but I do not want to get into a long list of &ldquo;benefits in kind&rdquo;.  That would be totally impossible.</P>

      <P>I certainly look forward to the Minister's reply on Report Stage.  If he feels an amendment is necessary on Report Stage perhaps he would initiate it himself.  He will be aware of our concern in relation to the definition of commission payment and benefit in kind.  If he needs to bring forward a definition of benefit in kind, a nice neat one might be helpful.  If there is not one available, the list could <Col N="165" /> be endless.  Government amendment No. 6 is certainly satisfactory to me, broadly speaking, for what I want achieved in my own amendment of No. 7 and I will withdraw amendment No. 7 accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the scope of benefit in kind, I do not think you can take benefit in kind out of context. It has to be seen in the context of section 2 (3) (a).  Section 2 (3) (a) defines commission payment as a &ldquo;payment including...&rdquo; and it goes on.  If it were intended, as Senator Hogan hopes, to have a broader scope for benefit in kind, it would seem as though it would be appropriate to amend that by having it as a payment or provision including commission or other remuneration, reward or benefit in kind paid or payable or provided by the holder.  Then you can have a broader identification of what amounts to benefit in kind.  It is not just a payment of some kind.  It can be some other goody of a technological or other nature.  It does not matter what you are defining as commission payment, because payment can be defined broadly as included in the provision of something that is not a payment, as long as it is so defined.  As it is defined at present, it would seem to me, looking at it narrowly and legalistically, that benefit in kind is very narrowly cast to being some kind of payment as such, but if the Minister is advised otherwise, then so be it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 2, if I could just refer to the definitions of insurer and the person who is authorised, the insurer is defined as meaning the holder of an authorisation under the regulations of 1976 or the regulations of 1984.  These are the EC regulations under the European Communities Act of 1972.  I think I am correct in saying that authorisation incorporates, in effect, section 9 of the 1936 Act.  Is that not correct?  Therefore, if a person is not authorised under section 9 of the 1936 Act he would not be authorised as an insurer.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  It is referred to in the reference to the Insurance Act 1980-1989.  To some extent that covers some of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>My next question &mdash; and this is really why I wanted clarification on that &mdash; is on the definitions and the authorisation.  What is the position of a person who takes out insurance with a United Kingdom or a Northern Ireland company and does not ask the question, or is not aware, of whether that company is an authorised company?  As I understand it, authorised under the European Communities Regulations, because they incorporate section 9 of the 1936 Act, means that the foreign insurance company, either UK or Northern Ireland in my example, would have to have a branch here, so if a person is offered insurance in the post from a UK company, or a Northern Ireland company and takes out insurance, and if that UK company are authorised under the British implementation of those directives, why cannot they do that?  Surely if we are going to <Col N="167" /> comply with European Community law they should be in a position to offer the services here without establishing a branch and be in a position to do business. The consumer should be in a position to enter into business with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is mainly because the EC law on this matter is not harmonised. There is not a &ldquo;freedom of service&rdquo; directive agreed at Council of Ministers level or EC level yet.  The question of somebody getting insurance in Northern Ireland is not supposed to occur.  If it does occur, there may be a legal question as to the validity of the transaction or the policy.  There is not a &ldquo;freedom of services&rdquo; directive so as such, we have not got that far.  It would need that directive to be agreed at EC level for us to harmonise the insurance law generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could just pursue that a little further, is that in fact the position?  As I understand it, there is a proposal for an insurance services directive. Certainly the Minister is correct in that but, pending a directive being implemented, is it not the case, under the case law of the Court of Justice, particularly the case the Commission brought against Germany, that freedom to provide services is a directly applicable provision of community law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, even without a services directive, it may not be open to us to require, as a precondition of doing business in this part of Ireland, that an insurance company should have established a branch here.  If that is so, it would be better if we tackled that issue in the definition of this Insurance Bill &mdash; we do not have Insurance Bills very often &mdash; and addressed the question of whether the provision for authorisation is compatible with the Community law on the freedom to provide services.  I would have some doubt as to whether an authorisation, which will only be given if you establish an actual branch here, where companies are authorised in their own member state under the directive to offer <Col N="168" /> the particular type of insurance, can be kept out or not be authorised entities to operate here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Court of Justice did recognise, in the particular case the Senator refers to, the sensitivities in the area.  They also recognised and made it clear in their judgment that there was an unharmonised state in regard to the freedom of services area.  It is for that very reason that the EC at Council of Ministers level and at Commission level have been trying to make some progress in that whole area.  Until such time as we get that freedom of services directive I suppose there will continue to be a lot of grey areas and difficulties.  The Court of Justice recognised, in their judgment, the particular sensitivities and the general difficult area the Senator describes.</P>
      <P>I do not know what more I can say to the Senator other than that the services directive is being worked on and this country is active in developing it at EC level with other countries.  In the meantime there is obviously a grey area and it will remain so until we agree to a services directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of authorisation under the European Communities Regulations, incorporating section 9 of the 1936 Act, is unique to Irish law.  We do not have a similar provision, for example, in the United Kingdom where they have similar approaches to this general law.  It goes back to an earlier period and an earlier time.  What is of more concern at this stage is that the consumer would have access to choices in insurance policies, choices in approaches to insurance.  The Court of Justice recognised, in the Commission against Germany case, that this was a mass market and that there might be a need, in the interim pending a services directive, for some concern on the part of member states.  I do not have the judgment here so I cannot quote from it but, as I recall it, the judgment did not go so far as to have as a provision of authorisation or licensing that a person should become established through a <Col N="169" /> branch in a member state.  There was simply a very general recognition by the Court of Justice of the nature of the mass market in question.</P>
      <P>I am unhappy about us having definitions in an Insurance Bill, which we are debating in 1988, which seem to me to raise difficult issues of possible conflict with the freedom to provide services. Companies which are clearly authorised in their own member state, in compliance with the Community Regulations Directive, which are authorised to do business, cannot provide services in this country unless they satisfy an authorisation here, which means that they must establish a branch to do it.  That seems to me to be very worrying as far as compatibility with European Community law is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be worrying but it is the actual situation as it is on the ground in that we have an establishment regime here.  As the Senator rightly states, you must have a branch here to establish business here.  The UK and the Netherlands have a freedom of services regime.  I do not know what we can do about that.  In legislation like this you can avoid defining &ldquo;insurer&rdquo; until you make some progress on the directive.  I think it is unwise to do that.  All we are doing here is saying that &ldquo;insurer&rdquo; means the holder of an authorisation under the regulations.  It is a very appropriate definition just to define the insurer as the holder of such an authorisation under either of those regulations.  It is the minimum we could do in a Bill such as this in attempting to define &ldquo;insurer&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously when we make progress on the freedom of services directive that will have to be subsequently incorporated into domestic legislation.  I am told that the Court of Justice drew a distinction between large commercial concerns and mass risk insurances in terms of the protections needed under national law.  The court recognised that a form of authorisation may be necessary for mass risks insurances.  It is a developing area.  The Senator will be aware that, on the one hand, we must try to get competition in the industry and, on the other hand, we <Col N="170" /> must try to give the industry, because of its peculiar structure here, time to adapt to a full free and open competition situation. It is for that reason that we have negotiated some postponement of total competition, not so much in this area but in the other side of the business.  It is a developing area, obviously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to take up time unduly on this.  The Minister put his finger on it when he said we are operating an establishment regime.  I doubt that we are entitled to continue to operate an establishment regime in the area of provision of insurance services.  I recognise the indication in the judgment of the Court of Justice that there may be a need for some kind of authorisation, but some kind of authorisation does not go so far as to say that you must be established.</P>
      <P>That is the real problem.  That is where the continued application of section 9 of the 1936 Act is certainly questionable.  It is something that should be looked at very closely in the context of the Bill we are adopting at the moment.  It could have a close scrutiny by the Minister and a requirement that certain conditions were met, but the way in which we have adopted and adapted the two Council directives in 1976 and 1984 goes much further by incorporating the system of authorisation under section 9 of the 1936 Act which, in effect, requires that a company which is going to do business here of that kind must establish a branch.  Having made the point, if the Minister does not accept that it would be appropriate to amend it in the definition section of this Bill, I do not think I can push the point much further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be unhelpful but it is too big a problem for me to tackle in this legislation because it is such a fluid and developing area.  For example, we have never been challenged under section 9 by any other country or EC institution.  Our present method of operation, of having the establishment regime here, has not been challenged. <Col N="171" /> My understanding of the way the harmonisation process works throughout the institutions is that you run with, develop and work the existing structure until such time as you reach agreement to change it.  So long as we are in the process of harmonisation and working with other countries to harmonise the insurance industry, I would not expect to be challenged in regard to the present structure.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect to it which the Senator has not touched on.  There are very good, sound, national financial reasons for the establishment requirement here.  If the Senator looked at it very closely she would conclude and agree with me that to overthrow that in any unstructured or unplanned way would be quite chaotic and would not be in the national financial interests.  There are very good, sound, national reasons for this.  It has not been challenged.  We are playing a full part in the harmonisation process and when we reach conclusions, that is the time to put it into our legislation and to develop our legislative process.  It would be premature to do it now.  We have got to live with the definitions which are to hand and that is the one that is to hand just now without taking account of the incoming tide which I think would be premature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to pursue one aspect of it, certainly, I can well understand the useful protection to the Irish sector that the requirement of establishing a branch would afford.  I can understand the reasons why that was very important in 1936 and why it may still have considerable weight as an argument. I raised this question, as the Minister will recall &mdash; and perhaps this question has not really been answered &mdash; because I am concerned about the person who is offered insurance particularly from either Northern Ireland or Britain because a lot of this insurance is now offered by post.  The person may be totally unaware that he cannot enter into it and take it up.  What are the protections <Col N="172" /> and what are the safeguards and how far can they be pursued at present in relation to such an individual?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>All that I can say on that is if somebody places business like that, it may be judged by a court not to be legal.  How the consumer is supposed to be aware of that is obviously a good question and a different one in many ways.  The whole area of one's knowledge of the law is raised here.  It may be judged by a court of law to be illegal.  The Court of Justice &mdash; to go back to that for a moment &mdash; could very well decide.  I would not like to be challenged in the Court of Justice on this just now because it is evolving so quickly.  Anybody who probed it too much might be asking for trouble.  It is going in such a direction that I am satisfied and the Government are satisfied the industry here can live with and develop with.  If somebody places business elsewhere and gets into difficulty because of that obviously you are into a very tricky legal situation where all of this problem could come up.  It might not simply be a matter of just not having known the law.  You might end up in a major legal battle going right back to the Court of Justice on the whole thing. That, to my knowledge, has not happened yet.</P>

      <P>Section 3 of the Bill is dealing with the general question of <Col N="173" /> penalties and fines and making it an offence to provide false or misleading information to the Minister and that whole area.  This is obviously again a somewhat technical amendment which is necessary for the following reason: section 3 of the Bill provides for offences and penalties as I said.  However, there are existing penalty provisions in section 109 of the Insurance Act of 1936.  It is necessary because of section 14 of the Interpretation Act, 1937, dealing with offences under two or more laws, to state that the provisions of this section are without prejudice to section 109 of the Insurance Act, 1936.  I am advised by the Government's legal advisers that this is the way to proceed.</P>

    <Title>Freedom of Information Bill, 1988: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue of freedom of information is an important and complex area.  I commend Senator Ryan for bringing the Bill before the Oireachtas.  It gives us an opportunity to express our thoughts on the issue at this time.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments obviously have been aware of the need for a well-informed electorate and do provide a considerable amount of information for the public on the operation of government. There are devices within the parliamentary system, obviously that lead to the disclosure of more and more information, for example in the other House, parliamentary questions, in both Houses adjournment debates and, of course, the proceedings of various committees, like the Committee of Public Accounts, and the Joint Committee on Commercial and State-Sponsored Bodies, of which I am a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is already addressed through the Data Protection Bill, 1987, which is before the Dáil at present.  To the extent that Senator Ryan may, for example, like to see that Bill improved or whatever, there will be an opportunity to discuss that Bill when it reaches the Seanad after the Dáil has completed its deliberations.  We will have a chance to discuss Part III of the Bill before us on personal privacy and data protection, <Col N="175" /> which is the subject of a Government measure in the Dáil now.</P>
    <P>The more complex area relates to disclosure of information itself.  This could be regarded as rather separate from data protection.  The key issue here is what might be exempt or not.  In the Bill Senator Ryan recognises this problem and, in fact, has exempt information under section 13.  The concern I have in reading the Bill &mdash; I am not a lawyer &mdash; is that when you read section 13 in conjunction with sections 14 and 15, it raises the question straight away as to what information would, in fact, be really exempt particularly in relation to access to that information by the Oireachtas and its committees.</P>
    <P>Clearly what is involved here is the striking of a balance between the rights of access to information and the dominant or wider public interest.  That public interest would not be served if the security of the State were impaired, or if the administration of justice were compromised, or if the commercial secrets entrusted to the State by the Government agencies were in turn compromised. Senator Ryan clearly attempts to exempt these areas except, of course, that a very considerable amount of information will be available to the Oireachtas and to its committees.  I continue to have the concern that, while the question of exemption is identified and provided for in section 13, it seems that section 13, when linked to sections 14 and 15, does not provide the kind of protection I think would be necessary in achieving the overall balance I have already referred to as between access to information and the public interest.</P>
    <P>One could argue that the Government are uniquely positioned to identify this balance given their access to the whole range of Government administration and issues.  Certain issues can be specifically exempted.  Cabinet papers were mentioned in the course of the debate the last day, and the content of Cabinet papers would be exempt.  Take the budget for example.  The budget is something we normally think about as containing very <Col N="176" /> sensitive type of information and very sensitive issues.  If the Cabinet papers in relation to budgetary matters were indeed exempt, there is a whole plethora of budgetary material in the non-Cabinet area and files in the Department of Finance and what about the sensitivity of disclosing such information?</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to say these few words on the Bill.  Senator Ryan has undoubtedly highlighted a very important area.  A Bill, however, would have to be workable and the public interest would have to be protected.  That raises the question as to whether the Government can produce a Bill that would meet the necessity to protect sensitive Government information.</P>
    <P>In summary, I feel that personal privacy issue is catered for in the Government's Data Protection Bill now before the Dáil, and which we will get an opportunity to debate here.  Freedom of information I regard as a very complex separate issue requiring profound examination by the Government who have access to all the material and all the issues that are involved.  I would wish, therefore, to be positive about the Bill in the context of freedom of information in principle and I ask the Minister what is the state of the Government's mind or Government thinking at present on freedom of information?  If this requires further examination and further investigation I would certainly welcome any indication that the Government are going to give the type of priority which past Governments have not given to the issue of freedom of information.  It has not been a top priority and there has not been this profound examination by any Government in the past.  I would like to see that happen and I think the Bill before us may serve as a stimulus to movement in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I must make a slightly political point to Senator Hillery, in that probably the most revolutionary act of any Government in recent years towards providing greater freedom of information was the decision to open the Cabinet papers, the archives, <Col N="177" /> taken by Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach back in the middle-seventies.  Further &mdash; speaking perhaps more professionally than as a politician &mdash; I welcome very much the Archives Bill which was brought in by the last Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, and which he personally guided through both Houses and which lays down very important guidelines as to how public papers and State papers will be processed, will be archived and will be made available to the public.  These were two very important developments which were very significant.  However, that said, probably they are not central to the discussion on the core of this Bill this evening.</P>
      <P>It is a Bill which bears very little resemblance to its author, because it is a Bill which I find to be conservative, moderate and indeed eminently reasonable in all ways.  It is a Bill which, if enacted, would bring us up to date with developments in some of the European countries, some of the European democracies.  It would leave us still very far behind the developments in the legislation of the US which, perhaps, goes too far for most people but, none the less, is a very interesting example of what should be available to a citizen in an open democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation, if passed, would put us way ahead of the UK.  It is frightening to observe many of the developments in the UK under this present regime, where there seems to be a very conscious, deliberate attempt by the Executive to claw into powers which were traditionally reserved to the Judiciary or to Parliament itself.  It will certainly lead to a climate of opinion which I believe will be injurious, and is injurious to many questions of civil liberty, among which the right to know is one of the more important.  We have seen all of this surface in recent times in the <i>Spycatcher</i> and allied sagas there.  It is something which I believe is doing profound harm to the whole fabric of democracy in that country.  I must also be fair to the British tradition, a tradition of openness and investigation in the better sections of the British media.  We in this country, either on our television, radio, or in our newspapers, have not matched <Col N="178" /> them at the top ends of the British market.</P>
    <P>When we compare ourselves as a parliament, under the heading of the right to know and access to information, we compare very poorly with the established practices in the House of Commons. They are well established.  We find a series of very powerful investigative committees which have the right to send for Minister, to question Ministers, to send for civil servants, to send for papers.  We saw, for example, in the celebrated Westland affair a couple of years ago the way in which some of the top Ministers were brought in &mdash; there were even questions of sending for the Prime Minister herself &mdash; and where the Ministers were forced to answer to their peers in the public interest about their discharge of public duties.</P>
    <P>One of the sad aspects of the current parliamentary session is the way in which the initiative taken in the development of committees under the last Government has been allowed to atrophy.  Not alone has there been no development of the committee system but, indeed, most of the then existing committees were not re-established and it is virtually not possible for Members of either House to ask questions about the discharge of public business by the Government.  It is impossible to sit down in a detailed way to cross examine and to question the public service about the way in which they carry out their work.</P>
    <P>This is a conservative Bill and it shows a great deal of realism and commonsense on the part of Senator Ryan in being a conservative Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator is happy to see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always happy to see a conversion no matter how surprising and short lived it may prove to be.  This Bill in its origin is like the Third French Republic.  If it was to exist at all it had to be conservative; there was no other way it could come into existence.  Senator Ryan knows that, in a community like ours, a <Col N="179" /> very radical measure which would provide very major departures in rights of access would not have much chance of success and consequently and very wisely he has produced this very sober, moderate measure here this evening.</P>
      <P>When we think of this whole subject, to persons in their twenties, people who have grown up with the computer revolution and the information revolution, the need for this legislation probably is obvious and straightforward.  For those of my generation, the pen and ink brigade, it is probably a case one has to argue with one's friends and contemporaries.  For those of an older generation it is probably very difficult to comprehend.  We have seen over the past number of years this extraordinary revolution in the provision of information, information which would not have existed, would not have been needed, could not have been conceived of 30, 40 or 50 years ago.  What this has meant is that all of us are vulnerable in a variety of ways, sinister ways, to the misuse of this information which becomes available.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that there are large numbers of unscrupulous persons and agencies who are quite willing to use this information or to abuse the availability of this information, whether it be for financial gain, whether it be for blackmail, whether it be for whatever reason. There is a growing need to ensure that, as far as possible, individuals and institutions are protected.  It is that desire to ensure that we move at least towards achieving this goal which lies behind this Bill.  It is an objective which all of us would share.</P>
      <P>Senator Hillery was right to ask the Minister if he would indicate the mind of the Government on this issue.  There may not be very many votes in this issue; there may not be even much awareness but I am quite certain that four or five years down the line, we may very well regret if this Bill is not taken seriously and if it is not seen as the first step in important developments in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there is a need for care.  Of course, we have to be very careful about <Col N="180" /> the type of information which we make available.  I believe, and, I am sure Senator Murphy could confirm this for me, that, for example, in the making available of information from the public records office the names of Fenian informers, 100 years ago plus, are not made available, the names of police spies and so forth are not made available because we are a country with a very long memory.  If that information were made available, the third, fourth and fifth generation descendants of these people could be damaged.  That may be an extreme example of the sort of information which should never be made public.</P>
    <P>I would like to give an example from my own experience of the way in which information and the withholding of information can be very damaging.  It goes back quite some years ago.  A student of mine at University College, Dublin &mdash; it is a very good example of how insidious this absence of access to information can be &mdash; he was a very good student.  I had given him a very good degree, given him reference after reference.  He applied for a job with the public service.  He had passed the medical tests.  This meant that, to all intents and purposes, he had been accepted and the medical test was normally a formality.  It meant that he had passed.  Yet every time he went for a job after the medical test, different Departments came back with a note saying he had been rejected.</P>
    <P>Professor Brian Farrell, a colleague of mine and I fought this case.  We knew there was something fundamentally wrong with what was happening and eventually we were told, after much perseverance, that this person was being rejected by the public service for security reasons.  We knew the fellow fairly well. We knew he was a reasonably harmless sort of individual and it struck us as strange that there should have been some security objection to his coming into the public service.  There was some further probing on our part and eventually we were told he had connections with a subversive organisation.  At this stage, finally, we got access to the Minister and eventually what transpired was that this <Col N="181" /> fellow had been at a number of student demonstrations.  He wore a duffle coat, read the <i>New Statesman</i> and probably had read James Joyce as well&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>He certainly had been seen by some Special Branch people in strange company, probably with some university lecturers, I do not know, but he was dubbed at that time as a subversive. His name entered the police files as a person who had subversive tendencies, or was associated with subversives, or was a member of some subversive organisation.</P>
      <P>At that stage and, this is factual, the NUJ was even regarded as a subversive organisation partly because members of the NUJ were seen turning up at all sorts of strange fringe events.  The frightening thing about this was that we were able in this case to assure the Minister that the information on the files was not correct, that this person was not a subversive, but it was only because we pushed the case as far as we could go that we got the situation reversed.  I wonder how many people there are who were rejected for places in the public service because their name appeared on some file.  This file may not have been verified.  The information initially may have been exaggerated.  It may have been incorrect.  It may even have been put in maliciously.  We never know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is simply the absence of the right to know which can lead to a frightening situation like this.  We do not know what intelligence there is.  We do not know if it has been updated.  We do not know the quality of the intelligence.  We do not know whether there was a malicious intent.  Clearly there is a great deal of information which must be kept secret, but there must be some appeal mechanism. An appeal mechanism does not necessarily mean that the information has to be made public, but at least those who gather the information must ensure that it can be verified and that somebody is not having an injustice done to them, an <Col N="182" /> injustice which can last their entire life time because of the type of incident, a very well-documented incident, which I have just related.</P>
    <P>This Bill addresses itself to that most fundamental of democratic rights, the right to know, the right to privacy, the right to protection.  As I mentioned earlier, the potential for the invasion of privacy in this computer age is frightening. The possibility of people being manipulated is ever present.  Before we can even come to tackle this problem we almost have to think ourselves out of the old modes, the old ways of looking at information, information as always a good thing, information as a tool for progress, for change or for whatever, and come to think of information now, the power which it places in the hands of those who control it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not a comprehensive Bill in that it does not set out to be the last word on the subject.  I do not think Senator Ryan would even pretend that it is. Nevertheless, he had done us all a great service, for example, in drawing attention to the number of public reports which were never published.  Reports were commissioned in the public interest, at public expense to help towards some public objective which then, because the results did not suit the Government or the public service of the day, were left unpublished.  He mentioned these.  He could have mentioned a few more of them.  He could have mentioned, for example, the SKC report into the reorganisation of the Garda Síochána over a decade ago.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it is not possible to go into the details of the Bill.  Perhaps it is not even necessary because I doubt that the Government will accept it, but its publication is a gesture and an important one.  It is an issue which this House could deal with in detail and deal with very effectively, indeed.  It is the type of issue on which, if we would invite in outside experts and interested groups, the quality of the ultimate legislation could be very high and very lasting indeed.  This House has the capacity to come up with a balanced and valuable Bill.  I know this will <Col N="183" /> not happen.  I know the Government does not accept Private Members' Bills.  That tradition has been broken in the Dáil by the present Government and it would be a very important gesture if they were to break that tradition in this House this evening by allowing this Bill to pass its Second Reading, bring it into Committee, refer it to a specialist committee which could send for outside expert information and then finally present it to the Dáil as a Bill which is eminently worth putting on our Statute Book.  Again, I salute Senator Ryan for bringing in this Bill.  I think it is one which would enhance our Statute Book, enrich the quality of life of the ordinary citizen and our Government would not lose in public esteem were they to accept Second Stage this evening.</P>

      <P>I simply want to put myself on the record as entirely supporting Senator Ryan's initiative.  I shall be very brief.  Our traditional society in Ireland has been a particularly secretive one.  That may well have to do with the rural way of living, perhaps, or more likely, the historical circumstances in which a large part of the population was alienated from the governing powers, so that there was a total dichotomy, as it were, between society and Government. In those circumstances where society had to evade the law and had to have recourse to all kinds of strategems to cope with oppression, it is understandable that a kind of mentality grew up which expressed itself in such peasant saws as: &ldquo;Say what you like, say nothing&rdquo;, or &ldquo;What you do not know, will not trouble you.&rdquo;  That does characterise the kind of society which Ireland was up to quite recently, at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I echo Senator Manning's observations about the historian's view of this in that we are glad that at long last access to archives has been granted here, but even the reluctance up to that point again illustrates what I am saying.  There was a reluctance to make records available.  I think again on the principle that well it was just as well to keep them locked up. <Col N="184" /> Perhaps there were particular circumstances there again having to do with the Civil War, for example.  As Senator Manning pointed out, in all countries there is a prudent selectivity in operation when documents are released to historians. If any documents can incriminate people or can lead to any kind of trouble involving present generations, such documents are properly withheld.  That illustrates the principle, of course, that availability of information is and must always be tempered by prudence.</P>
    <P>Up to a particular point, Irish historians were disadvantaged and still are disadvantaged when compared with the rich material which is available to them from other sources.  In fact, one of the problems in writing Irish history and, of course, it largely remains to be written since we had to make do for the most part with mythology up to now is that they have to draw disproportionately on foreign archives.  Frequently for something that happened in Ireland we have to depend disproportionately on the Cabinet sources in Whitehall or, perhaps the archives in the State Department in Washington.  To some extent at least that has been remedied, but it is still notable that the records which have been released tell us comparatively less than the corresponding records elsewhere.  It was, indeed, a principle of Mr. de Valera in his long years in office that, the less you put down in the nature of Cabinet minutes, the better.  Again I suggest this illustrates the kind of peasant mentality about which I am talking.</P>
    <P>The public interest is too easily invoked in this matter.  Senator Hillery very properly observed that a balance has to be maintained in the right of access to information and in the public interest.  The public interest is a very vague kind of commodity which may be cited in far too facile a manner.  What it suggests is that we in power know better; we know better than you and we will keep this information under wraps, as it were.  When the public interest is cited without any real explanation it can lead to the kind of situation which you have increasingly in <Col N="185" /> what I might call Thatcherite political culture where the public interest is cited <i>per se</i> as an adequate reason for immoral actions and for the refusal to proceed according to the proper principles of democracy.  We have seen at least one example of that in recent weeks.  The citation of the national interest without any proper development of that is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I would be appalled if the attitude of the Government and the Government party to this Bill was simply to give Senator Ryan a pat on the head and say: &ldquo;That is a very good thing you thought of but leave it to us.  We are much better equipped and we have the resources and personnel to deal with it.&rdquo;  What that means is that the attempt would be to put it to one side indefinitely.  I support Senator Manning's plea that the adult way to treat this Bill is to allow Second Stage to proceed and to be completed and then to have the Government coming in with their resources on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We are talking here ultimately about the principle of an open society.  We may even be talking about something much more fundamental.  Never in political history were people under so much scrutiny from their Governments.  Never did Big Brother watch us so much and I think we need the safeguard of being able to watch Big Brother as well.  We are all aware that in some respects this political society, this polity in which we live, is a very sick one and that part of the sickness is the alienation of a large section of people from the process of parliamentary democracy.  They do not know what is going on; they think that what is going on has nothing to do with them.  There is that very dangerous indifference or fatalism among large sections of our population.</P>
    <P>Our democracy is by no means a full one or a perfect one.  The reason freedom of information is available in other democracies is that they are more developed than ours.  They are less paternalistic. They have thrown off that paternalism in Church and State which is so much a characteristic of Irish society <Col N="186" /> and they are on the way to a fuller and more participatory and more meaningful democracy.  That is another good reason for supporting Senator Ryan's Bill.</P>
    <P>Thomas Davis is often quoted for nationalist purposes.  I like always to recall the most significant of his maxims which he uttered for a particular propaganda reason but which I think has very large application: &ldquo;Educate that you may be free.&rdquo;  I would say that what this Bill suggests to us is that you should say to people: &ldquo;Be informed that you may be free&rdquo;.  Daniel O'Connell used to enjoin his audiences to &ldquo;Know your grievances, know your wrongs&rdquo; and that is vital to a properly functioning democracy.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to Senator Ryan.  In my years in the Seanad I never had the opportunity, or perhaps never had the determination indeed, to take this kind of commendable step.  I think it is of the essence of the lifeblood of Parliament and of this House and I commend him highly for it.  I trust that the Government will take him seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party group in the Seanad, I want to welcome the fact that an Independent Member of the Seanad has introduced this Freedom of Information Bill, 1988. Like Senator Murphy, I would like to put on record our appreciation of the obvious work and detail Senator Ryan has put into the Bill.  It would be a major breakthrough if, in the interests of the freedom of an open society which we hope we represent in the Seanad, the Government were to agree in principle to the passing of the Second Stage of this Bill here tonight.  It would be a major achievement for the Government.  It would certainly be complimentary to the Independent Senator who obviously put a lot of legal and hard work into the preparation of this Bill with limited resources.  The Government have available to them expertise which people on this side of the House do not have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a major achievement to arrive at a stage where we have a Bill containing 41 sections all dealing with specific areas of information all of us feel should be <Col N="187" /> available as of right to members of the public, particularly if that information is garnered by the Government, by the State, or by public bodies.  Most of us accept the absolute right of people to have access to information, in particular information relevant to themselves.  Most of us accept that as a human right, as a basic right.  If the Government have individual problems with individual sections, they will find that people on this side of the House will be open to reasonable amendments which would improve this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government have been open and frank with us concerning legislation in this House which we have amended for the betterment of the Bill.  When all our minds and efforts come together in dealing with legislation in this House &mdash; and that happened during the term of office of the former Government and this Government &mdash; legislation has been improved by its very passage through this House.  What a wonderful thing it would be if the Government were to accept the Bill and were amenable to accepting amendments.  Why should they not repeat that procedure in reverse?  Why should not the Government accept this Bill in principle.  I have read all the sections of the Bill.  It is a reasonable Bill.</P>
    <P>They are reasonable exemptions and exceptions to some of the requirements in some of the sections in the interests of the public and the security of the State. Fundamentally I see nothing wrong with the philosophy that people should have a right to information.  I exhort the Minister to be generous enough to allow a fine legislative document to at least complete Second Stage in this House.  Then we could have an excellent Committee Stage debate where amendments could be fought and argued from the Government's side or otherwise to help to improve the Bill.</P>
    <P>That is all I would like to say on the Bill because it is technical.  I accept the principle of what Senator Ryan proposes to do and I support it.  The Labour Party are totally supportive of it and any assistance we can give on Committee Stage <Col N="188" /> will be given.  I am sure Senator Ryan is open to suggestions from all sides of the House but we must have regard to the Government's overall control in this area.  Their overall control in the area of Private Members' Bills is not a good one. It is very difficult to get a Private Members' Bill beyond this stage and this is almost a disincentive to people who go to the bother of putting down Private Members' Bills.  That would be a tragedy in the Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly this House, which is well known for its progressiveness in the area of legislation. Many controversial areas of legislation were originally touched upon in this House and tackled here by Members on this side of the House.  That is a record of which we can all be proud and it is one of which the Government should take note.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister does not have a closed mind to this Bill.  I hope that Senator Ryan's reply to the debate will reflect all our views and the welcome that is being generally given not alone in this House but by the media generally and by people to whom we have spoken.  There is a general feeling that this is necessary legislation and the Government will do a good day's work if they allow it to go to Committee Stage where we can debate whatever anomalies there might be in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean there is no other speaker on the Government side of the House.  It is an extraordinary way of doing business.  I would like to put on the record that on the Order Paper at present there are four Bills from the Independent group: the Homeless Persons Bill, the Criminal Justice (Abolition of the Death Penalty) Bill, the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill and the Freedom of Information Bill which we are discussing here tonight.  It is disgraceful and shows a lack of involvement, it is regressive and unenlightened that the Government side of the House do not consider this legislation <Col N="189" /> important enough to discuss it.  That is not meant to take from the contributions made by a small number of Senators on the Government side of the House.  I consider that it is hardly a very progressive or a very responsible way of doing business.  I can understand the Government saying: &ldquo;We do not agree with this Bill.  We feel we should oppose it,&rdquo; and giving us the reasons.  There is absolutely no case whatsoever for not presenting themselves for discussion, for not putting forward arguments and proposals and for not giving the Bill the type of treatment to which any Bill put before this House is entitled.  Having said that, I also feel it reflects very much on the legislative procedure.</P>
      <P>In the past couple of weeks in the other House the Government have been forced to accept a Private Members' Bill simply because they are in a minority position. That is probably one of the saddest things because having a minority Government opens up the opportunity for the introduction of proper legislation.  It recognises that not all wisdom is invested in the Government, not all wisdom is invested in those who represent the Government party.  We have seen very good examples of people making contributions to Bills which were taken on board by the Government and changes were made.  We are now at a stage in our history where, for the first time, Governments and Oppositions have to change their tune, and all for the good.  Many people have asked how a Government without a majority can rule but I believe it concentrates the mind wonderfully on things like legislation.  We should never have anything but minority Governments in the future when people have to stand up, make their proposals, sell their point of view, make their arguments and convince people they are right.  That is the way legislation was meant to be introduced and developed as envisaged in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly it also makes the Opposition stay on their toes.  It makes them consider opposition not purely for opposition's sake but for the sake of getting good, positive and progressive legislation.  This <Col N="190" /> is an opportunity for us to grasp.  It is significant that, under pressure in the lower House, the Government have been prepared to respond to it.  In this House we see a total lack of response, and empty benches on the Government side of the House.  This should be noted and considered and given its due place as this is a highly progressive Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill opens up so many different areas that it is difficult in 15 minutes to try to cover all those areas.  I would like to put on the record some of my thoughts on it.  The Bill came into my mind the other night while watching the unfortunate individual on &ldquo;The News&rdquo; charged with the graveyard killings of last week. He stood up in court and said: &ldquo;I read the files; they were legitimate targets.&rdquo;  I reflected on the fact that the files have always been used as the instrument of suppression, as the medium of oppression.  Information gives control.  It has always been the weapon of repressive Administrations.  It is used in South Africa.  It is used in countries where there are repressive Administrations.  Information is built up on people in the hope that they will step out of line at some stage &mdash; and who does not at some stage in their lives make mistakes which can be taken completely out of context and misrepresented?</P>
    <P>People do not recognise the different ways in which information is dealt with in the State, in the public service and in the Civil Service.  I want to give an example of the dual approach to information in Ireland.  If we take the members of the Garda Síochána who are obviously in a very sensitive area involving the security of the State, there is a recognition in their conditions of service that information kept about them &mdash; about mistakes they have made and about misdemeanours of which they have been guilty &mdash; will be kept on their files only for a period of five years.  In other words a misdemeanour of which a Garda is found to be guilty is recorded in his or her file and remains there for five years. It is cleared after five years and no record is kept beyond that point.  The Garda also <Col N="191" /> have the right to inspect and have access to their personal files in the Department.</P>
    <P>I always felt that was important because it meant that people passing judgment and people keeping a record of that judgment did so on the basis that it would be examined and perhaps they would have to justify it at a later date.  I contrast that with how my own profession, teachers, are treated.  They are treated in a far more regressive way. There still is no access to the files kept on members of the teaching profession in Ireland.  People may wonder if that is important.  Sueing teachers and complaining about teachers has become somewhat of a national pastime.  A problem arises and is not dealt with properly and the teacher is blamed.  We are all familiar with the saying: &ldquo;If the kid has no manners, send him to school where he is supposed to learn manners.&rdquo;  Everything that goes wrong is blamed on the school at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>Very often people send in a totally unfounded complaint about a teacher. It could be something very serious like sexual molestation of children, or it could be something relatively minor, but it is irrelevant what the nature of the complaint is.  Quite regularly a complaint goes to the Department of Education from a parent saying: &ldquo;I believe this teacher is guilty of this, or has done that, or should not have done the other.&rdquo;  There is a requirement on the Department of Education to investigate any such complaints.</P>
    <P>Let us say a complaint goes in that a teacher has been guilty of, say, sexual interference with young children.  That complaint is put on that teacher's file. The response to that is an investigation. I believe that every complaint should be investigated provided it is properly signed.  The difficulty is that somebody carries out an investigation, takes all the available evidence and comes to the conclusion that the complaint was totally unfounded.  One would imagine that that would be the end of the matter and in all justice that should be the end of the matter.  Once the person is found not to <Col N="192" /> be guilty of something, that should be the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>What goes into the teacher's file is that the complaint that the teacher was interfering with young children was investigated and no evidence could be found to sustain the complaint.  Perhaps the person who puts that into the file thinks in good faith: &ldquo;There was nothing to it; it was not true; it was completely unfounded&rdquo;.  But it remains on the file. The person who investigated it and put the matter on file goes about his business and in five years' time on reaching the appropriate age, if he or she has not been thrown out as redundant, leaves the service and is replaced by somebody else. Some years after that, the teacher applies for promotion.  Having applied for promotion, as is written into the rules, the management of the school to which he is seeking the appointment may refer to the Department about the suitability of the teacher for the job.  Somebody who knows nothing about this teacher says: &ldquo;I must respond to the board of management of the school.  I must see what is the background of this teacher&rdquo; and he goes to the file.  Among other things he sees that there was a charge of sexual molestation against this teacher many years ago.  It was investigated but no evidence was found to sustain it.  Of course we all know there is no smoke without fire and some of the mud sticks.  I give that as a real life example of something that actually happened.</P>
    <P>I chose that example to illustrate the kind of problem that can be created by lack of access to information being kept about a person.  That example illustrates the need for us to take particular care about the way information is kept, the kind of information kept and the people who have a right of access to that information. Of course, the whole idea of not allowing people access to information reflects very carefully what all rulers have known since the dawn of history, that is, that information is power.  Information has always been power and has always been more powerful than money, wealth, or anything else.  Throughout history information has been powerful.  Whether <Col N="193" /> you know the horse is being held in the races or the stock will double in price tomorrow morning, information is always power.  Similarly if people know about legislation and about people and have privileged information, information without right of access can be and is abused.</P>
    <P>Of course this reflects the mushroom policy which many Governments have implemented to keep their people under pressure.  The mushroom policy is to keep people in the dark, to throw manure on them so that they can grow quietly and in the dark without access to information. We have talked here about the Stalker-Sampson report and its non-publication. That report is of vital importance to many people in three different Administrations. It is important that it should be published and it is important that we should have access to that information and the process by which we could gain access to it should be firmly established.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I accept that it is important that the security of the State should not be put at risk by freedom of access to information.  Therefore, there needs to be an honest broker to decide whether the access to or the giving of information would constitute a threat to the security of the State.  In this Bill it is made absolutely clear that the courts could do that. That is above and beyond any suspicion anybody might have.  The courts would make the honest judgment and people could then have access or not.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it is my opinion that hand in hand with freedom of information should be the right to privacy. Senator Ryan referred to that in his opening statement on Second Stage.  I believe both go together.  I regret that the Government have not taken a more serious interest in this Bill.  I would like to record my compliments to Senator Ryan on bringing forward this Bill.  I wish him luck with it and I assure him of my support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator O'Toole I am very disappointed not with what he described as the less than serious reaction of the Government to this Bill but the <Col N="194" /> total lack of interest by the Government. Because they find it uncomfortable, the Government have virtually ignored this Bill in the Seanad.  It is no coincidence that the numbers in the Chamber this evening are slightly lopsided in favour of the independent Senators.  I found it disappointing as well that those who have spoken on the Government side have given very flimsy, spurious reasons for their opposition to this Bill at this time.</P>
      <P>I listened to Senator Hillery on the monitor.  His speech was certainly well delivered.  He said this is not for some reason the right time to introduce this Bill.  If it is not the right time to introduce this Bill Senator Hillery might have told us when the right time to introduce this Bill will be because I know, he knows, the Minister knows and anybody else on the Government side knows that, as long as they are in Government, it will never be the right time to introduce this Bill. While they feel safe and happy to pay some sort of lip service to the principle of a freedom of information Bill, we can be absolutely certain that they will never allow it.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed also the last time this was debated to hear what Senator Fallon &mdash; who was put in to bat and I am sure he did not want to go in to bat &mdash; said about the Bill.  He said it was not a Bill he would quarrel with, but it was a matter for the Government to introduce a Bill of this sort.  That is something with which I would agree and with which most members of Fianna Fáil and most Independent Senators would agree.  We do not have any indication of the fact that the Government will introduce such a Bill.  We know they will not.  What they have done is to play for time on this Bill. They will vote it down and we will not hear any more about it for a very long time except from the Independent benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also entertains me &mdash; although it was very nice to hear Senator Manning talking about Senator Ryan's conversion to conservatism &mdash; to see converts to this Bill in the Opposition here today.  I want to remind those on this side of the House who are supporting this Bill of the total <Col N="195" /> lack of interest shown in this Bill by both the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party when they were in Government.  It is very easy to support these principles in Opposition and then to forget about them when in Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am saying the Senator is very pragmatic.  That is said in a highly pejorative sense.  The principle behind this Bill is to release us from the philosophy of big Government which is to keep the people ignorant and to keep power in their own hands.  Senator O'Toole said quite rightly that information is power and the great power that would be released from Government hands by this Bill is its principal point.</P>
      <P>There is a temptation to which Governments in this country have yielded more than in other countries, to keep the people ignorant and keep power in their own hands.  The people are incapable of judging a Government if they do not have the necessary information on which to judge them.  I do not understand how there is any explanation for our being behind the Europeans, the US and behind many other civilised countries in the constant conflict between the individual and Government unless this is the case.  There is a tendency in this country to keep the people as ignorant as possible because it is very convenient for those who are in power.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning said quite rightly that this is a very conservative Freedom of Information Bill.  Senator Ryan who is not known for sympathies in that direction, has very sensibly pitched it in such a way that it will get the support of all those of moderate opinion, as well as of those who hold opinions like his own.</P>

      <P>This Bill makes some very important exemptions.  It is not a free-for-all. It is not a Bill which entitles a citizen to come in and find out any information he wants.  It makes important exemptions in areas which I would not necessarily think are necessary but which are prudent in order that the Bill should be passed.  The two important areas are the areas of an individual's privacy and the area of security and these are covered, along with minor areas like Cabinet meetings.  We believe the citizen has the right to this information by constitutional right and by democratic right and it is up to the Government, to give good reasons why this information should be withheld from the citizen.</P>
      <P>This is an excellent Bill which has, I am afraid, exposed once again the inadequacies of the Government and the hypocrisy of the political parties in this House.

Regrettably, for reasons which I will outline later, the Government are not in a position to support a measure of this type at this time.  So I must ask the House to reject this Bill on Second Stage. Having said this, I can assure the House that the Government recognise the importance of the issues raised in this Bill and are conducting their own examination of the complex issues involved. The fact that the Bill is now being debated clearly illustrates the openness of the Government's attitude to such matters and this has allowed the opportunity for debate on this Bill.  This Government, like previous Governments, are well aware of the importance of a well-informed citizenry.</P>

This Government, like previous Governments, are well aware of the importance of a well-informed citizenry to the proper functioning of a democratic society.  A clear indication of this awareness is the large volume of information on the workings of Government and of Government agencies now available through published sources.  Much of this information comes in the form of official statistics as well as departmental reports and policy documents on particular issues.</P>
      <P>I should mention, in particular, the important role played by the Oireachtas in securing well-informed public debates on the operation of Government.  Ministers are obliged to provide information about the exercise of their responsibilities so that those responsibilities can be accounted for to the Oireachtas.  This duty is discharged by many means including in particular Estimates debates, parliamentary questions, legislation, motions, Adjournment debates and Green and White Papers.  Ministers in Departments also provide a very considerable amount of information on their activities to joint committees of both Houses and to the Committee of Public Accounts.  In addition, the Ombudsman is empowered to examine all relevant papers and furthermore to summon and examine witnesses in the course of his investigations.  These are very important powers for the purpose of bringing undesirable administrative practices to the notice of the Oireachtas and for ensuring fairness in administration.  I commend the Ombudsman and his staff for the excellent work they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> Senators will also be aware that public bodies in general have various informal arrangements for keeping the public informed, for example, by means of publications, press release and advertising.  I am sure Senators will agree that a very considerable volume of information on the activities of the Government and the manner in which the public services are provided is already publicly available.  I am confident that with the ever-improving standard of education of our community as a whole, this freely accessible information will contribute increasingly to the standard of debate on public affairs and hence to the national decision-making process through the medium of our representative democracy.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us forces us to reflect on the adequacy of the processes by which the Government and the administration generally communicated their policies and operational strategies both to the Oireachtas itself and to the public at large.  It also forces us to reassess the conflicts between the needs of the Administration and the private sector to retain information on individuals and the concomitant rights of all individuals to verify the accuracy of such records and to their personal privacy.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is concerned with the protection, verification and correction, where necessary, of data held on individuals by public and private institutions. Senator Ryan has referred to the Data Protection Bill, 1987, sponsored by the Government, currently before the Dáil. This measure aims to extend appropriate protection to data about the private affairs of individuals held by public and private bodies in electronic data storage systems.  Since the types of personal information which are the subject of Part III of the Bill under discussion are nowadays widely held on electronic systems, I would expect that rights to personal privacy in this area would be more than adequately protected by measures in the Government's Data Protection Bill when it comes into force.</P>
    <P>Part II of this Bill provides for elaborate mechanisms to secure a general right of access to unpublished official <Col N="199" /> documents.  I compliment the authors for the obvious diligence which they have exercised in attempting to reconcile the complex issues to which the subject gives rise.  The resultant Bill is clearly the product of many hours of research and hard work.  Regrettably, as I will demonstrate later, some of the mechanisms for which this text provides might well hinder rather than strengthen the official management of Government and our public institutions and foster even greater bureaucracy. I am sure this was never intended and is no reflection on the excellent preparatory work by the authors.  It is for such reasons, however, that the Government, while maintaining a positive stance on the principles involved, are obliged to adopt a cautious attitude to the practical effects of the Bill as it stands and the measures which would be needed to put them into effect.  They are, therefore, conducting their own detailed examination of the difficult issues involved.</P>
    <P>The effect of Part II of the Bill would be to open to immediate public scrutiny either by any individual or the Oireachtas almost the entire range of records held by Government Departments, the wider public service, including the security forces and both commercial and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies. While I would not wish to pre-empt the Government's own examination of this matter, I would question personally the need to include such a wide range of bodies in the scope of such a measure.  In particular, I would tend to agree personally with some Senators in their questioning of the effects on commercial competitiveness of including commercial State-sponsored bodies within the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 13, 14 and 15 provide for exemptions from disclosure obligations. In practice, the Bill severely limits the scope of exemptions, particularly in relation to access by the Oireachtas.  This is a complex area where it would be necessary to strike a fair balance between rights of access to information and the wider public interest.  In the case of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas <Col N="200" /> or committees thereof, section 14 (3) appears to extend the disclosure obligation to all official information except constituency or party political papers of Government Ministers or their Ministers of State, or where the personal privacy of living individuals is at stake.</P>
    <P>Are the authors of the Bill suggesting seriously that civil servants should be obliged to publish the existence of the relevant documents and disclose to the Houses of the Oireachtas or committees thereof information which, for example, could serioulsy impair the security of the State, or concern matters which are <i>sub judice</i>, or interfere with legal professional privilege, or cover current non-Cabinet papers on budgetary options?  I doubt if that is what is intended but it appears that section 14 (3) of the Bill, as drafted, would impose such obligations.  This demonstrates that, even with the most diligent approach to drafting, this subject is a minefield where it behoves one to tread warily.  The definition of &ldquo;exemptions&rdquo; in the terms of this Bill is just one area which would require the most delicate balancing of new rights of the public and the Oireachtas to information on the one hand and the wider public interest on the other.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, neither this Government nor their predecessors have failed to recognise the need for citizens to be adequately informed on the workings of Government.  Neither would we suggest that improvements could not or should not be made.  At the same time, I am sure Senators will appreciate that the type of change proposed in this Bill or, indeed, in any such measure would involve a radical change in the operation of the machinery of Government.  No responsible Administration could endorse a change without being absolutely certain that the very machinery of government, including in particular its democratic basis, would be strengthened and not damaged in the process.</P>
    <P>There are two principal considerations to be taken into account in determining whether and to what extent it might be possible to open up access to the policy and operational papers of Government <Col N="201" /> Departments.  First, we would need to ensure that increased public access would not disrupt the freedom of the Government of the day to plan and devise policies rationally and of the public service, including the security forces, to manage public services fairly and efficiently.  Secondly &mdash; and this is primarily a technical problem &mdash; we would need to ensure that any mechanism for greater freedom of access would themselves be compatible with the existing State records system so that it would be capable of efficient operation without imposing additional costs.  This is a very important consideration.</P>
    <P>To take the second point first, Senators will not need to be reminded at this stage of the importance of strict control of public expenditure in the context of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> While it might not seem immediately obvious, the procedures advocated in this Bill to increase public access to Government information would, if implemented in the manner proposed, require the separate indexing and cataloguing of every non-exempt document on almost every file in the public sector, a gigantic task by any standard.  Processing requests and arranging for access on a global basis would also create considerable additional work for many public servants, quite probably at the critical times when they are needed most for their normal duties. It would be foolish to imagine that this could be catered for without imposing some extra burdens on them, with the consequent and significant increase in Exchequer costs.  In their examination of this question the Government will seek to identify other ways by which effect might be given to the principles involved without imposing unreasonable extra burdens on the staff concerned or making demands on the hard-pressed Exchequer finances.</P>
    <P>Of more fundamental importance in the longer term is the need to ensure that any increase in the scope of access to increase in the scope of access to information does not undermine the basic freedom of the Government to review policy rationally and to ensure fair and efficient execution of public policy.  This <Col N="202" /> is a very complex issue, particularly in present circumstances where public servants are being urged to be more result conscious and are being made more accountable.</P>
    <P>Senators have raised a number of examples of cases where, arguably, citizens may have been inconvenienced in the exercises of their rights by the non-publication of such documents as circulars governing the operation of various social welfare schemes.  In the light of the case law precedents we are obliged to consider whether it is possible to devise mechanisms to guarantee greater freedom of access in cases such as these. However, I am sure all Senators will recognise that there will always be classes of information, the premature release of which would undermine good government and put public safety at risk.  This need arises principally in relation to areas like security and policy formulation.  It is recognised already in the exemptions for which the Bill provides.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the problem of protecting necessarily restricted information in the context of more liberal freedom of information rules is not well understood outside Government.  To take an example raised during the current debate, Senator Fallon suggested that under this Bill budget secrets could be prematurely revealed, making it impossible for the Government to conduct budgetary policy in an ordinary rational manner.  Senator Mary Robinson in turn suggested that the exemption in the Bill covering Cabinet papers would prevent this happening.</P>
    <P>However, the exemption of Cabinet papers or even of those involving the giving of advice by officials would not be sufficient to cover all budget papers. Relevant departmental files and in particular Department of Finance files containing working information on such things as budgetary options could not be classed as Cabinet papers or otherwise be exempt under section 13 of the Bill as drafted.  Likewise it is difficult to imagine constructive negotiations on public service pay in a situation where one party <Col N="203" /> would have direct access to all the information. It would be like inviting somebody to play cards, knowing that all the aces were in their pocket.</P>
    <P>I would hesitate to speculate on the potential disruption to the administration of justice were all Garda papers, including those on criminal or subversive activities, to be open for scrutiny by Members of the Oireachtas as provided in section 14 (3).  These are just three examples of the types of difficulties and the potential problems to which they might give rise. Similar examples can be found in almost every area of the public service.  I mention these issues not in a spirit of knocking the Bill but rather as illustrations of the difficulty of the issues to which any reform of this kind would give rise.  The striking of a workable balance between the public interest needs for granting and restricting access to information is a highly complex area which we are having examined.</P>
    <P>The difficulties I have mentioned convince me that Senators Fallon and Hillery and others are right in stating that only the Government would be in a position to develop a workable scheme of reform in the freedom of information area.  The expertise required to handle all technical aspects simply does not exist outside the Government.</P>
    <P>Following the introduction of Senator Ryan's previous Freedom of Information Bill in 1985, to which Senator Ross referred, an examination of the possible need for changes in this area was initiated.  Unfortunately, due to the pressure of more immediate work, this examination could not be given the priority which it would otherwise have received.  However, arrangements have been made to progress this matter further, although I should say that a quick fix is not possible.  This is because of the complexity of the problem as I have outlined and because extensive inter-departmental consultations will be required.  In this process particular attention will be paid to the points made in the debate on this Bill.  It is for this very reason that an opportunity has been given <Col N="204" /> to this very august body to debate this Bill.</P>

      <P>And I have a right to do things which I do not get from the Senator.  The Seanad may be assured of our determination to ascertain in a positive fashion the extent to which change may be desirable and practical in this area and that the Government will give due consideration to any proposals which emerge from this examination.</P>
      <P>At this stage it remains only for me again to commend Senator Ryan and the other sponsors of this Bill for bringing this important question before the Oireachtas.  This debate has made an invaluable contribution to the public debate on this question and it serves to focus all our minds on the great principles and difficulties involved.  I have, I hope, made it clear why it would not be in the interests of good Government or effective management of our public services for the Oireachtas to proceed with legislation on this subject, at least until the Government have completed their own detailed study of the matter which is now under way.</P>
      <P>I should also say that many illustrations have been given of other countries where freedom of information is so readily accessible.  In my own limited way, as a public representative over the past six years I have had the pleasure of visiting some of these countries and, despite the fact that they have this freedom of information opportunity, they too would share many of the thoughts and sentiments which I have expressed.  Accordingly I ask the House to reject the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>After a slow start the debate on this Bill has developed immeasurably in the past couple of hours. Since I have only 15 minutes, I hope Members will forgive me if I do not refer individually to each Members' contribution. I am very grateful to the Members of the House who spoke on the Bill, to Senators Fallon, Hillery, Robinson, Manning &mdash; I forgive Senator Manning for some of his comments but I will discuss them later &mdash; Senators Murphy, O'Toole, Ross and Ferris.</P>
      <P>In general I do not need to argue with all of those Members because, with the exception of Senators Hillery and Fallon, they all welcomed the Bill and its principles. Both Senator Hillery and Senator Fallon also accepted the principles behind this Bill, just as the general objectives of the Bill were accepted by the Minister, speaking for the Government. I do not need to take much issue with the Members of this House for their replies or for their contributions.  They were most welcome and I am very glad to have had the opportunity to facilitate and perhaps to encourage a debate on an issue which deserves to be debated in this House and which justifies the existence of this House, the sort of important issue that will inevitably be pushed down very low on the ordinary timetable in the hurly-burly of politics.  That is not a criticism of politics.  It is part of reality.  It is most welcome that many Members took the trouble to talk about this issue and to reflect on it and I hope the Bill has contributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of one phrase I was very pleased and grateful for the Minister's reply.  It was a thoughtful and well-considered reply.  It was full of compliments and indeed it was almost full of flattery.  I am too long in the tooth to be totally taken in by flattery.  Nevertheless, it was a sincere contribution.  I did take exception to one phrase and I am sorry if I expressed by exception too strongly by interrupting the Minister.  I was not <Col N="206" /> allowed to introduce the Bill.  It is my right as a Member of this House to use the procedures of this House and, if the Government did not like this Bill at all, I would still have the right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I for one would not accept that a right exists in this House for the Government to decide what issues Members in their Private Members' time can have discussed.  I had a falling out with my good friend Senator Ferris during a previous Administration on this same issue and I am not prepared to concede it now.  Nevertheless, having said that, I want to get on to deal with the substantive issues raised by a number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in this House for almost seven years now and in those years I have seen a considerable amount of legislation come through.  I remember two Bills in particular introduced by the previous Government, the Status of Children Bill and the Clinical Trials Bill.  I remember two more introduced by the present Government, the Companies Bill and the Insurance Bill.  They all had in common the fact that as introduced they were far from perfect.  The Status of Children Bill and the Clinical Trials Bill were fundamentally rewritten between the time they were introduced and the time they were passed at Second Stage and the time they left this House.  There were of the order of 40 or 50 fundamental amendments accepted to the Status of Children Bill.  There were of the order of 40 or 50 amendments accepted to the Clinical Trials Bill.  The best part of 50 or so amendments are already accepted to the Companies (No. 2) Bill and we are only halfway through it.  There are a considerable number of amendments now in from the Government on the Insurance Bill.  I simply use this to indicate that the fact that a Bill has flaws or has some defects in it is no argument about the principle of accepting the Bill on Second <Col N="207" /> Stage.  The people who devise parliamentary procedures devise them precisely for that reason, so that you first of all discuss the principles in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The principle of this Bill is to maximise the access of the public to a huge body of public information which is not in any way threatening to any fundamental public interest or to any fundamental interest of a private citizen.  All we have argued about here and all the Minister has argued about with me are some of the details involved.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is worried about budgetary secrets, or some commercial aspect of semi-State bodies, or about the provisions of section 14 (3) concerning the right of the Houses of the Oireachtas, then I will accept verbatim whatever amendments the Minister wishes to put into the Bill to cover those issues.  I will not argue.  I will give the Government a blank cheque to write amendments on those three issues to cover the problems they have.  I have no problems whatever about the details of such legislation.</P>
    <P>I have three fundamental principles. The first principle is that all information other than exempt information should be available to the public.  The second fundamental philosophy is that there are categories of exempt information and the third is that the determination of what is meant within the legislation by exempt information should be made by an independent agency.  It should not be left to the Executive to decide ultimately what is covered by the exemptions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have chosen in this Bill the route which has been chosen by the United States, which is the route of using the courts to interpret or assess areas of conflict. Other countries have set up what they call information ombudsmen.  That was the proposal contained in the British Bill which never made much progress in the House of Commons.  I do not really mind if it is an information ombudsman provided the person is independent and has a guaranteed access to all the documentation required to take a decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to our own Ombudsman, but the truth is that the <Col N="208" /> Minister can at any stage direct the Ombudsman to cease an investigation. That is a reserved power in the Ombudsman legislation.  Therefore, the Ombudsman does not have any absolute right to access to information.  If a Minister sees fit, he can direct the Ombudsman not to carry on an investigation.  We, therefore, do not have one of my three fundamental principles, which is that whatever exemptions, whatever protections, whatever provisos are written in, they should be enforceable by an independent agency with the power to see and look at the documents and make a decision.  In my view, the best authority for that is the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>I can give the Minister a list because I have thought of a number of areas of deficiency.  For instance, the whole area of public exeminations under the Department of Education is uncertain in the Bill as drafted.  One of the great functions of Parliament &mdash; and most Governments find this difficult to accept &mdash; is that Parliament actually does improve legislation. That is what Parliament is for &mdash; to improve legislation.  The Members of this House with their varieties of background and the Members of the other House with their varieties of background serve that function.  They identify deficiencies; they identify oversights; they identify possible consequences. Many Members of this House who have been here longer than I, talk with enormous respect of some of the earlier members of this House who, by the sheer capacity of their intellect to think logically, forced reluctant Ministers to accept amendments to legislation simply because they identified glaring deficiencies in Bills that had passed through all of the Government's expertise, all the stages of such Bills in the other House and came in here and, nevertheless, were proved by Members of this House to have serious defects in them.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the least bit contradictory in advocating a Second Reading for a Bill and accepting that the Bill is far from perfect.  That is the one disappointing aspect of this whole debate. <Col N="209" /> The Government have said that they agree with the principles in this Bill.  They accept that a lot of work has gone into this Bill and that they would like to see this issue progress, but because they have identified a number of deficiencies they are going to oppose it.  It would have been a most magnificent opportunity to let this House and the Members of it be extremely constructive, bearing in mind that the Government have an overwhelming majority in this House.</P>
    <P>I would like this House to be extremely constructive and to have a select committee of this House go through this Bill, clause by clause, and consider amendments from various members of the committee and also of the Government and, at the end, come out with a Bill which presumably would be written in the form which suits the Government.  Subject to three fundamental principles which I have already outlined being accepted, I would not argue with a Government who were prepared to accept those fundamental principles but wanted the details changed.</P>
    <P>Let me talk about another problem which the Minister identified.  He identified the necessity to have any freedom of information system made compatible with the existing public records.  Much to my amazement, though I have heard it said before, he raised the problem of the cost of indexing public documents.  Will somebody please explain to me how any Government know what they have in their records if they are all in a totally unindexed jumble?  Is it actually true that we have masses of records in Government Departments and nobody knows, or can find, what is in them, because they are not already indexed?  If that is true, it is such an indictment of the efficiency of the Government as to call for a public inquiry into the way we are being governed. It is quite appalling if there are masses &mdash; perhaps hundreds of thousands of documents &mdash; and nobody has any ordered way of finding out what is in them because they have not been indexed.</P>
    <P>If they are indexed, and if there is a way of knowing, then the argument that it <Col N="210" /> would be a costly exercise is meaningless. You cannot have it both ways.  Either they are accessible to the people who run these Departments or they are not.  If they are accessible, the sort of information that they use is obviously not necessarily complete but, nevertheless, it is a basis for indexing.  Therefore, we are not talking about starting from scratch and putting public servants into the position of having to produce complex indices or otherwise buried and lost documents. If people running the Departments know what is on their records, they must have some sort of formal or informal index.  If they do not, it is about time they did it for the sake of their own efficiency, whatever about the needs of the public to have access to information.  I find some of the wording that the Minister used so heavily qualified as to be meaningless.</P>
    <P>May I say about section 14 (3) and the Members of the Oireachtas that I will happily delete that provision from the Bill and leave it so that the Members of the Oireachtas have no special privileges and they can go and fight along with everybody else through the mechanisms of this Bill, if it is unsatisfactory to the Government?  It is clearly inadequately worded.  It could do with rewording.  The fact that one four-line section of a Bill, which is 19 pages long and which contains 41 sections, may, perhaps, be defective is hardly an argument on which to reject the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the Minister went through a detailed refutation of this Bill. I accept that freedom of information is a complex thing, but there is nothing more complex than democracy.  There is nothing more complex in terms of assistance to the Government than democracy. The most uncertain part of democracy is the fact that nobody can foretell in advance the outcome of any democratic discussion on any issue.  That is the ultimate uncertainty.  It is also one of the reasons why Stalin was reputed to be not madly keen on democratic election.  One could not foretell the outcome.  That is the truth about democracy.  This argument that because something is complex we cannot have it is actually, though it is <Col N="211" /> not conscious or is not intended, an attack on democracy.</P>
    <P>Democracy is cumbersome.  It is unwieldy.  It is expensive, complex and also the best system of Government humanity has ever invented.  It is by far the most humanity-affirming system we have.  Built into that is a complexity which makes life difficult for those who are given the opportunity to govern and for those who are given the opportunity to advise those who govern.  That does not get us away from the fact that democracy is complex and difficult.  To argue that something should not be done because it is complex is to argue that democracy is somehow suspect because of the complexities it implies.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that this Bill is an attempt to restore the balance between the Government and the public. It is an attempt to do what Jesse Jackson has been talking about in the United States.  It is an attempt to empower the ordinary citizen to answer back by saying <Col N="212" /> to him that everything for which there is not a justifiable reason for keeping secret, is your property, not theirs, and by saying that everything that they have about you that there is not a justifiable reason for keeping secret is yours, not theirs.  It says that everything about your environment, your welfare rights and industrial policy for which there is no good reason for keeping secret is yours, not theirs.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not about the niggly details or mistakes I may have made in drafting it.  It is not about whether I may have omitted certain areas of concern to the Government.  It is about the rights of a citizen to know what his Government are doing for him, on his behalf and to him. The Government said they are in favour of those principles but they attempted to duck behind what I would regard as trivial details, so I must insist that this Bill be given a second reading in its present form.  I will give the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> to write the amendments to the sections he does not like.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking the time to come in and listen to my proposal for a woodpulp factory to be sited in County Leitrim.  I wish to refer to recent statements and decisions of the Minister for Finance on decentralisation and, in particular, I welcome the location of a section of the Department of Social Welfare in Sligo.  It is long recognised that decentralisation boosts local economies, provides local job opportunities and revitalises local communities which have suffered social imbalances caused by migration to the East coast and emigration. Even a cursory examination of the demographic distribution of population in Ireland will reveal instantly that one of the black spots is undoubtedly County Leitrim.  Constant migration, and in the recent past accelerated emigration, if allowed to continue, will result in a dwindling, ageing and eventually totally dependent population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thank God, we now have an opportunity to halt this enervating trend.  With one bold and imaginative stroke, this disastrous degeneration of a mainly rural population can be halted.  All that is required is a breadth of vision and political will.  I refer, of course, to the development of the timber industry.  My reference to the policy of decentralisation in this context may appear slightly irrelevant, but my point is that all of the advantages of the philosophy are even <Col N="214" /> more enhanced by the location of an industry and its regulating body in the correct place from day one.  No social upheaval is necessary.  Nobody need feel any compulsion to move.</P>
    <P>In short, my submission is that the new forestry body and the proposed woodpulp industry should be located in County Leitrim.  I will endeavour to show that this is no mere call for an industrial development based merely on the premise that we should get what is going regardless of good economic criteria. This call is based on sound and true principles of political economy which apply to the location of the industry.  A brief regression to our school days will remind us of those principles.  One principle is the availability of raw materials.  County Leitrim is 7 per cent planted, produces 50,000 cubic metres of timber per year which, when projected forward, rises to 60,000 cubic metres by 1990 and 100,000 cubic metres by 1995.  Furthermore, Leitrim has been designated by An Foras Forbartha as probably the finest timber growing area in Europe.  It already gives a yield of 28 per cent above the national average.  Another powerful point in Leitrim's favour is that it is the epicentre of an area comprising parts of counties Donegal, Sligo, Roscommon, Cavan, Fermanagh and Tyrone which posses the same drumlin soil on which we are providing vast quantities of timber.</P>
    <P>In relation to the viability of any industry there is the vital ingredient of added value.  At present when the commercial saw log timber has been processed there is a residue of about 30 per cent.  This resource is generally turned into fencing posts and firewood, giving a low added value of £43 per cubic metre.  If this was processed as woodpulp and turned into tissue, it would give us a figure of up to £315 per cubic metre.  Therefore, the location of such an industry in Leitrim, the centre of the region, makes irrefutable sense.</P>
    <P>Infrastructure is rightly regarded as an essential ingredient in determining the location of industry and, in the case of <Col N="215" /> Leitrim, a reasonable investment in roads, which will be necessary in any event, would provide ease of access to all forest areas.  Our communications system is second to none.  We have thousands of square feet of empty advance factory space in every town in the county.  Conversion to a plant and office would be relatively simple.  Furthermore, judicious allocation of the regional and structural funds, to which we are entitled, would very quickly extend our regional water and sewerage schemes to the whole county.  Availability of labour is another <i>sine qua non</i> for a viable industrial location.  In this respect Leitrim and its surrounding areas have a plentiful supply of highly skilled and highly educated labour.  No employer need fear any shortage of willing and adaptable workers.</P>
    <P>From a social point of view we can offer serviced sites for housing in scenic locations on uncrowded roads &mdash; albeit there are loads of potholes &mdash; a healthy environment, total absence of the more nasty aspects of the rat race, friendly people, excellent schools and, of course, boating, hunting, shooting and fishing, although the latter is sadly no longer free. The County Leitrim Development Team and the county council for many years were involved in the promotion of afforestation. The establishment of a wood processing industry has been a priority for some considerable time.  In October, 1985 the County Development Team made a submission to the then Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Mr. Paddy O'Toole, in relation to the establishment of a major wood processing plant in County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of urgency is now attached to this matter.  Consequently the team came to the conclusion after many deputations and consultations with interests and local industry, the IDA and some financial institutions that, (1) the most suitable process of the pulpwood processing giving the maximum added value would be the manufacture of tissue, (2) that this type of project is best provided by a multinational corporation which would have finance, machinery, <Col N="216" /> management, structure and marketing capacity, (3) that the IDA should be encouraged to promote with enterprises known to them the setting up of this project in County Leitrim as recommended by An Foras Talúntais.</P>
    <P>May I sum up by reiterating that what I propose is a viable economic proposition which stands on its own feet and will bear any examination on any criteria.  If we add the social dimension of desirability there can be no argument.  For far too long we in Leitrim and the West generally have seen our hopes dashed on one pretext or another and it is time we had our fair share of development.  Here we have all the conditions necessary to set up an indigenous industry.  It is not just that we want the industry, we need it.  The future of the county depends on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to thank the Senator for the case he has made for County Leitrim and say how much I enjoyed listening to a contribution from that part of the country which certainly needs more development.  In a particular way I welcome the Senator's contribution because of my previous association with this House and with his father who was the esteemed Cathaoirleach of the House at that time.</P>
      <P>There is another side to the equation, and I refer of course to demand for pulpwood. Developments on the demand side will decide whether the nett availability of pulpwood will be sufficient to accommodate a new industry.  Those elements on the demand side which impinge on net availability include sawmilling of pulpwood, exports, fuel wood, stake and pole sales.  A liaison committee comprising my Department, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the IDA are reviewing the possibilities first on the demand side, to try to maximise the amount of material that can be truly said to be available for new industry.  The ideal would, of course, be to be able to accommodate a new industry and also expansion by the existing processors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> Secondly, the committee have identified a number of pulpwood based products and have assessed these in a preliminary way, in terms of timber volumes required, level of capital investment required, potential employment and added-value to the economy.  Should it be clearly established that sufficient supplies of raw material will be available, more detailed feasibility work will need to be undertaken in respect of any possible potential new industry.  The ground-work to enable the IDA to solicit inquiries from overseas industries in the pulpwood using sector &mdash; necessarily foreign, because of the scale of investment required &mdash; has been more or less completed and the timing for such a new industry will depend on the results of examination of those elements to which I have already referred, on the demand side.  All in all, the future prospects for the domestic pulpwood industry look very healthy indeed.</P>
    <P>Some of the difficulties which constrained, of late, the development of our pulpwood processing sector are going to ease considerably in the near future. Chief among these is the supply of raw materials.  The forest planting policies pursued in the early years of the State's existence are about to pay dividends in the near future in the form of increasing amounts of pulpwood, as well as sawlog, from our forests.  It is for this reason that the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has targeted timber processing and especially pulpwood processing, as a future provider of new employment and wealth for our economy.</P>
    <P>Because of the crucial importance of being able to estimate with reasonable accuracy the amounts of raw material which will be available to processors, my Department have been working to obtain such data.  I am pleased to be able to announce that pulpwood supplies will increase substantially over the next few years which opens up the possibility of expanding the domestic pulpwood industry as soon as a suitable new industry can be identified by the State industrial development agencies.  A recent study <Col N="218" /> carried out by the internationally renowned forestry consultants Jaako Poyry confirmed these predictions.</P>
    <P>In 1987, total availability of pulpwood and residues &mdash; a by-product of the saw milling industry and, depending on the end products, a raw material for pulpwood processing &mdash; was in the region of 900,000 cubic metres.  From 1988 to 1992, it is estimated that this figure will increase to 1.2 million and from 1993 to 1997 the average annual figure is expected to be nearly 1.6 million cubic metres.  While the supply of pulpwood is clearly going to increase quite substantially, determining the optimum utilisation of the increasing volumes coming on-stream is not as simple a matter as might appear to be the case.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of development, the Irish timber processing industry can be divided into two sub-sectors, saw milling and pulpwood processing.  It is the pulpwood processing sector which concerns us here.</P>
    <P>The Irish pulpwood processing sector comprises mainly of two producers i.e., Medite of Ireland Ltd., Clonmel, manufacturers of Medium Density Fibreboard and Finsa Forest Products, Scariff, manufacturers of chipboard.  Both companies are now well established on selling on foreign markets as was originally intended.</P>
    <P>The Irish pulpwood industry has gone through a period of considerable upheaval since the late seventies.  The board manufacturing plants in Waterford and Athy, and the pulp manufacturing mill at Clondalkin Paper Mills, are now gone, victims of recessionary conditions in the seventies which witnessed all over Europe in this particular sector a reduction in demand and consequent over-capacity.  A joint study by the IDA and the Forest and Wildlife Service in 1979-80 identified medium density fibreboard as a product with real prospects and potential benefits to the national economy and the Medite plant in Clonmel, County Tipperary was a consequence. The Finsa operation in Scariff, County Clare followed from a takeover by the Spanish Finsa Forest Product <Col N="219" /> Group of the Chipboard Products Ltd., factory in 1984.  Some 330 are currently employed in both companies.</P>
    <P>The motion under discussion calls for the establishment of a woodpulp factory in County Leitrim.  It gives me some pleasure to be able to talk in a positive way about the future prospects for developing the pulpwood industry in Ireland.  It was not too many years ago that the prospects looked very bleak, indeed, for any such development on the domestic front.  May I say straight away that the decision on where to locate any project is ultimately a matter for the promoters involved who are in the best position to decide in the light of such factors as logistics of raw material supply &mdash; an extremely important factor in this case &mdash; access to main transport routes and other related matters.  Section 13 (2) of the Industrial Development Act, 1986, specifically prevents a direction being given to the IDA in respect of any individual industrial undertaking, or to giving preference to one area over others in relation to the location of an industrial undertaking, otherwise than as part of a general review of industrial policy for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Senator is correct to say that County Leitrim is a possible location for any new pulpwood processing industry that might arise but we cannot at this stage be too specific.  It would be more correct to say that the north-west region is going to be considered seriously by the promoters of any such industry.  The promoters, for example, could decide to <Col N="220" /> locate new capacity alongside an existing industry elsewhere in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know if there will be a Government decision on where to site the wood processing plant and is it envisaged that it will be a private enterprise project rather than State-funded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it will not be the Government who will determine the location of the new industry.  It is mainly up to the promoters to decide the exact location where they wish to site the new industry.  The concentration, however, by the Government on the north-west would be right because of the fact that it is in that area that surpluses to our present requirements of pulpwood now stand. Therefore, the likelihood of a new industry going elsewhere, further away from the supplies, is extremely unlikely.  As to whether it will be a privately-owned industry or Government-sponsored I think is beyond doubt.  It will be a private consortium.  However, I am making provision in the new forest company for the opportunity for the new company to go into joint ventures if such are necessary. I envisage in this case that probably that would not be the type of one which would interest the new company.</P>
      <P>Finally, I am certain that the investment will be made totally by the private side.  I encourage it to emerge from within Irish sources but we will welcome international interests as well.</P>
