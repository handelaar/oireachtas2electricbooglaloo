      <P>Last week when we heard of the unfortunate death of Jack Daly the House did not have an opportunity to pay an adequate tribute to him. I would like that tribute to be paid today.</P>
      <P>Senator Jack Daly died in office.  It was a great shock to his family, to his acquaintances and, indeed, it was a tremendous shock to everybody who was in the House on Thursday of last week. On a personal basis, my connection with Jack Daly went back before my political connection because we served on the council of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry together.  The society and the Irish motor industry have lost one of their greatest battlers.  Jack never pulled punches at meetings of the society.  Neither did he pull punches when he confronted Ministers on behalf of the motor trade. Last week the current edition of the magazine of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry came out.  It went over the past ten troubled years of the industry. In each of the years it was quite apparent that Jack was to the forefront in all the fights that needed to take place on behalf of that industry.  There is concern in the industry that he is gone and he will be missed greatly by his colleagues in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" /> In the political sphere, I first came across him when he beat me for a nomination to the Seanad in peculiar circumstances. They were peculiar in the sense that I felt I got too close to him for comfort because I did not want the nomination.  I wanted him to get it.  By a peculiar quirk of PR, two Fianna Fáil votes went astray, as I would think, and the votes went to Jackie which was a relief to everybody in the motor industry and, at the time, it was a partial relief to me.</P>
    <P>In politics I met Jackie on various occasions.  He was always courteous.  He was diligent in his work for the people who elected him.  His work in the House whether it was in the Chair, on the Committee of Procedure and Privileges, or in his position as Whip was always diligent and excellently carried out.  He will be missed by his colleagues here in the Seanad but he will be missed equally by his family.  The tributes paid to him in Killarney were well deserved.  By the crowd that turned up from all over the county to pay tribute to him, his worth was shown in public for the first time.  A lot of Jackie's work was not done in the public eye, although he had an eye for publicity on occasions.  Aer Lingus at times were not too pleased with the publicity he gave to one of their cheaper fares, or supposedly cheaper fares.</P>
    <P>We remember him from our hearts. He will be missed by everybody in this Chamber, by his party colleagues and by those he supported in the motor industry and those in any other area of society who approached him for help.  I would like on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government Party to express again our deepest sympathy to his family on their sad bereavement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to believe that only a short week ago Senator Jackie Daly was sitting in this House, present as always for the Order of Business, present as always throughout the day, working as chief Opposition Whip to ensure that the business of this House proceeded in an orderly and efficient way, as always paying full attention to the details and <Col N="847" /> the problems that make the job of a Whip so important and often so thankless.</P>
      <P>Death and its setting are never appropriate but, given that death is inevitable, it is perhaps appropriate that Senator Jackie Daly should die in harness, struck down while working in the service of this House and while doing the work he loved and valued so much.  Knowing Jackie, it is, I believe, the way he would have wished it to be.  It is hard to talk and think of Jackie in the past tense.  Even as I stand here today, I can feel his spirit sitting in the Whip seat behind me telling me to take it easy, or to pass on quickly to the next business.</P>
      <P>There are things about Jackie and his career which must be said and put on the record.  Perhaps the most striking thing about him was his commitment to this House.  It was total.  He believed this House has a significant part to play in legislation.  He believed this House gave voice to a wider diversity of views than could ever be heard in the other House. He believed that the traditions and practices of this House allowed for a calm, reasoned and tolerant approach to politics. He was angry with what he saw as unfair or uninformed criticism, or sniping at this House from outside.  He was equally intolerant and equally angry if he felt that Members of the House were bringing it into disrepute, or were not pulling their weight.  He felt it a great privilege to be a Member of this House, a great privilege to be a member of our national Parliament and he always behaved accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Daly was always loyal especially to his electorate.  No Senator was more conscientious in paying attention to the interests and the problems of his nominating body.  The Irish motor industry have lost a very good friend in Senator Daly.  He was equally loyal and concerned about his wider electorate, the members of our county and borough councils.  Jackie's individual acts of kindness, his thoughtfulness, his generosity and his very genuine concern for all that affected the lives of these people will <Col N="848" /> never be equalled.  He had a capacity for real friendship.</P>
    <P>Behind all of that he knew that the elected councillors, probably more than most, were in touch with the real people and the real problems of our country. They were the first to know if legislation passed here was working or not.  They could gauge better than most the impact of laws that were made or not made in this House.  Jackie always believed that their views and their concerns were authentic, that they deserved to be listened to and he ensured that they were listened to.  This was not a fashionable or an elitist view of this House, but it was founded on a bedrock of reality.  I believe it was a view just as valid and valuable as any other strand of representation in this or the other House.</P>
    <P>When I say that Jackie Daly loved this House, I mean the full House.  I believe he will be especially missed by the people who make possible the functioning of this House &mdash; the restaurant staff, the ushers, the secretarial staff, the Garda Síochána, the Library staff and those in the Seanad office.  Jackie Daly's capacity for friendship ensured that all of us in the community of Leinster House feel a sense of personal loss and all of us will have our own personal memories of him.</P>
    <P>Jackie was a lifelong committed member of Fine Gael.  He was proud of his party, proud of where they came from and he was fiercely loyal to the party and their leader.  He was unwavering and steadfast in the difficult days, and always optimistic about the times to come.  His commitment never made him bitter or intolerant and no member had better relations with his political opponents than had Jackie.  This was evident by the very wide representative turnout from all parties and groups who made the journey to Killarney to his final resting place last Friday and Saturday.</P>
    <P>It is ultimately as a person that we will miss Jackie most.  He was a decent good person, a decent, good politician and a decent, good Irishman.  It is for these qualities of decency and goodness, for his humour, his warmth, his courtesy and his friendship that we will miss him most. <Col N="849" /> Our deep sympathy goes to his family on their hour of loss.  May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>It is a sad duty to chur leis na focail molta atá ráite cheana féin. The Independent group of Senators would like to be associated with and add to the votes of thanks and appreciation that are being passed here today.  In the short time I knew him as a politician I had great regard for Jackie Daly &mdash; although I knew him for much longer when, years ago, the family bought cars from him.  I also went to school with members of his extended family, so I certainly knew him for a period of time.</P>
      <P>People make judgments in different ways.  As somebody who has been a short time in the House, I have always looked at the way Members of the House respond to and interrelate with the staff of the House.  More than any Member of either House, it would be fair to say, Senator Daly was held in the highest regard and respect by the people working at the top to the lowest jobs around this House.  He reminded me of John Henry Newman's definition of an educated person and the first quality he looked for was the quality of tolerance.  Certainly, tolerance was something he had in plenty. I will remember him for his tolerance and good humour.</P>
      <P>His death came as a great personal shock to me.  I was chatting with him in the ambulance as he was leaving here last week.  I joked with him about arranging a pair so that there would not be any sudden votes.  He told me to be sure to look after that.  I thought he had recovered from the attack.  We agree with Senator Manning that it was appropriate that he should die on the job.  Indeed, at the time he was rushing to ensure that there was no break in the business of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my experience of working with him, both in this House and on committees, in particular the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I always found him helpful, free with his advice and quite supportive. He was the essence of diligence. He was always in the House, on sitting days or otherwise.  He was always ready <Col N="850" /> to talk business.  He was always ready to ensure that the business went ahead.  He was always amenable, friendly and helpful to all Members on all sides of the House.  It was quite appropriate that at the removal of his remains Members of all parties were there not just to see him off but physically to bring his remains out.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that only last week he was talking to me about his plans for this week in Killarney where he had organised a number of things.  He had arranged with people from all over Ireland to be in Killarney today or tomorrow.  It is ironic that at this stage we should be thinking of him in the past tense.  It is often said, indeed it is almost a cant, go mbeadh sé molta fiú féin dá mba rud é go raibh muidne inár dtost, but it is true on this occasion.  We bid him farewell.  We associate ourselves with the warm words of the previous speakers and we extend our sympathy to his family and to his extended family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was more or less agreed that the Leaders of the groups would pay tribute to Jack today.  I believe I am in a different position.  First, I knew Jack since he came here in 1973 and then, as Whip for a number of years, I worked with him.  During my time as Whip, I worked with a number of people.  Jack Daly was the fairest and the best I ever met in this House.  His duties as Whip may have been the cause of his death because you have to be a Whip to understand the responsibility it carries in this House and in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jack was sitting in the Library reading the paper when he saw the Seanad screen go blank.  His first reaction was to rush out and come up here.  Maybe that bit of a run did not help him.  He was a perfect gentleman.  It is very hard for me to find words after what Senator Manning and Senator Lanigan and others have said.  I knew him better because we were both Whips.  If ever I was stuck for a pair for someone, I could go to Jack and he always obliged.  His last words to me on Wednesday were: &ldquo;Willie, I will not be here next week.  I have to be at Killarney <Col N="851" /> races.  Can you get a pair for me?&rdquo;  That was arranged but I did not think it would be in these circumstances.  In conclusion all I have to say is: may the good Lord have mercy on his soul and may the green grass of his beloved Kerry rest lightly on his mortal remains.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a sense of sorrow and sadness that, on behalf of the Labour Party group in the Seanad, I associate myself with this tribute to the memory of our colleague, Jack Daly, who left us suddenly last week without a pair.  He was generous with a pair when one wanted it, as Senator Willie Ryan said.  He was also an ardent believer in this House, as Senator Manning has said, and had a tremendous respect and regard for this House, the Houses of the Oireachtas, the institutions of the State.  He had a particular respect for you, a Chathaoirligh, in your position and for the Leas-Chathaoirleach and all of us on all sides of the House irrespective of our political persuasion.  All of us felt, after the traumatic end to his life last week, that we had lost somebody who was very close to us.  The Labour Party, certainly, had a most close working relationship with Jackie in Government and out of Government.  We never had an exchange of words or an argument about anything and we had our difficulties in and out of Government.  Jackie in his own expert way had a way of settling all the problems that go with running a House of the Oireachtas and ensuring that legislation was dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a personal basis Jackie and I had a very special relationship simply because we were both elected at the same time on the same day on 11 April 1975 in by-elections to the Seanad which were caused by the deaths of two other Senators.  Indeed, in that year tragically there were five by-elections and they were all filled together.  Jackie and I treasured a picture that was taken at the time.  The caption over it was: The New Boys.  That really chuffed him.  To be referred to as a new boy was really the pinnacle of his career.  It took him a while <Col N="852" /> to get in here but, from the moment he was elected to this House, he dedicated himself totally to it.  He was never missing unless with a pair or by arrangement. He always ensured that the debate was conducted with the highest degree of decorum.  He had wonderful respect from all of us for doing so.</P>
    <P>We also had a special relationship in that Jackie and I lost our seats in the next election and we commiserated with each other.  We had our ups and downs together.  We had losses together and we both came back and won our seats again. We had a dialogue going on between us about how good things were and how tough things were.  These are happy memories we have of him.  It was certainly a privilege to know him.  We have all benefited from being close to him whether we sat in the House or on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges where he fought tenaciously for the rights of Members of this House.  On the day of his death he was ensuring that the rights of Members were established and upheld. One of his last commands to me going out the door was to ensure that that was followed through in his absence.  As Senators know, we adjourned the matter awaiting his return to deal with it.</P>
    <P>We have many happy memories of him.  It was an honour to be present at the removal of his remains and at his burial and we were privileged, a Chathaoirligh, that you could be there to lead the guard of honour, representing all of us when we walked behind him as our last gesture of solidarity with him.  I think he would have been proud that all of us were there, the Cathaoirleach, Members of the Seanad and Dáil and the Taoiseach who was represented officially.  For me that said something of Jackie Daly.  He could transcend all political affiliations and, as Senator Manning said, he defended the motor industry tenaciously. Not alone that, but he was successful in having major changes made in legislation and in financial legislation which affected the motor industry which he proudly represented.</P>
    <P>There are legends about his canvassing. One could go on forever.  On the <Col N="853" /> day of his burial, members of the motor trade were there.  Committed Fianna Fáil people said they never had any problem canvassing for and with Jackie because when they contacted their councillors, not alone did they not have to make an excuse that Jackie was a personal friend of the motor industry but they were reminded by the Fianna Fáil councillors that he was also a very special friend of theirs.  He had something about him that most politicians can never achieve, the ability to deal with all people of all persuasions.</P>
    <P>We have lost a friend.  When we were present at the graveside the other day we looked down at the lakes he loved and was so proud of.  As Willie Ryan said, we hope the green grass of his native Kerry will lay gently on him.  I hope indeed that the green grass of Aghadoe will rest lightly on this wonderful Kerryman whom all of us loved so much.  Go ndéana Dia Trócaire ar a anam.</P>

      <P>As the longest serving university Senator I would like to join in the tributes to Senator Jackie Daly.  I remember very well when he was elected to the Seanad, his immediate ability to establish a personal relationship with each of us.  I think that is what we are trying to say today.  He had a unique warm personal relationship with each Member of this House.  He made a contribution which is very hard to quantify but I think that is a theme that has run through the contributions.</P>
      <P>I had intended to refer to his warmth and to his capacity for friendship but, in fact, everyone who has spoken has emphasised these qualities.  I had also intended to refer to his sense of what the Seanad is about, to the importance he attached to it, to the time he put into his role of Senator.  That also has been emphasised by Senator Manning and others.  It is something which is of particular importance in a Member of this House, and, therefore, although it was tragic that he died it was perhaps fitting that he pased away in the service of this House as has been mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wanted to refer to the many <Col N="854" /> times he chaired this House as acting Chairman.  He was a most fairminded, balanced, intelligent chairman, again with a sense of this House and as somebody often trying to open up issues and perhaps raise matters that might just have been on the margin of being in order, he was always generous, always perceptive. He followed the argument and allowed the maximum freedom to an individual Member.  He will be greatly missed by all of us and I would like to join in the sympathy to his family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of the new Senators and when you come first you look for friends.  I met friends on all sides of the House but there are some people you get very friendly with and I become very friendly with Jackie.  Jackie was a self-made man, a man who always recognised the other fellow's view.  He always asked a question and in the question he was giving advice.  He was a character and he had a warmth about him that was typical of Kerry people.</P>
      <P>He recognised I think more than anybody else the qualities of this House and what the Houses of the Oireachtas mean. He was very proud of that.  I did not realise on Thursday morning when he was leaving us that he would not be coming back.  I was the last to leave him. He was fine.  He was thoroughly checked out and he was going for an x-ray.  All of a sudden he got a very bad attack and passed away shortly afterwards.  He was a very, very dear friend of mine.  He took an interest in everybody, even though they were in opposition to him or did not think like him.  He had a great way about him when putting arguments across.  The way he put across his arguments in this House was one thing.  He was the perfect Senator.  There may be an impression of the Seanad that would not be Jackie's impression.  He put that across in an elegant way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was certainly very good to people and had great feelings and great compassion. He had a tendency to listen and to do things very discreetly in a very compassionate way.  I know that because every week when I came up here the first <Col N="855" /> person I looked for was Jackie.  I will miss him and I know my friends Liam Burke and Senator McDonald will miss him.  As he was being wheeled out of the House he said he was going for a 70,000 mile check up.  Unfortunately he did not come back.  He went gracefully.  He would have liked it that way.  He was privileged and honoured to be a Senator.  We should be privileged and I am certainly honoured that I knew him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>If Jackie was here with us today he probably would say that enough has been said.  We could talk for a lot longer and we would not cover all we would like to say.  Jackie was a gentleman. He was very helpful in a personal way, particularly if somebody was ill and he had to do something for them.  He went out of his way in a very practical way to see that everything possible was done.  He was very tolerant in very difficult situations and he was always trying to find the best way forward out of awkward situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He brought a commitment to this House that anyone would bring to a business and took it no less lightly than any one would take a business.  He took it very seriously indeed.  I had many discussions with him.  I can just picture Jackie having a store of information somewhere with little bits of paper relating to something you had asked him to do.  This was evidence of the conscientiousness that he displayed in every sense of the word.  He had an appeal for everybody in the House including the ushers and the staff in general.  He had a disarming way with him when you wanted to have some sort of discussion with him, maybe on something he might not totally agree with.  He used to look at me and say: &ldquo;Do you think that would work Jack?&rdquo;  That meant I was not going to get any support.  He had a nice way of telling you he was not going to support you.  He was a gentleman.  I would like to join with all of the other people in the House who have paid tribute to him.  I felt it was right that only the Leaders of the various <Col N="856" /> groups should speak but I could not resist the feeling that, having such regard for the man and being a Member of the House when he arrived, and having dealt with him as the Assistant Whip it would be wrong for me not to put on record the esteem in which I held him.  May the Lord have mercy on his soul.</P>

      <P>I was not here last Wednesday but when I opened <i>The Irish Times</i> the following day and read of the death of Jack Daly I realised along with everyone else here that I had lost a great friend.</P>
      <P>As a Senator who is fortunate enough to be in this House from the northern part of Ireland I would like to say how very warmly he welcomed me when I first arrived here, how open he was with me in both agreeing and disagreeing with my views, not only in the House but privately as well, how very much he tried to understand in a very tolerant way the difficulties that confront the two communities in Northern Ireland, how he never tried to force a case in that direction but was hopeful that with tolerance and goodwill, time would bring us closer together.  In bringing us closer together, he certainly reached across a very warm hand of friendship to myself from the extreme south west to the extreme north east.  I shall miss him very much.  I would like to offer his family my sympathy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like very briefly to pay a small tribute to my dear friend and colleague over a long number of years.  I want to join in the various fulsome tributes my colleagues have paid to him in the House this evening.  I know we have lost an admirable colleague.  The Seanad has lost a very dedicated Senator. There is no doubt that Kerry has lost a particularly powerful representative.  In my experience here irrespective of what kind of legislation was under discussion it was interesting to be in the Chair and listen to Senator Daly lauding the pros and cons of the tourist industry in Killarney at the drop of a hat: he never lost <Col N="857" /> an opportunity to promote the interest of his beloved Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party have lost a member who served the party with great dedication at every level from branch to the National Executive.  I first met him on the national council almost 30 years ago but his work for the country through the party went back perhaps even 20 years further when, in less enlightened times, it took more guts and more dedication to stand by and to proclaim one's loyalties to one's ideas.</P>
      <P>As has already been said, on the floor of the House or on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or, indeed, on the Joint Committee on Small Businesses, he made a very definite contribution. In his later role as Whip, a post which has always been a very difficult one, he played it with understanding and appreciated the pressures on colleagues. He gave everybody consideration and, through his work as Whip, his great integrity and his agreeableness shone forth very clearly.</P>
      <P>In his business career he was a national leader.  In the Seanad where our electoral system is based on the vocational system, he was the ideal Senator.  He publicly defended and promoted the interests and the viability of the motor industry on every possible occasion.  I do not think the Finance Bills will be the same again from the point of view of his getting in the plugs about the dire straits which the industry was in.  It is nice to see that in appreciation of that contribution in the House and elsewhere, his colleagues and friends in the Society of the Irish Motor Industry elected him a fellow of the society which I think is international.  By any standards this was an honour and a rare distinction for an Irishman.  We all agree that he deserved it.  If I may, a Chathaoirligh, I would like to say to the President and Council of the SIMI and to his friends and colleagues in the trade that we sympathise with them in their loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest loss of all, I believe, is to his family.  Jack was not a proud or a vain man but, to my certain knowledge, he <Col N="858" /> took great pleasure and pride in the progress and especially the happiness of his family and of his cherished grandchildren, one and all.  That came out very much undisguised.  For those of us who were very close to him his loss is irreplaceable. Many will recall his splendid qualities of mind and heart and his generous nature, so shrewd in assessing the propositions of others innovative in his thinking beyond the norm of accepted ideas and imaginative in his expectation and desires for a better Ireland, for perhaps an Ireland better than the one he and his generation grew up in.</P>
    <P>I would like especially, a Chathaoirligh, to thank you, and all our colleagues in the House who attended the funeral. I believe the family would like me to express their sincere appreciation and thanks and to yourself, a Chathaoirligh, for taking part in the guard of honour which involved quite a long walk through Killarney.  We very much appreciate your kind gesture.  The family asked me to express their very sincere thanks to you.</P>
    <P>To the Clerk of the Seanad, the Captain of the Guard and the individual members of the staff of the House who travelled the not inconsiderable journey down to Killarney for the funeral and to pay their respects, the family are very grateful and very much appreciate the support and messages of condolence.  If I may speak on a personal basis, I have had a very close personal relationship with Jack for many years.  To me and a few of our colleagues who spent our leisure time together, especially in midweeks, he is a great loss.  There will be a great change of lifestyle for us all but at least we have found memories of a man who served his country very well.  May the Lord have mercy on him.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my tribute to Jack to those of all my colleagues here.  Certainly Jack's going last Thursday has deprived me and Senators to whom I have listened and, indeed, Senators who have not spoken but would wish to do so, of a very great and sincere friend.  He devoted himself <Col N="859" /> unselfishly to this House.  Like myself and other Members he firmly believed in the Seanad; he understood its constitutional status and he was a staunch supporter of its role.  Indeed, he believed in the other House also.</P>
      <P>I would like again to try to convey our sympathy to his family and to his dearly loved daughter, Fidelma, and his two sons Billy and Jimmy, his sisters and his son-in-law and say to them that perhaps time may help them to get over the awful loss of Jack leaving them.  He loved them deeply and because of recent events in my own life we could talk quite freely of those who were close to us and whom we loved.  He was one of the most popular members of this House.  He was in it before me, as Senator Ferris said, and then left it for a short time and came back.  Since 1977, when I came in here he was a marvellous friend and he was absolutely sincere in everything he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is a dreadful loss to the Fine Gael Party and to the organisation and I would like to put that on record.  Sometimes it is said that you can be replaced and maybe you will not be missed.  I certainly think Jack Daly will be missed and that his memory will stay with all of us for a long time.  I did not think I was saying goodbye to him at 12.45 last Thursday when he went into the ambulance.  The guard of honour who escorted him in Dublin and in Killarney were a tribute to the man, to the way he served all his constituency, the whole nation.  I would like also to put on record &mdash; I could not say it to him: he was gone &mdash; my appreciation of his co-operation when he was a temporary chairman when I was Cathaoirleach six years ago and then when he was with me for four years when I was Leas-Chathaoirleach and with former Senator Pat Joe Reynolds.  Again he was here for the past 12 months.  He was always there when we had to call on him.  I would like to say thanks also on behalf of the Clerk of the Seanad, Kieran and Deirdre, the Assistant Clerk as they do not have an opportunity to say it themselves. He was a wonderful friend also to them.  All we can say now is &ldquo;May God <Col N="860" /> look after Jack&rdquo;.  We know he is with his late wife and all we can retain are wonderful memories of a great Senator and a great public representative.  May God rest his soul.  We will now stand.</P>

      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Bradford and Reynolds as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Bradford's Motion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded. Senator Reynolds may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise a point with the Leader of the House that I raised some time ago and I think it is now of some importance, that is, the recently published report by the European Community on the implications of the internal market by 1992.  I believe that in this House we have a very good opportunity to have a series of discussions <Col N="861" /> and debates on the implications for this country of the completion of the internal market.  I am not suggesting that we should have one or two debates but that, by agreement with the Whips, in a structured way we could look at the various implications of the completion of the internal market in this House over the coming weeks and months.  I believe that we have a great duty to inform ourselves and to inform the wider public of its implications. I also believe that there is little point in doing this two or three years down the line.  I feel that now, through consultation, this is something which all parties would wish to see done.  I would like the Leader of the House to give his commitment to putting this in train as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I understood that the Adoption (No. 2) Bill was going to be ordered today for its Report Stage.  I heard yesterday that that was not to be the case.  It is important to the orderly work of this House, particularly on Bills, that we should know reasonably in advance what matters are being taken.  I would like the Leader of the House to confirm if it is the case that the Adoption (No. 2) Bill on Report Stage will be taken tomorrow.  Could he indicate to us what other business is proposed to be taken. It is very difficult to prepare properly for Bills unless we know in what order they will be taken.  I appreciate that it is difficult at times when Ministers have to be got ready, but there seems to be more of a change around recently in a rather sudden way than had been the case before for whatever reason.  I would certainly welcome clarification of the position particularly in relation to the Adoption (No. 2) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter raised by Senator Manning I agree with him that it would be important in this House that we have an early debate on the internal market and on the enormous implications for Ireland of moving towards 1992.  I also feel that another report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities which was ordered last week but which could not <Col N="862" /> be taken because of pressure of other business, that is, No. 7 on the Order Paper, the report on the Implementation of the Directive on Product Liability, is extremely important.  Ireland should already have implemented the Directive on Product Liability.  We should either have legislation or at the very least a statutory instrument implemented, because the time limit for implementation has now passed.  We do not have any intimation from the Government of what steps are going to be taken.</P>
    <P>I noticed that when there was a recent list of proposed measures to be passed by the Oireachtas &mdash; certainly passed by the Dáil before the summer &mdash; there was no reference to legislation on the issue of product liability.  We are bound by our commitment at European Community level to implement the Directive on Product Liability and it is extremely important. What is particularly important is that it may well be that, if Ireland fails to implement by legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, it is not a matter of referring to a report; it is actually necessary legislation.  The report was ordered last week and for various reasons was not reached.  It is extremely important that the report is reached because it recommends the importance of bringing in early legislation to ensure that we meet the deadline.  We have now missed the deadline but at least we should be bringing in legislation at the earliest opportunity. I would welcome clarification of that position.</P>

I would like to add my voice to that of Senator Robinson because I pointed out some months ago that a situation was developing where, for example, while we <Col N="863" /> were required to bring into effect certain protocols protecting information systems, we had allowed the date to lapse. This is important particularly when we consider the Custom House development and the possibility of introducing a financial centre.  So, I think there is a degree of urgency and I would welcome an indication from the Leader of the House on when such a debate will take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first of all support Senator Robinson?  On the question of the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, I was under the impression that it was being taken today.  The last time I checked was yesterday afternoon and it was being taken today.  I was a bit nonplussed when I discovered this morning that it was not being taken today.  We on this side of the House have tried very hard to make use of the fact that legislation has been introduced here.  We have tried to deal with legislation constructively, to introduce amendments and talk to people who are interested in legislation and in general try to take the business of the House with the seriousness that important business deserves.  It is not possible to do that if the order is being continually changed around and if notice is not given, and if we cannot know from week to week what precisely is being taken from week to week.</P>
      <P>I am fairly sure that, as always in these cases, it is neither the Leader of the House nor the Government Whip who are responsible for this misorganisation.  I would like clarification that the Adoption (No. 2) Bill will be taken first tomorrow and that it will not be postponed, especially if the Insurance Bill is not completed. I would like to know when it will be taken tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, may I agree with the Leader of the Fine Gael group that it is more than timely for him to suggest that we should have a debate on the implications of the internal market, given in particular the fact that Fine Gael, among other people, assured us that VAT on foodstuffs would not be a consequence of the Single European Act and that they now <Col N="864" /> propose to introduce it themsleves at 15 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Manning and other Senators have asked for a debate on the internal market.  I totally agree that this is a matter which has not been adequately addressed by anybody in the country yet.  However, a report is to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas shortly from the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  I suggest that we start a debate as soon as possible after we get that report, having given people time to digest what is in it.  I totally agree with the need for the debate because there is an inadequacy of information throughout the country on the implications the internal market will have for us as, indeed, it will have for other countries throughout the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the questions raised about the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, I reject the comments that have been made that there is constant changing on the Order of Business and on Bills.  In fact, there has not been any inconsistency either in regard to the Order of Business.  This is the first time there has been a change at such short notice.  It is not of my making. However, the House can be assured that the Adoption (No. 2) Bill will be before <Col N="865" /> us tomorrow.  It will be No. 2 on the Order Paper tomorrow.  There is a Veterinary Surgeons Order which we will have to go through, but it should not delay the House too long.  I say that with reservation because often when one expects things not to go on too long, that is the very time the debate can become extended.  However, it is intended to take the Adoption (No. 2) Bill as Item No. 2 tomorrow.</P>
    <P>On Item No. 7, we will have, I think, an early debate.  I will report the comments to the Government in terms of legislation that might be needed to be implemented.  Over the next few weeks we will be taken up with Government business.  Next week we will be sitting three days and the major business will be the Finance Bill.  We will continue with the Insurance Bill and the Companies (No. 2) Bill throughout the next few weeks.  I cannot give any commitment as to when these Bills will finish.  At this stage there are over 132 amendments printed to the Insurance Bill on Committee Stage and a further list of Government amendments has come in, so that the Bill cannot go through at an early stage.</P>
    <P>The Companies (No. 2) Bill will be back with us again over the next couple of weeks and we will get as much work done as possible.  Some people are of the opinion that the Bill is being held up here. It is being held up here but for the right reason, that is, it is very important legislation and changes are being made and amendments are being brought in which are being considered by the Government. That is the way most people would wish to see such a major piece of legislation as the Companies (No. 2) Bill being dealt with.  The same situation arises on the Insurance Bill.  That again is legislation which is long overdue for change and again it is not a Bill that can be rushed out of this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb wishes to have a debate on the continuing horrific events in the North of Ireland.  I will take this into account and we will have a debate on that matter as soon as it can be arranged.</P>

      <P>We are on the Report Stage of the Oil Pollution of the Sea Bill (Civil Liability and Compensation), 1987.  This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82 it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question that the Bill be received for final consideration, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as a report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendments made by the Dáil. For the convenience of Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. B. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill has been passed by Dáil Éireann with amendments and I would like to explain these amendments to this House.  The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to cover Rosslare Harbour, which is under the administrative control of Iarnrod Éireann-Irish Rail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of amendment No. 2 is to make it clear that both the harbour master and any other person enforcing the provisions of that Act must each be appointed by a harbour authority, as defined.  I envisage that in certain cases the harbour master and his deputy might each be appointed by a harbour authority <Col N="867" /> to enforce the provisions of this Act in their own harbour.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 3 is to make it clear that the &ldquo;liability&rdquo; referred to is &ldquo;liability for pollution damage&rdquo;.  The subsection , as amended, means that an owner of a ship shall not incur any liability for pollution damage otherwise than under section 7 of the Bill.  Amendment No. 4 is a technical amendment which I brought forward on the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 5 is to correct the positioning of certain words which were transposed during the printing of the Bill.  In Page 11, subsection (1) line 23 of the Bill as passed by Seanad Éireann, the words &ldquo;or a harbour-master may detain a ship in his harbour&rdquo; appear. These words should in fact be included after the second reference to &ldquo;State&rdquo; in line 24.  This has now been done in the new subsection (1).  The change does not affect the intended meaning of that subsection.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 was brought forward on the advice of the Attorney General. The effect of it is to make both the owner and the master of a ship detained under section 13 guilty of an offence if the ship leaves or attempts to leave any harbour or any other place otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.  The amendment also provides that the ship may be detained, or further detained, if it attempts to leave any place in the State after being stopped and detained, if it appeared that the owner of that ship had incurred a liability for pollution damage.</P>
    <P>The object of amendment No. 7 is to ensure that ships which are neither registered in another Convention country nor the State carry on board a certificate showing that there is in force, in respect of the ship, a contract of insurance or other financial security which satisfies the law of either the Convention country concerned or the State, whichever is appropriate, relating to the bulk carriage of oil.  Ships of non-Convention countries would, therefore, have to hold insurance <Col N="868" /> cover up to the same level as Irish-registered ships or ships from other Convenion countries.</P>
    <P>The object of amendment No. 8 is to make it clear that the provisions of section 34 relating to the detention of ships refer to an inspector or harbour master exercising the powers conferred on them by section 13 (3) or section 16. In the case of section 13 (3), a ship may be detained or be further detained if it attempts to leave any place in the State after being stopped and detained if it appeared that the owner of that ship had incurred a liability for pollution damage. As regards section 16, a ship may be stopped and detained at any place in the State if it attempts to leave in contravention of that section which provides that the master of the ship shall produce a certificate in relation to the existence of a contract of insurance in respect of his ship.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 9 is to correct the omission of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; which occurred during the printing of the Bill.  The object of amendment No. 10 is to rectify an omission in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 was brought forward on the advice of the Attorney General. Section 35 provides that when in respect of an offence under this Act, an order has been made detaining a ship, a district justice may, if satisfactory security is given, order the ship to be released pending the hearing of the charge against the ship.  The object of this amendment is to make it clear that following the hearing of the charge, the fine, if any, and the costs of the trial may be paid to the Minister for the Marine out of the security lodged in court.</P>
    <P>The object of amendment No. 12 is to provide that any director, manager, secretary or other official of a body corporate which committed an offence shall also be guilty of an offence in certain specified circumstances.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 was brought forward on the advice of the Attorney General. The intent of the new section 41 is the same as the existing section 41.  Two changes were made in the new section 41 as follows: (i) the word &ldquo;document&rdquo; is <Col N="869" /> used instead of the word &ldquo;record&rdquo;; (ii) reference to the &ldquo;Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 to 1977&rdquo; is included.</P>
    <P>I commend these amendments to the Bill to this House.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I would like some clarification on a point you raised.  You have indicated that a Member may speak only once on this question.  I thought we would be taking it in sections.  This is is the first time I have dealt with a Bill on Report Stage.  As you said, this is a Seanad Bill which passed all Stages in the Seanad on 12 November. We are dealing today with the amendments recommended by the Dáil.  Would it be appropriate for me to go through all the amendments and say what I think of them in one speech?  Is that the procedure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>We will proceed on those lines.  I wish to make some comments on the amendments.  We are all aware that the pressure for this Bill arose originally because we had a disaster involving the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>.  Around the same time we had a second near disaster involving the <i>Capo Emma</i>, an oil carrying cargo ship, which nearly went aground.  This would have been several thousand times more serious than the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster, which was only leaking engine oil.</P>
      <P>I accept amendments Nos. 1 and 2. They are technical amendments and they are necessary.  I would like to ask a question about section 7, as amended.  That section reads:</P>
      <P>An owner of a ship shall not incur any liability for pollution damage otherwise than under this section;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have some points on that section clarified.  For example in the case of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> where that ship was losing engine oil, would the owner be liable, or would the Bill only apply to a ship carrying oil as cargo if the oil pollution was caused as a result of that? Does it cover both eventualities, or which <Col N="870" /> eventuality does it cover?  I am not clear on the purpose of inserting &ldquo;for pollution damage&rdquo; in the subsection.</P>
    <P>You will have to bear with me, a Chathaoirligh, because some of these technical amendments alter greatly the original intention of the Bill as passed by this House and some of them make it more clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right.  It is only a technical amendment as well.</P>
      <P>Section 7 deals with insurance.  Is there any limit on the size of the ships covered in this Bill?  As larger ships are now in fashion does that liability insurance cover up to any limit?  I would like to pose a question about the proposed amendment to section 13.  Does it make provision for ships in distress that come into ports? Would it have any effect on the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906?  Under marine law this Act allowed ships in distress to come into port for shelter and for repair.  Could they be arrested or held for doing this? Does the section, as amended, make any difference to that situation?  Amendment No. 8 to section 34 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 22, lines 39 to 41, &ldquo;Whenever an inspector, in exercise of his powers under this Act, or a harbour-master, in exercise of the powers conferred on him by section 16,&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;Whenever an inspector or a harbour-master, in exercise of the powers <Col N="871" /> conferred by section 13 (3) or section 16,&rdquo; substituted.</P>
    <P>What would happen in a case where a ship was in the jurisdiction of a harbour and for any reason, damage or otherwise, it started to break up?  What powers would the harbour master have in that case?  Is pollution caused by a ship starting to break up covered under this section?  Would that have any bearing on section 34, as amended?  The remaining amendments were recommended by the Attorney General for technical or legal reasons.</P>

This is most important at present when we are trying to keep our natural resources, our seas and our rivers, pollution free.  The Minister will be introducing the new Estuarial Development Bill.  I am delighted that this legislation will help to keep our natural resources free from pollution.  I come from the Shannon region where we have large industrial development.  I am glad to say it is pollution free.  I welcome this progressive legislation.</P>

      <P>I join with the previous speaker in complimenting the Minister and the other House on the amendments.  Obviously these points were referred to a very substantial degree when the Bill came before this House on a previous occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one question in relation to section 7 which basically refers to the responsibility for ships whether we are a Convention country or outside that arrangement.  When the Minister is replying he might clarify what would happen where a ship had no determined owner either inside or outside the Convention countries.  In a number of places along the coast there are coasters which have been abandoned effectively in the various ports.  They are causing pollution on an on-going basis.  However, the Bill refers <Col N="872" /> to specifically pollution of the type caused by the <i>Betelgeuse</i> disaster in Bantry and the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>.  I am referring specifically to coasters and small craft which have been abandoned.  The companies that owned them at some time in the past have disappeared into the night. I could instance specific ports where the problem is very acute at present, in south Kerry and in parts of west Cork.  I am not referring just to visual pollution but pollution on an on-going basis.  For example the Ranga beach in west Kerry is polluted on a daily basis.  The owners of the abandoned vessels appear to have just walked away from their responsibilities. I understand from Kerry County Council debates that nobody has had a successful mechanism at his disposal up to now to address this problem.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether it is provided for in any subsection of this Bill, which appears to be extremely comprehensive.  On reading through it I could find no other reason why an owner or a master of a ship could get out under the wire and shirk his responsibilities.  The Minister and his draftsmen are to be complimented on getting it right.  I have not found any provision for that aspect of the discussion, but the Minister might refer to it when replying.</P>

      <P>I want to make the same observations as Senator O'Callaghan on section 7.  I want to refer to Senator McCormack's initial remarks.  This legislation goes back over a number of years. I think it was in the late sixties that it was first introduced.  It was not an occurrence or event of late which brought forward this legislation.  I hope we are bringing it to a close today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with my colleagues in complimenting the Minister and his team on the fine legislation before us today &mdash; progressive legislation which is well <Col N="873" /> thought out and well planned.  It takes account of what we in Ireland have to offer compared to many other countries in the world.  We are the envy of most other countries throughout the world because of our pollution free water and air.  It is extremely important, in view of the developments in technology that this legislation maintains all our safeguards intact.  We have only to look at Dublin Bay, Cork Harbour, the Shannon Estuary, all these places have to be protected by the Department of the Marine, and by the Minister and his officials.  While I have said some tough things about the Department of the Marine in the past, I now compliment the Minister and say, &ldquo;well done&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Bill implements a number of infrastructural conventions in relation to the bulk carriage of oil.  The main thrust of the Bill is to make it obligatory for oil tankers to be insured against oil pollution damage which they might cause.  A back up compensation fund financed by contributions from the oil tanker people is available to meet claims which, for one reason or another, are not covered by the ship owners' insurance.  That is important and valid.  I do not want to hold up the legislation any longer.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. B. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my sincere thanks to all the Senators for their helpful and constructive comments.  I will deal with the points raised by Senator McCormack. We are talking about bulk carriers of oil. The legislation covers both the oil carried in the bulk carrier and any bunker oil or other oil associated with it.  In relation to size, ships of all sizes are covered; all sizes of bulk tanker carriers are covered. There is a limit in the overall Convention. There is a fund which, as Senator Cassidy pointed out, is contributed to by the various organisations involved.  The insurance cover together with the availability of the fund will ensure that any damage is fully covered.  In the final analysis the owners will be responsible in the event of that arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Points were raised on section 13 (1) <Col N="874" /> about whether ships in distress or otherwise which cause pollution are covered under this legislation.  They can be detained.  If a ship creates pollution, whether in distress or otherwise, it can be detained under this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 34 deals with the potential for criminal offences.  Pollution caused by a ship breaking up is also covered under section 13 (1) and section 7.  We are dealing here specifically with criminal offences arising from incidents of this nature.  The actual pollution offence is covered under the other sections I have dealt with already.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators Kiely and Cassidy for their very helpful comments.  In the Department of the Marine we are endeavouring to bring our maritime legislation into line with international conventions and into line with developments taking place within the Community and internationally.  We are working on a number of measures which are designed specifically to bring our national legislation into line with international and Community legislation.  I am satisfied that we will have further legislation at a very early stage.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with the point Senator O'Callaghan raised.  This legislation deals with oil tankers.  I propose to introduce new legislation to deal with the problems the Senator had described.  We have already some measures in the course of preparation.  I will take the views expressed by the Senator into account. We have already been made aware of this because of our experience of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> affair and because of the situation in other areas where we find, for one reason or another, hazards we would like to eliminate.  In the new legislation we are framing we will attend specifically to the points raised by the Senators.</P>
    <P>We would like to bring our maritime legislation into line with the 20th century. Unfortunately, some of the legislation in operation at present is archaic, out-of-date and is not capable of responding to present day circumstances and opportunities. In the maritime legislation alone you are probably talking about 1,000 <Col N="875" /> sections, or thereabouts, of very complicated legislation, designed in different centuries to meet different situations.</P>
    <P>The rationale behind the establishment of the Department of the Marine was to tackle and deal with issues of this nature. We have already taken some steps in introducing the legislation at present before Senators.  As I have already indicated, we have a number of other very important measures which, I hope, will be coming before the Seanad in due course.  This will tidy up the area of our maritime legislation.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the officials in the Department of the Marine and myself I wish to express our deep appreciation of the constructive approach shown this afternoon to this legislation.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 10, 11, 12, 14 and 15 refer in particular to the importance of having due notice given to the people who are going to be affected by delivery of post.  Section 4 refers to serving very serious documents in the case of a company incorporated or a society registered in the State.  Any notice, or requisition, or document to be sent to those people is of such importance <Col N="876" /> that it necessitates registered post in order to ensure that no legal difficulties will arise in relation to the company or society getting the notification to the consumer or <i>vice versa</i> in a very serious situation, such as the service of documents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's amendment, if accepted, would substitute &ldquo;registered post&rdquo; for &ldquo;ordinary post&rdquo; in relation to the service of notice, documents, and so on, on persons under the Act.  In statute law, it is invariably the case that references to the service of documents are references to ordinary post and not to registered post.  An obvious example here would be the 1963 Companies Act.  In any event, there is no obligation imposed on the Minister to use the methods described in section 4.  Section 4 provides quite simply that any notice may be served by ordinary post, in other words, the Minister may use any method.  He is not tied to one particular method for the service of documents.</P>
      <P>In reality, the Minister, as supervisory authority, would decide in particular circumstances on the most appropriate means of delivery for service of documents. This could include ordinary post, or registered post, depending on the circumstances and location of the addressee.  It could include delivery by hand, with registered signatory of receipt, if required.  It could include a telex in the interests of speed, or registered facsimile transmission of documentation where appropriate, which is very much the modern method.  The important point is that the most appropriate means of communication will be determined having regard to individual circumstances.  Accordingly, I request the Senator not to proceed with the amendment.  The Minister should be free, in my view, to determine the appropriate course of action in particular cases. In the event of a dispute it would obviously be a matter for the court to decide if the documents were properly served. However, this is extremely unlikely to occur in practice.</P>

      <P>I certainly see that the Minister would want discretion in the way in which he could serve documents on an undertaking.  He will have to admit that a dispute could arise if a document had not been received or there was no receipt for it on delivery.  I will not proceed with these amendments. I wished to highlight the technical difficulties that might arise in the event of a dispute.  I was merely trying to protect the Department and the Minister from a dispute.  If the Minister is happy about it, I am quite happy about it.</P>

      <P>The purpose of Amendment No. 16 is to delete subsection (1), lines 27 to 30, on page 7. The reason for this amendment is that subsection (1) which, as Senators can see, provides for payment of fees in connection with applications for ministerial recognition of brokers under section 38 is no longer necessary.  The revised scheme of former ministerial recognition of brokers' bodies will be proposed in Part IV of the Bill.  That will not require the payment of fees.  This subsection is, therefore, superfluous and I think we can safely delete it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 deals with the submission and publication of returns and documents by insurers.  I would like to know from the Minister if he has found any problems in this area with insurance companies generally.  If he has found that companies, for one reason or another, do not submit various documents and returns to him what action, if any, has he taken?  I would like him to comment generally on the attitude of companies to this section.  Is he happy that insurers in the past have been co-operative?  I would like a general summary from him on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not had any great difficulty in this area other than one very celebrated case where documents had to be sought from one of the companies in administration and were subsequently got under suggestions of court action, but that was an exception.  The general position is that we have no difficulty in this area.  This simply now encompasses in statute what, in effect, has been happening anyway.  The companies have been very co-operative and this information has been freely provided but we felt the need to encompass it clearly in substantive legislation, which has not been the case before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Fallon referred to this.  I have no doubt that the Minister had difficulties in the past in getting information and in having returns disclosed and documents sent to his Department in relation to particular companies in administration.  It is essential that the Minister should have whatever powers are necessary to ensure that a company in a doubtful solvency situation is required under legislation as tight as possible, to send to the Minister and his Department returns and documents which are necessary to bring about a greater realisation of the difficulties of <Col N="880" /> the firm.  That would assist the administrator in carrying out the full administration of the company to the benefit of the consumer.  It is essential in view of the fact that policyholders are paying a massive contribution each year by way of the 2 per cent levy to a company administrator in order to pay for the administration of the company.  I would take a poor view if the Minister had not got ample powers to get these documents and returns.  I am glad that the matter was raised and that the Minister has given us some assurance.  I do not think we should let this opportunity pass without saying that there were difficulties in the past.  I hope that, as a result of this Bill, similar difficulties will not arise in the future.</P>

      <P>This section is welcomed by the responsible people in the industry. They feel it is a power the Minister should have in the public interest and we, as legislators, agree.  The people in the industry to whom I have spoken have no problems with this section which confers on the Minister power to send for documents, to examine them, to publish them if he requires it to be done, and also to lay them before the House when the public interest is at stake.  The people in the industry have no problem that I am aware of and I have had many discussions with them on this Bill.  I welcome the section.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 36 and 37 to insert new paragraphs as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(g) the prohibition or limitation <Col N="881" /> of investments of a specified class or description,</P>
    <P>(h) the percentage of distributed surplus allocated to policyholders&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the scope of the two new paragraphs is clear.  This deals with the power to make regulations to forbid investments in certain areas. Secondly, it deals with the maintenance of certain levels of bonuses, and so on. With regard to the proposed paragraph (g), I would like to emphasise that this is an enabling power only and, before any regulation will be made, full consultation will take place with all interested parties in the insurance industry.  The proposed paragraph (h), which would give the Minister power to lay down regulations governing the distribution of surplus by life insurers, is a desirable protection for policyholders.  Other EC insurance supervisory authorities already have similar powers available to them.  For example, allocations to policyholders are covered in detail in UK legislation.</P>
      <P>The regulation envisaged under the paragraph could require an insurer to notify the Minister if he proposes to make no allocation to policyholders or if he proposes to make a lower allocation than before.  This will help to protect the position of policyholders in that such a reduction in bonus payments could indicate that an undertaking was experiencing some financial difficulty or, indeed, manipulation of funds in favour of distributions to shareholders at the expense of policyholders, that is, asset stripping which would frustrate the reasonable expectations of policyholders as to the surplus distribution which should be made to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very difficult to understand the insertion of this paragraph into the section.  I would like to ask the Minister what difference the insertion of the new paragraph (g) would make in view of the fact that paragraph (c) basically deals with the nature and spread of assets representing underwriting liabilities. The limitation of investments of a <Col N="882" /> specified class or description is covered under paragraph (c).  Perhaps the Minister could give us the benefit of his advice on the difference between these two paragraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point the Senator is making.  It is very valuable. First, this is an enabling section in which the Minister takes power to lay down this prohibition or limitation of investments of a specified class or description if he decides it is in the public interest to do so.</P>
      <P>It is obviously desirable that policyholders' funds should be invested in appropriate places and in appropriate types of investments.  If the Minister of the day felt that an undesirable class of investment was being considered by an insurance company, he could say that was not the type of investment in which they should be investing policyholders' funds. The purpose of the measure is not in any way to interfere but to give the Minister some reserve functions if, for example, an attempt was being made to invest the policyholders' funds in something unusual like oil wells in the Sahara or something of that nature which one would not normally regard as an ordinary, sensible investment for policyholders' funds.</P>
      <P>The EC have directives in this area and they cannot be contravened.  The Minister would be acting <i>ultra vires</i> if he were to do that.  We feel that directives may be changed in the future to cover solvency margins, assets which would not be covered at present, and that enabling powers could, therefore, be used if necessary at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was concerned that the insertion of this paragraph might be against the rules of the EC directives and I am glad to hear the Minister saying that they are not.  I am concerned that the Minister should have powers to direct any company to invest their money in any way at any time.  In Ireland at the moment there are fund managers in all insurance companies who do a very good job.  They <Col N="883" /> all have contact with international investors and have access to advice from fund managers of an international calibre.  The returns that policyholders get on their investments are second to none and the performance has been extremely good over the past 20 years or so.  As a result of the Stock Market collapse last October, returns took a downward trend and it would be unusual if that did not happen. Fund managers have a wide range of investments available to them.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the freedom of companies to invest their policyholders' moneys in a particular way would be curtailed by a ministerial power.  I would like to see the regulations and guidelines where the Minister could intervene, tightened up and more firm guarantees given in relation to the investment of this money. After all, at the end of the day, it is the policyholder who must be protected and it is the policyholder's return that is important.  He or she has decided to invest money in a particular insurance company and they expect to get the best return that is available from that company. The Minister should not interfere unless guidelines are laid down which suggest that he could interfere in relation to the investment of the policyholders' money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting section.  I realise it is an enabling section which empowers the Minister to make regulations if he so desires.  First of all, I want an assurance from the Minister that, when he makes these regulations, they will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas so that we will have an opportunity to debate them.  We now come to the fundamental principle involved, particularly with the new suggested subsection from the Minister about his rights of prohibition or limitation of investments of a specified class or description. In the Minister's reply he identified an investment abroad, in Morocco or some such place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unknown that a famous banking institution in this country had a major investment in Manhattan.  Many of us <Col N="884" /> think that investment could have been made at home and the profits made by investors in Ireland.  The directors of the bank decided that a much larger return was available by investing outside the jurisdiction.  There is a policy within the IDA to entice international industrialists to come here.  We know that the repatriation of their profits to their investors is considered by all of us on this side of the Atlantic to be the black hole where all our money seems to go.  Here, for the first time a Minister in this Government is taking unto himself power to limit that but only in regard to the insurance industry. May I take it that it is the Government's intention to have similar powers invested in the relevant Ministers in various other areas of the economy which would enable them to restrict the investment abroad, for greater profit, of hard-earned profits in this country.  This practice creates tremendous unemployment in our own country.  We would like to see all the money made in this country invested in this country, thereby creating jobs.</P>
    <P>This is a fairly strong power the Minister is giving himself.  It is one that I welcome because it is important, particularly in the areas of insurance and banking, that we should have some say in where the funds might be invested.  Is it on the grounds of risk that the Minister has reservations, or is it the principle of the movement of money outside of our shores for investment elsewhere, whether in Morocco or in Manhattan, that the Minister is concerned about?  I would like to see as much money as possible invested at home.  This is an important power but if it is limited to the insurance industry and their investments it is only touching the tip of the iceberg because unfortunately this situation prevails in many areas at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ferris that this is an interesting section of the Bill and it is also very important.  I want to query paragraphs (b) and (d).  The Minister has already referred to an example and we know he was talking about the PMPA.  I can recall a previous <Col N="885" /> example &mdash; Equity Insurance.  The infamous bush telegraph of the industry was telling us of problems within these companies for a long time.  I can recall saying at one stage to a prominent Minister that if the people who audit the accounts of the Vehicle in General in England, a company with a turnover of about £20 million in premiums, audited the accounts of the PMPA at any time they would be asked to stop trading.  I made that statement as, indeed, did many other people in the insurance industry.  We all know what happened.  The problem with the valuation of assets of an undertaking is that people may say that they have property in Cork worth £500,000 and property in Dundalk worth £225,000 when, in fact, that may not be the case. How are the Department to know what is correct?  This is a problem that will arise and has arisen in the past.  It is something which must be investigated in great detail.</P>
      <P>As regards underwriting liabilities, the provision for claims that are outstanding can be drastically understated.  I can recall a case in County Westmeath where a company estimated a claim at around £50,000 and it was settled for £275,000. These things are vital to the Bill and the whole supervisory role the Department of Industry and Commerce have in regard to insurers.  The Minister should ensure at all times that the Department have at their finger tips the up-to-date correct information with regard to assets, underwriting liabilities, the provision for outstanding claims and so on.  I welcome the fact that, like the previous section, at least this section is now clearly inserted in the Bill and will become the law of the land in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their comments on this section.  I want to say to Senator Ferris that section 8 of the Bill lays down that any orders or regulations made under the Bill obviously have to be submitted to the Houses.  The Oireachtas will get a second bite at this in the sense that the regulations would be laid before the Houses.  Any unreasonable requirement could at that stage <Col N="886" /> be prevented by the Dáil and Seanad if they so wished.  That was one of the points raised.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to make is that what we are trying to do here is to protect policyholders' funds, to make sure that they are not abused in any way and to make sure that they are not invested in such a way as would be unreasonable, dangerous or in any way likely to damage the cause of policyholders.  It is not the Government's, or any Minister's intention, to interfere with normal commercial decision-making &mdash; I want to stress that very carefully &mdash; or to interfere in any way with the investment strategy of the companies.  This is a reserved power which enables the Minister, if something unusual happens or an unusual investment is made, to decide that it is not in the policyholder's interest to engage in those type of developments.  You could conjure up all sorts of outlandish suggestions. I heard Senator Fallon talk about three-legged race horses and things like that.  That might be a bit extreme.  The powers will not be used to direct investments in a particular way.  They will almost certainly be used to say what investments should not be undertaken and that decision will be taken on the basis of the policyholder's interest.</P>
      <P>I refer Deputies to the opening line in section 12 which says: &ldquo;The Minister may make regulations for the proper exercise of his functions under the Insurance Acts in respect of the following...&rdquo;  It is clearly limited to the Minister's functions under the Insurance Acts and does not give him any broader remit other than protecting policyholders and supervising the industry under the Insurance Acts.  It is an enabling section and the regulations will have to go before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As I have said, because this is an enabling power it will be used only in specific circumstances when it is felt that the interests of policyholders are not being protected.  I cannot say that often enough.  I appreciate the efforts that companies are making at present to comply with existing regulations.  Indeed, it is not envisaged that this requirement will be used by the Minister in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> Senator Fallon mentioned property valuations and other matters.  It might be unwise of me in a public forum like this to comment on former auditors of companies which are now under administration as there is legal action pending in this area.  In regard to property valuations and so on, paragraph (b) of section 12 refers to the valuation of assets of an insurance undertaking and paragraph (c) refer to the nature and spread of assets. They address that issue.  Section 13 will also allow independent verification.  They are the points that perhaps worried the Senator.</P>
    <P>I will just refer to what Senator Ferris said about the broader issue.  The whole question of localised assets arises at the moment in the industry where 80 per cent of liability to policyholders in Ireland, 80 per cent of domestic investment by the insurance industry, must be invested in the country.  The Senator raised broader issues which do not come within this Bill, with the exception perhaps of repatriation of profits.  Obviously any Government would want to keep a linkage between the profits made by a company here and the jobs which they create out of those profits.  At the same time, we live in the EC which is completing its internal market and any ill thought-out moves to prevent repatriation of profits or to insist on private industry investing in certain areas, any interference in that way in the freedom of companies to make decisions on how to handle their funds, could have the opposite effect because the company would not have to stay here if they felt that the requirements were unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Business today is very global and businesses can and do move to where they find the most attractive environment.  I appreciate the Senator's concern about the need to translate profit-making by companies into real jobs.  At the same time, you have to be very careful in tackling that issue not to send out any messages to companies who might be considering Ireland as a location that they are not welcome here.  They should feel that, whatever funds they make from <Col N="888" /> doing business in Ireland, they are free to do with those funds, by and large commercially speaking, what they wish.  Any other message coming from this country, at this time &mdash; this is very much a strong personal view &mdash; would be crazy.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's reasoning on this.  It is the argument that has been used for some time.  I think the Minister is on record as saying that he would like companies to consider this country in the first instance because naturally it would be in everybody's interest if they invested profits here which would create jobs.  The Minister has reassured the House that 80 per cent of insurance profits are invested within the State.  It is with regard to the other 20 per cent that he is retaining the power in this section which he may bring into force.  He has also clarified that it will apply in specific instances only.  If the Minister is to stop somebody from within that 20 per cent bracket from investing outside the State a regulation will have to be brought before the House.  It would be specific to a particular stoppage that he considers desirable in the interests of the policyholders. Does that mean that all the companies will have to submit to him proposals on what their external investments will be?  If he is happy, none of us will know anything about it and it will continue.  It is only if he is unhappy that the Houses of the Oireachtas will become aware of it.  Is that the kind of procedure that will be followed?</P>

      <P>On a point of information, and to make it clear because there might be some confusion here, first it does not apply only to the 20 per cent; it applies to the 100 per cent.  Equally, a bad investment or an unusually risky <Col N="889" /> investment proposed to be made in Ireland would be as dangerous as one to be made in the Sahara or somewhere else.  Therefore, it applies across the board.  Secondly, I am happy that under the various sections of the Bill, the Minister has ample powers to get the information he needs on which he can base a decision.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 13 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>13. &mdash; An undertaking shall maintain at its registered office or place of business in the State proper records of all business carried on by the undertaking in the State under its authorisation.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The meaning of this proposed new section I hope is evident to Senators.  While it is, of course, implicit in the area of supervision of insurance undertakings that proper records are maintained in the State relating to business carried on here, this is not an explicit requirement of existing insurance legislation. The amendment will copperfasten the position in substantive insurance law. It is simply a declaratory provision.  It is possible the question could be raised whether this allows for the holding of computer-based data files and records by insurers with access from their offices to remote data bases.  For example, this section does cover a UK branch insurer in Dublin connected to its head office main frame computer in London, once the necessary records can be produced to the Department from the branch establishment in Dublin.  That is the new section.</P>

I wonder if a minimum period should be allowed for the undertaking to respond?  I say that because there are very serious penalties imposed for failing to comply.  This is a general query that the Minister would allow appropriate time because of the huge penalties involved.</P>

      <P>I would like to deal with that now but the Senator seems to be dealing with section 13 proper.  What we have here are three new sections.  The Senator has raised very good points and I will come back to them.  We are proposing three new sections, amendments Nos. 19, 20 and 21, to be inserted before the existing section 13.  The first amendment deals with the question of laying it on the company to make sure that they keep records in their Irish office and that they are available here.</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say foreign companies that have subsidiaries in Ireland would have access to main frame computers.  That will be very important to future development of insurance companies, and their accessibility to this country when we are open &mdash; tariff free and barrier free &mdash; to the internal market of the European Community. Although we are sensitive to the <Col N="891" /> insurance industry in relation to the Single European Act, nevertheless, we are pointing to the day when other companies now on mainland Europe will seek to do business in Ireland.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of keeping records and keeping tabs on companies that have their headquarters elsewhere, how is the Minister going to get sufficient information from the registered office in this country to ensure that an insurance company which has its head office elsewhere is a bonafide company, that it has enough assets and the least possible liabilities, in the interests of its policyholders, so that we do not have a debacle like we had in recent years with two companies at present under administration.  The safeguards and the records that the Minister requires from companies that come to this country as a result of our opening up to the European frontiers is very important for the policyholder.  I would like the Minister to explain what procedure he would adopt in those cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We apply the same procedures to every company based here, whether it is a branch or a head office, in that we get the annual return from the company, which is a very detailed document covering solvency margins, assets, liabilities, reserves and a whole range of financial information one would expect. Secondly, if we deem it desirable, we are entitled to seek information throughout the year at quarterly intervals or half yearly intervals.  We would do this on a regular basis.  Every so often we select companies for specific consultancy review, almost on a roll-over basis.  We pick a company every so often and say we are going to have consultants look at it and give us an opinion on its reserves and financial strategy.</P>
      <P>I am happy that any branch based here has to make its annual returns.  Section 21 (2) of Statutory Instrument No. 115 of 1976, reads:</P>
      <P>Annual Returns to Minister and Register of Technical Reserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An undertaking which is the <Col N="892" /> holder of an authorisation shall furnish to the Minister annually or at such more frequent intervals as the Minister may request, such returns and documents in such form and manner as he may require, as are necessary to enable the Minister to verify that the technical reserves mentioned in Article 14 are being maintained and to enable him to comply with Article 13 of these Regulations.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the level of disclosure of branch offices here is satisfactory.  The Senator touched on this and he was right.</P>
    <P>We see what is happening with the financial services legislation in the United Kingdom, for example.  The insurance business in financial market places is increasingly getting very complex and global.  What we have to do here, and in our own Department in particular, is to make sure we keep up with those trends internationally to ensure that our reporting requirements are as sophisticated and as modern as they possible can be.  They are fine today, but they may not be in two years time.  One cannot write legislation for what might be, but I am conscious &mdash; and I appreciate the Senator raising it again &mdash; of the changing nature of reporting systems.  We just have to look at the advent of technology to grasp that.  I thank the Senator for raising this point.</P>

      <P>This is a new section to be inserted before section 13.  Basically it deals with policyholders' funds being kept separate from shareholders' funds. That is the purpose of subsection (1). Section 22 (1) of the Bill introduces the right to amalgamate the industrial branch, IB, and ordinary branch, OB, life assurance funds maintained by an assurer with the combined fund being liable for all life assurance liabilities of the undertaking.  This subsection introduces the requirement to separate the assets representing the combined fund from the assets representing the shareholders' funds and requires sufficient accounting and other records to be maintained as are necessary to identify the assets representing the combined fund and the corresponding liabilities.  The effect here will be that the assets which represent the combined fund may only be used for the purpose of the life assurance business and that a transfer out of the fund may only be made after a surplus has been established in an actuarial investigation.  The intention is to isolate and protect policyholders' funds as far as possible from shareholders' funds.</P>
      <P>The 1986 regulations already require life assurers to submit separate returns in respect of policyholders' and shareholders' assets and liabilities.  Subsection (2) specifies that the provisions of subsection (1) are without prejudice to the obligations of an undertaking to prepare separate accounts for any class or part of a class of business as required by insurance legislation.  This will enable the Department to continue to receive returns in respect of each IB and OB fund as required by the 1986 regulations.  That is basically amendment No. 20, which is this practice of keeping as separate as possible policyholders' funds and shareholders' funds.</P>

      <P>This amendment is of a technical nature.  In view of the involvement of banks and building societies in the insurance business, and setting up their own life assurance companies, is there a separation of assets and liabilities in relation to the Bank of Ireland, or the Allied Irish Bank, or building societies, getting involved in insurance business? Would they be in a position, as financial institutions, to transfer shareholders' dividends?  If they were shareholders of the Bank of Ireland, would they receive a dividend out of the life assurance company or the life assurance arm of the Bank of Ireland Group?</P>
      <P>I am extremely concerned at the recent development in relation to the involvement of the banking and building society sectors in the area of life assurance, where you have roaming the countryside tied agents who have preferential status in relation to accessibility to information by delving into consumers' bank accounts, and by delving into the privacy of customers' accounts.  This practice is not in keeping with the competition which is essential in the interest of the policyholder and the consumer.  I want the Minister to explain what would be the involvement, if any, of the building society sector in the life assurance market.</P>

      <P>This section deals with each undertaking that is authorised to carry on life assurance business.  Irrespective of what the company is, or its ownership, whether it is owned by a bank or by another insurance undertaking, it still is an authorised insurer and, once it is authorised, this legislation will apply to it.  The example the Senator gave of a <Col N="896" /> particular bank with a life assurance company would be transparent and at arm's length because the authorisation given to the new company which is separate has to be kept at arm's length and has to be transparent.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 20, which is a new section, would also make it a requirement of that company to keep policyholders' funds separate in a broad way from shareholders' funds to ensure that the ratio between both is kept at an appropriate level.  The point I want to make is that it really does not matter whether it is the company the Senator quoted or another company.  The law is the same because it is an authorised company.  These companies must keep this separate arrangement.</P>

      <P>(a)  shall be applied for the purposes of that business, and</P>
      <P>(b)  shall not be transferred so as to be available for other purposes of the undertaking except where the transfer constitutes reimbursement of expenditure borne by other assets (in the same or the last preceding financial year) in discharging liabilities wholly or partly attributable to life assurance business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are largely technical and are to clarify the powers of the Minister to seek information and so on.  Section 13 bestows general powers on the Minister to require information.  The amendments now proposed do not change the scope of the provision.  However, they clarify a number of aspects.  First, a clearer distinction is drawn between information required of an insurance undertaking in relation to its own business and other information dealing with any connected body of the undertaking in circumstances where the links between the insurer and the connected body may have implications for the financial position of the insurance company.  Obviously the Minister, as the insurance supervisory authority, would be entitled to any information in relation to a connected body which an undertaking may be expected to reasonably provide in order to assess the implications for the financial position of the insurer arising from the nature of the ties and commercial links, for example, in a group holding structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amendment is also proposed to subsection (2) of this section to take account <Col N="899" /> of a technical accounting concept and to improve the precision of the wording implied.  The amendment now provides that the Minister may require that returns, and so on, are certified or attested to as to their correctness.  The original subsection referred to certification only.  However, this has a particular accounting meaning in that certification can only take place in relation to matters of fact which have been established and would not be appropriate in relation to estimates, for example, however reasonable or accurate, or outstanding claims and liabilities. The additional wording will cater for this rather technical accounting concept.</P>
    <P>The opportunity has also been taken here to delete reference to auditors or actuaries as the original wording of the subsection was unintentionally too narrow in this regard.  If, for example, in assessing the solvency of an undertaking the Minister has reason to doubt certain property valuations, the appropriate person to express an opinion on those valuations might be a property valuer as opposed to an auditor or an actuary.  The amendment by deleting the words &ldquo;being an auditor or an actuary&rdquo; does not affect the scope of the provision but it broadens its application in a desirable manner.</P>

      <P>Under the section, the Minister has the power to require information and my understanding is that a reasonable period would have to be adopted.  In practice, about six months would be the normal period, or three months for newly authorised companies. We could have a look at putting in something like that at a later stage.  In page 9, section 13 (5) reads:</P>
      <P>A requisition under subsection (1) may specify a date by which it must be met and if it is not met by the specified date the Minister may suspend or revoke the authorisation of the undertaking in any class or part of a class of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, under subsection (1) where the Minister is requiring such information he may specify a date.  The Senator is quite right in that the legislation does not actually lay down the date, but it permits the Minister to lay down a date.  All I can do is put it on the record that in practice six months is the normal period and three months for <Col N="901" /> newly authorised companies.  We will give some consideration to putting this in, but the time period may vary.  Some information may be immediately to hand and it would be unreasonable not to get it immediately.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 9, before section 14, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14.&mdash;(1) No insurer shall have a financial interest in an insurance brokerage.</P>
      <P>(2) No group of companies shall have an interest in an insurer and at the same time have an interest in an insurance brokerage.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is self-explanatory.  I believe we now have the definition of an insurance broker which is a person who acts with freedom of choice.  It is unreasonable and unfair that an insurance company can also be involved in insurance brokerage or that the insurance brokerage can have a financial interest in an insurance company.  There are a few such companies around.  The Bank of Ireland has been referred to. Anybody who ever worked on the road for an insurance business will tell you that there is a life inspector.  If you are asked to make a call on behalf of the bank manager, you can be sure it will be a successful call and the business will be written, but if it goes from a broker in <Col N="902" /> town or the agent down the road, it might not be successful.  In fact, on the road, one must work hard to get business. Senator Hogan referred to this aspect.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a conflict of interests here.  The freedom of choice the Minister has spelt out for us does not operate.  This is an amendment the Minister should take on board on Report Stage if necessary. To me it is a very reasonable amendment. We are talking about independent advice.  One cannot give independent advice or freedom of choice if one has a vested interest in a company.  It is quite clear to me that there is a real conflict of interests here and the Minister should take this seriously in the best interests of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat what I said earlier.  I agree totally with Senator Fallon.  The words &ldquo;vested interest&rdquo; have been used.  Obviously the banks have a vested interest in relation to bank accounts.  Senator Fallon has explained it very well.  There is no such thing as competition to any degree if you are dealing with a financial institution which for one reason or another, decides to tell a bank client that he or she needs life cover or life assurance of some description whether it is for the education of children or for a particular need in the future in relation to inheritance, tax liability or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once a bank manager says to a consumer that there is a definite need for life cover or a need for an investment or savings policy of some description, it is very difficult for the consumer to exercise independent discretion and to analyse independently whether he or she is getting the best deal on the market.  At the end of the day they are depending on a bank manager to sanction a loan, an overdraft, or whatever.  There is a hold, as it were, on the client involved and a beholding to the manager involved.  That is not always in the best interest of the consumer.  A wide discretion of choice is essential to any consumer business.  The Minister often spoke about that.  The Director of Consumer Affairs carries out investigations into particular activities in <Col N="903" /> order to establish that there is not unfair competition.</P>
    <P>What Senator Fallon has just said should be taken on board.  We should seek immediately to eliminate the single agency approach of a particular financial institution, whether it be bank or building society, to get into the area of life assurance in order to make a quick source of finance out of the clients they have coming in to do other business in relation to mortgages or loans which they need. They are prepared to give an extra few pounds for life cover or life assurance in order to keep the bank manager happy if they get the loan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>A good case has been made.  Possibly we should await the Minister's response.  Perhaps he will concede this amendment to his colleagues on the Government side.  We lend our support to the concept of what is at stake here.  It is a question of somebody being on the inside track and having inside information available to them which would make their selling of insurance, particularly life assurance, more advantageous than the ordinary man on the road, so to speak, who is working with an overall interest in his client but does not necessarily have the inside information about the person's finances.  This is a question of fair trade and fair competition, or one group of people having additional information which is subsidiary but very important to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a question of whether we want to agree with the principle of fair competition in the interest of the customer, or whether we agree that, unless we have something like this written into the Bill, sectors which now deal with insurance, banking and other financial matters, will have additional information which will give them a decided advantage with a vested interest.  That is what concerns Members of the House.  Perhaps the Minister considers that the wording is not correct and will give us his assurance that he will come back with suitable wording on Report Stage, or perhaps he is satisfied with the wording of the amendment put <Col N="904" /> down by Senator Mulroy and Senator Fallon.  It reflects the views of all sides of the House on this section.  We hope the Minister has already made up his mind to be generous.  He should be generous to his own colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we get the assurance from the Minister that he is accepting this amendment I would like to say a few words in support of the amendment. In recent years in particular the bank manager has had a very unfair advantage in this area.  We have seen the situation change dramatically in recent years with banks taking over building societies, banks going into the insurance business and mortgage endownment policies being sold by banks, building societies and everybody else.  What is asked here by the people who have signed the amendment is very reasonable.  I hope the Minister will see his way to incorporate this amendment into the Bill.  The bank manager, in the position he holds in the local community, has a great advantage.  He has access to the financial position of clients.  He is the adviser to a number of people and his advice is readily accepted in matters pertaining to finance, insurance and so on.  For that reason he has a very unfair advantage over brokers who are trying to compete in the market selling the same product but who have not got access to the information the bank manager has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having spent some years in this House I always appreciated generosity from Ministers.  Unfortunately, I cannot be very helpful today. The effect of this amendment would be to require that insurance brokerages would be held in totally distinct ownership from insurance companies.  I am not convinced of the need for such an outright prohibition.  In any event, the matter covered by the proposed amendment would not appear to be directly amenable to legislation in the way the Senators appear to wish it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are normal everyday commercial relationships between insurance companies and insurance brokerages. <Col N="905" /> The most obvious one is in relation to the procurement of business including a certain financial exchange of information in relation to premiums.  Insurance brokers have agency appointments from insurance companies and they hold moneys in trust for insurers in many cases.  Even more important there are, to my definite knowledge, a number of instances in the Irish market where insurers already have a proprietorial interest in insurance brokerages.  The whole trend internationally is for more linkages of this kind to come about in response to consumer demand for increasing the integrated financial services operations.  In recent times the council of Lloyds of London decided to remove the artificial barrier to ownership of not more than 26 per cent of a Lloyds broker by insurance company interests. Since then there have been several notable instances of links of this nature being forged in the Lloyds market.</P>
    <P>Also, I should tell Senators that Union America, the large United States insurer, has now built up a substantial shareholding in one of the largest broking houses in the UK.  As Senators can see, the whole trend internationally is in a direction directly opposite to the intention behind the amendment.  In any event, I am not convinced that such links or shareholdings operate to the detriment of consumers, or have any potential impact on the solvency of insurance undertakings.  I would be more concerned if the proprietorial interests were, perhaps, in the opposite direction with insurance brokers having the potential to control insurance companies' operations by virtue of shareholdings.</P>
    <P>In response to any arguments about the potential to mislead clients by holding oneself out to be an independent brokerage while in reality being controlled to a significant extent by a particular insurance company, I would point out that it is our intention to include a specific requirement under the codes of conduct to be made under section 48 in relation to independent and impartial advice, the <Col N="906" /> avoidance of undue placement of business with any particular insurance company and the need to ensure the client's best interest at all times.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in the event that an insurer and an insurance brokerage, by virtue of a financial interest of one in the other or some other common link in the group structure, reach an agreement or arrangement that the so-called broker should channel business to the insurance company on a less than independent basis, any such arrangement would be classified under section 43 of the Bill as a tied agency agreement.  This is because it would restrict the insurance brokerage's freedom to refer proposals of insurance to other insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The immediate effect of this provision would be to require the brokerage to revert to tied agency status with all the restrictions and discipline which this would entail.  In such circumstances the nature of the links between the insurance company and former brokers would be immediately transparent.  There is also the consideration that under the Mergers Act, 1978, any significant moves by other financial institutions in relation to broking businesses would be subject to the notification requirements of that particular Act, that is, the Mergers Act, 1978.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce would accordingly be able to assess the implications of any proposed significant shareholdings of the kind which I imagine is contemplated by the Senators in their proposed amendment under the criteria of the mergers legislation.</P>
    <P>These criteria mention specifically the interests of the consumer and the extent to which the proposals would be likely to prevent or restrict competition, or to restrain the provision of any service.  The Minister's consideration would, therefore, include the reasons for the proposal, details of any changes planned in the operation of any of the enterprises affected by the proposal and details of any other agreement, including any business channelling arrangements, any of these which would come about as a result of the proposed acquisition or merger.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> While emphasis on the various points would obviously vary from case to case, I can assure the House that the implications, particularly from the consumer perspective, would be vetted very carefully in situations where linkages between insurance companies and insurance brokerages were being proposed.  I feel this is sufficient safeguard for the public and I would not be in favour of a specific and very inflexible statutory prohibition of any levels of cross-shareholdings and so on.  Such a blanket prohibition could, as an extreme example, rule out desirable capital injections to improve the solvency of an insurance brokerage which would not be forthcoming from other sources.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for putting this forward and I hope they understand the very strong reasons which I put before the House as to why to do it in this particular way, at this time, would run counter to what is going on globally and would hold us out as being very different in an international market place within which we have to live, an international market place in which this kind of cross-shareholding and cross-fertilisation is continually going on.  It would lead us ultimately to having to reverse engines at a later date when we found ourselves up against total and open competition.  The mergers legislation and the other areas which I have mentioned &mdash; section 43 of the Bill and the tied agency &mdash; will give sufficient safeguards to prevent the abuse which some Senators are pointing to.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point that the manager of a bank somehow has an inside track, this amendment would not change that in any way because it is no different from where a bank manager holds an agency agreement.  He may just be an ordinary agent with an agreement in his hip pocket and he would not have to have a massive shareholding to channel business.  It is a separate argument as to whether bank managers should have that facility or not.  The ownership of the insurance brokerage is an entirely different debate.  You do not need to own an insurance brokerage to have the bank manager do what is being suggested by <Col N="908" /> Senator Hogan.  He might do it.  I have no direct evidence that they are doing that.  If they are I will take the Senator's word for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree at all with the Minister's interpretation of the real world in relation to this practice that is going on, the practice which the Minister referred to and for which he has no evidence that it is going on.  It is an understandable thing on the part of the consumers.  If they have a case to make for another financial matter with a bank manager the corollary of that, the extension of that, is that the bank manager can say a certain requirement in relation to life assurance is essential in order to have that loan enacted or put into effect.  The consumer has no choice and the element of competition is removed.</P>
      <P>I certainly hope my colleagues will put this amendment to the House.  It has nothing to do with what I am talking about in relation to the bank manager. In a group of companies and the direction in which the banks in particular are getting involved in building societies and in financial services such as insurance, I am totally against this from the point of view that it will bring about a situation sooner rather than later in which all financial business will be done by a very small number of financial institutions.  The element of competition and certainly the benefit to the consumer will have gone out the window in the form of one, two or three financial conglomerates in a small country like ours.</P>
      <P>I hope this amendment will be put so that we can establish in legislation the safeguards we see as essential to the consumer and show in this legislation that we are not happy with the direction in which the banking institutions are heading in gobbling up all aspects of financial services and removing the independence necessary and essential for the consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to separate the ownership of brokerages from the practice of, say, an individual bank manager channelling business.  They are quite <Col N="909" /> separate to the extent that a manager can still be an agent and channel business to his favourite company in any case.  He does not have to have a shareholding or otherwise in the brokerage to do that. That practice is quite separate and can be quite distinct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a bank manager is not doing business for the company the bank owns, he certainly will be ticked off fairly quickly from headquarters about the direction in which his life assurance business should be going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>He could be a separate agent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>He could be a separate agent for another company.  The Bank of Ireland at the moment owns Lifetime Assurance.  Is the Minister saying that the Bank of Ireland manager in the local town is not going to do business for Lifetime or help the Lifetime agents in that area in order to do business for the benefit of the Bank of Ireland?  That bank manager would find it very difficult to cope with the pressure that would be put on him from headquarters and he could find himself being transferred to another part of the country if he did not conspire to look after the affairs of the company he was working for.  That is the kind of problem that might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can walk into my own Bank of Ireland branch and I see bank managers and assistant managers speaking with Lifetime agents and educating them to the possibilities they would have in writing life assurance business.  I have my own account with The Bank of Ireland.  That practice is taking place and we cannot push it under the carpet.  The ownership of a life assurance company by a bank is putting the onus on bank managers to do business with that life assurance company. The same will apply in relation to unit linked and managed fund bonds in relation to the consumer.  A consumer might get a much better return over a three or four year period on an investment in a unit linked bond and, because the bank manager refuses and makes it <Col N="910" /> difficult for a consumer to move money out of a deposit account in the bank, this will militate against the best interests of the consumer.</P>
    <P>These are the practices that are taking place.  We must awake to the fact that these people have too much power at the moment to interfere in the consumer area to such an extent that the best interests of the consumer are being militated against and the independent financial advice that is essential for the benefit of the consumer is being whittled away for reasons of vested interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Hogan has said.  If, for example, a customer of the Bank of Ireland wants to effect an insurance policy it will most certainly be a Lifetime policy.  The point is that the manager may only have one single Life agency.  Of course most of them have three, four or five.  From now on they are obliged to be loyal to Lifetime. As single agents, I can see it will be impossible, in view of what we are saying in the Bill about agents, to stop an independent bank manager giving life assurance to his own Bank of Ireland company.  I am more interested in the idea of the ownership of insurance brokerages by insurance companies, or <i>vice versa</i>.  That is what I would like to have eliminated, if at all possible, because independent advice will obviously be lacking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify again the question of this code of conduct he has referred to.  I am not at all sure that it would be possible for independent and impartial advice to be given.  I am not at all happy that it could be given.  I am well aware of the changes in the whole global, financial market.  Things are changing so rapidly throughout the world that, as the Minister says, if he took it on board now he might have to change it in six or eight months.  I can understand the Minister's thinking that in time we might have to change it.  I understand well, even at this point in time, the great changes which are taking place in world financial thinking and in the whole financial marketplace. It is changing weekly, with new <Col N="911" /> ideas, new groupings and new thoughts. I accept that fully.  There is a changing global attitude in the financial marketplace.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would come back to the question of this code of conduct. Obviously, if that could be implemented strongly it might go some of the way towards meeting what I have in mind, brokerages owned by insurance companies or vice versa.  We seem to have dwelled on the Bank of Ireland and Lifetime, but FBD are an insurance company and yet they are an insurance brokerage as well.  It seems to me there is some conflict.  I would welcome further clarification on this code of conduct the Minister referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response to this amendment indicates that he has carried out extensive research.  It is very hard to disagree with his explanation as to why he should not take the amendment on board because he has given us a very detailed and technical response to it.  He points out that, whether or not he takes this on board will not affect the position of the bank manager acting as an agent. The message is coming across loud and clear that Senators are concerned about the privileged position of the bank manager and the effect this position has on small brokers and small agents throughout the country who are employing one or two people.</P>
      <P>The other point to come across is that we are concerned about the banks getting into a monopoly situation on banking and insurance.  I am pleased that this whole area has been discussed in detail and that we have got the message across to the Minister.  I am sure that, under the code of conduct he mentioned, he will look into this area more closely and come up with some protection and see that the privileged position of the bank manager will not be abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are existing realities in the marketplace which I cannot ignore.  There is no way we can turn the tide back on what is going on.  I <Col N="912" /> think Senators know this better than I because they are dealing with it, although they are perhaps focusing more on the insurance aspect which we are talking about today.  Who owns the insurance companies?  Very often the banks own a large slice of them.  Who owns the banks? Very often the insurance companies own a large slice of them.  The Bank of Ireland owns Lifetime.  The Bank of Ireland has a large slice of Hibernian.  Irish Life has a large percentage of AIB and the Bank of Ireland.  The Hibernian has a large proportion of Hibernian Life and FBD has a large proportion of a brokerage organisation, and so on, and so on.  They are the realities in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that to try to turn back that tide and say that you cannot take a slice of this company or that company would lead us into absolutely horrific difficulties.  There is a separate issue here too.  For example, the Bank of Ireland owning Lifetime is not quite the same as a bank owning an insurance brokerage, although I see the point about an insurance company being involved in a brokerage.  The other point I am worried about &mdash; brokers have to listen to this voice in the wilderness &mdash; is that the UK are experiencing now a difficulty in capitalising brokerages because of the tide of competition from Europe, as it hits us, towards the internal market.</P>
      <P>There is heavy competition out there. Brokers are beginning to ask themselves increasingly where is the source of their capitalisation.  It will ultimately end up, by and large, perhaps with banks and perhaps &mdash; even the unthinkable &mdash; with insurance companies.  I am not saying that will happen, but it is a trend which is being experienced in the UK.  A broker who is thinking ten years ahead must ask himself where will he go for capitalisation if he is to really market his products on an international scale in particular.  He will probably have to go to the self-same financial institutions which we are now talking about.  That is a quick view down the road which I wanted to put before the Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fallon asked me about the <Col N="913" /> code of conduct.  It is our intention to include a specific requirement under the code of conduct to be made under section 48 in relation to independent and impartial advice, the avoidance of undue placement of business with any particular insurance company and the need to ensure the client's best interests at all times.  We would include those very strongly in the code of conduct.  In view of what the Senator has said, I will have a special look at making sure that we strengthen that code in the area of the avoidance of undue placement of business.</P>
    <P>Section 43 of the Bill applies to tied agency agreements.  In the event that an insurer and an insurance broker, by virtue of some common link or financial interest, reach some cosy arrangement about channelling business, such arrangement would be classified, under section 43 of the Bill, as a tied agency agreement with all the restrictions that implies.  That does not guarantee avoiding the difficulties the Senators foresee but it gives us some grip on it.  It would be a major policy decision to prevent a financial institution, such as an insurance company, buying a share of any company, given the globalisation and the changing nature of financial services.</P>
    <P>Looking at what is happening in the UK, it would be taking us totally against that trend.  We have often done that in the past where the UK is concerned.  The reality about financial marketplaces is that they are bound up inextricably.  For us to adopt an entirely different direction from that which is now very strong in the UK, is something we should do very slowly indeed.  I have very real practical difficulties in taking that notion on board because it is actually in the marketplace at the moment.  It is there.  I would have all sorts of legal difficulties in trying to undo what is already there.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's concern.  He is doing the best he can.  He knows there is an argument there but he has a job to do and we have a job to do in relation to this Bill.  As an insurance broker I can assure him that I have no <Col N="914" /> intention of internationalising myself and setting up office in Paris or anything of that nature.  I have no intention of buying a bank or getting a share in one either. In fact, the bank has a good share in me at the moment and in may other insurance brokers also and that is the real world we are talking about.</P>

      <P>Last week I spent some time dealing with the whole area of emigration and tying it into unemployment and I talked about the great waste of resources of young people.  I described how one in every two are leaving the country; in other words, we are losing half a generation.  I referred to the fact that while this great, natural resource of our young people is flowing out of this country at a rate of 50 per cent of them leaving us or looking forward to leaving us if the Kinsale oil or gas, or some of our mineral wealth, or some of the more tangible assets of the country were to go to waste at the same rate, there would be cries of outrage.</P>
      <P>With the plethora of training programmes, courses and centres for unemployed, social employment schemes, community schemes, enterprise schemes, etc., unemployment has almost become an industry of its own.  The most astronomical unemployment figures now cause no more than a ripple in the news pond. Emigration has been presented by some of our leading opinion informers as merely a solution to unemployment rather than a waste of our greatest resource.  It is fair to say that the scandal of emigration must also be tied into the failure of industry and the private sector and Government policy and all of us involved in any way with providing jobs in a country which could be providing jobs.  I do not have time at this stage to outline where all our young people might be rather than in the Bronx or in Europe but I do want to point to a few things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the discussion in recent days on the problems for the fishing industry at the moment because we cannot export our fish.  It brings an interesting point to mind.  We are now in a situation where in Ireland for everybody working on the seas full time as a fisher person, we have 0.8 of a person working on fish processing or fish-dependent industry, whereas the European average is eight.  In other words, we could be <Col N="916" /> employing ten times more people on land in fish processing than we are at the moment.  The export of fish to the Continent is every bit as bad as the export of cattle on the hoof.  Fish should be processed here and it should provide work here; it should have added-value here and it should then be exported.  It is a scandal that it is not happening.</P>
    <P>I have no time for these people who have betrayed the fishing industry &mdash; I come from a fishing town myself &mdash; over 40, 50 or 60 years.  I have no time to listen to people whingeing and whining about Spanish trawlers coming into our waters. Why are the Spanish not worried about our fishing trawlers in Spanish waters since we have got an older tradition and have had a longer opportunity to develop our fishing industry?  Similarly, in terms of agriculture we have heard a lot recently about the position of Denmark <i>vis-à-vis</i> the position of Ireland, that it is a country with much the same population and many other comparisons.  In this country with a very firm agricultural base we are processing one million pigs per year.  Denmark is processing 15 million. We are very low on the production level. We are away down and we are doing nothing about increasing jobs.  The Pigs and Bacon Commission was abolished about 15 years ago, as I understand it and it is only in the last couple of months it has been taken into the meat marketing board.  We have the best climate in Europe for the growth of trees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, let me make the connection.  I am making the point that the reason we have emigration and the reason we have to care about these people is that we have failed to provide for them at home.  I am also making the point that we have the national resources to do that.  I am also making the point that, if private industry is the jewel in the crown of capitalism, we have seen many of the unacceptable facets of private <Col N="917" /> industry and capitalism over the past number of weeks.</P>
      <P>Let me tell the House some more of the problems of emigration and why they are being caused.  We had the greatest export development of any country in Europe last year when we improved our exports by about 13.7 per cent.  It has made no impact whatsoever on the quality of life, or the standard of living, or the wealth of this country.  It has not done so simply because the groups with the largest export growth are those in foreign-owned industry and they are bringing in their goods cheaply, adding no value here whatsoever, exporting them to the export markets and are then repatriating their profits to their home countries. It is not good enough.  That is another reason we are failing to provide employment.  We should be demanding added-value in those industries.</P>
      <P>I would also go much further and suggest that unemployment and emigration must be very closely tied together.  We now have a way of stopping emigration. For one time in our history the Government, private industry and the trade union movement can share a common objective of supporting wealth creation and that must be the objective, wealth creation for different reasons.  The Government must support wealth creation because greater wealth allows greater political options and allows them scope to develop the country.  The private sector and industry would support the idea of wealth creation because more wealth means more profit which activates the greed buds and is a very healthy way to stimulate private industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade union movement, for different reasons, support wealth creation because they recognise that in the prevailing political climate the only way society's inequities can be redressed in the short term is by creating wealth which can be taxed and in that way redistributed positively in favour of the under-privileged. We will continue to have emigration as long as our society is still unfair, as long as it is still based on inequity of access and opportunity and as long as it maintains privilege.  We have <Col N="918" /> also seen in the last week or so a very clear understanding by those people who know the facts that the 1 per cent growth which we had last year should really have been 4 per cent were it not for the repatriation of profits.</P>
    <P>What I am trying to explain is that we are now the slaves of our own bad policies of the past.  It is not too late to make a change.  We should now insist that we use every employment opportunity.  I have just mentioned a few which are practical, pragmatic approaches to increasing employment, thereby banishing the curse of emigration and thereby protecting our young people, giving them a future in Ireland rather than putting us into a situation of trying to improve their future abroad.</P>
    <P>I regret very much the outflow of our young people, our innovative, well-educated young people.  As long as our young people are leaving us, we are losing our greatest asset in terms of economic recovery, our greatest asset in two parts, first of all an educated, young population and, secondly, a population of young people who can make and take decisions.  We are losing them: instead of looking after them abroad let us concentrate on keeping them at home.</P>

      <P>I have read some of the contributions and I listened to others in this debate, mainly from the other side of the House, and I can only express a certain amazement and some disappointment at the wording of the Motion and the unjustified attacks on the Government for their approach to this question of out of status or illegal Irish in the United States.  The problem only manifested itself since 1982, as Senator Connor quite correctly stated in his opening contribution last week.</P>

      <P>I would be delighted to listen to any interruptions as they arise but empty vessels sometimes make the loudest sounds.  Senator Connor said that this whole question started in 1982 and he then went on to attack Fianna Fáil.  I was surprised because he failed to mention that this exodus of young people coincided with the period in Government of his party and the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I was privileged to initiate a debate on this subject in the Seanad by way of Motion shortly after my election last spring.  In the course of that debate I referred to emigration as an emotive subject. Nine months have not changed my view.  Forced emigration in particular is an emotive subject: it is also a national scandal.  It is a scandal for which all parties and all politicians must bear some responsibility.  However, I suggest to my colleagues on the other side of the House that they should look at the mote in their own eye before launching a broadside against Fianna Fáil on an issue Fianna Fáil picked up from day one.  If there has been any significant progress in United States legislation on this matter, even the dogs in the street will acknowledge that the personal interventions of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Fahey who is with us this evening have played no small role in impressing on our friends on Capitol Hill the seriousness of the problem for our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said it before and I will say it again. <Col N="920" /> The illegals in the United States, the youngsters in London and elsewhere who have had to leave Ireland in recent years, are our responsibility even hundreds and thousands of miles away.  If they are in difficulties we must reach out to them. In looking after their needs in a foreign country we can also maintain an important contact with them and, hopefully, as the economy improves and as more and more jobs come on-stream in this country &mdash; as I have no doubt they will in the months and years ahead &mdash; young people will want to come back to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The general perception I have of many of our young people is that they are abroad unwillingly, that it is not just simply a question of being out of the country because they think things have not been going well, or because they do not like Ireland; it is mainly that they have not been able to get jobs.  The quality of life in this country has a great deal to offer.  Many of your young people &mdash; as indeed I did myself when I first emigrated as a teenager &mdash; have suffered a culture shock on going into large conurbations. When I think of the difficulties I and my contemporaries faced some 20 years ago when we emigrated, they pale into insignificance compared with the difficulties faced by many of our young people who not only have to cope with the difficulty of finding a job in a new and sometimes hostile environment but also of finding suitable accommodation at a reasonable price and then having all the difficulties of day-to-day living on a particular budget.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor asked in the course of his contribution last week whether or not the Government had sought an amnesty. The amnesty is in the context of the legislation which was put before the US Senate and House of Representatives which meant that anybody who had been living illegally in the United States before 1982 could apply for legal status and that their applications would more than likely be processed.  I am sure if Senator Connor is listening, whether it be here or elsewhere, he will know that I am not singling him out specifically for attack.  Much of what he said was very sensible but he did <Col N="921" /> make the point that this amnesty facility had not been picked up to any great extent and asked could not, perhaps, many of the Irish illegals who are out of status in America now become part of that amnesty, for example, by extending it.</P>
    <P>However, that does not seem to be a viable political prospect.  I know our own Government have pressed for an amnesty.  Indeed, the Government's view on it is that an amnesty would provide a permanent solution for our citizens now illegally in the United States.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Lenihan, discussed it with Congressional and other leaders during his visits to the United States over the past 12 months but he was advised that such a move would be most unlikely to prove successful in Congress.  In the circumstances the Government believe that the best prospect for long term legislative reform lies in the measures now proposed by Senator Kennedy, Senator Simpson and by Congressman Donnelly.</P>
    <P>Behind that policy statement is the difficulty that any politician in America has in bringing forward reforms in the Immigration Control Acts as they are currently operating in the United States.  This is mainly because of the influx of many, many millions of illegals across the Texas-Mexican border on the one hand, and also from the offshore islands which come under the US mandate.  Many hundreds and thousands and millions of these people, unfortunate people I have to say, have poured into the United States illegally and are attempting to find work and to find a suitable environment in which to bring up their families.  Sad to say, in many cases they fail to find jobs and as a result they are on welfare &mdash; as they refer to it in America &mdash; and this is, of course, a drain on the American economy.  In States where there is a high influx of such unfortunate illegals there is great pressure on the Representatives or US Senators not to encourage reform in the immigration law area or, indeed, to go so far as to block it.  Consequently, any suggestion that there should be an extension of the amnesty that came into force in 1986 would be met with very stiff <Col N="922" /> political opposition in both Houses.  The Government's policy and their approach to the question of extending the amnesty are sensible in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>US immigration law is extremely complex. The main provisions are in the 1965 Immigration Act which severely restricts access to immigrant visas by individuals other than relatives of US citizens and of US residents.  The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act introduced sanctions against employers and that, of course, was alluded to in this debate and in the debate last summer.  I stated at the time, and I repeat, that as a country we were rather lax in 1965 in not being vigilant enough in watching the progress of that legislation through both Houses, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate.  Consequently, Ireland was in a sense to lose its most favoured nation status and the general thrust of immigration quotas was to move away from the old world, the old European world countries whose people had traditionally emigrated in large numbers, not only Ireland but also Germany and Italy and the Scandinavian countries and indeed our neighbours, Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The orientation in the legislation of 1965 was more away from those countries and more towards the countries in the Pacific Basin and, of course, in Central America.  As a result Ireland was to lose out.  The inactivity &mdash; if I may use that word &mdash; of politicians in this country in 1965 has borne a rather sad legacy in 1988 in that we are now in a sense trying to undo the damage that was done at that time.  However, that is water under the bridge and I suppose in the context of the time, if one looks back at 1965, it was a period of buoyancy, of economic boom, the country was &ldquo;on the up&rdquo;.  We were experiencing the greatest economic advance in our short history and it was inevitable that legislation on immigration to America would have passed on the nod without being given any great priority by the Government here at the time.</P>
    <P>However, two positive developments came out of the last Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act as it relates to Ireland.  It created 10,000 non-preference <Col N="923" /> visas; these were the famous Donnelly visas and they are to be issued over a two year period up to September of this year. Over 3,000 Irish applicants were declared eligible for these visas.  I remember at the time they came out many commentators, myself included, criticised this move on the basis that it seemed like a shameful lottery, a lottery in which young people who, unable to find suitable jobs at home and who were also caught in the vice of illegal status in the United States, found themselves in this mad rush to get letters and application forms to Washington on a particular day and on a particular post and all sorts of ingenuity was used in order to get them there.  It seemed like a rather shameful episode in our recent history and I hope it will never be repeated.  The moves currently in Congress in relation to improving the status of our illegals in America would seem to eliminate that lottery process in the future.  It is in that context that one must compliment the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Deputy Fahey, all of whom have travelled to the United States &mdash; in the case of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste on numerous occasions.</P>
    <P>It is important to put on record that one of the main planks of the election platform of the Fianna Fáil Party prior to the general election was that Fianna Fáil, if returned to Government would take immediate and effective action in the area of the illegals and out of status young people in America.  Within days &mdash; literally within days &mdash; of Fianna Fáil assuming office both the Tanáiste and the Taoiseach were on their way to the United States where they met the relevant individuals working with the young Irish in America.  They met with Church authorities, they met with the newly-formed Irish Immigration Reform Movement and they also met the consular officials, all of them anxious and willing to co-ordinate their efforts to improve the lot of the young Irish who were going over to America in many thousands or had been going over in the previous few years.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the illegals in the <Col N="924" /> States is that there seems to be some confusion about how many are actually over there.  All sorts of figures have been bandied around but it seems that, according to the figures released in recent months by the Central Statistics Office, there is an estimated 40,000 young illegals in America.  As far as I am concerned, and I know that this view will be shared by all responsible politicians of all parties in this House and in the other House, 40,000 is 39,999 too many, particularly if they had to leave rather than those who, in the normal course of events, wished to leave to extend their expertise in a particular area and, hopefully, they will come back home.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refute any suggestion that our representatives in the United States are ignoring the plight of young people who are out of status in the United States.  Our embassy in Washington and our consulates throughout the United States are continuing to monitor closely the implementation of US immigration legislation.  The best long term solution, the Government feel for our young people in the United States, is the implementation of legislative reform in the US.  It is thanks to our Irish-American community and our friends in Congress that there is now a very realistic possibility that the Kennedy-Simpson Bill will be passed into law.</P>
    <P>Time, I admit, is running out &mdash; perhaps my own time is running out, a Leas-Chathaoirleach for this piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>They are in an election year in the United States.  If the legislation is passed it will go a long way towards alleviating the legislative problem of our out of status young people in the States.  I hope my colleagues agree with me in that.  If it is not passed before the November presidential elections, I understand that under United States legislative process this piece of legislation will fall with the termination of the Congress business in November.  Obviously, it is important for our political leaders &mdash; and I use that word in the widest possible sense &mdash; on all sides of the House, if they have an opportunity to meet and <Col N="925" /> come in contact with American legislators in the Legislature, to impress upon them the seriousness of our position and the importance of getting this legislation through.  I may have started on an acrimonious note but the terms of the motion seemed to be rather surprising in the context of the very real achievement and the matter of historical fact over the past nine to 12 months of this Administration, the achievements they have made and the efforts they are continuing to make, both in this country and in America to ensure that our illegals are brought back into status.  The Government have initiated a policy of ensuring continuous contact with our emigrants abroad.  As a former emigrant I have felt for a long long time that once our young people left, successive Governments here seemed to ignore them.  I am glad to say that this Government's policy at least has set a precedent, which I hope will be continued so long as there is emigration, that if a young person leaves this country and has any difficulties the Government of Ireland will look after him or her as if they were in this country and encourage them to return home.  That is the aspiration of all of us, that our young people would return home and that they would be living again in their own environment with their own families and contributing to the welfare of this great country of ours.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of those who signed this Motion.  I can speak with a degree of expertise as I happened to be one of the infamous illegal immigrants from 1982 to 1985.  When I went to the United States a lot of lip service was paid by politicians in this country to the plight of illegal immigrants over there.  As somebody listening and looking for help I found it was a lot of hot air and nothing came of it.  I went to New York in 1981. Emigration at that stage was beginning to peak but in the following years, from roughly 1982 to 1987 it increased alarmingly. Young people have left this country. We have a lost generation and, like Senator Mooney, I wish and hope they will return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" /> Leitrim has lost them and we need them back.  I will give an example.  I left national school in 1973.  There were 36 people in my class.  Two of them are living in Leitrim today.  That is the situation which now manifests itself within the west of Ireland, I think the Minister is quite aware that is the case in many parts of rural Ireland.  As Members of the Oireachtas we should not pay lip service to a very serious social problem.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any political gain out of this Motion.  People who left this country are cynical about politicians in Ireland and in the US.  That is unfortunate. They find themselves in places like New York depending on friends or relatives who went there before them.  If their friends and relatives in the US have not done very well, unfortunately the people going out to them are not going to do any better.</P>
    <P>The Emigration Reform and Control Act, 1986, has had a very serious effect on illegal immigrants. Under that Act, as everybody is aware, an employer can be fined up to £10,000 for hiring illegal aliens.  Many employers were willing, because of their ancestral roots, to try to help young Irish people in the US. Many employers are still willing to take a chance, but quite a number of employers have let illegal immigrants go and do not wish to employ them.  This in turn leads to unscrupulous employers who may employ and are employing young Irish people at very low wages.</P>
    <P>As numerous Senators said, the cost of accommodation in the US is exorbitant and we now find that the young Irish illegals are staying in accommodation &mdash; perhaps a one bedroom apartment &mdash; with ten or 12 people.  This is totally unacceptable. Snide remarks were made about the way the Pakistani or Indian people live together in hovels in London. Unfortunately, the Irish people in America have to bring themselves to this level at present.  This is something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I can make my point briefly.  There is one important point I would like to make to which Senator Mooney referred earlier, that is, the number of illegal aliens who did not take up the amnesty visas.  I know they did not take up these amnesty visas because of fear and lack of advice.  They thought if they went to the relevant immigration authorities and stated that they had been in the country illegally for a long period they would be deported.</P>
      <P>The second part of our motion calls for the establishment of support and advice centres in New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco and is of vital importance.  Many amnesty visas could have been taken up but, through fear and lack of advice people were not willing to take the chance.  That was unfortunate, because it was a good opportunity to obtain a visa.  However, the advice centres were not there.  After the Minister returned from America there were statements in the daily papers. I remember, in particular, that the Mayor of New York stated that any illegal Irish immigrants who got into specific difficulties relating to hospitalisation &mdash; and we are all aware of the exorbitant cost of hospitalisation in America &mdash; would get help.  Unfortunately this help is not forthcoming. I know of two examples in the past two months of people who have been hospitalised.  They have no insurance cover and they depend on the goodness of county communities in the States.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate that point about hospitalisation.  It was stated in the newspapers that the Mayor of New York would try to help illegal immigrants.  I know it was not a binding <Col N="928" /> statement but it was rather misleading, especially for people who are there illegally with their families.  They know about the exorbitant costs that prohibit people from being hospitalised.  I have a friend in the US who unfortunately received very serious burns.  The hospitalisation costs came to something in the region of 75,000 dollars, which is an awful lot of money.  The Irish communities there at present are trying to raise this money for him and there is no talk of any Government agencies in New York or New York City giving him any financial help towards meeting the costs. These type of statements are misleading and unhelpful.  Perhaps if I give the Minister the information afterwards he may be able to intervene and help out with that problem.</P>
      <P>The Kennedy-Donnelly Bill which provided extra visas for Ireland last year and this year was quite helpful but, as Senator Mooney said, it was on a lottery type basis and people had little appreciation of the great value of these visas.  The establishment of advice centres in the US would be of great benefit to the illegal immigrants.  It must be remembered that, even though the Irish-American politicians are working extremely hard on our behalf, our power as an ethnic group in the United States has been eroding slowly.  We are not as powerful as we once were.  This must be taken into consideration by the Government.  People from Latin America and Hispanics are becoming an extremely powerful group in the United States.  They are also causing many problems for the immigration authorities.  The authorities have a bigger problem about people from Latin America than from Western Europe.  When legislation is being put through the Houses of Congress, it will be quite difficult for Irish-American politicians to get support.  As the Bills are now in the House, this Government should ask American politicians and friends in Congress from all the political parties to use their influence on our behalf.  This is our chance to try to get an amnesty for the illegal immigrants.</P>

      <P>Let me say at the outset how much the tone of the motion before us saddens me.  Indeed, I am amazed in particular, by the manner in which it &ldquo;condemns the ineffective and uncaring approach adopted by the Government in resolving the plight of the Irish (out of status) emigrants in the US&rdquo;. This language is, in my opinion, a good description of the approach of the previous Government who were in power when the vast majority of the out of status Irish emigrants went to the United States. I do not wish to make this a political issue. I am normally a peace-loving person but I have to respond to the type of language used and the attack made by Senator Connor, in particular, when he was moving this motion last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sheer hypocrisy for the Fine Gael Party to put forward such a motion when one considers their performance on the subject of emigration when they were in Government.  In fact, their dealing with emigration was simply to ignore the fact that thousands of people were leaving this country.  I recall on a number of occasions in the Dáil when I questioned the then Taoiseach on the numbers of people leaving this country &mdash; and gave my opinion that it was in the region of <Col N="930" /> 30,000 &mdash; that he continually stated that no more than 6,000 people per annum were leaving.  Subsequently the census showed that the figures I was giving were correct.  Even then the previous Government took no action whatsoever on the question.  They still wished to brush it under the carpet.  I recall one particular day in the Dáil when I insisted that the question should not be taken unless it was answered by the Taoiseach or in his presence.  The then Taoiseach sat in silence while the Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach answered that question.  That sums up the performance of the previous Government in regard to emigration.</P>
    <P>At no time in the years in office of the previous Government did the Taoiseach or his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, personally take any form of political or diplomatic initiative in this area. At no time did the then Taoiseach or his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, go to the United States to see for themselves how serious the problem was, to meet with representatives of the Irish-American community and to discuss what could be done to alleviate the plight of the out of status Irish.  In fact, at no time did I hear any comment from any Fine Gael Member of the Oireachtas on the question of emigration.  We had a major about turn by the party on this question as soon as they went into Opposition. The comments we heard, in particular from Senator Connor the last night ring rather hollow when one considers the performance of his party on this most important topic while they were in Government.</P>
    <P>By contrast, even when we were in Opposition, Fianna Fáil took a close and compassionate interest in the problem.  I visited the United States in late 1986 and saw for myself the real conditions in which the out of status Irish people were living and working.  Together with other Fianna Fáil TDs, I repeatedly raised the issue in the Dáil and repeatedly ran up against a wall of incomprehension.  When the general election of 1987 was called, it was Fianna Fáil, and only Fianna Fáil, who identified emigration and the out of <Col N="931" /> status Irish in the US as an issue.  From the other side there was a deafening silence. Since then, as we will see, we have delivered on our promises.  The Taoiseach has been praised for the work he has undertaken in Government but, in my view, probably his greatest achievement has been the level of progress he has brought about on all fronts in regard to the out of status Irish in the United States.  In that context let me say that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is the one who put that progress into action.  I am sad that he is not here to participate in this debate this evening.  I am sure we all wish him a very speedy recovery.  He has done enormous work over the past 14 months and I propose to outline the progress made.  In the light of this, for Fine Gael to accuse the Government of &ldquo;an ineffective and uncaring approach&rdquo; is, to put it mildly, rather ironic.</P>
    <P>Emigration is a national problem.  Its causes are not simple.  They are part social, part economic and part demographic. Its solution is far from easy to obtain.  As every Government since the foundation of the State have found, the creation of jobs requires continued and determined effort involving the harnessing of all our natural resources.  A major objective of Government policy is to build a climate conducive to investment and job creation which will ensure that no Irish man or woman will be forced by economic necessity to travel overseas in search of a better life.  I am confident that we shall succeed in this.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, since the early eighties many thousands of our young people, well educated and well trained, have left our shores.  Many have gone to the United States.  It was during the period of the last Coalition Government that most of those people found it necessary to emigrate.  Again, it rings rather hollow for Senator Connor to make an attack on the Government when, in fact, most of those people were forced to leave this country as a result of policies pursued by his Government.  Their going represents a major national loss.  It is a loss both to those who emigrate and in the longer <Col N="932" /> term to the community as a whole.  The Government are most concerned at this development and are determined to do all in their power to alleviate the most immediate problems facing our emigrants and to remove the basic economic causes of emigration in the long term.</P>
    <P>Our emigrants in the United States face special difficulties because of their uncertain legal status.  Since taking office the Government have invested a good deal of energy and effort in this issue.  We were particularly encouraged in our task to see what appeared to be the emergence of a broad measure of parliamentary consensus on this issue last December when in the Dáil we accepted the terms of a Fine Gael motion which, while not perfect, as we indicated at the time, we could live with.  Now, however, that party have decided to introduce a distinctive element of confrontation into this debate in the preamble to the motion.  The Government deprecate this change of approach and are compelled to oppose the passing of this motion by this House. At the same time, we welcome the debate.  It is nearly a year since the House last considered the issue and it is opportune to bring before it a report on how the Government have delivered on their commitments &mdash; and deliver we have, as the record shows.</P>
    <P>The Government have addressed the problem of the out of status Irish in the US on two principal levels.  In the first place we sought to have US law in the area modified.  Under current law it is extremely difficult for most of our out of status emigrants to regularise their legal position.  We have discussed this in depth with our Irish-American friends in Congress and the almost unanimous reaction was that an amnesty would be extremely difficult to get.  That this advice was sound was borne out by the fate of the proposed amendment to the Kennedy-Simpson Bill introduced in the US Senate in March which sought to extend the amnesty deadline of 1 January 1982.  There was so little support for this measure that the proposed amendment was withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that the amnesty provision contained in the <Col N="933" /> 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act was one of the reasons the Act took so long &mdash; almost four years &mdash; to win approval in Congress.  Moreover, several attempts to have a more up-to-date amnesty incorporated in the Act were defeated.  Clearly, another Bill designed to bring forward the 1982 deadline would be most unlikely to command sufficient support in Congress for adoption.  Therefore, the call Senator Connor made last week for Government lobbying in regard to an amnesty shows him to be very poorly informed on the situation that pertains in the US Legislature.  When such calls are made one might remember the various efforts that have been made, and their fate as I have just recalled them and, indeed, an amnesty Bill from Congressman Joseph Kennedy which has not even been moved for the simple reason that the Congressman knows there is no possibility of any success.</P>
    <P>What is needed is a structural change in US law on immigration.  The main Act, the 1965 Immigration Act, incorporates the twin principles of family reunification and non-discrimination.  The falling off of emigration from this country between the early sixties and the late seventies meant that we could not benefit from the principle of family reunification as much as countries which had continued to send a steady stream of emigrants to the US. The Taoiseach discussed this problem with the political leaders in the Irish-American community during his visit to Washington in March 1987, barely a week after the formation of the Government. He took this matter up at a very high level in the United States for the first time and it was that which led to the introduction of two Bills which are now in progress: the Kennedy-Simpson Bill which was approved by an overwhelming vote in the Senate and the corresponding Schumer-Donnelly Bill in the House of Representatives.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the statement made by Senator Connor that he deplored the fact that this Bill was languishing in Congress.  This Bill has been one of the fastest Bills to move so far through Capitol Hill.  That is mainly <Col N="934" /> due to the efforts on both sides of the Atlantic, by the Government here and by our diplomatic people in the United States.  Far from languishing, the Bill is being actively considered.  I will refer in detail in a moment to the success it is having.  The main provisions of those Bills are well known to Senators.  They provide for the creation of a new independent visa category in US law.  Under this 55,000 extra visas will be available annually. It is hoped that Irish applicants will benefit substantially from these.  They also provide for the allocation of these new visas by means of a points system based on criteria which should favour the type of well educated young Irish people who leave our shores for the US and an additional 30,000 visas to reduce the existing backlog in the fifth, the brother and sister, preference category &mdash; the category where currently there is the biggest backlog from our point of view.</P>
    <P>Concern was voiced here last week about one of the provisions of those Bills &mdash; the requirement that applicants have to be outside the US when lodging their application.  I would like to make a few comments on that.  In the first place we are talking of draft legislation and it is not possible to say with certainty at this stage what the final form of these provisions will be.  We are, however, discussing this with the drafters of the proposal.  Furthermore a considerable amount will depend on the regulations under which the legislation will be administered by the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service.  These will be drawn up on the passing of this Act.  Again we will ensure that our concerns are made known.  Indeed, if precedent is anything to go by, in particular with regard to the NP5 visas, we can expect a very positive situation to emanate for young Irish people who are illegally in the US rather than the negative expectancy of Senator Connor.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the people who are involved in ensuring that the Bill is successful in the first instance and that it will suit young Irish people who are in the US.  In particular I would like to pay tribute to Ambassador McKiernan, our <Col N="935" /> ambassador in Washington, and to our consuls, Daithi Ó Ceallaigh in New York and Brendan Scannell in Boston.  I am very proud to be Irish, considering the way in which our diplomats in the United States are able to put forward the Irish viewpoint at every level, up to the very highest level.  Clearly they have played a very important role so far in the success of this legislation.  I would personally like to compliment them on the work they have done.  Indeed that stretches further to the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs here at home.  We are indebted to those diplomats for the progress being made in regard to this legislation. The officials in the American Embassy and Ambassador Heckler have also been very supportive in having progress made and that should not go unnoticed.</P>
    <P>Senators also wondered whether this legislation will be passed this year.  It is not our intention to build up false hopes, or to pretend that difficulties do not exist. Allowances must be made for the US legislative system which is much more complex than ours, a complexity increasing in particular in a year which sees both Congressional as well as Presidential elections.  However, we are hopeful that legislation will be approved and enacted before the autumn.  Because of the diplomatic approach that has been, is being and will continue to be taken by our people throughout the United States and because of the very worthwhile political initiatives that have been taken, in particular by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, I am confident that this legislation will get over the difficult hurdles and we will see it passed before Congress falls towards the end of the autumn.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, during his most recent visit to the United States, took the opportunity to discuss the measures further with prominent Irish-American politicians and to encourage strongly the progress which has been made to date.  I assure the House that the Government will continue to watch the developing debate most closely and to take whatever <Col N="936" /> action they consider necessary or desirable to further the prospects of legislative reform.</P>
    <P>Turning to the second prong of our approach, we have also addressed the immediate problems facing the out of status Irish.  When we took office there was a clear need to bring together the expertise of the various bodies in the immigration area, to clarify the real problems faced by our emigrants and to tackle the most pressing welfare issues, in particular medical care.  The Government took action immediately.  First, the Tánaiste established the emigration working committees in New York and Boston under the auspices of our Consulate Generals in those two cities.  These comprise the main bodies active in the immigration area, the AOH, the Irish Immigration Reform Movement, Catholic charities, business and labour representatives and city services.  The committees meet regularly to consider and act on welfare and other issues affecting our people.</P>
    <P>During his recent visit, the Taoiseach met the two committees and received from them a first-hand account of their work and of the problems facing our young people in the United States.  He expressed the deep appreciation of the Government for the hard work and dedication demonstrated by the organisations involved and assured them of the Government's continuing support for their activities.  I would like formally to endorse those sentiments on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>A second step we took was to appoint an additional officer to the New York Consulate to act as an immigrant liaison officer.  Since last autumn he has been working full time on emigration matters, maintaining liaison with immigration services as well as providing advice and help to individuals.  I would like to compliment James Farrell on the wonderful work he has done in New York, ably assisted by Ann Barrington of the staff of our Consulate office there.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we have up-graded the advisory services at all other Consulates in Chicago and in San Francisco.  Although <Col N="937" /> the problem is less acute in those cities, staff of the Consultates have stepped up their contacts with immigration groups and with city authorities.  Fourthly, we have encouraged city and Church authorities to improve the facilities available to immigrants, in particular health services. Although certain private firms provide health insurance to illegal immigrants in the same way as to US citizens, we are aware that many young people in the US fail to obtain medical cover.  To provide a safety net for these, city and Church authorities in New York and Boston have undertaken that legal and financial status will not be an obstacle in regard to hospital services.  In addition the Catholic Church in New York has established a special project, known as Project Irish Outreach, to provide assistance and advice to our emigrants.  We owe the Mayors of Boston and New York and Cardinals O'Connor and Law in both cities our gratitude for their work on behalf of our people.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Reynolds that people are having difficulties, if he brings those specific cases to my attention I will certainly have them examined.  I am aware that much progress is being made in this regard since I was in the United States in January. Fifthly, we have prepared booklets in New York and Boston outlining the range of medical, legal and housing services available to Irish immigrants in those cities.  The New York booklet is being published and the Boston booklet will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>Lastly, we have instituted a series of regular ministerial visits to the US to ensure that the subject is kept under constant review.  As well as the two visits by the Taoiseach since March, there have been three visits by the Tánaiste and one by myself in the same period.  The prime purpose of those visits was to monitor the progress being made in both areas of our concern, legislative reform and welfare issues, and to take whatever action was necessary to make our efforts more effective.</P>
    <P>During my visit in January I attended meetings of the working committees <Col N="938" /> based in New York and Boston.  I made direct contact with Church and civic leaders in both cities and talked with representatives of groups comprising the working groups.  In addition, I discussed the legislative reform package with the aid of prominent Irish-American politicians in Washington, in particular Senator Kennedy.  The Ministers for Justice and the Environment and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach also made a specific point of raising the immigration issue while in the US during the St. Patrick's Day celebration. I believe the measures we have taken over the past year have resulted in a much improved network of facilities to provide help and advice for our emigrants. I want to assure the House that we shall continue to develop our services in response to our people's needs.</P>
    <P>Since his return, the Taoiseach has caused a review to be carried out on the administrative response here at home to the current level of emigration.  I am glad to say that he has decided that a special inter-departmental committee should now be established to co-ordinate the Government's efforts in matters relating to emigration and, in particular, the provision of advisory and information services for intending emigrants and those already abroad.  Consultation between different Departments was already taking place but this new arrangement is designed to put it on a more structured and co-ordinated footing.</P>
    <P>The measures we have taken at home and abroad are a signal to the new generation of Irish overseas that we have not forgotten them and that this Government care for all their citizens, wherever they may be.  In due course we hope that many of our emigrants will return and put their enterprise and experience to work here in Ireland.  To eliminate the causes of emigration and to ameliorate its effects require a concentrated national effort.  I am disappointed that the motion before the House does not recognise this and seeks instead to denigrate the work of the Government over the past year.  For this reason I recommend that it be rejected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I regret that I cannot wholeheartedly support this motion because I am concerned about the wording of the Preamble.  I can of course support the principal substance, as every decent person in this country can.  There is nothing divisive about paragraphs Nos. 1, 2 or 3.  We owe it to our young people who, by virtue of economic circumstances, have been compelled to emigrate to look after and service their needs as fully as possible.  The support obtained in the US Houses of Congress for legislative initiatives such as the Kennedy-Donnelly Bill, which seeks to change their status, is obviously a desirable objective.  The establishment of support and advice centres in the principal American cities is something that leads to no contention whatever.  I would make the point, and make it strongly, that if we are serious about our concern for our many thousands of young people who are now in the United States of America, we should take on board the very clear message that the last thing they need is party bickering here at home.  It is a moment at which the people of this country require to be united behind the leadership of the country in seeking to achieve the maximum possible advantage for our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one further occasion on which I am very glad I am an Independent Senator because it means I can give an independent viewpoint and independent support if necessary to the Government if I think they are doing a reasonably good job in this matter.  We owe it to the people in the United States of America to get our act together, to respond in a statesmanlike manner and to avoid petty point-scoring on a party political basis. I appeal to both principal parties, the Government and Opposition, to make a united drive with regard to this very serious problem.  If one looks at the record, it is perfectly clear that the average Irish citizen would say when confronting unemployment, emigration and the tax situation: &ldquo;A plague on both your Houses&rdquo;.  No persons involved in a political party in this country can totally exonerate themselves from responsibility <Col N="940" /> for what has happened over the past 15 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>In 1975 Professor Brendan Walsh produced a research document through the Economic and Social Research Institute examining demographic trends in this country which clearly showed that he at least anticipated the scale of this problem. The politicians during this period &mdash; I remember it so well and with such a sense of irony &mdash; told us that we had a great national resource, our young people.  They boasted about the fact that we had the youngest electorate in the European Economic Community.  This great national resource has been transformed, because of our absolute lack of a capacity for coherent planning, into our greatest national liability.  It is rather interesting that many of the young people interviewed on radio who have emigrated have chosen to emigrate.  They made a conscious choice, unlike in previous times of emigration.  The rates of taxation here are so penal that they feel they do not have any prospect of reasonable satisfaction in economic or domestic terms, particularly young people setting out in life and seeking to get married.  This is the responsibility of all of us, but particularly the responsibility of the political parties.</P>
    <P>I say this because I think it is remarkable that the present Government &mdash; God knows I am not a member of Fianna Fáil &mdash; have at last sought to attack the underlying causes of decay in the economy. I can say this without fear of contradiction because this has been clearly taken on board by the other principal party in the Dáil.  There is a very welcome and extraordinarily courageous degree of consensus on this matter in the Lower House at the moment.  I note, for example, the speeches of the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Dukes recently, and also the speeches of Deputy Michael Noonan.  There has been a courageous attempt to reach consensus politics.</P>
    <P>Is there something different about the Upper House that we have what is clearly contentious wording in the Preamble which does not really affect the substance of the motion?  I want to know if the Fine Gael Party in the Upper House are out <Col N="941" /> of step with the Fine Gael Party in the Lower House.  I appeal to them to consider withdrawing the contentious wording in the first part of the motion.  It does not do the young people in the United States of America the slightest good for one party to condemn another here.  We should be united.  We should, particularly as an Upper House, rise above the pettiness of political party point scoring.  I appeal to them to delete the contentious wording and retain the substance of this motion.</P>
    <P>I believe we must think positively.  We must look at the situation.  There was much that was positive in what was said from the Opposition benches on this matter.  In an earlier debate attention was drawn, by myself among other people, to the serious problems encountered by illegal immigrants in the United States with regard to medical insurance.  I welcome the fact that this has apparently &mdash; I too trust the Minister on this &mdash; been brought up with the authorities at the highest level in the United States and some degree of movement appears to have been gained.</P>
    <P>I am also seriously concerned about the fact that we are exporting naive, unsophisticated people from rural areas of this country, and let me assure the Minister that we are.  I have this on authority from people who are working in New York with victims of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.  I have to say that we have a real responsibility to make sure that our programme of education is such that people are not catapulted into the lowest areas of New York where they may go out with their friends, get drunk and land themselves into a situation of freely available sexual enjoyment of various kinds, unprotected, and may very rapidly find themselves in real and irreversable trouble.  I have that on the authority of a marvellous priest, Fr. Bernard Lynch, who to the great credit of this country has done extraordinary work among the communities in New York who have been the principal victims of this disease.  There is a certain amount that needs to be done there.  We must take the views of the representatives of <Col N="942" /> the immigrant groups in New York and the other principal cities.  There are things we can do here.  I think there is an economic key to this matter.  There is general consensus, as I have said, that the Government are beginning to attack this in the appropriate way.</P>
    <P>I would like also to refer to the universities and not, I hope, in a petty way. I refer to what I see as a very remarkable, courageous and innovative thing that my colleagues in University College, Dublin, have embarked upon, that is, a £20 million scheme for promoting graduate research fellowship.  They at last have woken up to the fact that we have extraordinary talent in this country.  We have people of great intellectual gifts.  Why should we squander these by sending them abroad.  I welcome the initiative shown by University College, Dublin, in seeking to implement a major programme that will reward young people here for their talents and put this expertise back into the active commercial life of this country.  We need more of this kind of positive thinking and also more support for our excellent diplomats.  I have had some small experience of our diplomatic mission both in the United States and in Canada.  I can echo the Minister's praise of the personnel involved there.  I wonder what they may be feeling when they are working so hard and they see divisive wording in such an important motion.  We should cut out everything that is divisive and lend total support to the people who are operating on our behalf diplomatically.</P>
    <P>This problem is not new.  Unfortunately the sixties and early seventies were an aberration, statistically speaking. Recently I have been reading the new biography of Lady Morgan who wrote <i>The Wild Irish Girl (Glorvina).</i> Lady Morgan, in the 1830s and 1840s, was worried about precisely the same thing.  As my distinguished colleague Senator Murphy has said, this has alas been a feature of Irish life for a considerable time and he produced historical evidence to support this.  I was proud to be a Member of this House last week when I sat here and listened to the <Col N="943" /> generosity of what Senator Murphy had to say.  He spoke not as a member of a party because he is not, he is an Independent, not just as an Irishman, not just as a Senator, he spoke as a citizen of the world.  I would remind the House of his words.  He said:</P>
    <P>What is now the great problem is the uncontrollable and massive influx from Latin America, Mexico, the Philippines and Asia &mdash; though to a lesser extent because the Asians are not a problem but an enormous resource for Americans.  As for the others, the Mexicans, the Hispanics and so on, they are the wretched refuse of the new teeming shores.  They are the huddled masses yearning to be free.  They are the Irish of the 20th century.  If there is a grand and generous American tradition of welcoming the wretched of the earth to their shores, they are the people who are the real pity and they are the people who inspire pity from the most noble hearted Americans of our time.</P>
    <P>I was proud to sit here and listen to those generous sentiments</P>

If Fine Gael are generous and responsible, as they normally are, and remove the sections condemning an ineffective and uncaring approach, I will support the motion.  If they do not, I will either abstain or vote against it.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Connor for allowing me five minutes of his time. I am glad of the opportunity to speak to this motion tonight because of my recent visit to the United States &mdash; to which I am a frequent visitor &mdash; in the same area as the Minister of State has been visiting since he took office.  I can assure the Minister of State that there are significant problems in relation to illegal Irish immigrants in the United States.  It is because of my concern in that regard that I wish to have the opportunity to speak here this evening.  The Minister will be aware, and it has been said by a number of speakers during this debate, that young Irish illegal immigrants find it very difficult to become involved in the United States medical care system.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the hospitals in particular are treating young Irish immigrants who find themselves in difficulty or who have health care problems.  The main difficulty for the young Irish immigrants is the lack of a social security number, many of them use false social security numbers, false bank accounts and false names in order to get into a hospital quickly to get treatment, hope they are not caught in the process.  That is not an acceptable position for young people to encounter and it is certainly not acceptable for their parents at home who are genuinely worried about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information that all of us receive from abroad highlights the difficulties people face when searching for work. The recent immigration reform whereby employers are now being fined to a very high degree, up to $10,000, for hiring illegal emigrants of any ethnic group has an effect on the young Irish in their search for work.  From my conversations with a number of the young Irish in America, particularly in the Boston area, I can <Col N="945" /> recall cases in a nursing home where there was a clampdown by the US authorities in relation to the employment of young Irish illegals.  In that case the employer was faced with the option of having to suffer the rigorous penalties incurred or close dawn the entire operation.  Genuine difficulties are being experienced by the young people in their search for work and this should not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>I appeal in this debate that we lobby as strongly as possible the Congressmen in the United States.  This may be the last opportunity we will get as a nation to do so.  Up to 10,000 extra visas can be got for this country through the latest immigration reform sponsored by Congressman Donnelly and Senator Kennedy and we must welcome their move.  It is not good enough to be criss-crossing the Atlantic as the Minister has been doing. Each of us must use every contact we have in order to tap into the source of political initiative which Congressman Donnelly, in particular, has been taking and to get widespread support for this initiative in Congress.  There is every chance that it could be defeated and we should redouble our efforts now to ensure that it will be successful.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to compliment all US politicians who have taken an interest in Irish affairs.  In a year of a US Presidential election we can capitalise on the ethnic Irish flavour we have generated over there.  There is a significant Irish electorate over there.  We must make make it possible for more young Irish people to get more visas, otherwise we will have to force the situation and an extension of the 1980 amnesty will be the only answer.</P>

      <P>I thank all who contributed to the debate.  The first comment I would like to make is in response to what Senator Norris said about the wording of the Bill.  He said he finds it contentious and feels he cannot vote with us unless we change it.  Maybe the wording is contentious in certain political opinion. If it is contentious, but nevertheless true, <Col N="946" /> it must stay on the record and the motion as proposed by us will have to stay.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Minister's comments, there is little I want to say because I made all the points last week.  The Minister came back this evening, and often in a defensive way acting like an angry young man, he tried to attack many of the points I made.  The points I made are factual. The genesis of the problem is firm.  It started in the mid-seventies because of the madness of the policies that were pursued.  Senator Norris referred to an observer at the time commenting that we were building up for ourselves a store of trouble if we did not pursue the right economic policy which would absorb the thousands of children in the sixties who would be young adults looking for work in the eighties.  That is the genesis of the problem.  That is when it all started.  It showed up in the eighties because of what was done in the mid-seventies.  On the hands of the Minister and the Government he represents, lies the greatest blame for that tragedy.</P>

      <P>I hope the Cathaoirleach gives me injury time for these interruptions. The 1986 census showed that between April 1985 and April 1986 31,000 left this country.  However, if you look at the statistics of the welfare agencies in London alone for 1986, a far greater number are leaving than is suggested. In 1986, the Irish Centre in Camden dealt with 6,000 Irish emigrants, mostly newcomers, who had various problems, some of them very acute, in relation to unemployment, homelessness and illness.  The Irish Centre in Hammersmith dealt with 7,000 such persons in 1986 with similar problems.  Harringay Irish Community Centre dealt with 7,500 Irish emigrants, again most newcomers in difficulty.  The Centrepoint night shelter had 2,000 youngsters of different nationalities under 19 years of age seeking shelter for varying lengths of time during 1986, and 25 per cent were Irish. The Irish were numerically the largest ethnic group seeking this very basic assistance in London.</P>
      <P>On Monday last, I and three of my colleagues &mdash; Senator Bradford, Deputy Peter Barry and Deputy Jim Higgins &mdash; met various groups working for the welfare of Irish emigrants in London.  All of them unequivocally told us of the need for greater funding for the advice and welfare services for emigrants in Britain and for a proper pre-emigration advice and preparation service for them at home before they leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the groups we met, the Action Group for Irish Youth, a group of excellent young people, gave us some pretty harrowing facts and figures on the plight of many of the young Irish in London. The result of one survey they gave us <Col N="948" /> showed that 72 per cent of the young Irish people arriving in London were unemployed or never held a job before going to London, showing the degree to which modern emigration to the United Kingdom is forced.  Thirty four per cent of the people surveyed had less than £30 in their pocket when they arrived and almost all had less than £100 when they arrived.  Sixty one per cent came to London alone and 60 per cent had no prior arrangement for accommodation on arrival in London.  Twenty per cent spent their first night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The result of a study carried out by the London Strategic Policy Unit, a body acting on behalf of all the councils in the Greater London area shows that the Irish have the second highest rate of unemployment in London among all the ethnic groups.  The group with the highest rate is the Afro-Caribbean community.  The survey also showed that the Irish feature disproportionately in London's poorest housing and the Irish are disproportionately concentrated in private rented accommodation.  Private rented accommodation is some of the worst in London&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I call on the Government to set up a task force to study emigration? This task force must be given the resources to be able to prepare a report for Government action in not more than six months.  The task force must look at all the reasons so many young people have to leave this country and suggest policy changes, I mean economic and social policy changes, to tackle the problem.  The task force must be given the job of suggesting that a full, adequate pre-emigration advice service should be established throughout the country.  At the moment, only one pre-advice service or centre gets official funding from the Government through the DION Committee of the Department of Labour, that is the Church-sponsored advice centre in Cathedral Street, Dublin.  There is no use in the Government responding to these arguments by saying FÁS, formerly the national manpower services, are providing information, pre-emigration advice and service.  Yes, they can give you a leaflet when you call, but the manpower placement officers, as they were, or their staff were never trained or meant to deal with emigration advice.  That is no reflection on them, and even the cursory advice they can give is not advertised.</P>
      <P>The task force should also have as part of their remit, after full consultation with all the voluntary immigration advice bodies in the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, the duty to discuss with these immigration bodies a broad policy by which our Government can more adequately help and fund the work and services of these truly dedicated and marvellous people who are working voluntarily, not just on behalf of our emigrants but on behalf of the country itself.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Patrician Academy, Mallow, County Cork.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming back to listen to my plea on behalf of the Patrician Academy, Mallow.  After discussing the more global topic of emigration for the past hour and a half, we are getting back to matters more parochial.</P>
      <P>The long delayed extension to the Patrician Academy in Mallow is considered very important, not just by the 500 pupils at present attending the school, but also by their parents and those people who will have children going to the school within the next few years.  I completed my secondary education there and, therefore, feel a great affinity to this school which was built approximately 120 years ago.</P>
      <P>Within the town of Mallow and throughout the surrounding areas, it has a history of sound education and having done great work for the area.  The success of the school, in a sense, has caused the problems it faces today.  The numbers attending the school have increased out of all proportion over the past 20 years but unfortunately no major developments have taken place within that time apart from the erection of a limited number of prefabricated buildings.  As we all know, prefabricated buildings are no long term solution to a school's building problem or accommodation difficulties. At present the school has accommodation and sanitary facilities for approximately 250 pupils.  Unfortunately, approximately 500 pupils attend this school.  We can automatically deduce from that that there is a severe accommodation problem at present.</P>
      <P>The first question we can ask is why the numbers have increased so dramatically since 1970 or thereabouts.  In 1970 there were approximately 250 pupils attending the Patrician Academy in Mallow.  By 1980 that number had risen to over 300, and now we are speaking of 500 pupils. Obviously, the school has been very successful in attracting new pupils.  It is a very innovative school.  It has a six year leaving certificate cycle.  Fortunately, due to the Minister for Education's latest decision to reverse the earlier Government policy of not having a six year cycle, the school will now be able to continue with the six year cycle.  That is something they are very pleased about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> Up to some years ago the pupils could sit for the following certificates: the group certificate, the intermediate certificate, the general certificate of education and the leaving certificate.  I believe this wise examination structure was one reason for the increased numbers attending the school.</P>
    <P>The present plans within the school would be for a three year intermediate certificate programme and a three year leaving certificate cycle and this, if allowed to develop, would be a most welcome step and should indeed be copied by many more schools throughout the country.  I am not referring directly at present to the school's building programme but I would just like to point out that there are some very good long term plans for the development of this school and for its educational advancement. Obviously, it is very important that proper facilities should be available within the school to allow this plan to come into being.</P>
    <P>The school also places special emphasis on language training and on technology which is a very important subject as we approach the nineties.  For many years the school has stressed the importance of computer training and indeed for the past ten years computer facilities have been available within the school for use by the pupils.  There is within the school an excellent teaching environment and I must say, from my own experience, that the caring and dedicated approach of the teachers is second to none; they are at the very top of their profession.</P>
    <P>The need for new buildings within the school has been seen since the early eighties and an application for a building programme was made to the Department in 1982.  The Department at that time recognised what was described as the chronic state of the school buildings and after much negotiations regarding design plans etc., a £1.2 million building plan was agreed.  The block which would result from this building programme would allow the school to cater for an estimated pupil number of 500 and it is very important that this plan come into being as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, a standstill now seems to have been reached. Stage 5 of the building programme has been completed.  Other schools who applied for sanction at the same time as the Partrician Academy have been sanctioned and some buildings have been completed.  What we are demanding is that money be provided in next year's Estimates for the building programme within this school.  I am fully aware of the financial constraints placed not only on the Minister for Education but indeed on every Minister but money will be spent on priority schools and I would argue that this certainly is a priority school.  The present condition of the school is so poor that an indefinite wait would mean that the very future of the school would be in question.  Indeed it has been suggested that an indefinite wait would cause the school to be closed down temporarily due to the dangerous structures at present.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to give this school priority and to make it possible for action to take place on a building programme within the very near future. Some schools will get priority attention. This one has been held up long enough. I will not detain the Minister any further. I would appeal to him to try to do something for this school.  I will talk to him privately about it in due course.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Senator Bradford for his very reasonable case on behalf of this school. First, I would like to give some background information on the capital funding of second level schools so the specific case of the Partician Academy, Mallow may be put in perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, as part of the economic <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> decided to limit its 1988 provision for capital purposes in second level schools to £23.625 million.  The present capital programme for those schools includes some 400 building projects at various <Col N="955" /> stages of planning and construction. These projects would have a combined overall spending potential of approximately £326 million.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Patrician Academy, Mallow project, the proposed extension will bring the pupil capacity up to 475 pupil places.  The estimated cost of designing, building, furnishing and equipping the extension is £1.4 million. The new accommodation will have an area of 1,280 sq. metres.  The project will also involve extensive conversion work to the existing building.  The project has now reached the bills of quantities stage and the next step is the invitation to tender.</P>
    <P>In 1988 the greater part of the financial allocation will be expended on existing contractual commitments and on minor works and unforeseen contingencies.  In the circumstances, it will only be possible to undertake a limited number of new building starts in 1988.</P>
    <P>The project at the Partrician Academy, Mallow is one of a large number, about 43 in fact, of second level school building projects where architectural planning has been completed and the next step, in the normal way would be sanction to seek tenders.  The aggregate cost of all those projects is estimated to be in excess of £34 million at current prices.  The situation beyond 1988 in terms of capital provision <Col N="956" /> for second level school building projects has yet to be determined.  Consequently, it is not possible to indicate when any of the projects now in course of planning may proceed.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that I cannot give any commitment as to when the Patrician Academy, Mallow, project may proceed beyond giving the assurance that the particular circumstances of the academy will not be overlooked and that I will keep in touch with the school management on the matter.  I am very familiar with this particular case.  I have had a number of people in touch with me about it and I appreciate the concern of Senator Bradford and certainly in the Department we are keen to try to make progress as quickly as possible but within the financial constraints upon us.</P>
