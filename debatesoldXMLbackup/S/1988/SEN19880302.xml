      <P>I have notice from Senator Joe Doyle that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Energy to implement in full the recommendations of the Cremer and Warner report.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Philip Hogan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to examine the serious consequences that her proposed change in the pupil-teacher ration will have on the pupils and staff of Tullow Community School, County Carlow.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Gerry Reynolds of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to establish a wood pulp factory in County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the building programme on the new community school at Castlerea, County Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator <Col N="1922" /> Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The rapidly deteriorating ophthalmic services in the South Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Doyle, Hogan, Reynolds, Connor and Bulbulia as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Doyle's motion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senators Hogan, Reynolds, Connor and Bulbulia may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the question of item No. 59 on the Order Paper dealing with the nuclear industry. I asked the Deputy Leader of the House a few weeks ago for a very wide-ranging debate on the nuclear industry.  This might be put down as an all-party motion if that is agreeable to the Leader of the <Col N="1923" /> House.  If he was not prepared to consider this precise one, would he consider putthing down an all-party motion, or something approaching an all-party motion on it?.  Also, a Chathaoirligh, I would like to join with him in his comments on the way you represented all of us.  I felt proud to be represented by you last week end in the Dáil Chamber.  I certainly think you did us proud.</P>
      <P>Could I also draw attention to item No. 16 on the Order Paper?  In the light of all that has happened over the past number of weeks with regard to Anglo-Irish relations, I would like to raise two points. First of all, I wish to refer again to the need for a debate on Anglo-Irish relations in this House and to ask the Leader of the House if he would consider putting such an item down for discussion. I would like to raise the need for movement on the Extradition Act which now, more than ever, needs to be amended. We have a clear duty to see to it that people we extradite have a fair trial and that we have confidence in the legal system in the country to which we are extraditing people and that we&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, on the Order of Business, I wish to join with the Leader of the House in his tributes to you on the way you represented all of us at the special Joint Sitting on the occasion of the visit of President Mitterrand.  We were very proud of you as I have already told you privately.  The Chair should be commended when it is appropriate to do so, privately or otherwise.  We were very proud of you and you did it in our own natural way.  That was what we liked about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I ask if it is the intention to take item No. 42 this week or next week?  I understand why the Leader of the House had to postpone the agreement to take it last week.  Perhaps he would intimate whether he intends to take it tomorrow or next week as we want to inform the <Col N="1924" /> people who have an interest in this item which is, in fact, an all-party resolution.</P>

      <P>I would like once again to raise the matter of item No. 8, which is the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1987.  This Bill is very badly needed.  The debate on it began in this House last July.  Again and again I and other Members have asked about it, but there does not seem to be any sign of it coming through.  It will deal with possibly 1,000 abandoned, legitimate children.  We need legal provisions to help these children.  It is an indication of the Government's lack of concern and interest in social issues that this Bill has not come through.  It is absolutely inexcusable.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the listing of item No. 17 today.  As the House knows, it is simply a formal introduction. Could I further impose on the Leader of the House by asking that item No. 17 be taken first?  It is a formality.  If he agrees we could take it first and it would be over in less than five minutes.</P>

      <P>Could we ask for the <i>n</i>th time if there has been any progress on the establishment of a foreign affairs committee?  The Leader of the House promised last week that he might have news for us soon.  I wonder if &ldquo;soon&rdquo; is now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point raised by Senator B. Ryan.  Yes, item No. 17 can be taken as the first item.  With regard to Senator J. O'Toole's request that Ireland be declared a nuclear free zone &mdash; item No. 59 &mdash; we have a clear and unambiguous position regarding the nuclear industry.  I am not too sure whether declaring Ireland a nuclear free zone would be of any benefit to the people of Ireland because at this stage we are a nuclear free zone but, unfortunately, we are being imposed upon by outside influences. It might have some outside influence from a moral point of view if Ireland were declared a nuclear free zone.  I do not think it has any practical value at all. However, the Whips can get together and <Col N="1925" /> discuss that.  I have no hang-ups about having a discussion on that.</P>
      <P>I can guarantee that item No. 16 will not be taken for a debate on Anglo-Irish relations.  There is no problem about having a debate of this nature.  In view of the request made by Senator Ferris about item No. 42, a debate on Anglo-Irish affairs would probably be of more importance than a debate on item No. 42.  If agreement can be reached, we might have that debate on Thursday of next week.  That can be open to discussion during the day.  In actual fact, I think it would be better if item No. 42 was put back.  I do not want to go into the details of that.  I disagree with Senator Fennell's remarks about this Government's lack of concern on social issues.  This Government have proved their concern in the area of social issues but the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Bill she refers to &mdash; the Adoption (No. 2) Bill &mdash; is very important.  It brings in changes in legislation which affects families now and will affect families in the future.  There is no way that it is through lack of concern that this Bill is not before the House.  The Bill will be brought forward as soon as all the inhibitions in terms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before we resume on amendment No. 12, I have circulated for information of Members a note on the present state of play on the remaining amendments.  Senators will note that most of the amendments have already been discussed and dealt with.  Before I call on whichever Senator will be speaking to move amendment No. 12, I would like to remind the House again that Senators may speak only once on Report Stage except the proposer of an amendment who has the right to reply.  That is just for information, because in my days on the floor I was always totally confused when there was a grouping of amendments. We are now dealing with amendments Nos. 12, 17 and 27 with 28.  We are dealing with No. 12 on its own first. Already out of the way are the other amendments.  The Senators who are interested in this legislation have it before them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 30, to delete &ldquo;examined&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;viewed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole was asked to have an informal discussion with the Whips.  He was to second this amendment.  I hope the House will grant me some indulgence if he is not here by the time I finish my explanation on it.  I have a seconder on this, as is required under Standing Orders for Report Stage.  He is unfortunately out on the business of the House.  I hope the House will indulge me if there is any problem about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not, in my view, a particularly controversial amendment.  It is similar to one I introduced, but did not push to a <Col N="1928" /> decision, on Committee Stage.  It has to do with the role of the Official Censor in determining whether or not a video work shall be granted a supply certificate.  I must say I have not yet understood why the position cannot be clarified.  The section as it stands states:</P>
    <P>If the Official Censor, having examined a video recording containing a video work... is of the opinion that the work is unfit for general viewing because of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;examined&rdquo; imposes absolutely no obligation on the censor to actually view the video.  I presume that by and large our censors have been sensible, practical people.  I also know that our censors are not governed by my will, or the will of a Minister, or the will of a Government.  They are governed by the legislation.  They operate according to the legislation.  I know that legislation is drafted carefully.  The word &ldquo;examined&rdquo; does not require our censor to actually look at every video before he or she decides to either grant it or refuse it a supply certificate.  I would be worried that in times of pressure or in times of volume of work a lot of material would be refused a supply certificate simply on the basis of reputation, or on the basis of an assumption of what it was like, or on the basis of the first five minutes of it.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned frequently one particular film &mdash; a film which I would regard as a superb film &mdash; which commences with a sexually explicit scene.  It was on view in the cinema for a considerable length of time.  If a censor, or one of the officers acting on his behalf, which can happen, were to simply look at the first two minutes of that film, he or she might choose to take a particular point of view. I do not think that we can allow anybody to decide what we can see or what we can read on the basis of anything other than a considered judgment.  I have sufficient reservations about the whole business of censorship as it stands without allowing people to operate in a kind of &ldquo;default&rdquo; situation.</P>
    <P>For instance, if we had a phrase like this in connection with literature, so that <Col N="1929" /> a censor of books could examine a book to decide whether or not he or she would censor that book, we would have the ridiculous position where books could be censored on the basis of their covers or on the basis of their repute, or on the basis of how they are advertised.  The word &ldquo;examined&rdquo; does not mean in any way that the censor has actually had to look at the material.  If it does mean that, the Minister can happily accept my amendment and clarify the meaning of the legislation.  If it does not mean that, he is inviting trouble.</P>
    <P>I am beginning to suspect at this stage that this Bill, from being a well-intentioned attempt to regulate an area where we all saw an appalling abuse, is moving into a classic piece of traditional Irish censorship which will adjust to the latest demand from an outraged public opinion about something.  I cannot understand why the censor should not be required to look at and view every single work before it is banned.  To ban something from circulation in a country is a profound interference with the freedom of the individual.  It should be done for good and valid reasons only.  I cannot imagine circumstances in which you can justify something being banned on the basis of a cursory examination.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I have to suggest that we are inviting the censor to go through large bodies of material which is deemed to be prurient because of its source, its publicity, its wrapping, its cover, or its reputation, and examine it, as he sees fit, perhaps without viewing it, and ban it <i>en bloc.</i>  It is of course a very effective way of getting a lot of work done quickly but it is not a satisfactory way.  I would be very interested in hearing any circumstance in which the censor could be justified in not viewing a particular video recording.  I do not believe there is one. The reason which the other Minister used on Committee Stage was that he did not want somebody to be required to view a particularly offensive video in its entirety. I take the view that if somebody is given the particularly unpleasant job of being a censor, that responsibility should go with the job.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1930" /> In order to be reasonable and to respond to the Minister's position I rewrote this amendment because it does not say &ldquo;viewed in its entirety&rdquo;.  Since it does not say &ldquo;viewed in its entirety&rdquo; it does not mean &ldquo;viewed in its entirety&rdquo;. I require that at least the censor must make an attempt to look at what is in a video before he or she decides to refuse a supply certificate.  That is not an overwhelming load.  It is not an unreasonable demand.  It is the least that can be expected if we are introducing censorship by one person or by an appeals board. I cannot conceive what motivated the Minister or the Government to draft a Bill which could leave open even the remotest possibility that a film could be refused a supply certificate in this country without being seen by the person who is refusing that certificate.  Therefore, I am moving the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment arises out of the debate on Committee Stage &mdash; columns 1725-1729 &mdash; on a different amendment which Senator Ryan proposed and which he withdrew on the Minister's undertaking to look at the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan's amendment in Committee was to insert a provision in section 3 to require the Official Censor, before refusing a supply certificate or making a prohibition order in relation to a video work, to have &ldquo;viewed the entire work&rdquo;. Senator Ryan was afraid that with the Bill as drafted the requirement in section 6 that the censor should have &ldquo;examined a video recording containing a video work&rdquo; would be satisfied by the censor's merely looking at the cover of the recording and Senator Norris seemed to some extent to share his anxiety.  Senator Norris, in fact, suggested the substitution of &ldquo;having viewed&rdquo; for &ldquo;having examined&rdquo; in section 6 as the present amendment proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the Minister promised on Committee Stage to look into the wording. This has been done and, in view <Col N="1931" /> of the difficulty that Senators Ryan and Norris felt, the Department consulted the draftsman of the Bill.  The upshot is that I am convinced that &ldquo;examined&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;viewed&rdquo; is the right word here; and the draftsman so agrees.  In any event, the amendment would surely have to be changed to speak not of viewing a video recording but of viewing a video work contained in the video recording; but apart from that purely drafting point I still think that, as the Minister said in Committee, &ldquo;there is a very subtle different between the two words &lsquo;examined&rsquo; and viewed&rdquo;'.  I think that the idea of examining a thing involves ascertaining its character, or the like, for the purpose of enabling one to form an opinion about it, whereas the idea of viewing a thing is much more general and may not be for any particular purpose.</P>
    <P>Applying this distinction to the Bill, the censor examines the recording in order to decide whether the character of the video work in it is such that he ought to make a prohibition order, whereas the viewer is probably looking only for entertainment or interest.  Clearly the expressions &ldquo;examine&rdquo; and &ldquo;view&rdquo; are not simply interchangeable in the Bill. For example, one could not speak in section 3, 6 and 10 of the viewers &ldquo;examining&rdquo; a video work.  I feel sure that &ldquo;examined&rdquo; conveys what is required of the Official Censor; he must find out enough about the video work in question in order to show him whether he should make a prohibition order.</P>
    <P>The censor will be able to make a prohibition order only if he is of opinion that the video work is unfit for viewing because of one of the reasons stated in section 6, and he could never form this opinion without acquiring sufficient knowledge of the contents of the work. So it follows that Senator Ryan need not fear that the censor might make a prohibition order in respect of a work after merely looking at the cover of the recording. If he were to have just a cursory look at it, he would see that it would be extremely foolish.  As the Senator is aware, there is a Censorship Appeals <Col N="1932" /> Board.  One would have the right to appeal in the event of a cursory decision of that kind.  That is extremely unlikely.</P>
    <P>I should add that the expression &ldquo;examine&rdquo; is used in what I suggest is an analogous context in relation to publications. Section 6 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946, provides that the Censorship Board shall examine books referred to them.  Under section 7 the board's power to make a prohibition order in respect of a book on the ground that it is, in their opinion, indecent or obscene is exercisable only after they have examined the book.  Clearly, the board could not form such an opinion after merely looking at the title of the book.  Surely the same argument would apply to a video work.</P>
    <P>I know this matter was discussed on Committee Stage.  Senator Ryan holds a very strong view in relation to the use of the word &ldquo;view&rdquo; and against &ldquo;examine&rdquo;. On the last occasion, he more or less accused me of not wanting to deal with some of the questions he raised.  We could spend days here.  With regard to the words &ldquo;examine&rdquo; and &ldquo;examination&rdquo;&mdash; you could move to the top of a hill and view a valley, but you would not be able to examine it, There is a difference. Because of my high regard for the intellectual honesty of the Independent Senators and their highly liberalised views from time to time &mdash; maybe with some inconsistencies as well &mdash; I looked at the Irish aspect of it.  Here we get the word &ldquo;scrúdú&rdquo;, in contrast to &ldquo;breathnú&rdquo; nó &ldquo;feiceáil&rdquo;.  Even the Irish language itself has a stronger sense of the interpretation of &ldquo;examine&rdquo; versus &ldquo;view&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When I was dealing with the question earlier, I referred to references in the Censorship of Publications.  Here in the Irish version we have the &ldquo;scrúdóir oifigiúil&rdquo;. I think it is fairly clear that the word &ldquo;examine&rdquo; is used because it was felt that was a better word when the censorship Act was being devised.  It has stood the test of time.  It seems to search more for a solution to the problem.  An examination is tending to lead towards a result.  You can view for any one of a <Col N="1933" /> number of reasons but, when you examine, you are examining to find a result. I suggest to Senators that it may be a debating point but we are satisfied that the use of the word &ldquo;examine&rdquo; is more appropriate in the circumstances and, therefore, I have to reject the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Purely semantically I think the Minister makes a very strong case.  Our worry is that the use of the word &ldquo;examination&rdquo; could mean something else again.  To continue this semantic discussion, it could be an actual physical examination of it rather than what was portrayed by the video.  Could the Minister, for my sake, give a guarantee that somebody would not rule out some video work without having even looked at it?  In other words, what I want to know before going any further with it, is whether the censor would be required to see the work or a portion of the work that goes into the actual video recording itself.</P>

      <P>I have a sense of grievance and the Minister will not reassure me in the least.  First of all, I would never accuse the present Minister in particular of incompetence because I know he is far from being incompetent &mdash; he is extremely competent.  The problem is that he is not in a position to decide. The decisions about these matters were taken, presumably, outside this House by the Minister on the advice of his officials and this present Minister was then landed with the less than pleasant job of having to defend something which was not part of his normal brief.  I feel great sympathy for him.  Nevertheless I regard it as an extremely frustrating experience that this House has to go through an important piece of legislation which the Minister for Justice stated he was introducing in this House precisely because he would welcome the sort of debate that would take place on it in this House and then the Minister goes missing from a large part of the debate.</P>
      <P>I found that unacceptable and I still find it unacceptable and the fact that one of the most able of the Junior Ministers in the present Government was sent in to cover for him does not get us away from the fact that it is still unsatisfactory.  He can have all the compliments he likes from me but he is still not the person for the job because he has not the authority to speak on it.  It is as simple as that. It has nothing to do with the present Minister; there are others to whom I would not be as complimentary but I would still feel they were not prepared to do the job.</P>

      <P>In page 15, line 10, after &ldquo;recording&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;for which a supply certificate is not in force.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is an attempt to deal with quite an extraordinary situation. You have no parallel with books in this case because under the Censorship of Publications Act, all books are permitted to be circulated in this country unless they are banned.  In the case of videos from now on, no video will be allowed to be distributed in this country &mdash; subject <Col N="1937" /> to exemptions &mdash; unless a supply certificate is issued.  That is the precise position at the moment.  So, any parallels with the activities of say, Customs and Excise, are not entirely true.  Under the present Customs and Excise legislation, if an officer of the Customs and Excise suspects or believes that a book is indecent or obscene, he may seize that book and refer it to the censor of publications and whatever we might think about that, that is the way it is.  What we are now proposing to do is to say under section 16 that an officer of Customs and Excise may detain upon importation into the State any video recording which, in his opinion, ought to be examined by the Official Censor under this Act.</P>
    <P>This raises the interesting question: if one particular censor takes the decision and subsequently there is a change in the moral climate or something, or an officer of Customs and Excise forms the opinion that the censor was wrong, can be then say: &ldquo;I want to send this back.  I do not approve of this.  I can send it back.&rdquo; Unfortunately some of the evidence on the behaviour of some people in the Customs and Excise &mdash; not all of them &mdash; is that they seem to exercise a rather extraordinary set of judgments about what should and should not be banned.  I am simply proposing that the Customs and Excise officer should not be allowed to refer to the Official Censor any video recording for which a supply certificate is in force.</P>
    <P>In other words, if the material is coming in and has no supply certificate in force &mdash; and bear in mind there will be a register of videos for which supply certificates exist provided for under this legislation and therefore he is free to check which videos a supply certificate exists for &mdash; I can see this legislation leaving us open to all sorts of confusion and, indeed, embarrassment with material which has already been approved being resubmitted for censorship. If there is a job for Customs and Excise here, and I doubt it, but if there is &mdash; and some people seem to agree that there is &mdash; it simply should be to deal <Col N="1938" /> with any videos which an officer of Customs and Excise comes upon which do not have a supply certificate with them. The present provision under section 16 is that any video recording, whether or not a supply certificate exists for it, can be referred by an officer of Customs and Excise to the Official Censor.</P>
    <P>I have no real reason to understand why Customs and Excise should have such a function for those videos where a supply certificate already exists.  It seems to me like an attempt to make sure that, having censored us once, we are going to try to make sure that in case the censor either missed something, or made a mistake, or perhaps made an error of judgment, we can do it a second time.  I cannot see why we should not restrict the activities of Customs and Excise in scrutinising video recordings to those video recordings for which in the words of the amendment a supply certificate is not in force.  Otherwise we could have ludicrous attempts to recensor things.  We could have ludicrous attempts to re-judge things, to rewrite the judgments of the censor, particularly when there was a change of censor or something like that. Therefore, I move that the officers of Customs and Excise may detain any video recording for which a supply certificate is not in force and only for those cases and that is the meat of my amendment.</P>

      <P>In seconding it, just to cur leis an méid atá ráite ag an tSeanadóir Ó Riain, I have discussed this with the Customs and Excise people and their union.  They are, quite frankly, sick and tired of legislators bringing in new bits of legislation which requires them to do extra duties and extra functions, not because of the extra duties and extra functions but because they have no guidelines on which to work.  This still requires the Customs and Excise person to carry out the same functions, but at least at this stage with the back-up of requiring the State to give the customs officials a list of those videos or whatever equipment is concerned which have a supply certificate which allows them easily to check <Col N="1939" /> whether or not something has already been assessed, scrutinised and passed.  If that is the case, they can do a quick check on it.</P>
      <P>In all fairness to the people we are asking to do the job on the ground, the Customs and Excise officials, this is something which would lead to a more efficient and effective working of the legislation.  There can be no reason why the Minister would not accept this proposal.</P>

      <P>Section 16 empowers a customs officer to detain on importation a video recording which, in his opinion, ought to be examined by the Official Censor and to refer it to him for that purpose.  This is in order to enable the censor to consider whether he should make a prohibition order in respect of a video work contained in the recording. The difficulty about prohibiting a customs officer from detaining a video recording, if the video work contained in it is one in respect of which a supply certificate is in force, is that the customs officer may not know whether the recording contains only certificated video works and he may have reason to suspect that the title of the work as it appears on the recording is false.  If the customs officer was satisfied that the recording contained only certificated video works normally there would be no point in his detaining the recording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the fact that a supply certificate is in force in respect of a video work is not a bar to the making of a prohibition order.  That is provided by section 6 (1).  Clearly such a case would be exceptional.  Nevertheless, if it is right that the censor should have this power, it would surely be wrong to deprive the customs officer of the ability to provide the censor with the opportunity to consider whether he ought to exercise it.  In <Col N="1940" /> any event, there is no question under the Bill of customs officers acting as censors. I repeat the assurance the Minister gave on Committee Stage that if it is shown that this section is being abused it will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The point was made by Senators O'Toole and Ryan that you may have an individual person in customs who was perhaps a type of maverick, or someone who had a special feeling towards all of this.  Senators seem to envisage that certain difficulties might arise in that situation. Looking at it in a broader context we have to be sure that, since the censor has an obligation to make the decision ultimately, the freedom to pass on that material to him where the customs officer has a suspicion has to be enshrined in the law.  Therefore, it is not possible to accept the amendment.  The Senator should be satisifed with the assurance that, if this proves to be in any way ineffective or creates problems, we will be prepared to review that aspect of it as soon as information to that effect comes to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am beginning to wonder what the point is.  There was a time when one could speak on Committee and Report Stages and feel that one was having a debate.  It reminds me a little bit of Seán ÓFaoláin's famous remark: when you hear two Irish people having a conversation it is like two people playing handball against different sides of the same wall.  I keep hearing the same things I heard on Committee Stage.  We have made no progress.  When we deal with an issue in this country we tend to have a habit of overkill as evidenced by the referendum on abortion when we had the most cast iron prohibitions, not just legally but in terms of the moral climate of the country about abortion and we decided we had to symbolise our outrage by copperfastening and overkill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now in a position where a perfectly legitimate concern about a particular form of video recording has translated itself into a Bill which will do an enormous amount of damage to free expression and which, at the same time, in other areas which are offensive to all <Col N="1941" /> of us, will allow a licence that probably exists in no other European country, the licence to foment racism and religious bigotry.  What we have here is the unfortunate tendency which comes up in a lot of our legislation, the &ldquo;what if&rdquo; tendency &mdash;&ldquo;what if somebody were to do something that might possibly in certain circumstances be against a certain part of the law?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the officer of Customs and Excise believes that a film or a video recording does not have a supply certificate in force &mdash; and I am perfectly happy that that will include some where he thinks the supply certificate that is on it is not one that refers to the body of material &mdash; I do not believe any court of law would blame him for saying: &ldquo;There was a supply certificate for this title but I was satisfied that what was contained in this was not the title for which a supply certificate was in force.&rdquo;  It seems that would be very reasonable.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how we could ever have a situation in which a video recording for which a supply certificate was in force could be held up or delayed by an officer of Customs and Excise unless we are getting ourselves involved in extraordinarily convoluted reasoning.  I have enough qualms about this legislation as it stands without inviting second-time censorship, third-time censorship and God knows what else.</P>
    <P>I really do not know if we have addressed the fundamental questions here.  For instance, we have no prohibition on child pornography <i>per se</i> in this, which I would regard as a particularly offensive form of pornography for which the makers ought to go to jail as well as anybody who attempts to sell it.  We left that out.  We have left out a number of other things also.  Yet we have this extraordinary provision that an officer of Customs and Excise may detain on importation into the State any video recording which in his opinion ought to be examined by the Official Censor under this Bill.  &ldquo;In his opinion&rdquo;&mdash; an extraordinary phrase; and it is &ldquo;any video recording.&rdquo;  I cannot understand why we have to put in these <Col N="1942" /> catch-all phrases.  It is quite understandable, though I do not think necessarly, that Customs and Excise ought to be the front line of our defence against pornography.  If they must do this as well as all their other jobs, surely their attention should be directed towards video recordings which are not covered by a supply certificate.</P>
    <P>I am flabbergasted by the resistance to any attempts from this side to improve not the administrative arrangements for dealing with video outlets but the whole philosophical question involved.  A further barricade of censorship has been put up against every single amendment introduced from this side of the House, a vigorous resistance to any suggestion that this Bill in the philosophical issues of censorship is anything other than perfect. I have rarely encountered such a resolute resistance to an attempt by Members of this House who take different views on different issues to contribute towards a sensible solution to a problem.</P>
    <P>What we have met is a virulent, vigorous resistance to every attempt to rewrite this Bill in a way which would meet both the concerns of those of us who are unhappy about censorship and the concerns of those who promoted this Bill, and a resistance to a simple proposal that Customs and Excise should confine their attentions to videos which do not have supply certificates in force.  This confirms my view that this Bill was conceived and will go through both Houses of the Oireachtas unamended because it suits a particular narrow point of view.  Its impact will be well beyond that which it was originally intended to be.  We will be returning to something close to the censorship of the sixties and before.</P>
    <P>If the Bill goes through in its present form, the process of importing a video will become most hazardous.  For instance, if the cover on a video coming perhaps from a country with a different viewpoint on sexual matters from ours is changed and the publicity material associated with it is changed a Customs and Excise officer may say: &ldquo;I do not like the look of this.&rdquo;  He goes through his list of supply certificates, discovers that it is <Col N="1943" /> covered by a supply certificate but then he may be of the opinion that this might be different from the one for which a supply certificate was in operation and he can pack it off and hold up distribution. I find that quite astonishing.  How does he know, for instance, that the material in a particular video which has the same title as one on the list is actually the same video?  Any customs officer who objected to sexually explicit scenes in a number of films could happily say: &ldquo;How do I know this is the same as the one the censor looked at, even though there is a supply certificate in force for it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The list of possibilities is endless if we do not say his or her job ought to be to deal with videos which are not covered by supply certificates.  Forged supply certificates, unauthorised changes or unauthorised insertions in videos are matters for the Garda.  Are we to leave this power at the point of entry for an arbitrary exercise of opinion by an officer of Customs and Excise to say: &ldquo;I do not think this is the same as what the censor saw because the censor could never have allowed this to go through.&rdquo;  I remember a Member of this House talking to me after we had discussed a film here and saying he was taken aback when he saw the film.  He felt that the censor had gone too far.  That is a matter of opinion but the fundamental fact is that any officer of Customs and Excise can happily form an opinion that either the censor did not see it in its entirety or, perhaps, it had been changed from the one the censor saw or, perhaps, it was the same title but a different video.</P>
    <P>There are endless possibilities and there is a question of balancing the rights of the individual against the rights of the State in this case.  It is now loaded heavily on the side of the State where an officer can decide, on his own, without reference to anybody, without being bound by the list of films for which supply certificates are in force, that a particular piece of material must be referred to the censor. That seems to be an invitation to interference in a whole lot of areas by people who, as Senator O'Toole has said, would <Col N="1944" /> far prefer not to be involved in these areas.  The whole idea of asking Customs and Excise people to get involved in censorship is ridiculous and is probably as embarrassing for them as it is for the people they question about it.</P>
    <P>At this stage my concern is far more about the pointlessness of attempting to have a serious debate on a serious issue in this House when the Government resolutely refuse to discuss the issues and lead us into back alleys &mdash; but I will say something more on that on Fifth Stage. The amendment is an attempt to make this legislation work in the way it is intended and I deeply regret the resolute refusal of the Government to consider any serious amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on this amendment and on the section which Senator Ryan had hoped to strengthen in his opinion.  He wanted to ensure that it was strengthened.</P>
      <P>First of all, the comment from Senator O'Toole about putting an additional burden on Customs and Excise officers is without foundation because this section does not insist that they should act as censors on the ground.  There is no obligation on any Customs and Excise officer under this section to carry out a form of censorship on his own.  Therefore, any worry they have as an organisation is unfounded.  The Minister's response to that is reasonable.  Certainly they involved themselves in the past in areas which were outside the narrow Customs and Excise role, as we understand it.  All videos are imported into this country and, obviously, as in the case of drugs, we were of the opinion in this House that the frontline defence in most of these areas of drugs, videos or whatever, which could have a detrimental effect on the people, should always be, and has always been as is exemplified in other legislation, the Customs and Excise.  Giving them power here, if they decide to use it, is not wrong.  Senator Ryan wants to ensure that the Customs and Excise officer would exert his power in all areas where there was no supply certificate issued. That is all he is asking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1945" /> The next question we must ask ourselves is: is a supply certificate applicable to individual video works or recordings? I requested that the people who import videos should be registered as importers and when they distribute them throughout the country they should be so registered. The people who sell them wholesale should also be registered.  That is desirable because we will then have a proper record of the people dealing in videos.  I am not sure if a supply certificate is applicable to specific videos.  If so, Senator Ryan's suggested amendment is legitimate in that all works included in a supply certificate could be presumed by the customs to be OK.  It would then rest with the film censor if he needed to carry out the role that we have insisted he should carry out, by way of his intervention under this Act.</P>
    <P>If that is not the case, Senator Ryan's concern in this area is legitimate.  If all work is individually identified with a supply certificate, Senator Ryan's amendment is legitimate.  If it is not all included, anything coming in which is not included in a supply certificate would automatically be suspect and I would expect any good, hard-working Customs and Excise officers to operate within the parameters we have laid down in other legislation for them.  Senator Ryan has not been unreasonable in trying to ensure that there is no loophole, even though it possibly goes against the grain of what he would normally stand for in the area of censorship.  Here he wants to make sure that nothing slips through unless it is already certified as being fit to supply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the indulgence of the House.  On the last occasion when I spoke a second time I was chastised but I think both Senator Ryan and Senator Ferris have raised some points which perhaps need some clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not get away from the fundamentals here.  We have clear, overwhelming evidence that there are unsuitable and undesirable videos available in the country and that they are being imported.  From time to time Senator Ryan keeps on surprising me. <Col N="1946" /> There are occasions when he accuses private enterprise and people involved in commercial areas of being capable of the most extraordinary things &mdash; how they avoid obligations and how they scheme to extract the last halfpenny from the taxpayer, or from the customer, or whatever. There is no way his alert mind can grasp the fact that somebody who is peddling nasty videos could dream of thinking up an arrangement whereby he could circumvent the laws of a particular country into which he wanted to sell his merchandise. We are endeavouring to give a power to the customs officer where he has a suspicion that something is not right.  Let me give an example.  I will have great difficulty here because Senator Ryan obviously has lost all grip on himself in relation to these matters.  I will have to be extremely helpful and long winded and I may have to use examples which will be unnecessary for the rest of the House.</P>
    <P>Take a situation where a supply certificate is given for a particular video. There may be a longer version of that video which is commonly known to contain works which would be objectionable. Senator Ryan would probably be the first person to say: &ldquo;The shorter version was fine.  Why should you prevent the importation of a video, the shorter version of which is quite acceptable?&rdquo;  Or is he arguing that in the area of censorship he talks about we should have an even more rigid system than we have?  I would be the first to admit this Bill does not solve all our censorship problems.  History has taught us that it is not a simple matter.  Things change from generation to generation in liberal or other ways.  He accuses the Government and members of the Government almost as if they are setting out to restrict the liberties of people.  The fundamental issue is that throughout our society there are videos which are nasty, which are cruel in many areas, and we are trying to do something about them. We have accepted a good number of amendments.  The longer the Senator is in this House the more successful he will be in making changes.  He is doing himself a disservice at times in the way he accuses <Col N="1947" /> others of having ulterior motives.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill, as <Col N="1957" /> amended, be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question that the Bill, as amended, be received for final consideration, I understand I am in order in speaking at this stage.  It needs to be put on the record that the Bill as amended is now a licence for racism, prejudice and bigotry.  The Bill contained a prohibition on videos which would be likely to incite people to stir up hatred against any group of persons in this State on account of their race, nationality or religion.  That has been deleted from this Bill because the Government, apparently, could not handle the question of sexual orientation as an addition to this and, rather than deal with that, they ducked the entire issue.  Having raised the issue of incitement to hatred, or stirring up hatred against any group, they have now removed that prohibition and, in the process, in my view, highlighted the fact that, as a country, apparently we will tolerate the inclusion of making videos in our country of anti-Semitic, racist, religiously bigoted and religiously inflammatory material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a promised incitement to hatred Bill in the indefinite future.  The Minister was gracious enough to assure us that he was not too sure when it will be introduced, but it is promised.  In the meantime in this country people can make videos which are anti-Semitic, which stir up racism and religious bigotry and we also have the capacity to do that in the printed field as well.  We will rapidly become in the video area what we are already in the area of printed matter, the European publishing centre of extreme right wing propaganda.  We are probably the only country in Europe now which allows that sort of material.  Most of the material that is circulated of an anti-Semitic nature in the United Kingdom is printed in this country because we allow it to be printed.  We are going to do the same now about video material because we took out one of the useful sections in this Bill which was the prohibition on incitement to hatred.  I find it particularly <Col N="1958" /> repulsive and revolting that we have chosen to do that.</P>
    <P>I choose to speak on the Bill, as amended, because the Bill, as amended, has lost one of its most valuable and useful provisions, a deliberate attempt to confront one of the problems of the late 20th century which is a tendency for racism and for anti-Semitism to begin to surface again.  I find those particular manifestations of the late 20th century revolting and I do not think they should be justified in the interests of any spurious notion of free speech.</P>
    <P>I was quite happy to welcome the Government's attempt and to attempt to nudge them in the direction the rest of the world is moving, particularly in the light of the AIDS problem, which is to prohibit discrimination against people on the grounds of their sexual orientation. The Government chose to refuse to confront that as they have refused to confront a number of related issues, not by arguing on the principle of discrimination and hatred against people on the grounds of sexual orientation, but by simply deleting the entirety of that subsection.  I am sure it is not the Government's intent but the consequences of their action will be that anybody in Europe who wishes to make anti-Semitic, racist or religiously bigoted videos knows that at least there is one country which does not prohibit such activities.  I find that most regrettable in a country that has enough experience of religious extremism to do it for the next 500 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity to thank the Minister of State and the Minister for Justice for bringing this legislation before the House.  It is a very important milestone in the legislative programme of the Department of Justice to have a priority Bill such as the Video Recordings Bill initiated in Seanad Éireann and getting such a wide-ranging discussion.  I am glad to say that during the course of the debate the amendments tabled were listened to very sincerely by the Minister for Justice.  The Second Stage speechs were listened to, and this <Col N="1959" /> is reflected in the number of Government amendments brought forward.</P>
      <P>Many innovations were introduced in this Bill.  I hope they will become part of the legislative process and that we will not fail to enforce the provisions of this legislation.  Far too often Bills put through the Houses of the Oireachtas are not backed up by proper enforcement procedures.  The video nasties problem is so serious in this country that no responsible Government can fail to deploy the necessary resources to enforce the legislation initiated in the Seanad and which will go to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The registration and licensing of everybody involved in the retail and distribution of video material is very important in controlling those who are distributing and making this material. Also, it will be of net benefit to the economy that we now have the legislative framework to do something about the black economy in video recordings.  With the controls and registration systems which have been implemented in this legislation I hope we will be in a position to act swiftly in the event of erroneous developments in that area.</P>
      <P>We are still faced with the problem of wholesale piracy of video material.  I urge the Minister of State to take an initiative in getting the Department of Industry and Commerce to reform the copyright area in order to stamp out the wholesale piracy and counterfeiting of video material.  This is having serious consequences in many urban and rural areas. Before this debate commenced many Senators failed to see the impact it was having in every village and town.  I hope Senators and public representatives generally will be more aware of the enormous damage to and the wholesale destruction of the minds of young people by the filth which has been distributed throughout the country.  The Minister's task will not be fully completed until he has controlled this piracy and counterfeiting.  I urge the Minister strongly to take on board that problem with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1960" /> Finally, I record my thanks to the Minister for the constructive way in which he has dealt with this Bill.  This makes one's contribution as a Senator worth while. As a new Senator you feel that you are getting some place by articulating your views from your experience on the ground.  The constructive spirit in which all legislation is dealt with in this House has been well displayed in the Debate on the Video Recordings Bill, 1987.</P>

      <P>Because of our Bill we took a particular interest in the Government's efforts in this area.  The record will show that we played a role in endeavouring to ensure that the Bill, as amended, is fundamentally different from the Bill as initiated by the Government.  I want to thank the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, for having agreed to many of the suggestions made from this side of the House.  The Minister of State was supported by his colleagues on the other side and by Senator McEllistrim who also saw the value of the amendments we were suggesting.  You would know the Minister of State had been a Member of this House for some time because of the way he applied himself to debating the Bill with Senators, listening to their points of view and enjoying it immensely.  Today's record will show how much he has enjoyed it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>People involved in the video industry have proved to be a very responsible body of people.  Whether we listened to their submissions or otherwise on the proposed <Col N="1961" /> amendments, never once did they show a vested interest.  They were concerned with the interest of the consumer and the interest of the responsible people involved in the video recording business. We are subjected at times to certain pressures from outside but I certainly welcomed their own view of how this Bill should be amended.  We finally managed to achieve this because the Government, the Minister and the Minister of State were forthcoming.  I hope we will carry out the proper investigation on the ground and that the proper application of the various sections of the Bill will really make it successful.  We all want it to be a success.</P>
    <P>Finally I want to deal with the last comments made by Senator Ryan.  I cannot understand why the Government removed the section from the Bill which made it an offence to incite people to violence or hatred based on creed, religion, colour, race, and so on.  I cannot understand why there was a Government proposal to delete that.  It was the only division&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We will try to ensure that the Government will bring forward legislation covering the section which has been removed from this Bill.  I am asking for an assurance that legislation on incitement to hatred will be introduced.  We have already published a Private Members' Bill and we will be pushing it unless the Minister gives us an assurance that the matter is getting urgent Government attention.  This Bill, as amended, is defective and that is a tragedy.  It is defective because of the removal of that section.</P>

      <P>Speaking on the Bill on Second Stage, the Minister for Justice said he expected that there would be general agreement on the need for a control system in relation to video films.  He mentioned that there might be differences of opinion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on the best method of control and also on details of the scheme as set out in the Bill.  No doubt he was aware, as I was, of the versatility and resources of this House.  It is impossible, <Col N="1963" /> I suppose, to get 100 per cent agreement on everything.</P>
      <P>There has been very general support for the need for a control system in relation to video films.  Members of the House have made that clear in their contributions on the Bill.  At the same time, there were suggestions that certain details of the proposed scheme could be improved and there were amendments on the question of a licensing system for persons selling video recordings or letting them out on hire.  Some of the amendments as regards matters of detail were accepted, and some were not.  Having studied the arguments made in favour of a licensing system, the Minister agreed to bring forward a series of amendments which built a licensing system into the Bill.  Accordingly, the debate on the Bill has resulted in substantial improvements to it.  There are, however, a few other points I would like to refer to specifically.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to reiterate what was said by the Minister on 4 November last that it was not the intention that the Bill should serve as a vehicle for a fundamental review of all censorship law. The approach adopted in framing the Bill was that there are already two areas in which censorship is operated &mdash; censorship of publications and censorship of films.  Generally speaking, the operation of censorship in those two areas has proved satisfactory and, accordingly, the Government considered that censorship of video films should be framed having regard to the general principles underlying the other two areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to refer to is the concern expressed that the advent of censorship of video works could lead to a less liberal approach being taken by the film censor in his approach to cinema films.  I do not accept that this will be the case.  It is, of course, true to say the film censor can at present give a limited certificate to a cinema film and that this contrasts with the situation in relation to video recordings where only one type of certificate can be given in respect of video works.  This situation in relation to video recordings resulted in Government <Col N="1964" /> amendments which were agreed to with general approval in Committee and which provided that the censor could be required to grant a supply certificate if he considered the video work was fit for viewing instead of fit for general viewing which was a requirement in the Bill as introduced.  The Government amendments were expressly approved by Senators Hogan, Brendan Ryan and Ferris.  The logic of the situation as proposed is that parents will have to be aware that they should exercise control over the video recordings being viewed by their children, whereas in the case of cinema films they can rely on their children not being admitted to a cinema where the film does not have a certificate for their particular age group.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank all Senators for their contributions.  I can tell Senator Hogan in relation to his anxieties about piracy that a meeting will be taking place between officials in the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Irish Video Film Association tommorrow.</P>
    <P>On the points made by Senator Ferris and Senator Ryan in relation to the exclusion of the section on race, nationality and religion and the amendment which was proposed by Senator Norris and Senator Brendan Ryan adding in sexual orientation, we have gone over this ground before but I want to reject the assertion that the Government signalling that anybody who wanted to make racist videos in this country could now do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>I will quote from one or two references in the Official Report of 17 February 1988.  At column 1476. Senator Ryan said: &ldquo;...A Government... signalling that anybody who wanted to make racist videos in this country... could do so.</P>

      <P>Naturally I will be guided by the very experienced Leas-Chathaoirleach. Both Senator Ryan and Senator Ferris in their concluding statements referred to the way in which, arising from the exclusion of the particular section on racism, etc., the Government had now opened the door in a way which they found difficult to accept.  I want to approach this point from two separate angles.  First, if we did not have this Bill at all at present would either Senator be accusing the Government of opening those doors?  The Bill deals with a particular problem and to suggest that, because we are not including this section, it does something to encourage developments in that area, which none of us will accept and none of us will stand over does not stand up.  Senator Ryan and others have made a very distinct contribution towards ensuring that a Bill against incitement to hatred is introduced perhaps more quickly than it otherwise would have been.  There is a broad consensus that this is not the type of Bill to try to cover the ambit of all of these problems.  It requires its own specialised treatment.  I think the Senator should feel honoured by the fact that he is making, in spite of himself, a contribution towards developments of that kind.  I am sorry Senator Norris is not here to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am very sorry.  He can be busily engaged elsewhere.  I merely wanted to make the point that he referred to the fact that there was widespread legislation in this particular area all over Europe.  He said he would supply the Department of Justice with the information which would support his claim &mdash; with the exceptions of Denmark and Norway where there was some minor treatment in the sexual orientation area. He presented nothing else.  As far as the rest of Europe is concerned we are up there with the best and we will keep on improving.  I am very sorry that once again I have transgressed against the rules.  It is a difficulty which I will have to overcome.  I would like to thank all of Senators for their support and assistance in our deliberations here.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I spoke twice, not to be troublesome but because I understood there was a difference.</P>
      <P>I want now to confine my remarks exclusively to the Bill as it stands.  I want to confine myself to one thing because I have a fear about one aspect which I will mention briefly.  In spite of the Minister's re-assurance &mdash; and I am very glad he finally mentioned it on the previous Stage &mdash; I have a fear that the fact that the censor will now know that any film he approves as the Bill now stands, for display for a restricted certificate in the cinema is automatically granted a supply certificate as a video.  In other words, if a film is approved for over 18s in a cinema, it automatically receives a certificate for supply in the country.  That is the Bill now as amended.</P>
      <P>I was very glad and I welcomed that at the time but like any other legislator I thought about it and my worry still is that that will have an impact which was not, I believe intended but which will in time still produce that impact.  That is, that the censor will now adjudicate on a film for display in a cinema on the basis that if he approves it for restricted viewing in a cinema it will then become a video which is available for general distribution through video outlets.  I appreciate it that the Minister addressed that fact but reassurances from Ministers are no substitute for legislation.  I do not mean that in any personal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation is what this country is run on not on the personal interpretations of either Ministers or, indeed, the Attorney General's office.  Ultimately the courts will interpret this and the censor will have to do his best to interpret it as it stands. I still stand over my feeling that there is a reasonably fear that the unintended consequence of amending this Bill will be to inhibit the censor in his attitude to films for display in cinemas.  The other matter is the technological questions which arise from that particular prohibition. If a film is approved by the film censorship for showing in a cinema with <Col N="1968" /> cuts &mdash; with something removed from it &mdash; which is one of the powers the film censor has, which film will than be given the video supply certificate?  Will it be the cut version or the uncut version?  This is a direct consequence of what is in the Bill.  Which will it be, the cut version or the uncut version?</P>
    <P>I have some understanding that cutting a video may not be as easy as cutting a film.  Will we find that, because there is a one minute cut in a film, and it is then approved for adults, for over 18s, the same video uncut will be prohibited because it will not be the same work? Therefore we could have, as a consequence, many films on display in the cinema not being available as videos. Whichever way you work, you can have impacts of one on the other that I do not think have been fully thought out.  I am sure our colleagues in the other House will pursue this matter further.</P>
    <P>The other consideration in this Bill &mdash; and the one I find morally difficult to accept &mdash; is the fact that anybody can make a video in this country and not have to worry about supply certificates, etc., provided it is being supplied outside the country.  I find the idea unacceptable that we will let people make videos here which would be absolutely unacceptable here, for instance, on the grounds of depicting cruelty and dismemberment of humans or animals which, incidentaly, is the core of what this Bill is supposed to do.  It is supposed to deal with video nasties, not with erotic videos, not with videos which are deemed to be obscene or indecent in the sexual sense.  It is to do with nasties.</P>
    <P>Video nasties are videos which involve the excessive use of violence or, indeed, the excessive use of violence and sex intermingled together.  I did not understand that we were as concerned about the whole flood-tide of what can be best described as erotic videos.  I would invite the Minister or any Member of this House to go into any magazine shop and look at the last five or six pages of the number of magazines which deal with video reviews, as I said on Second Stage, <Col N="1969" /> one of which describes it as the lustometer in which various videos are assessed on a category of either one to ten or one to five on their lustometer in terms of how stimulating they are sexually.  The point I am making is that while attempting to deal with that this Bill will either introduce into this country a censorship of magazines, because they will be inciting people to break the law in which case all of those magazines will be banned, or we will develop a large mail order business, so large that neither the Post Office nor the Customs and Excise will be able to censor it adequately.</P>
    <P>We should have confined ourselves to the core problem which was those videos which use appalling scenes of human dismemberment or of violence against people or animals.  That was what we wanted to do and that is what we should have confined ourselves to.  There are other aspects of the Bill which go too far. I do not think we should allow people to make video films in this country which we, as a people, would find repulsive and say simply: &ldquo;Because you are not going to pollute the minds of the Irish people with them, we are going to let you go ahead.&rdquo;  It is quite true that obscene, erotic pornography is already illegal because the activities involved would be prohibited under the law.  But in the making of films which depict explicit and brutal violance, given that by and large with the exception of the more appalling ones they are made by simulating them, there would be no offence.  The offence is the actual production of a video which suggests, or encourages, or depicts appalling violence.  We are going to allow people to make those.</P>
    <P>I do not have any great views, under the normal film censorship laws, about discouraging people from making films. By and large, films made in this country are made by reputable film companies using large resources and they do not get involved in pornography.  But video recordings, by the nature of the simplicity of the technology, can be made on a shoestring.  We are, therefore, saying to people who want to make backyard pornography that they can do it, provided <Col N="1970" /> they ship it across the Border and sell it in Northern Ireland.  If people want to make explicit violent videos on a shoestring budget, which can be done because video technology is so cheap, and ship them across the Border, there is no prohibition. We discussed this at length but that was the final conclusion we came to. If we believe these things are inherently evil we should prohibit them from being made here.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I regret the fact that the Bill contains no prohibition on child pornography and the sale of such video recordings.  I have no time and I believe there is no room for any value judgment about the word &ldquo;obscenity&rdquo;.  I appreciate that I have broken my promise and have slipped away from the contents of the Bill.  I will stop there and then.  I will not pursue that line any further.</P>
    <P>My objection to the Bill is on two grounds.  I think the impact of this legislation on cinema censorship will be far more profound than the Minister believes.  I cannot argue with the Minister but I think he is wrong and I think his advice is wrong.  Secondly, on the issue of video nasties, if they are as bad as we all agree they are, we should not allow anybody to make them here.</P>

      <P>First, the broad principles which cover this Bill are those enshrined in the censorship of films and publications.  I do not think Senator Ryan should have any fears in that regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan made a point about the same type of material being available to the cinema and in video form.  There may be some doubt about that.  As I understand the technology it is quite simple and practical from an economic point of view to cut a film for cinema purposes, but it is extremely difficult to do that in video form.  In that sense you are likely to have a cut version available to film goers which would not be available in video form.  It is a matter of technology which I do not want to go into too deeply but that is my understanding and the advice that is available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan made other points which <Col N="1971" /> were threshed out here on the last occasion.  I know he is quite genuine in the point he raised in relation to material being manufactured here which we would not allow to be presented to the public. Therefore, he sees a certain freedom. Our general view about that is that, for instance, material which would be for sale in France, or some other place, would be governed by their own regulations. We have no way of policing that, so that it is not an area where we feel a major contribution can be made.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the points raised.  I thank the Senators for their support in the passage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>This amendment was moved and we were in the middle of a debate on it the last time we discussed this Bill.  The proposal is that the words &ldquo;the application is not made in contemplation or in furtherance of a trade dispute&rdquo; be deleted.  The Government's view is that an application for a disclosure order cannot be made in the interests or contemplation of furtherance of a trade dispute.  I object to the Government's position on this.  The reason I am opposed <Col N="1972" /> to that remaining in the Bill is the basic one which I have discussed a number of times in this House.  It has its genesis in this general view that the workers and the union representing the workers have no interest except in wrecking the company. Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
      <P>Over the last period of years, we have seen more and more interest shown by workers, and workers' representatives, in access to information and disclosure of information for the very best and most practical purposes.  Very often this kind of information may be sought in the middle of a dispute.  Somebody has to make a judgment on contemplation of furtherance of a trade dispute.  Very often disputes take place because of lack of information.  I am opposed to taking a decision here which seems to indicate or imply that the worker, or those representing the worker in a trade dispute will, in some sense, have less than the best interests of the company at heart.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This paragraph was inserted in subsection (5) as a safeguard clause.  The thinking was, first, that these provisions are part of company law and that the use of them should be confined to real company law situations.  We felt that company law should not be concerned with trade disputes, which should really be governed by labour legislation.  There is legislation on trade disputes and we felt that any action taken by employees in the context of such a dispute should be governed by such laws.  Secondly, we felt that the right of employees to seek an order is clearly provided for in section 83 (6) under which, being actual or contingent creditors they would qualify as applicants for an order.  Thus the section would not restrict the right of employees to find out, in the normal course of events, who controls the company which employs them.  What the Bill is saying, in effect, is that beyond this normal right to know, the mechanism in this part should not be capable of being used to further the aims <Col N="1973" /> of employees in the context of an industrial dispute, for example, by embarrassing or harassing the company or tying up the resources of the company in litigation, and so on.</P>

That needs to be stated clearly because, if the worker in the company has a financial interest in the company, which is beyond doubt, does that mean that the workers, and, therefore, the workers' representatives can seek a disclosure order? I just want to get that clear before discussing trade disputes again.  I want to clarify that point first.</P>

      <P>As a worker he is entitled to get this information by way of court order.  The Minister said that if it is in the furtherance of a trade dispute, labour legislation already governs that but that, as an employee of a company, he is considered to have a financial interest and can have a court order asking for information to be made available provided it does not further a dispute.  In the overall interest of these matters and their knowledge of what is happening in the company, there is nothing in this section to preclude them from getting that information. That is what the Minister is saying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that point has been clarified.  It is unfortunate that a worker was not put in there in his own right.  Had I known that the Minister was so clear on it I would certainly have put that down as an amendment.  I do not know whether that can be considered at a later date but I will certainly give some consideration to that point.  Regarding the fact that a worker may have this information we are now saying that the worker or the workers' representative may not seek this application &ldquo;in contemplation or in furtherance of a trade dispute.&rdquo;  Let us look at the two phrases &ldquo;in contemplation of&rdquo; and &ldquo;in furtherance of&rdquo;.  I have difficulty with both.  I have difficulty with &ldquo;in contemplation of&rdquo; because I am not sure that would be interpreted.  I have no clear view on how a court or anybody else could decide.  What are the guidelines in deciding whether or not it is in contemplation of a trade dispute?</P>
      <P>For instance, in my own position in a representative capacity in a teachers' union I seek all information, statistical and otherwise, about the running of the particular section of education with which I am closely involved.  I always want to have that information because I would not consider being in dispute with anybody until I knew everything about whatever was going on.</P>
      <P>This is counterproductive in many senses.  Very often when information becomes available the reason for a dispute actually evaporates.  Information has always been power.  Very often the non-disclosure of information causes more problems than the actual information which it is sought to keep secret. I cannot understand how a judgment would be made that a disclosure was sought only in contemplation of a trade dispute.  I would like to have some indication of what that means.  I do not think it makes any sense at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other phrase is &ldquo;or in furtherance of a trade dispute&rdquo;.  Can the Minister explain what that means?  Does that mean the resolution of a trade dispute?  Does it mean the heightening of tension in a trade dispute?  Is that what &ldquo;furtherance&rdquo; means?  For instance, if people said: &ldquo;We <Col N="1975" /> are facing into industrial action next week but perhaps if we had this information that action could be deferred!&rdquo;, would that information be seen as &ldquo;in furtherance of a trade dispute&rdquo;?  What I am attempting to make clear is that this legislation shows a very old-fashioned and, indeed, archaic approach to industrial relations and disputes because it goes back to the old days of seeing the workers and the bosses of the factory as being totally and completely and always at loggerheads with each other.</P>
    <P>The time has now come when trade disputes are being resolved more and more without recourse to industrial action.  This has been achieved not only through people meeting and negotiating around the table but by people actually sitting down and discussing the affairs of the company or the workplace and making the case, on both sides of the table, about the financial arrangements or the financial implications of a particular matter.  Therefore, it is actually in the interests of the State and very often in the interests of good industrial relations in the company that they should have access to information.</P>
    <P>Finally &mdash; and I put this question deliberately &mdash; can the Minister give me some indication of the kind of information which would be seen as being dangerous in the event of a trade dispute?  Let us say there is a possibility of a trade dispute in a company and the workers make application for a disclosure order for certain kinds of information; can the Minister explain to me how that would cause a problem either for the factory, the workplace, the owners or the proprietors? Explain to me in simple lay person's terms what is the protection here.  I do not see any protection here for the proprietor or the owner of the company, or for the worker.  I am not sure in whose interest it is.  Perhaps I misunderstand the kind of information that needs to be hidden.  We mentioned on the Order of Business today the Freedom of Information Bill.  Access to information resolves disputes and problems.  I cannot think what kind of information <Col N="1976" /> we would be trying to keep secret here. Perhaps I am very naïve but I cannot think of a set of figures or facts which it would be in anybody's interest to keep secret.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that this section is out of place in company law as against being dealt with adequately in labour legislation.  There could be legitimate reasons why employees would seek a disclosure order during a trade dispute. For example, the company may decide to change its ownership overnight and set up another company.  This is information which an employee would want to have at the time of a dispute.  This could happen.  I agree with Senator O'Toole that 99 times out of 100 the dispute is legitimate, but there is always the once in 100 when the dispute could be devious.</P>
      <P>I can understand on the other hand, why private companies in particular, may not want to be dragged through the courts during disputes.  The other thing I would be a little bit afraid of is: would it be a kind of standard practice that as soon as a dispute is called people would say: &ldquo;Let us request the disclosure order&rdquo;.  As the owner of a private company, I would be a little afraid that during a trade dispute, this would become a standard weapon, that a disclosure order would be the first thing on the agenda and in the case of a family company: &ldquo;Let us see who the shareholders are.  Let us get it all out in the open.&rdquo;  As I say, there are two sides to it.  I can see both sides and I am not sure which side I should come out in favour of.  Personally, as the owner of a private company, I would like it to be left to the discretion of the court to implement the disclosure order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to thank the Minister for, in his earlier reply, at least confirming that an employee is considered to have a financial interest in the company and may, in fact, go to court and have a disclosure order made.  Then we went on to qualify that right which a worker has.  He cannot do that in the furtherance of or contemplation of a trade dispute because <Col N="1977" /> existing labour law, the Minister said, protects us in that area.  If we follow that to its natural conclusion, it brings us to the dilemma Senator Mulroy and Senator O'Toole have and Senator Ryan now has about the area of information workers or a single employee, even if he is the shop steward, would have in any company. Companies in the public sector are privileged because there is a system whereby members can have their worker's representatives on boards and can have certain information available to them.</P>
      <P>We were talking about private registered companies in which employees have no rights whatsoever except what is meted out to them or is discussed or negotiated by their trade unions.  One of the bits of information a shop steward might require from a private company is their ability or otherwise to meet a demand made by their members.  If, in contemplation of a strike, the information was not available to them for that reason, that could possibly lead to a strike.</P>
      <P>I think the point Senator O'Toole is making is, that there would have been no need for a strike if the full information was available and on the table.  Our experience is that workers and their representatives are responsible people and it does not pay the unions or, indeed, their members to call strikes for no reason.  We have been hoping that legislation dealing with companies and their responsibilities to their workers would include this, that they would be responsible enough to ensure that the fullest possible information was available to trade unions, trade union representatives and individual workers.  That is why I am sorry they are excluded from the groups who could, in fact, make an application to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not be unduly worried because there is a second section which makes it obligatory that the court must be satisfied as to who will pay for this process.  This will eliminate frivolous applications to the court and should be sufficiently strong.  But to put it in makes it in some way a sin almost for workers even in contemplation of or even trying to avoid <Col N="1978" /> a dispute to seek the necessary information. Somehow or other they are precluded from getting the information. Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position?  We want to be sure what we are doing in this area because it is a big Bill.  It is a complicated Bill and we want to make sure it is right in every respect. It is our view that workers have as many rights as anybody else in respect of legislation which affects their conditions of employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment needs to be seen, as Senator Ferris saw it, in the context of the section.  The section has to do with disclosure orders and a disclosure order involves any person whom the court believes to have or to be able to obtain any information as to persons interested at present or at any time during a period specified in the order in the shares or debentures, the names and addresses of any of those persons, the name and address of any person who acts or has acted on behalf of any of those persons in relation to the shares or debentures, to give such information to the court not later than the date specified in the order or a section.</P>
      <P>It is very specific kind of information. Any person who has a financial interest in a company may apply to the court for a disclosure order in respect of all or any of the shares.  So, it is a person who has an interest who may seek a disclosure order.  The section than goes on to define &ldquo;financial interest&rdquo; and uses a phrase which is so rich that I have never seen it before in legislation.  The word that caught my fancy was &ldquo;co-adventurer&rdquo;.  I presume there must be a legal precedent for this but I have never seen it before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having defined it like that, the section goes on to say &ldquo;an application shall be supported by such evidence as the court may require&rdquo;.  That is an enormously sweeping range of judgments to be offered to the court &mdash; such evidence as they may require.  I do not think anybody need anticipate that the Irish courts will be springing to the defence of the trade <Col N="1979" /> unions by allowing them to make frivolous applications for information for no particular reason.</P>
    <P>Then the court may require the applicant to give security for payment of the costs of hearing.  The costs of a hearing like this are not going to be numbered in hundreds of pounds.  No significant member of the Bar I know of would be involved in an action like this for anything less than what could be counted in thousands of pounds.  Anybody who goes looking for this information will literally have to put his or her money where his or her mouth is and secure the costs of the action.  Having put all of those obstacles in the way &mdash; and they are probably reasonable so as to prevent a series of frivolous applications for disclosure orders &mdash; the procedure then goes on to exclude &mdash; and this is where Senator O'Toole's amendment comes in &mdash; an application which is not made in contemplation or in furtherance of a trade dispute.</P>
    <P>As I said the last day, &ldquo;in furtherance of a trade dispute&rdquo; could be re-written for instance to refer to giving one side of a trade dispute an unfair advantage which might well be a matter which the court may want to adjust but the words are &ldquo;in contemplation of a trade dispute&rdquo;.  Trade unions, if they are to be effective, must always have the reserve weapon of a trade dispute.  Perhaps, as many people say, it is the threat of industrial action that is the real weapon of a trade union rather than actual industrial action. Industrial action can often be seen as a failure by one side or the other and possibly by both sides.  Since a trade union must always reserve its right to use industrial action to achieve anything it wishes where there is a dispute with an employer virtually any information sought by a trade union can be interpreted or could be interpreted as being in contemplation of a trade dispute.  Consequently it seems to me that that small section could either be deleted entirely or could be re-written.</P>
    <P>In the submission some of us received from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the sardonic comment was that section <Col N="1980" /> 83 seemed to have more to do with preventing disclosures than with facilitating disclosures.  There are so many obstacles along the way which a person has to get over in terms of proof and securities that the sticking at the tailend of what looks like a gratuitous reference to a trade dispute seems to me to be simply justifying somebody's ideological perspective of the role of trade unions.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that in the Explanatory Memorandum on section 83 no reference is made to the prohibition of information being disclosed in contemplation or in furtherance of a trade dispute.  It is as if the little subsection did not really exist. The people who, in my view, have probably the greatest interest in the security and future of a company are its employees.  It is very doubtful that anybody other than the direct openly identified owner of a company, has as much interest in the success of the company as the person whose daily or weekly income depends on the success of the company.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has invested money in the company arguably has interests in other areas and, therefore, his or her future may not necessarily be on the line, but the future of virtually every employee in a company is on the line if a company is not successful.  Therefore, the financial interest, if not paramount, is equivalent to that of the owners of the company.  To exclude them by a vaguely worded clause like that from seeking what is legitimately information which they are legitimately concerned about seems to be something that was not intended.  If it was intended it was wrong.  If it was not intended, perhaps between now and Report Stage the Government and the Minister could attempt to re-write the section to do what I hope is their intention, to prevent disclosure orders being used to give people an unfair advantage in the course of an industrial dispute.</P>
    <P>There is a legitimate concern that people should not be able to use procedures like this to gain information which would give them an unfair advantage during a dispute.  I do not think anybody imagines that the Irish courts <Col N="1981" /> are going to lean over backwards to facilitate the trade unions.  Therefore, if the sort of wording I suggested were there, it would work.  Unless we can get a commitment from the Minister I will happily support Senator O'Toole's amendment. There are many obstacles there already. Given that most Irish trade unions are far from affluent, far from well off and have a considerable number of industrial disputes going or contemplated at any stage, the frequency with which they will resort to the courts to seek information will not be particularly great because of the commitment of cash that would be involved in obtaining legal expertise and assembling information.  Therefore, I think that paragraph is unnecessary and has no business in company legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled about this. Without being sarcastic, the wording of it seems to be as clear as mud.  Take, for example, &ldquo;contemplation&rdquo;.  If you are contemplating a strike there are agreed procedures laid down.  One wonders what those procedures have got to do with company law.  The contemplation of a strike is in the labour law area.  Regarding &ldquo;furtherance of a strike,&rdquo; obviously a trade union cannot go to the courts once a strike notice has been served and say: &ldquo;We need more information to help us in our bid to win this strike.&rdquo;  It does not add up.  The provision should not be in company law at all.  It is more appropriate to labour law and procedures in industrial democracy.  It upsets the whole concept of a disclosure order by having it placed there.  The words &ldquo;contemplation&rdquo; and &ldquo;furtherance&rdquo; make the paragraph illogical.</P>

Having looked at the section again in the light of the points they have made, I can see clearly that there might be situations where employees could have a bona fide <Col N="1982" /> reason for seeking an order even when there was an on-going trade dispute.</P>
      <P>I am also happy that the court would be able to reject vexatious applications on the just and equitable ground which is inserted in paragraph (a) of the subsection.

By way of background, section 85 (2) amplifies subsection (1) of that section. Subsection (1) gives the court discretion as to the kind of particulars it might require from a person interested in shares who is the subject of a disclosure order. As currently drafted, subsection (2) requires the person concerned to disclose <Col N="1984" /> his identity and current address in all such cases.

      <P>This is essentially a drafting amendment. The intention of subsection (4) is to provide that sections 60 to 71 are to be used to interpret &ldquo;interest in shares&rdquo; for the purposes of this particular Chapter. The term &ldquo;interest in shares&rdquo; appears in a number of places throughout sections 82 to 89.  However, the first problem is that the reference to it in the subsection to section 84 is incorrect.  That section says nothing about interest in shares.  The reference in the subsection should really have been to section 83.  Looking at the <Col N="1985" /> matter more generally, however, sections 83 and 85 are not the only ones in Chapter 4 to refer to interest in shares.  Other sections mention that as well.  The solution in the amendment which we have come up with is to have subsection (4) mention references in this Chapter to persons interested in shares etc., rather than references to &ldquo;section 83 and this section&rdquo;.  It is really a drafting amendment which we think is necessary.</P>

The subsection here really has nothing to do with that, but rather has to do with the information which is subsequently disclosed under that particular order.

My limited understanding of the law is that debentures are not voting shares.  Perhaps the Minister could explain the position to me.  I had a hurried consultation with Senator Robinson last week but she did not clarify it for me. It appears that disclosure orders can be made for persons holding debentures in companies who would not have voting membership of the company.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 106:</P>
      <P>In page 78, before section 88, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>88.&mdash;(1)  An obligation to provide any information imposed on any person by a disclosure order shall be treated as not being fulfilled unless the notice by means of which it purports to be fulfilled identifies him and gives his current address.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where information is given to the court in compliance with the terms of a disclosure order, a prescribed officer of the court shall, unless the court otherwise directs, cause such information to be furnished (in whole or in part as the court may direct) to the applicant and to the company in respect of whose shares or debentures the order was made.</P>
      <P>(3)  In reaching its decision under subsection (2), the court shall have regard to whether the requirements of section 87 have been complied with.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>(Acceptance of this Amendment involves the deletion of section 88 of the Bill).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new section. In page 78 we are deleting lines 19 to 32 in the Bill and we are substituting a new section.  We are proposing to put in this section in place of what is contained in lines 19 to 32.  It has three main objectives. The first one has to do with a related amendment, No. 104, which we have <Col N="1989" /> already made to section 86.  The House will recall that we felt section 86 was not really the proper home for subsection (5) of that section and that its provisions would be more appropriate to this section.</P>
      <P>Turning to the present amendment, therefore, subsection (1) of the new section 88 is what was formerly section 86 (5).  The second aim of the amendment would be turning to subsection (2) of the amendment.  The effect of section 88 as it stands is to bring the information which is supplied to the court under a disclosure order not just to the attention of the company and the original applicant for the order but to the public's attention also.  Any information lodged with the Registrar of Companies is effectively open to public inspection.</P>
      <P>Furthermore the effects of subsections (2) and (3) of the present section 88 would be to further emphasise the public exposure of such information since these subsections would require the company to enter the information, as we know, on a special register which could be inspected by the public generally.  However, the mere fact that the court has agreed that a person with a financial interest in a private company should, in exceptional circumstances, have the right to know who the shareholders of the company are is not in itself a good enough reason for bringing the whole affair into the public domain.  The procedure in this Chapter whereby a person can apply for a disclosure order in the case of a private company on an exceptional basis is generally, in my view, a private one and should, perhaps, remain so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a third aim behind the new section.  The final aim has to do with section 87.  That section requires the applicant for the disclosure order to notify various parties that the court has made an order.  It has, however, been correctly pointed out to me that section 87 contains no sanction for contravention of its provisions.  The usual thing to do in such circumstances would be to create, perhaps, a criminal offence for failing to make the required notification under <Col N="1990" /> section 87.  It struck me that a better way to deal with the matter would be for the courts to take the applicant's compliance with section 87 into account when the court is dealing with the matter.  Thus, for example, if the applicant had not complied with section 87, the court could always withhold the information from that person.  That is what we are trying to do in subsection (3) of the amendment.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for the long introduction but this is a particularly complex aspect.  I wanted to give the House a full explanation of it.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 89.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 107:</P>
      <P>In page 78, lines 39 to 41, to delete from &ldquo;those shares&rdquo; to the end of the subsection and substitute &ldquo;any shares in or debentures of the company concerned held by him shall be enforceable by him whether directly or indirectly, by action or legal proceedings.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section there are three problems which emerged, but I want to tell Senators they are essentially <Col N="1991" /> drafting ones.  First, the words &ldquo;those shares&rdquo; in line 39 do not appear to refer to anything previously said in subsection (1).  Obviously, of course, we are talking here about shares held in the company concerned by the person who fails to comply with the disclosure order.  The first aim of this amendment is to make that clear.</P>
      <P>Secondly, as with earlier amendments to section 85 (1) (b) the reference should be not just to shares but to shares and to debentures.  That is the second reason for the amendment.  The third reason is that the final words of the subsection say that a person who fails to comply with the disclosure order will not be able to enforce any rights attaching to the shares &ldquo;by legal proceedings or otherwise&rdquo;. However, the words used in an identical provision in Chapter 3 of this Part, section 71 (3) are &ldquo;by action or legal proceedings&rdquo;.  In the interests of consistency the wording should be the same in both cases.  They are the three main reasons for what are essentially drafting difficulties.</P>

      <P>I would describe our tourist business as our second largest industry.  I would also describe it as the welcome industry and the Cinderella industry.  It is an industry which can create many jobs.  If we could succeed in encouraging more tourists to come to our country we would be lucky.  It is an important industry.  As a Government we have done everything possible to encourage tourists to visit our country.  We have reduced air fares considerably.  The Swansea-Cork ferry service resumed. This ferry brought many tourists to the south west.  Coming from a county such <Col N="1993" /> as Kerry, which has attracted a large number of tourists, I would like to say a little about the county itself.</P>
      <P>We have every type of amenity in County Kerry.  We have some of the best beaches in the world.  We have the mountains and the lakes.  We have the scenery, which is second to none.  We also have a national park in Killarney with 21,000 acres of land.  This national park is rated third or fourth in the world.  We, in County Kerry, are very proud of it.  We also have some very fine golf courses. There are two golf courses in Ballybunion. It is interesting to note a turnover there of £¼ million last year.  There is a new golf course near Tralee which is very highly rated.  There is also a golf course in Killarney which is well known to all the tourists.  We also have substantial sport complexes in County Kerry.</P>
      <P>We had a big increase in the number of tourists last year due to the fact that our Government succeeded in bringing down air and sea fares.  Petrol vouchers were given to British holiday makers.  We allocated £1 million to promote activities to encourage more tourists into the county.  This county received revenue last year from our tourist business of £721 million.  That is an increase of £72 million since 1986.  We succeeded in encouraging 2½ million tourists to visit our country in 1987.  This year our Government are spending £4 million extra to promote and encourage tourism.  The future promises existing developments in tourism.  The Government have given encouragement and support to meet the needs of the industry.  We hope it gets the same support from the people involved in the tourist business and from those in industry as well.  Everybody can play a part.  I hope our Government will encourage all sectors of Irish life to support them in their effort to encourage more tourists to visit our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte should be decentralised and personnel from Bord Fáilte sent to every county which is interested in tourists. Tourism promoters should work very closely with county councils.  They should be prepared to take instruction <Col N="1994" /> from the county manager and the elected members of the council.  A tourist officer for a county should go out and sell and promote the whole county and all aspects of the tourist attractions in that county.</P>
    <P>The hotels and guesthouses which have done well in my county are those whose owners went abroad and sold their business directly to the customer.  One hotel in County Kerry, owned by continentals sent their agent to Dublin to encourage Dubliners and top executives to come to Kerry during the winter period.  They did very well in this promotional effort.  The first package tour from America came to County Kerry in 1895.  The attractions of Ireland as a tourist destination are our scenery, people, culture and the amenities we have to offer.  Because of the variable climate Ireland has never been and will never be part of the mass tourism sun-seeking culture.  The variety of attractions means that it is less likely to fall victim to change in fashion, as has happened to some summer holiday destinations or to suffer the widespread environmental damage which some such countries have experienced.</P>
    <P>Ireland's natural attractions are well known.  It has hundreds of miles of safe and sandy beaches, beautiful scenery, accessible countryside and the largest island waterway in these islands.  These lead to outdoor pursuits like boating, cruising, fishing, horse-riding, golf and other sports.  It also makes Ireland an attractive destination for the motorist.</P>
    <P>Other things which attract tourists to our country are our national monuments. We have castles dating back to the 4th century.  In County Kerry, we have castles dating back to the 15th century. One thing which has done a great deal for our tourist business in County Kerry is &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter,&rdquo; a film made in County Kerry.  It did more to promote County Kerry than Bord Fáilte would do in 12 months.  The scenery was so good in that film that foreigners came in very big numbers to Ireland to see the place where &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo; was made.  As Senators know quite well, this was made in the Dingle Peninsula.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we provide <Col N="1995" /> tourist guides.  Some should be provided by Bord Fáilte and some by our hotels and guesthouse owners.  Many of the tourists who come to Ireland to see our country never see the best parts as they do not have a guide to show them around properly.  Our county councils should have a special tourist officer to deal with tourism and to be responsible to the elected members of the council and, indeed, to the manager as well.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a compliment to our hotel and guesthouse owners &mdash; country guesthouses, farm guesthouses and town guesthouses.  They have done a tremendous job but they should reduce their charges, especially our hotels.  I met a guesthouse owner recently who was in Florida on holidays.  She said she wondered how any Americans came to Ireland because holidays are so cheap in Florida.  That means we should control our prices and ensure that our hotels, guesthouses and restaurants are not overcharging. We should do our utmost to keep our hotel prices down.  Our car hire firms should reduce their charges as well. Our restaurants should watch their prices and make sure to serve all Irish food in their restaurants.  Every hotel and restaurant should serve a glass of good, rich Irish milk with every substantial meal. This would mean so much to our dairy farmers and to our co-operative societies. Hotels and restaurants are always pushing wine which is imported.  Why not push an Irish product like milk?</P>
    <P>CERT has done an excellent job in training our young people.  One could pick out a CERT trained person in a hotel or restaurant.  Tourism creates so many jobs.  All of us should work together and try to encourage as many tourists to come to our country as we possibly can.  Everyone benefits from a vibrant tourist business.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by saying that everybody in this country should work together to encourage our tourist business, as it is the second biggest industry in the country.  If we worked hard enough at it, it could surpass our agricultural <Col N="1996" /> business and become our main industry in the near future.</P>

      <P>As this is a very important debate and many colleagues are anxious to get in with the agreement of the House I should like to share my time with my colleagues, Senator Daly and Senator Ferris.  The three of us would like to be at an important CPP meeting at 7 p.m.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to speak about the tourist industry this spring without first of all recalling and paying tribute to the great work of the late P.V. Doyle, whose significant contribution to the tourism industry will be difficult to follow.  Not just his work as an entrepreneur in providing a magnificent string of hotels but his leadership but also his work as chairman of Bord Fáilte made a great contribution over the past number of years. He has left us his impressive hotel group and excellent standards, from the conservatory in the Berkeley Court to Charlie's Coffee House in the Westbury.  I do not wish to encroach on the area of our colleague, Senator Norris, in saying that the excellent value and cuisine offered in these places are within the scope of the ordinary Irish citizen as well.  I would not like to comment on the standard of accommodation because I have not got personal knowledge of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish tourist industry, while having the benefit and encouragement of State bodies such as Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus and CIE, is essentially a private sector industry.  I hope both sectors can work together in the interest of the economy and the country as a whole.  We can examine and admire what entrepreneurs like the late P.V. Doyle and Jim White, a former Oireachtas colleague, have achieved in their own areas.  For instance, look what has been achieved in resurrecting Lisdoonvarna in the Burren country over a very short few years.  What a service Jim White has provided there. Our former colleague has done a marvellous job in revitalising an ancient and traditional holiday resort.  I hold the view that, if it can be done in one part of the <Col N="1997" /> country, it should certainly be tackled and boosted in every other part of it.</P>
    <P>In Bray, for example, which is a very important seaside resort adjacent to perhaps nearly half the population of the country, obviously the restoration of the esplanade is something which the private sector cannot easily tackle.  I hope the Minister for Tourism and Transport and his colleagues in the Department of the Environment and the Office of Public Works will provide adequate capital to assist that important progressive town to recapture the tourist industry it had over so many decades, especially in the earlier part of this century.  I look forward to an effort being made by the State agencies and by the various Departments to boost the infrastructure where it is required to ensure that Irish people wishing to have a varied holiday at home can have it.</P>
    <P>In the past year the most significant of all the improvements in the tourist industry, perhaps, came as a result of yet another private sector company &mdash; a small company called Ryanair &mdash; who have revitalised the entire travel industry. I was rather taken aback two Sundays ago when I saw our semi-State body, Aer Lingus, using and introducing a sort of American type negative advertising in direct competition with this small company. Since the introduction of Ryanair into the market, I read in some journal that the traffic on the Dublin-London route had increased by 65 per cent since the introduction of competition and that fares had fallen by 54 per cent.  It is a pity that Aer Lingus, our State body, do not reduce the fares on the other routes where they have no competition from the Irish private sector.</P>
    <P>If we take, for example, Dublin-London, the distance to Heathrow is 285 nautical miles and there the cheapest Aer Lingus fare is £63.  Before May 1986 their cheapest fare was £209.  Since the competition it has fallen significantly.  If we take, for instance, the routes without competition, there is the Dublin-Leeds route which is only 189 nautical miles and the Aer Lingus fare is still £204; Dublin-Glasgow, 188 miles, £204; Dublin-East <Col N="1998" /> Midlands, 205 miles, £204; and Dublin-Paris, 490 miles, £448.  It is very difficult to see why Aer Lingus cannot give the travellers on the other routes the same facilities they are able to offer where there is Irish competition.  I should like to develop that argument still further.  I should also like to hear the views of my colleagues with whom I have agreed to share this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I will try to be brief to facilitate my colleague, Senator Daly.  Many of us in tourist counties have an interest in tourism.  Senator McEllistrim dealt with Kerry.  As my grandfather came from Kerry I have to agree with everything he said.  I live in County Tipperary in the heart of the Golden Vale.  It is known internationally by name.  The Minister of State knows it now, having been at a recent launch by Tipperary Tourism Council of their programme for the year named &ldquo;Take in Tipperary&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A lot of excellent work has been done in various counties through the county development teams, county councils and sub-committees of councils which have specialised in promoting tourism.  Bord Fáilte's assistance in this has been appreciated.  Any improvement to streamline Bord Fáilte is to be welcomed. They have made a major input into the tourist industry.  Indeed, hotels and guesthouses have applied themselves to the problem not alone of accommodating tourists but of giving them good value, and that is to be commended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Minister, Deputy Wilson, has a particular interest in this brief and, in particular, since his change of portfolio he has made a major, significant contribution to improving the tourist trade through innovative changes in air fares assisted, of course, by our Commissioner, Mr. Peter Sutherland, who has spearheaded the whole concept of opening up the airways to legitimate competition and ensuring that the piece of water which divides Ireland from the rest of the Continent was not, as it had been, the most expensive piece of water in the world to cross by air.  All those <Col N="1999" /> initiatives are to be welcomed.  Indeed, the Taoiseach has applied himself in a personal way in the setting up of a task force to which we look for improvements also in the tourism area.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about tourism councils, like Tipperary Tourism Council who specialised in sending experts abroad out of their own funds in order to stimulate an interest in specialised interests like golfing and hunting, both of which are adequately catered for in south Tipperary.  They were assisted by hotels which sent out delegations to convince continental visitors that they should come to Ireland and, indeed, to Tipperary for fishing.</P>
    <P>A brochure was published which is named &ldquo;Tipperary South &mdash; River Angling&rdquo; at tremendous private expense. A team was selected to go abroad to sell the county with the co-operation of all the angling clubs in south Tipperary &mdash; the Ara Anglers, Ardfinnan Anglers, Ballymacarbry Tourist Association, Cahir and District Anglers' Association, Carrick-on-Suir Angling Association, Cashel/Golden/Tipperary Angling Club, Clonmel and District Salmon and Trout Anglers' Association, Clonmel and District Anglers' Club, Newcastle Angling Club and Thurles, Holycross and Bally-macas Anglers' Association.  All those people contributed in some way to stimulate tourists to come here for fishing. Then the Government suddenly decided to change the availability of free trout fishing in the area.  It has devastated the clubs.  It has stopped the programme.</P>
    <P>It gives me no joy to put it on the record that, in the past couple of days, the Minister received from the Chamber of Commerce a letter which said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been brought to our notice that the fishing facilities being supplied to tourist anglers by the 12 angling clubs on the enclosed brochure are being withdrawn immediately due to the imposition of a rod licence.</P>
    <P>We are all well aware of the need to promote and develop tourism in this country and of the benefits that such <Col N="2000" /> development will have for the economy. The withdrawal of this facility will be disastrous for this area.</P>
    <P>We earnestly request you to rescind the imposition of rod licence for the year 1988 and to enter into immediate negotiations with the relevant angling interests for the development of the inland fishing industry for the good of angling and tourism.</P>
    <P>Copies have been sent to Deputy Daly, Minister for the Marine and also to the Chambers of Commerce in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I understand that Senator Daly does not want to avail of the last couple of minutes left, so I will develop the point. Until such time as the Government and the Minister for the Marine can prove to fishing interests that they intend to tackle the problem of restocking of rivers, control of pollution and all the other incidentals which affect fishing and the quality of fishing, there is no justification whatsoever for the imposition by the Government of a rod licence for trout fishing.  It is only because of the dedication of clubs like those I have put on the record of the House and with the work they have done over the years in this area, and because of their dedication to trout fishing as a tourist attraction, that continental visitors are attracted to this country.  The Government have done nothing in this area.</P>
    <P>There have been statements from the Minister for the Environment and calls on local authorities to be more diligent in the control of pollution.  There is resentment because it is an imposition when we know that nothing has been done by Governments in the past.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ask the Government to rethink this.  These are a peaceful group of people who want to be involved in assisting us.  They are willing to sit down and work out some kind of plan which will assist us in the future.  The State should have some responsibility in the area of trout angling.  The Minister of State will find them most co-operative.</P>
    <P>He knows the spirit of enthusiasm in Tipperary for the development of tourism. He was present when we launched <Col N="2001" /> our programme in the shadow of the Rock of Cashel which was visited and seen by Presidents on their recent State visits.  It is a place that is dear to my heart. If we can try to sell our own county with very little assistance from the State, the State should listen to the plea from angling and fishing clubs in regard to the anomaly that has now arisen in the middle of a promotional drive which has cost a lot of money and which will now be withdrawn unless the Government change their mind.  We will all support anything else involving tourism because we are all keen to attract visitors.  We are hoping the Government will rethink this matter which otherwise will have a detrimental effect on tourism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Motion.  I would like to reiterate the sentiments expressed by Senator McDonald in paying tribute to the late P.V. Doyle and the tremendous work he did on behalf of tourism.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the Motion I congratulate the Minister and the Government on the initiatives taken last May in relation to air fares to encourage the throughput of tourists.  Getting people to come on holiday to this country is exactly the same as exporting products to other countries.  Getting people to holiday at home is exactly the same as import substitution. The reality of that must be made clear to all our people at home. These packages introduced by the Minister provided a wide range of reliable and regular transport services at the lowest economic cost, as has been mentioned by a number of speakers already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent announcements in relation to air services with Britain are even more liberal than the provisions of the EC package which was announced earlier in the year.  The fact that tourism has been identified by the Government as one of the key targets for sectoral development requires a reorientation of transport policy to serve tourism.  It requires the industry itself to adapt accordingly.  In recent years Irish residents holidaying abroad have spent more money than incoming tourists spent in <Col N="2002" /> this country.  That must be put into perspective. A small country with a population of approximately 3½ million people has spent more money on holidaying abroad than the rest of the world has spent on holidaying in Ireland.  This shows the enormous potential for development of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The figures released by An Bord Fáilte indicated, as has already been mentioned, that over £720 million was generated by over two million visitors in 1987.  This represents record earnings for the Irish tourist industry.  According to An Bord Fáilte those results are attributable in large measure to the initiatives taken by the Government in relation to transport, to reduce the cost of air and sea travel and also to reduce the cost of accommodation.</P>
    <P>Revenue from US visitors in 1987 was £173 million, or 24 per cent more than in 1986, according to An Bord Fáilte's statistics.  The same statistics show that revenue from British visitors increased by 16 per cent to £200 million.  I was quite interested to read a report in today's newspapers on the <i>Which</i> magazine which did a survey on tourism.  In general, the results it arrived at were favourable to Ireland and outlined the tremendous tourist attractions we have.  It exploded myths in many areas as to the reason many more visitors do not come to this country.  We have fantastic natural resources at our disposal.  We were endowed by nature with magnificent facilities and it must be said that in the past we did not do enough to explore the possibilities of making the best use of them.</P>
    <P>The figures mentioned for 1987 are encouraging.  They prove that the potential is there for the tourist industry, given the right approach and the proper type of structures to exploit the advantages peculiar to different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Some other speakers mentioned the advantages their particular counties have in attracting tourists.  It is fair to say that each county is unique in its own way.  The reaction even of our own people who visit places in Ireland for the first time is amazing.  They are very pleasantly surprised at the amenities and the wonderful <Col N="2003" /> tourist facilities which are available in those areas.</P>
    <P>The case for restructuring tourism on a regional basis stems from the fact that no single region dominates the Irish tourist industry.  The benefits of tourism are relatively well dispersed throughout the country and the statistics available from An Bord Fáilte for 1987 bear this out. The revenue generated from tourism in the Dublin area last year was £126 million; in the east coast area it was £70 million; in the south-east £83 million.  Cork and Kerry generated £154 million; the mid-west region generated £59 million; the west generated £92 million; the north-west generated £60 million and the midlands £45 million.  Those statistics come from An Bord Fáilte.  They bear out the fact that no particular section of the country has a monopoly in relation to tourism.</P>
    <P>The importance of tourism differs widely from region to region and even within regions.  Some speakers have already mentioned that Kerry is much more dependent on tourism as a source of income than Dublin which has a much broader base of manufacturing and service industry from which to generate wealth and employment.  The wide dispersal of tourism earnings and the relative dependence in some regions on tourism earnings lead to the question of how best to organise an effective tourist industry.  The present organisation of the industry is relatively centralised with An Bord Fáilte doing most of the important marketing and development work on a national basis.  In the meantime, the regional tourism organisations have remained largely as centres for disseminating information for tourists and making accommodation bookings on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The regional tourism organisations have mostly been starved of the resources to develop effective marketing programmes or to play a key role in tourism product development in their own regions.  We are talking about product development and packaging.  We have a fantastic product but we must package <Col N="2004" /> that product and market it effectively. That is where we have been falling down in the past.</P>
    <P>The consequences of our centralised approach to the organisation of the tourist industry are far from beneficial.  As the Price Waterhouse report on the tourist industry noted, Ireland has been losing the market share in our most important producing countries for the past ten years.  The Taoiseach said at a recent tourist industry forum that this loss of market share has cost the country in the region of £500 million of lost revenue from tourism.  Clearly, our centralised approach to tourism has not been producing the desired results.  There is, therefore, a strong case for making a less centralised approach to the organisation of the industry.  This is particularly so in the important area of product development. Different regions throughout the country have different strengths as tourist attractions.  I suggest that Dublin's appeal as a tourist centre revolves around its historical importance as our capital city.</P>
    <P>As Senator McEllistrim mentioned already, Killarney's appeal is based on its famous scenery.  Senator Ferris mentioned Tipperary and I think I should put in a plug for my own part of that county. Tipperary is a beautiful place to live, both north and south.  I do not like to be sectional in these areas but we hope that, when we win the All Ireland next year, the whole county will be behind us not just one part of the county.  The appeal of the county lies in its diverse range of attractions including the tranquil waters of the beautiful Lough Derg we have in North Tipperary and the numerous onshore villages, one of which Terry-glass, I am very proud to say, in recent times won the overall national Tidy Towns Award which was a tremendous achievement.  On the other hand as Senator Ferris said, we have the magnificence of the Rock of Cashel, Holy Cross and Ballyporeen which is in the news on fairly regular occasions.</P>
    <P>By allowing each region and sub-region to build on its strengths we can increase significantly the overall appeal of the Irish tourism product.  We can do this by giving <Col N="2005" /> the regional tourism organisations a bigger role in tourist product development. This can be done by transferring money and manpower from Bord Fáilte headquarters to the regional tourist organisations and by encouraging them to attract private sector investment in new and existing tourism products.  A strong regional commitment to improving tourism products should encourage the kind of public and private sector partnership which is urgently needed.</P>
    <P>The first step is to strengthen the hand of the regional tourism organisations by giving them more resources through transference from Bord Fáilte.  In the marketing area we need to be more circumspect. Bord Fáilte should remain the national marketing agency for overseas tourism to maintain a unified image of the country in foreign markets.  There has to be room for greater regional presence in overseas tourism promotions.  Senator Ferris mentioned this also.  For example, the Midlands is the country's foremost fishing region.  A representative of the region who knows the fishing product thoroughly should be encouraged and financed by Bord Fáilte to spend time promoting the fishing products overseas where there is a clear potential for attracting fishermen to Ireland.</P>
    <P>This example could be extended to all regions.  Our objective ought to be to emphasise our strengths in overseas markets by building on our strong regional base.  There is a strong case for letting our regional tourism organisation become much more involved in marketing their tourism products in the domestic market.  Domestic holidays have been stagnant in recent years and on a number of occasions Bord Fáilte put this down to the recession.  At the same time, Irish people are taking more holidays abroad; so they are spending more money on holidays abroad in spite of the recession.  There must be room to switch from foreign tourism back to the Irish market.  Our approach must be to let the regional tourism organisations promote their regions more aggressively for the Irish tourist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2006" /> Give the RTOs the money and manpower Bord Fáilte currently use to promote home holidays and encourage them to source additional promotional funds from local product suppliers.  As is the case with product development, the strong local commitment should help the regional tourism organisations to generate additional financial support and further work from the local tourism industry.  The potential for tourism is absolutely enormous.  We have not exploited the magnificent potential we have in this country as a tourist attraction. I make a very strong plea to the Minister and the Government to give the regional tourism organisations more say in their product development, more money to promote their product in their own areas and I know that, taking account of the magnificent initiatives taken by the Minister in recent times, the tourist industry will reach record figures in the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons) Denis Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá sé soiléir dom go bhfuil ganntanas ama orainn agus dá bhrí sin déarfaidh mé an méid atá le rá agam chomh tapa agus is féidir liom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to respond to this Motion.  It was with some satisfaction that I noted the Seanad's acknowledgement of the upturn in the Irish tourism industry and of Government efforts to ensure that this upturn is maintained.  No doubt 1987 was a record year for Irish tourism.  For the first time in the industry's history total tourism revenue is estimated to have topped the £1 billion mark.  Over 2.1 million visitors came to Ireland in 1987 and total out-of-State revenue amounted to over £720 million.  This represented an increase of 12 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively, on the previous year.  The domestic market, where preformance in recent years had been disappointing, improved dramatically in 1987 also, with estimated revenue at £290 million.  This represented an increase of 33 per cent on the 1986 performance.  Arising from this improved performance, Bord Fáilte estimate that <Col N="2007" /> 4,000 new jobs were created in the tourism sector in 1987 while a further 3,500 new jobs resulted indirectly from the increase in tourism revenue.</P>
    <P>The improved 1987 performance of Irish tourism did not happen by chance. In their pre-election manifesto, &ldquo;Putting Growth Back Into Tourism,&rdquo; this Government recognised the vast potential of Irish tourism and the fact that this potential was not being realised.  In that document, we pointed out that Irish tourism had lost ground in recent years and that we were not maintaining our market share.  What we said then was underlined subsequently in the Price Waterhouse report on improving the performance of Irish tourism.  This is now widely acknowledged and the same point has been made more forcefully on a number of occasions during this very debate in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the entire community is now focusing attention on the tourism industry and I welcome the response and enthusiasm being expressed.  Immediately on assuming office the Government set about the task of revitalising the industry.  An emergency package of measures was introduced last May designed to boost tourism numbers in 1987 &mdash; a little late but nevertheless very effective.  This involved such action as a reduction in air and sea fares into Ireland and concessions on petrol for British motoring tourists.  It met with a most positive response from within the industry which produced its own package of special incentives for the tourist season.  That was very important.  The Government gave the lead and the industry responded.</P>
    <P>Our 1987 performance is a testimony to the success of this approach.  Let there be no mistake.  This was not a once-off burst of energy on the Government's part.  It was the first step towards the intensive and comprehensive development of the national tourist industry.  It is one of the key planks in the Government's sectoral development policy outlined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  I am pleased that Members of the Seanad share our view that tourism <Col N="2008" /> has the potential significantly to increase its current contribution to the economy by way of jobs and wealth creation.</P>
    <P>Tourism has quite rightly been targeted as a growth area which can provide an extra 25,000 jobs and an additional £500 million in tourism revenue through a doubling over the years of the number of foreign visitors.  These are ambitious targets.  They are, however, realistic and attainable.</P>
    <P>Access transport will be a key element in the Government's strategy for achieving these targets.  Our commitment to improving the range of access transport services, increasing competition and making access fares more competitive was evident from the moment we merged tourism with the crucial area of transport under the one ministry.  The Price Waterhouse report referred to the non-competitiveness of air fares particularly from continental Europe, and of sea fares for motoring tourists from both Europe and the UK.  The House will agree that our policies in the transport area are very quickly addressing these problems as evidenced in the large number of new routes and reduced fares which have been approved since our coming into office. More has yet to be done especially on the continental side and we look forward to a bit more co-operation from France and Germany and further liberalisation and fifth rights for airlines to bring more people to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Recently, a substantial number of further new services by Aer Lingus, Ryanair and Club Air have been approved.  All of this will help the development of competitively priced air services to Ireland from our main markets.  More competitive air access has also brought about a positive response from the sea access carriers who have introduced a broad range of competitively priced fares aimed at boosting car passenger traffic.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon mentioned the dangers of carriers entering into below-cost selling.  I would, of course, be worried about such developments.  However, I can assure the Senator that, when examining fares filed for approval, the Minister operates on the principle that carriers are <Col N="2009" /> expected to charge the lowest possible fares consistent with an adequate service and economic and continuing operation. All fare filings, therefore, are examined critically within my Department to ensure that they are geared towards improving capacity and increasing traffic rather than undermining current services.</P>
    <P>A further indication of the Government's commitment was their decision to allocate an additional £4 million in this year's budget for the introduction of further measures to boost tourism traffic in 1988.  A special advisory group, the &ldquo;task force&rdquo; referred to by Senators in this debate, was established by the Government specifically to bring forward recommendations to the Government on how best to spend these funds for the benefit of Irish tourism in 1988.  This has meant that the group must report as soon as possible to ensure that any recommendations to be implemented could be put in place in good time for this year's tourist season.</P>
    <P>The group have taken on this very demanding task with great enthusiasm and energy and have already met on a number of occasions.  They have received numerous submissions from a wide range of tourism interests.  I would like to acknowledge the interest shown by all those who felt they had something to offer and did so in response to the request for these ideas to be submitted to the committee.  These have been considered along with the large number of recommendations which emanated from the tourism forum convened by Government in January.  I understand that the group are aiming to report their findings to the Government shortly and these will be given immediate consideration.  The Government are acutely aware of the importance of getting any special package of measures for 1988 into the marketplace in good time to allow holiday makers to take them fully into account when determining their holiday destination, or indeed destinations, for this year.</P>
    <P>These pressing time constraints on the work of the special advisory group meant <Col N="2010" /> that they could not possibly contemplate the round of consultations envisaged by Senator McGowan.  Regarding the tourism development in Donegal and the Border counties, since the Senator is the proposer of the Motion and spoke for a half hour on it, I think it is only reasonable that I should reply in some detail to the points he raised.  Apart from reaping the benefits of national and overseas promotional and marketing campaigns and incentive schemes such as the business expansion scheme, this region will also be reaping the benefits of special funding made available specifically for tourism there.</P>
    <P>The board of the International Fund for Ireland has to date allocated £3 million towards the development of tourist amenities in these counties and for the marketing of the area through tour operators in North America.  In addition there is £8 million available in funding from the European Regional Development Fund Special Border Area Programme for the development of tourism in the same region.  A steering group chaired by the Department of Finance has been assigned the task of selecting projects suitable for funding from the large number of submissions already received to date.</P>
    <P>Emphasis in both the IFI and ERDF programmes will be on revenue-generating projects which make a positive net added-value contribution to the local economy and have significant potential for job creation.  Concern was expressed by Senator McGowan last week about the unemployment on both sides of the Border regions.  All in all they represent considerable capital injections for tourism development in the region and should place it in a very strong position when the programmes are complete.</P>
    <P>We are also aware of the opportunity for closer co-operation with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board who have developed a close working relationship with Bord Fáilte in overseas marketing and more recently in developing the tourism programme with the International Fund.</P>
    <P>I now propose to move to the second <Col N="2011" /> point in this Motion which refer to support for a restructuring of Bord Fáilte on a regional basis.  Bord Fáilte are the existing national State body statutorily responsible for the development and marketing of Irish tourism.  They are assisted in carrying out their role by six regional tourism organisations.  SFADCo have responsibility for tourism in the mid-west region covering the counties of Limerick, Clare, North Tipperary and west and south-west Offaly.</P>
    <P>The RTOs have two major tasks: (a) to encourage and promote the development of tourist traffic to their region; and (b) to provide and encourage the provision of tourism amenities, facilities and services for visitors.  Under their memoranda of association they are required to do this in accordance with national policy and overall direction of Bord Fáilte.  Bord Fáilte, who last year provided an average of 50 per cent of the RTOs' budget, have one director on the boards which vary in size from 15-35 directors.</P>
    <P>Here I would like to indicate the widely-held view that these numbers of board directors need examining.  I am at present giving consideration to and having consultations with the industry and all involved in this matter.</P>
    <P>RTOs have a crucial role to play in the development of tourism, especially in the area of product development, as stated by a number of Senators in the course of this debate.  By virtue of their localised structure they are ideally positioned to identify tourism investment opportunities most advantageous for the region, having regard to its natural and cultural heritage, access to tourist markets and capacity to attract and cater for increased visitor numbers.  They also play a promotional role.  They actively promote their regional attractions for the home market.  In so far as overseas marketing is concerned, they organise local industry participation in Bord Fáilte marketing campaigns and, where appropriate, participate themselves, particularly where local knowledge and expertise is vital to the selling of a particular product, e.g. angling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> I am aware of the industry's concern, widely articulated at recent tourism fora, that we should have a more effective regional tourism structure.  Price Waterhouse in their report also stressed the potential of the regions to play a much greater role in the organisation and development of Irish tourism.  They did add, however, that it is essential that their activities are consistent with national tourism development efforts and that there is no wasteful duplication or overlap.</P>
    <P>The Irish tourist industry embraces many small and independent operators. This should be one of our strengths.  At local level there is a wealth of talent, ideas and expertise which, if properly harnessed, can make a significant contribution to the overall development of tourism.  The Government's aim is to ensure that this important source of local expertise is fully exploited.</P>
    <P>It is true that existing institutional structures may not be availing adequately of this expertise or inciting local communities to commit themselves fully to the drive for growth in tourism.  There is a clear need for a strong central executive tourism body to (1) co-ordinate local and regional efforts in product development and, (2) to lead and organise promotional and marketing efforts, especially overseas, where markets are large and often complex.</P>
    <P>The Government are currently reviewing all aspects of State expenditure on national and regional tourism structures. Government strategy is to build up from local to regional to national level and to ensure that the channels of communications encourage a two way flow of information and ideas for the development of the industry.  Public bodies, both at national and regional level, have an important but not exclusive role to play in product development.  However, the private sector have an expertise in relating these products to market demands and packaging them for sale.  It is vital, therefore, that our institutional structures are designed to ensure close co-operation with the tourist industry and to <Col N="2013" /> build up confidence in the industry in order that it can achieve its full potential.</P>
    <P>I found Senator O'Callaghan's comments on the current regional structure very interesting.  I was particularly interested in his comments regarding the failure, in many instances, of local industry to contribute their fair share to the cost of RTO promotional and developmental activities.  There is a strong and growing groundswell of opinion that a leaner, less cumbersome administrative structure, resourced mainly, if not exclusively, from local funding sources is what is required.  Such a structure would better facilitate the more dynamic, creative role, which I know local interests would like to play in tourism development. There is a need, particularly for local businesses and commercial interests who benefit considerably from successful tourism, to contribute to and become more involved in their local RTO.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that a slimmer, more locally funded RTO structure would ensure a more productive and effective utilisation of local resources. There is also a need to ensure that the functions of the RTOs do not overlap with those of Bord Fáilte, the local authorities, other public agencies and the private sector.  As pointed out by various Senators during the debate, there are a large number of agencies whose work impinges directly, or indirectly, on tourism. It is important at local level that each agency knows what its responsibilities encompass.  It is equally important that the RTOs continue to prompt and encourage such agencies to give priority in their work to those aspects of greatest importance for developing the region's tourism potential.</P>
    <P>The recent appointment of a full-time chairman to Bord Fáilte, combining the functions of board chairman and director general for the next five years, reflects the high priority and the urgency which the Government have accorded to the development of tourism.</P>
    <P>I join with the Members who have expressed their appreciation of the tremendous work done by the late P.V. Doyle.  In the course of managing his <Col N="2014" /> own business, he spearheaded and led development in the accommodation sector.  He did tremendous work during his time as chairman of the board.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
    <P>The appointment also presents an ideal opportunity to look at structures, both national and local.  The criteria for the appointment are to be seen as another proof of the Government's determination in this area.  It will be seen that the Government are determined to create the necessary structures to ensure that the vast potential of Irish tourism is fully tapped and, in so doing, eliminate some of the overlapping of the present structures.  We will be addressing the question of appropriate regional structures in our review and I will ensure that the views of the House, as expressed in the course of this debate, receive the fullest consideration.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to thank Senators for their contributions and support.  I acknowledge the desire of many Members to contribute but time constraints prevented them from contributing. I went into top gear as quickly as I could to save time for some Members.  I hope I have done that.  I will remain to hear what other Members have to say.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to contribute to this debate on tourism because it is something I have an interest in.  This side of the House note the upturn in the tourism industry in 1987 but we would say it has little or nothing to do with any action the Government have taken in the past year.  We submit that the upturn in tourism earnings had more to do with increased prosperity in the economies of countries from which we draw our visitors and had little or nothing to do with policies adopted during 1987.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We will examine the statistics. We agree that gross tourism earnings in 1986 were about £865 million, from all tourism including domestic as well as external or out of State tourism. <Col N="2015" /> The provisional figures for 1987 indicate that tourism earnings will go up to over £1 billion, an increase of about 16 per cent.  We agree that is impressive.  Nevertheless we think the Government had the happy accidents of economic upturns in the United States, the value of the dollar <i>vis-a-vis</i> our currency and economic booms in major nations in Europe like the United Kingdom, France and Germany from which we draw many of our tourists.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the true measure of the Government's commitment to tourism. This can be gleaned or garnered by looking at the Book of Estimates for 1988 which makes very interesting reading.  I do not know if my friend across the floor has read the Book of Estimates so far as it relates to tourism.  I might remind him that the administrative estimates for Bord Fáilte for 1988 stand at £16,527,000, down 20 per cent on a figure of £20,727,000 for 1987.</P>
      <P>We all appreciate the need to pare administrative costs and that is a good thing, but one might wonder whether we are going a bit too far here.  Yesterday I attended a tourism council meeting in County Roscommon.  What this means to a county like Roscommon &mdash; and regrettably this will be repeated all over the country &mdash; is that there will be no tourism information offices in the towns of Roscommon or Boyle in 1988.  The same will apply in Counties Sligo, Laois, Offaly, Kerry and Cork.  That is one of the effects of the cutbacks in the administration budget for Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>Under the heading grant-in-aid for the development of holiday accommodation, that is, grant-aids for hotels and registered guesthouses, a basic essential of our tourism industry with a great need for development and improvement, the Government propose to allocate £150,000 in 1988.  In 1987 the previous Government provided £547,000 to that grant fund.  I remind the Minister that grant is down by 73 per cent.</P>
      <P>Under the heading grant-in-aid for the development of supplementary holiday accommodation, that is, for unregistered guesthouses, farm guesthouses, etc., in 1987 the previous Government allocated £383,000.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government pay lip service to making tourism a major industry and one of the major areas of economic growth.  The lie is pinned by the very figures I have quoted in the House. They are incontrovertible.  Nobody can gainsay them because they are in the Book of Estimates which underpins the budget for tourism promotion and development.  The figures are there in black and white.  We admit an additional £4 million was provided in the budget but we do not know where that will go.  We <Col N="2017" /> believe it may go on specialised promotional programmes abroad and I would certainly agree with that.</P>
      <P>Under the heading grant-in-aid for tourism development works in the Book of Estimates there was a very worth while and highly useful grant for tourism promotion. The 1987 Bord Fáilte annual report, which comments on activities in 1986, states that eight coarse and game fishing enterprises, 17 coarse and game fishing festivals and 25 sea angling festivals were aided from that fund in 1986. In addition 13 sea angling boats &mdash; and there was a great shortage of that kind of craft &mdash; were grant-aided to the tune of 20 per cent in 1986.  Eight equestrian establishments got aid.  Nine new regional tourism information offices were opened and one language school was aided out of that fund in 1986.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made on this motion of the restructuring of Bord Fáilte on a regional basis.  We welcome this but we ask for an explanation of what it really means.  Does it mean reducing or reshaping the existing eight regional boards?  This would probably be a good move.  For instance, we ask whether there is a need for a regional tourism board covering all of the east Leinster counties except Dublin, with Dublin having its own regional tourism board.  We agree that Dublin had 1,307,000 visitors in 1986, the second largest number of visits after Cork and Kerry.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator McGowan for giving me a few minutes of his time.  Of course, I will use a few minutes.  I will reply to something my colleague from Kerry, Senator McEllistrim, referred to.  He said the cost of car hire, among other charges, should be cut.  Car hire prices are too high.  Why are they too high?  They are too high because a car that costs £4,000 in the North costs £6,000 in the South. Insurance on a self-drive car in the North costs £150 but it costs £900 in the South. Everything, including road tax, is almost double what it costs in the North.  American travel agents hire cars in a package deal to people coming to Ireland.  They <Col N="2018" /> are doing what is known in the trade as back tracking.  They are hiring the cars through the Northern Ireland car hire people.  The cars are brought into the South where those who have hired them are spending their holidays, and then returned to the North.  The self-drive people in the South are now being deprived of this business.  It was bad enough when their backs were blistered with taxation on the price of the cars, the excise duty and VAT on cars but that is the position now.  I am sorry to have to disillusion Senator McEllistrim.</P>
      <P>When I questioned the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, about the business expansion scheme he said it would not affect car hire but when I questioned Deputy Wilson, Minister for Tourism and Transport about it, he told me it was available to the car hire people and that he would see to it.  Can the Minister say if the car hire firms benefit from the business expansion scheme, in other words, is Deputy Wilson right or is Deputy MacSharry right?</P>

      <P>I want to thank Senator McGowan for giving me this time and I congratulate him on the idea of putting this motion down in the name of Fianna Fáil.  I have just two points to make on the tourism industry here in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 60 per cent of family run hotels have not got the very basic necessity of a bathroom or shower in the bedrooms or with the toilets.  The Minister and the Department should do something about that immediately.  It would improve our building industry and improve the very basic standards of accommodation we all require and which in particular Europeans and Americans demand.  Second, the enormous sums of money spent by Bord Fáilte on marketing Ireland are totally inadequate compared with the marketing budgets of other countries. <Col N="2019" /> However, this money could be saved if Bord Fáilte were to convince the RTE Authority to do what was done in Dallas and Hawaii.  The tourist boards in both of those areas convinced the national television network to call their most popular programmes &ldquo;Hawaii Five-O&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Hawaii Five-O&rdquo; increased the tourist attraction of Hawaii sevenfold after the first two years of transmission.  The programme &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; increased the tourist trade in Dallas by 11 times in the first two years of transmission. &ldquo;Glenroe,&rdquo; the programme with the highest TAM rating ever transmitted by RTE other than the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;, could change its name to &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; with lead-ins to Croke Park, to Bord na Móna, to our farming organisations and to the various things we have to offer in Ireland like the Horse Show. That is my contribution to this tremendous Motion.  I thank Senator McGowan for having tabled it.  It would not cost a penny to market that idea of mine and it would help RTE to sell the TV series everywhere in the world.  It would not cost them a penny more to make it either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was not present for the Minister's response.  I welcome his response to this motion.  It is what I would expect from the Minister.  I have talked to him on numerous occasions and there is no doubt in my mind that he is totally committed to the full development of the tourism industry. I also welcome the initiative he has taken on the rationalisation programme at Government level.  I am glad to see that Bord Fáilte are included in that rationalisation programme.</P>
      <P>The restructuring of Bord Fáilte and any other Department does not depend on a Motion before the Seanad.  Nevertheless the motion gives us an opportunity to express our concern.  We could have had a longer debate and many people would have liked to make a longer contribution.  Nevertheless, it is timely and quite a number of Senators contributed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from County Donegal where <Col N="2020" /> there are big opportunities for greater development of tourism.  It is important to develop tourism.  We have 20,000 young people waiting to get employment and the tourism industry holds out one of our greatest hopes for job creation. We also have one-third of the beaches in the country.  Public representatives have to advocate the development of the tourism industry.  We believe there is a big future in tourism.  Bord Fáilte have done reasonably good work for certain regions and for the capital city.  There is no doubt about that.  Some Senators feel that Bord Fáilte still have a major role to play and perhaps they are right.</P>
    <P>I have read the Minister's speech and I recognise that there is a whole new approach to tourism at present.  The Minister said the regions will be strengthened and that is exactly what we want. There is no point in just publishing brochures and showing the flag at international fairs.  That is not good enough because there must be an input on the ground.  Across the Border in County Fermanagh they publish colour brochures on Fermanagh, which are marvellous advertising for County Fermanagh.  This is organised on a regional basis.</P>
    <P>EC funding makes a 60 per cent input to marketing local regional organisations on the ground across the Border from County Donegal.  Therefore, the Minister, the Government and anybody else interested in the tourism industry will see that one way to succeed is to support the regions.  I am satisfied that will be done. I hope we will have an opportunity to meet the task force and the new director general.  Tributes have been paid to those who have served Bord Fáilte and the industry well in the past.</P>
    <P>We are living in a hard world where it is tough to survive economically.  If we are to promote industry we certainly have to put our best foot forward.  I believe it is time to make a bigger effort to contribute more and get more out of an industry that can provide jobs.  I am satisfied that the Motion was useful and timely.  I thank the Minister and everybody else who contributed. I hope we can all look forward <Col N="2021" /> to an expanding tourism industry where the greatest need exists, that is in rural Ireland.  I have no doubt that we should give the new task force a chance.  We should meet them and talk to them and put forward our different arguments on regional development.  Tourism offers a big opportunity at present and I hope we will grasp it because there are not many areas open for development.  I put the development of tourism and the fishing industry as our two leaders.  I thank the House for listening to me and supporting the motion.  I thank the Minister very much for listening to all the contributions made and for his good reply to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter tonight and to thank the Minister for attending.</P>
      <P>After the explosion which demolished part of Raglan House, killing two people and injuring four, the Government requested Cremer and Warner to make a report which was duly submitted to the Minister for Energy last March.  Dublin Gas, now Bord Gáis Éireann, have been tackling a major job of restoring public confidence in natural gas as a fuel, in the integrity of the gas grid and the company. There has been almost a complete change in the management of Dublin Gas.  Bord Gáis Éireann and the Minister are to be congratulated on the interest they have shown in this matter.  The Minister has been very conscious, I know, of the need to improve safety standards in the gas industry.  I thank him for his interest in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2022" /> There is no question that the new management had a great deal of ground to make up.  Mr. Brendan Sommers, the receiver appointed to Dublin Gas by Bord Gáis Éireann in April 1986, made no secret of the poor state of the company's work practice and form of management when he took over.  Routine maintenance was unknown, with the result that the pipe grid fell into serious disrepair.  Cremer and Warner concluded that hazardous situations still exist in the grid.  The problem is that no one knows where they are because of the lack of data on past repairs and replacement work. During the past year the Gas Company have replaced, I understand, about 27 kilometres of gas piping which compares with only 49 kilometres replaced in the 20 years up to 1987.  The main replacement and upgrading, however, will be costly and time consuming.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the necessary finances will be available to Bord Gáis Éireann to carry out this work.  I believe that under the present planning £50 million will be spent over the next five years. It is a little difficult to see why the hazard problems referred to in the Cremer and Warner report are not tackled on a much shorter time scale.  I understand the reasons given by the chief executive of the gas company are that the company quite simply do not know where they are and that they may be dealt with only when they become obvious through leaks.  Nevertheless, it is evident that the gas company have revised operating procedures and more stringent regulations governing repair and maintenance work as well as intensified training.  All these are being introduced.  The gas company are committed to improving the whole area of gas distribution.</P>
    <P>The new management knows that if there is another Raglan House the consequences for gas sales and for the future of the company will be dismal.  This is the main reason I tabled this motion tonight. On the Adjournment some weeks ago I spoke about Dublin City air pollution.  If we are to remove pollution from the city air we will have to use more smokeless <Col N="2023" /> fuel in the city.  Recently Dublin Corporation surveyed 850 houses in Ballyfermot and 98 per cent of the houses surveyed were using solid fuel, mostly bituminous coal.  I believe many people would be willing to use natural gas but there is a niggling fear in their minds that it is unsafe.  It is essential that any doubt in the public mind in this area should be totally removed.</P>
    <P>For all their reassurances about the safety and desirability of natural gas as a fuel for domestic consumers, the Government are not without fault when it comes to the implementation of the Cremer and Warner recommendations.  The main recommendation, the appointment of a task force to examine all multi-storey buildings in the country liable to progressive collapse in the event of an accident, has been partially implemented. The task force were appointed but failed in their brief which was to examine all multi-storey buildings, blaming this on the limited time available to them and the scarcity of information supplied by the owners and administrators of multi-storey blocks around the country. Because they did not indentify individual vulnerable buildings, the Government were prevented from complying with another of the Cremer and Warner recommendations &mdash; that the owners of such buildings should be notified of the necessary remedial measures to be carried out.  Neither did the Government comply with the recommendations that all local authorities should be informed of the task force's findings and that they, in turn, should inform owners of buildings identified as being liable to progressive collapse, or the remedial measures required.</P>
    <P>The Government also failed to comply with a recommendation that did not depend on the task force.  Launching the task force last September the Government said they would be introducing legislation before Christmas giving statutory backing to a recommendation that owners of buildings, deemed to be in need of examination, would have to submit a certificate showing that an <Col N="2024" /> appraisal and, where necessary, remedial works had been done.  That legislation has not come before the Dáil or Seanad and I have to ask why.</P>
    <P>Many of the lessons learned from the Cremer and Warner report and the Raglan House disaster seem to have faded together with the memory of the New Year's eve explosion.  The Cremer and Warner report was unequivocal in stating that buildings with the same type of construction as Raglan House need to be identified urgently and measures taken to minimise access which could cause damage and progressive collapse.  That has not happened and the only conclusion which can be drawn from that is that Raglan House could happen again.  In view of this I earnestly ask the Minister to have the recommendations of the Cremer and Warner report and the task force implemented in full as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke) Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to inform the Seanad of the excellent progress which has been made in the implementation of the recommendations of the Cremer and Warner report on the explosions at Raglan House and Dolphin House.</P>
      <P>On 5 January I published a lengthy nad detailed statement on the progress made with the implementation of this and other reports on Dublin Gas since I became involved in these matters.  There are over 100 recommendations in these reports and progress has continued since then.  I will now outline the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Securing the future of Dublin Gas was, of course, a major element in the drive for safety and BGE assumed ownership of the assets of Dublin Gas on 3 November 1987.  At the same time I made an order pursuant to the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987, which gives Bord Gáis Éireann the necessary legislative powers to function as a gas utility in the Dublin area.  This order &mdash; S.I. No. 283 of 1987 &mdash; includes a number of articles related to safety.  BGE have the power to enter premises to inspect pipelines and fittings and to cut off a gas supply if it is considered unsafe.  The board also have very <Col N="2025" /> extensive powers for dealing with emergencies, including the power to order people to evacuate buildings.</P>
    <P>Under the order BGE are obliged to report to me periodically on the state of the gas network and to co-operate with any investigator whom I may appoint to review their safety procedures.  The order also sets out the nature of investigations which must be undertaken for different types of gas incident.  These range from internal BGE investigations in minor cases to the appointment of external investigators in the event of a serious incident.</P>
    <P>Gas safety is a subject which I have been extremely conscious of since taking office and I appointed a technical officer of my Department to closely monitor, on an on-going basis, the implementation by Dublin Gas of the various recommendations.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that overall, excellent progress on safety has been made by Dublin Gas and I am confident that sustained vigilance and commitment will see further improvement.  I would like to pay a particular tribute to the staff of Dublin Gas who have responded very positively to the new safety initiatives.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the recommendations of the Cremer and Warner report is now over 95 per cent complete. I want to emphasise that to Senator Doyle.  I recognise his particular constituency interest in this area in view of the tragedy that took place in his constituency but I want to emphasise to him that in the period since the Cremer and Warner report recommendations were made 95 per cent of them have been implemented.</P>
    <P>All of the actions required in the recommendations on operating practices have been put in place and the rest of the CWL recommendations are targeted for completion in the coming weeks.  Of course, some of the recommendations, for example training, clearly involve a sustained commitment.  When I mention training I look forward within the next couple of weeks to going down to Dublin Gas and opening a whole new training operation they have in place there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2026" /> A very satisfactory level of progress has also been achieved on the VEG recommendations following a technical audit of the Dublin Gas distribution system.  That report was published by me last August.  It was an internal report. The aspect of safety is of such concern to the people of Dublin that, when parts of it were leaked, I published the whole document, something that is not normally done, but I wanted to involve the people of Dublin in the whole report and in the safety of their gas network.</P>
    <P>There were ten short term recommendations on priority network improvements and these are now 80 per cent complete and will be finished by mid-1988 as required.  The other medium and long term network recommendations are well under way and will be completed within the proposed three year target of the report.  It was the VEG who set out the targets and we will meet those targets.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force on multi-storey buildings which was prepared for the Minister for the Environment contained 30 recommendations directed at Dublin Gas in addition to those which are a matter for the Minister for the Environment.  I am delighted to be able to say that the Dublin Gas recommendations are already 50 per cent complete, and all of them will be completed within the anticipated three year schedule. I can also inform the House that the Government have now approved the circulation of the Bill of the Minister for the Environment on multi-storey buildings which was a question raised by Senator Doyle.  It is on its way.</P>
    <P>Dublin Gas have made commendable progress on the implementation of all of the recommendations of these reports &mdash; in so far as these are for Dublin Gas to implement &mdash; and they are completing all the required actions on or ahead of the publicly declared schedules.</P>
    <P>The principal areas of good progress during 1987 included: Placing in position a competent and disciplined technical organisation at all levels; work practices in the four operating Departments have been improved through re-organisation and training; the over-riding importance <Col N="2027" /> of safety is not accepted as a first priority: Dublin Gas are well on the way towards establishing a complete computerised record on every gas pipe in the city; the first complete leak survey of the 2,600 kilometres network has been completed and a second survey is already 50 per cent complete; Dublin Gas have surveyed around every public building in the city; because of their higher priority, Dublin Gas have already surveyed around every apartment block on four separate occasions.  Dublin Gas have internally surveyed over 14,000 apartments and are awaiting access to 2,000 more.</P>
    <P>Every bridge crossing has been surveyed, and several other special purpose surveys &mdash; for example, mains close to buildings &mdash; are in course of completion; the results of all the surveys, and of all leak reports, are now carefully recorded on drawings and on computer for appropriate remedial action; approval has been given for the construction of a new main to allow the decommissioning of 22 kilometres of the existing pipeline along the DART railway line.  The remaining sections of pipeline will be upgraded by the insertion of new plastic pipes.</P>
    <P>The pipe replacement programme is now fully mobilised.  During 1987, 21 kilometres were replaced and inserted and six kilometres taken out of service. It is expected that, in 1988, about 100 kilometres of mains will be replaced &mdash; this is well up to the level which the task force recommended.  So far this year 20 kilometres have been replaced.</P>
    <P>The mains and services replacement programme is proceeding as quickly as possible consistent with the need to establish appropriate priorities to ensure that the most serious cases are dealt with first. Over 5,000 customers had their services renewed in 1987 and 1,000 more already in 1988 are well up to the task force's target.</P>
    <P>Another problem was the loss of gas due to leakage at joints.  Mains conditioning, through injection of MEG and through spray and drain operations, has been continued at a high level and this has clearly reduced the losses.  As well as <Col N="2028" /> that, a programme of improvement of governor operations, leading to finer control of gas pressures in the network, is also helping to reduce lost gas.  Odorisation practices have been rationalised between BGE and Dublin Gas and significantly improved &mdash; this is a particularly important aspect of gas safety.</P>
    <P>Last October I launched a portfolio of National Gas standards covering all aspects of the supply and use of natural gas and Liquid Petroleum Gas.  Dublin Gas operating procedures have been fundamentally reviewed in the light of these standards and there is no room now for doubt or ambiguity on technical requirements. The Operating Practices Manual has been totally revised and updated. Leak classification and repair procedures have been thoroughly reviewed to achieve the safest practices in that area. Emergency procedures have also been updated.</P>
    <P>An extensive programme of training has been completed and a new training school has just been built.  In 1987 there were 1,260 man-days of training.  In 1988 it is estimated there will be 4,000 such man-days.</P>
    <P>Another important element in gas safety is public awareness.  A comprehensive campaign has been launched and reminders on the key safety rules have been sent to every customer, as well as to the caretakers of multi-occupancy buildings such as apartment blocks, hospitals, etc.  The safety brochure <i>Natural Gas in the Home</i> has been delivered to 240,000 households, including noncustomers and a schools campaign is under way.  At every long weekend there have been safety messages in the newspapers and on the radio.  The TV campaign is now on the air, and will continue as necessary through the cold season.</P>
    <P>The target time limit for attending to reports of gas leaks is one hour &mdash; which is internationally recognised as standard for good gas industry practice &mdash; and this is achieved in over 80 per cent of cases. Constant improvement is being sought. All responses outside the one hour criterion are investigated.  All non-emergency calls are dealt with by appointment. <Col N="2029" /> Attention to customer needs has improved considerably, and Dublin Gas are continuing in their attempts to improve their performance in this area.</P>
    <P>A number of areas are receiving specific attention.  Access to premises is very important.  Where there are doubts about safety, and where access to a premises is not readily available, the gas supply will be cut off.  Further emphasis is being placed on quality control, on odorisation and on the enhancement of the management information system.  The number of gas-related holes in the streets of Dublin which peaked at approximately 1,000 has now decreased to a running average of less than 100.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity in Seanad Éireann to say that the Gas Company are not responsible for every hole dug in the streets of the city of Dublin and the parts of the county that have gas. There are a whole lot of other utilities &mdash; the corporation, county council, Bord Telecom, Uncle Tom Cobley and all &mdash; but every hole dug in the city is blamed <Col N="2030" /> on the Gas Company.  I want to emphasise that while there were 1,000 at one time, the average is now less than 100 citywide and countywide, some of which are there for a couple of hours only before being closed again.</P>
    <P>Finally, Senators may be interested to know that 1987 sales of gas in Dublin were 81 million therms, approximately the same as the 1986 figure.  However, the mix of premium and non-premium sales has improved significantly.  The recent central heating campaign has been very successful, and will impact favourably on 1988 sales.  It is also noteworthy that customer numbers are now increasing following a period of reducing numbers early in 1987.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity, a Chathaoirligh, to thank you for giving me the opportunity to put these very positive results of the activities of the past 12 months in the Department of Energy on the record of this House.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 3 March 1988.</P>
