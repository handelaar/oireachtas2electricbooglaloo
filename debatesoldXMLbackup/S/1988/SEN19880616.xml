      <P>I have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The criteria used by the Department of Foreign Affairs to ensure that vessels carrying nuclear weapons do not enter Irish ports.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Paschal Mooney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clarify whether the Government are continuing their efforts to secure the release of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four, a pardon for the Maguire family and if the Minister will seek an explanation from the British authorities about the inhuman treatment being meted out to Gerard Conlon of the Guildford Four who has been moved to a prison which will make it more difficult than ever for his family to visit him.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice <Col N="654" /> to update our legislation on phone tapping to comply with rulings on this matter by the European Court.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ryan and Mooney as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ryan's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Mooney may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule the matter raised by Senator John Connor is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground that it would involve legislation.</P>

      <P>It is with regret that I rise this morning to express a vote of sympathy to the families of those who were brutally murdered in Lisburn last night.  Unfortunately, we in this House extend these expressions of sympathy on a regular basis and unfortunately the murder and carnage continue.  All we can do is to continue to express our abhorrence at these events and extend our sympathy to the families of those who are killed.</P>
      <P>On another note, I congratulate the Irish team on their endeavours last evening and I wish them well in their next match on Saturday.</P>

      <P>Last evening, as we were celebrating life and taking pride in the exploits of our national football team, at the very same time six young soldiers who were helping in a charity event in an Irish town were wiped out by the Godfathers of Death in as dastardly an act as <Col N="655" /> we have seen over the past 19 years of horror.  It is an act which brings shame to the name of Irishmen and to our island. One can only express revulsion and horror and give the comfort of one's sympathy to the families of those who suffered so grieviously last evening.  Those who carried out this deed do not know the meaning of the word &ldquo;decency&rdquo;.  Civilisation is not part of their make-up or creed.  While I, as a politician, have always believed in dialogue and in talking, I wonder now if there is any point in talking to these people.  I wonder if the well-intentioned attempt to establish a bridgehead, to talk to these people, by constitutional politicians in Northern Ireland over the past few months have any place or purpose.  On behalf of my party I want to extend sympathy and to express revulsion.</P>
      <P>May I point to the irony that just as the Dáil was focussing attention last evening on the plight of the Birmingham Six and others in British jails, attempting to reason, to create a climate in which their cases could be revised and, hopefully, that they could be given clemency, the Godfathers of Death were ensuring that whatever efforts were made from these Houses would be set at nought and a climate that might help them was, in one stroke, completely destroyed.</P>

      <P>I support the expressions of condemnation and sympathy voiced by both the Leader of the House and by Senator Manning.  As I said before on similar occasions, to utter words of condemnation may seem futile and easy, but it would be infinitely worse to remain silent.  It is proper that the second House of the Oireachtas should go on record in expressing its detestation of what occured last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan said that all we can do is to express our sympathy and condemnation. Is this not an occasion for wondering whether those of us who prattle glibly and hypocrically about and subscribe to the objectives of an all-Ireland constitutional conference, phased British withdrawal and ultimate Irish unity are <Col N="656" /> not unwillingly supporting IRA morale, encouraging them in their &ldquo;one last push against the Brits&rdquo; strategy, of which last night's event was such an evil expression. Last night's atrocity puts in proper perspective our nit picking and pussyfooting attitudes towards extradition.</P>

      <P>I join with the Leader of the House and the other speakers in their condemnation of last night's dreadful, unlawful and cowardly killing of unsuspecting British soldiers when they were participating in a charity run in Lisburn. It brings home to us, and certainly to those of us in the Labour Party, that, instead of passing votes of sympathy to the families of those who were murdered, there is a responsibility on all of us to act positively and do something other than passing votes of sympathy.  It is becoming a ritual for all of us in the South to be identified only with votes of sympathy but &mdash; and Senator Murphy touched on this &mdash; we have a major responsibility in this area.</P>
      <P>I echo Senator Manning's comment that what happened last night immediately after, or even simultaneously with the all-party agreement of the other House to seek clemency from the British dashed any hope of clemency from the other side because some people continue to flout ordinary human behaviour.  We are now beginning to quantify things &mdash; if it happened three minutes later 100 children could have been killed.  Thankfully only six people were killed.  This is a desperate situation.  It needs a supreme effort on the part of the Government and all Members of the Oireachtas to consider further the whole concept of constitutional politics so that these people, both North and South, can be rooted from our society.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with other speakers in expressing sympathy to the families of those who were killed in last night's bomb attack in Lisburn. With the exception of Senator Robb, I believe I meet more British soldiers than any other Member of the House.  Most of them are teenagers who are not in the North of Ireland by choice. Their deaths will not achieve anything. County Donegal, which is a beautiful county, is now ringed by a number of bases unequalled anywhere else on this side of Beirut.  This is a tragedy, it achieves nothing and I believe it is condemned by any reasonable person.  I call on the Members of this House and all responsible people in the South to support those who are trying to take the gun out of politics in Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 146:</P>
      <P>In page 91, before section 104, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 285 (2) of the Companies Act, 1963 shall be amended by the addition of the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;The unpaid purchase price or any outstanding balance thereof for any goods supplied to the company under a contract for sale and actually delivered to the company, its servants or agents during the three months next before the relevant date&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Basically we are trying to amend section 285 (2) of the Companies Act, 1963, by the addition of the following:</P>
      <P>The unpaid purchase price or any outstanding balance thereof for any goods supplied to the company under a contract for sale and actually delivered to the company, its servants or agents during the three months next before the relevant date.</P>
      <P>We put down this amendment to the Principal Act because, as we outlined yesterday, of the difficulties experienced by unsecured creditors in getting some payment for the goods they supplied to a company who have gone into liquidation. The liquidation of the H. Williams supermarket chain and Clover Meats Ltd. are two examples whereby the suppliers of goods were erroneously exposed under existing company law.  Even though the Revenue Commissioners enjoy preferential status and the financial institutions can utilise their secured position to extract all of the available resources in the liquidated company, this is done to the detriment of the unsecured creditors. Often there is no money in the pool at the end of the day in order to give any recognition to the unsecured creditors, many of whom will end up going to the wall as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> The balance in liquidations has tilted against the smaller creditor and the producer of goods.  I seek to redress the matter through the acceptance of amendments Nos. 146 and 147.  Amendment No. 147 seeks to establish clear retention of title in the event of the supply of goods to a company.  While there might be difficulties in so far as the goods supplied to a company are mixed in with other unsecured creditors' goods, nevertheless it is important to establish in law that the goods were supplied to the company involved, that there will be clear recognition of that in the books of the company in liquidation and that there will be payment in lieu of the goods supplied to the unsecured creditor.</P>
    <P>Over the past 15 years retention of title clauses has become commonplace in cases where goods are supplied on credit. These have given rise to considerable litigation. Section 17 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, makes it clear that the title to goods which are sold passes on the delivery of goods unless the contract for the sale of the goods otherwise provides. Therefore, I believe it is legitimate for the parties to the sale to agree that the property in the goods sold will remain with the vendor until payment has been made.  I am sure the Department are familiar with the efforts made in the Carbury case and many other cases to establish payment, through various High Court judges, to unsecured creditors. Many of these cases would have failed if there had not been clear registration of title, or clear evidence that the goods were supplied by the unsecured creditor.</P>
    <P>The day has gone when we can overlook the significance of this matter and the inequity in the legislation which can cause many problems for the supplier of goods.  The balance must come back in favour of the producer.  The central approach should be that the producer of the goods has some recognition that he supplied the goods and payment, is some form, should be made to the supplier out of the liquidation of the company.  If the goods have been sold, whether in their original state or mixed in with other goods, and the purchaser has paid the <Col N="661" /> money into an overdrawn account in the bank, obviously there will be no fund because the purchaser will already have parted with the money and the bank will have obtained it bona fide in payment of moneys owing to them.  However, there might have been very severe difficulties here.  It is possible to put the bank on notice that any moneys paid into an overdrawn account should be paid to the vendor of the goods but, in reality, the bank will not allow a customer to trade in that manner.  Banks do not work that way in relation to companies.  This adds to the insecurity of a smaller supplier of goods or an unsecured creditor.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty might arise because many dairy co-ops sell their dairy products into intervention.  The EC have different systems of payment from national Governments or co-operatives in these cases.  In the Carbury pig producers case, which I mentioned earlier, the purchasing company went into liquidation while stocks of pigs were still in varying degrees of processing.  Even though the pigs were still in the factory no suppliers were paid in respect of the pigs supplied during that period.  The same happened in relation to Clover Meats.  Many farmers had supplied the goods in good faith to the meat processing company but the financial institution who were honouring their financial obligations to that company decided that the situation had become untenable and appointed a receiver, which eventually led to the liquidation of the company. Farmers came together and formed a group who lobbied the financial institution to recognise that they had supplied goods to the company.  They had to lobby long and hard before they eventually got something of a nominal nature.</P>
    <P>I do not think that type of thing should be tolerated.  It is disgraceful that unsecured creditors should have to beg and crawl to any company, whether in receivership or liquidation, to get payment for the goods they had supplied. The fact is that they had supplied the goods.  The cattle and pigs are not on the property of the farmer or the property of the supplier of the goods; they are on the <Col N="662" /> property of the purchaser.  I hope the Minister will take this opportunity to see the good sense of putting into law a clear recognition of the difficulties of unsecured creditors so that there will not be a repetition of what has happened in many cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister is familar with the recent debacle in relation to H. Williams.  I know many small suppliers of goods who went out of business following the collapse of that supermarket chain.  They got their fingers burned to such an extent that they could not afford to continue in business. I know a third hand supplier of bacon products to H. Williams supermarket chain who had to cease trading because he was owed something in the region of £100,000 by an intermediary between him and the H. Williams group.  We are not talking only about the direct suppliers who can be affected by a company collapse; we are talking also about small business people who have invested considerable financial resources in their businesses. They see their future and companies being whittled away because in company law recognition is not given to the fact that they have supplied goods. It is of significant importance that the Minister should give favourable consideration to inserting something of this nature into the Bill.</P>

      <P>In many ways it is unfortunate that the two amendments are being taken together because, even though they are related, they are quite different.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was taking them separately.  Senator Hogan indicated that he would like them to be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, I wanted to make the points together. Perhaps the Senator would like to discuss them separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind discussing them together.  I just want to make the point that here are two quite separate ways of dealing with the same problem.  I compliment the Senator on <Col N="663" /> closing down all the angles on it very clearly.</P>
      <P>What we are discussing is a situation where a company goes out of business, goes bust, or is being liquidated.  A number of people supplied goods to that firm over a period of time.  On the day the company is handed over to the liquidator, there are goods <i>in situ</i>, or in the business, factory, or wherever it is, which were supplied that day, or the day before, by an unsuspecting small supplier.  The two amendments are attempting to protect that small supplier &mdash; if the company is liquidated the small supplier is protected. The two amendments go about doing this in two ways.  I support one and I oppose the other.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 146, the proposers are looking back at the Companies Act and, as it were, they are making this preferential. They are adding it to section 2 to make them the preferential people in dealing with creditors.  I do not agree with that.  That is not the way to do it. In discussing something similar, I said I thought it would be appropriate to bring in some form of legislation that would protect the small supplier.  The idea put forward in amendment No. 147 certainly grapples with that fact.  They are saying that, when the liquidator comes in, the company is liquidated, but this stuff which has been supplied, but which has not been paid for by the company, does not belong to the company.  They are saying it is not the property of the company and is not appropriate to be liquidated. I go along with the thinking behind that, although I see some problems with the wording of it.  I certainly think the idea is right.  What is being said in amendment No. 147 is that this material, which is on the property of the company, or on the premises, does not in fact belong to the company.  If that legal distinction could be built into the legislation in some way it would allow a very clear understanding of the fact that it does not belong to the company and that therefore, it will not be liquidated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, the two points I am making <Col N="664" /> are that I do not agree with the idea of making it preferential but I do agree with the idea of some legal protection being built into it to protect the small supplier &mdash; in a very positive way this time &mdash; by saying that this material has been delivered to the company but in a sense does not belong to the company because they have not paid for it.  Because they have not paid for it, it should not be liquidated on behalf of the company but it should remain the property of the supplier.  It should be dealt with on the same lines as lost property.  It is like a lost property syndrome; it is there on the company's premises and it does not belong to the company.  I would maintain that what we might do here is to bring into it a protection that would say that this material still belongs to the supplier until such time as the supplier has been paid for it.</P>
    <P>It raises a very neat question: when in fact does property change hands?  I say to you that I want to sell you this pen, a Chathaoirligh, and I hand you the pen and we agree a price, say 50p.  When I hand the property over to you and you say to me, &ldquo;Thanks very much; I will pay you next week&rdquo;, is the property yours or mine?  I have handed it over to you.  What I would be saying, in the unlikely event that you were to be wound up and that your assets were to be disposed of in any way, is that it is still my pen and I would like to have it back.  That example might be very useful.  I think the Minister should look at that and perhaps take it on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be possible to wind you up.  With respect, I think you are holding your own there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On amendment No. 147, perhaps the Minister would give us the legal definition of the situation where goods have been <Col N="665" /> supplied on contract, meaning if somebody orders goods and they are delivered. Perhaps he could advise us then about the legality of the ownership, even if they are not paid for.  This happens, of course, with hire purchase companies which sell goods on hire purchase and if one defaults on any or one of the payments the hire purchase company can actually retrieve the goods.  I am almost certain that they have to go through a court procedure.  That is the ideal situation. But if you are now in a winding-up or a liquidation situation can the normal course of law come into effect when in fact the owner of these goods &mdash; because they have not been paid for although they are on somebody else's premises &mdash; is the supplier?  Can he still have recourse in law for the redemption of them?  Or, do those goods, because of the liquidation, come into the overall reckoning by the liquidator?</P>
    <P>All of us would agree with the sentiments of the amendment but I am not sure about how we can achieve in legislation what is desirable, particularly in regard to the smaller supplier of goods. This is one way of doing it but perhaps there is another way around this problem and we are looking to the Minister for guidance.  I think Senator Hogan has not been unreasonable.  He has requested the Minister to look at what we are trying to do, what we feel should be done or what the parliamentary draftsman feels could be done, possibly with better wording or otherwise, or in a different section in this or other legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the supply of goods generally, there is a simple document that can be drawn up legally, a contract between the supplier and the people he is supplying goods to whereby the supplier can retain title to the goods. That is clear and straightforward: until such time as the goods are paid for, he still retains title to those goods.  The problem is this.  Let us take the example, say, of the construction industry where there is a Government contract.  When suppliers are asked to tender for goods part of the contract is that they have to sign a <Col N="666" /> vesting certificate stating that they relinquish all claims to those goods, having supplied them.  The situation is such that if you take a manufacturer supplying to a subcontractor and the subcontractor is subsequently paid for the goods and if the subcontractor does not pay the manufacturer, the goods have been sold on to a third party and this title to ownership is lost, as far as I can see.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make is this.  I believe that Government Departments have a responsibility when they appoint a design team, architects, engineers, quantity surveyors that those quantity surveyors will be held responsible to nominate legitimate bona fide sub-contractors. If they appoint sub-contractors who are not solvent or have been trading fraudulently for a period of time, then the Department or somebody should be held responsible down the line for appointing a company that was not a legitimate company.  This is a great problem in the construction industry for suppliers and manufacturers.  They are supplying to sub-contractors who are really using the next job to pay for the last one.  Prices have become so competitive that they just cannot be making money.</P>
      <P>It is a known fact that many companies are tendering for Government projects at below cost.  I believe that the design team appointed by the Department have a responsibility to ensure that in any contract they accept, there is a fair price and that contractors and sub-contractors are not going in at below cost and that they are not using the next contract down the line to pay for the last one.  I am sure that if there was an investigation carried out with companies who went into liquidation in the construction industry it could be easily established that they were on the road to insolvency, if not insolvent 12 months previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I would like to make is that some protection should be given to manufacturers who are supplying to sub-contractors, particularly in Government contracts, so that they would retain, if not title to the goods, at least a claim to payment to payment for the goods supplied.  They are nominated suppliers <Col N="667" /> and they are supplying to sub-contractors who have been nominated by a design team which has been appointed by the Department.  I would be glad if the Minister could give some consideration to this. I am not sure whether this is the relevant part of the Bill in which to do it but it is a very contentious area.  I would ask the Minister to look at it and perhaps advise if something could be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Without getting into an argument, a Chathaoirligh, while Senator Mulroy's point is very good, we brought forward this amendment because of the proliferation of cases throughout the whole country where many unfortunate suppliers and unfortunate individuals very often have found themselves supplying goods or services or moneys to companies that at the time of supply are insolvent or in the process of collapse or liquidation.  I remember one case in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon, my own county, the famous Towey case where at the time of the collapse of that company there was approximately £1 million owing to hundreds of small farmers &mdash; I underline the word &ldquo;small&rdquo; in this particular instance &mdash; throughout western counties and indeed other counties outside of the west of Ireland.  None of these unfortunate individuals had any recourse or any redress while people like the Revenue Commissioners and the secure creditors were able to get their full pound of flesh, to quote Shakespeare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> The resentment that kind of thing caused and the sense of injustice among people whose incomes had been ruined for a whole year, or possibly two years, because they and supplied £2,000, £5,000, £6,000 or £7,000 worth of animals or livestock to a particular firm was enormous. In some instances perhaps the value was less than that, but there are many extreme cases of smallholders doing that and doing it at a time of the year when these smallholders disposed of the majority of their animals, in the months of October and November.  The resentment was felt by those people when they could look around and see secured creditors getting their full pound of flesh.</P>
    <P>No attempt at all was being made &mdash; because the law did not make provision for it: this is where we would like the law now to make provision for it &mdash; to look at the make-up of the demands made by the secured creditors.  For instance, the Revenue Commissioners, if they so wish &mdash; and no doubt they do these things; I am not making an anti-Revenue Commissioners speech here &mdash; can get their full interest etc. on the moneys due to them.  Certainly, small individuals could find their incomes utterly ruined by being unsecured creditors.  They deeply resented it and nobody can blame them in instances like this when they find that the secured creditors have so many privileges under the law.  What we are doing here is proposing to give a little privilege or, rather, a little protection to people who find themselves in that situation, who have supplied goods and the goods have not been paid for.</P>
    <P>I know of another instance where people supplied money to a management company and that management company in turn was to buy certain items for these people and put them to work.  That management company went into liquidation and there were hundreds of thousands of pounds in a bank account of this particular management company that were not spent on buying the items which they traded in.  Yet, all of these moneys that belonged to these unfortunate people were not deemed to be held in trust for them, even though the goods and services <Col N="669" /> that were supposed to be purchased for them had not been negotiated.  These moneys went into the general assets of the company.  These poor unfortunate individuals were unsecured creditors and they literally lost all their money.</P>
    <P>One could go on.  There is another recent unfortunate case in the west of Ireland, also in the livestock-meat area.  Again, we find small farmers are the people who are at the rough end of the stick.  May I repeat that our purpose in introducing this amendment today is to try to give some level of legal protection to those defenceless individuals who usually are people with low incomes, bearing in mind the resentment that can be felt towards the secured creditors like the Revenue Commissioners, the banks, etc. Senator Ferris &mdash; and I do not wish to get at cross-purposes with him &mdash; talks about the difficulty of getting a legal way of bringing this in.  This is a legislative House, as is the other House, and of course it is here we make the law and here we can enact a statute or part of a statute to give legal protection to these individuals we are talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their comments on these amendments.  What amendment No. 146 is proposing is basically that certain ordinary trade creditors should be elevated to the status of preferential creditors.  That is what I understand Senators to be saying.  The trade creditors which the amendment proposes to elevate in this way are suppliers of goods.  The wording in the amendment deals with &ldquo;suppliers of goods&rdquo; to a company. I note in passing that the amendment does not propose that suppliers of services should be treated in the same way and perhaps that is just a technical oversight.  Under the amendment, therefore, such suppliers would remain ordinary trade creditors.  I do not imagine the Senators mean to draw a distinction between goods and services in this context although that, in fact, is what the drafting of the amendment does.  For example, the services of the contractor <Col N="670" /> who cleaned a factory, or of a pension consultant, or people like that would not, in fact, be covered by this amendment.</P>
      <P>The effect of the proposed amendment would be to change the existing order of priority for payment in the winding up of a company.  Under the proposed provisions, suppliers of goods would rank ahead, not only of suppliers of services and other secured creditors, but also of holders of floating charges.  The suppliers of goods would thus rank equally with all preferential creditors, in other words, the Revenue Commissioners, rating authorities and the employees.  There seems to be no reason whatever why the supplier of goods should rank actually ahead of the holder of a floating charge in the winding up of a company.  There is nothing to prevent &mdash; and this is an important point &mdash; the supplier of goods looking for a charge from the company in relation to the credit being advanced by him.  It is reasonable, therefore, that a prudent creditor who has sought to safeguard his position by creating a floating charge over the assets of the company should, as a result of this amendment, for example, find himself actually further down the line in the order of priority than a supplier of goods who had taken no precaution in relation to securing his credit.</P>
      <P>Similarly, a supplier of goods is free to agree with his purchaser to the inclusion of a retention of title clause in the contract for sale.  The effect of such a clause would be that the supplier would retain title to the goods until the purchase price was paid.  If the purchaser company goes into liquidation or receivership before the purchase price is paid, then the supplier would be entitled either to have the goods returned, if they are still in the possession of the purchaser, or to be refunded the purchase price in accordance with the terms of the contract.  I think those points are important in regard to retention of title.  Also, in regard to amendment No. 147, what is being suggested is that a reservation of title clause should be implied in every contract for the sale of goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 of the Sale of Goods Act, <Col N="671" /> 1893, which is referred to in the amendment, provides that title to goods shall transfer to the buyer when the parties to the goods intend it to be transferred.  I will quote that section 17.  It says:</P>
    <P>Where there is a contract for the sale of specific or ascertained goods, the property in them is transferred to the buyer at such time as the parties to the contract intend it to be transferred.</P>
    <P>That is a very well-respected piece of legislation.  This provision reflects both legislative and common law trends in the area of contract law for a very long time, in other words, respect for the freedom of parties to decide the terms of their own contracts.  The Legislature, in particular, has traditionally intervened only where the balance between the contracting parties is uneven and possibly unfair.  This is particularly evident in the area of consumer protection law where the consumer may very often be in a weaker position than the supplier of goods or services, particularly where standard form contracts are in operation.</P>
    <P>The amendment suggests that the Legislature should intervene by inserting a provision in company legislation to the effect that, where goods are sold to a company, title of the goods should never pass until the seller of the goods has been paid for them.  The intention of the proposed provision seems to be to protect ordinary trade creditors in the event of the insolvency of the company.  There seems to be no very good reason why such a clause should be deemed, by virtue of statute, to be implied in every single contract for the sale of goods to a company. Indeed, I think the amendment is proposing an unwarranted and unnecessary incursion in the area of contract law.</P>
    <P>The reason for the proposed amendment is difficult to understand.  The law has recognised for some 200 years the right of a seller to stipulate that the property in goods sold passes only on payment in full.  This principle was, as I have mentioned, given statutory approval by section 17 of the 1893 Sale of Goods Act which I have quoted.  Furthermore, <Col N="672" /> reservation of title clauses were given specific judicial approval in a number of cases over the past 15 years.  The most celebrated case is that which is known as the Romalpa case, a United Kingdom case in 1976.  This case showed clearly that it is possible for a supplier to guard against the insolvency of his purchaser by creating an enforceable claim to recapture goods supplied and to be paid the proceeds of any sub-sale of them.  Since this case, reservation of title clauses have commonly become known as the Romalpan clauses.  Although the Romalpa case is regarded as the most important case on the question of retention of title clauses, the Irish courts, two years prior to Romalpa in 1974, had declared a retention of title clause to be enforceable.  This was the case of Interviews Limited.</P>
    <P>This makes the amendment a little surprising in that what is being suggested would essentially restate the common law position in relation to reservation of title clauses.  Perhaps this is what the proposers have in mind.  This may be in some cases of more concern because it could, in fact, introduce a restrictive element in this area of law which of its nature requires considerable flexibility.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why the proposed amendment is undesirable.  While the Government have no plans to introduce any restrictions on the use of retention of title clauses, we are not convinced that the proliferation of such clauses is a good thing even in itself.  The UK Cork Committee on Insolvency suggested that such clauses could strike at the root of the system of credit.  When banks lend without security they look to the assets in the balance sheet or, more frequently, in periodical statements of assets by the customers to the banker.</P>
    <P>If a large portion of those assets such as stocks, work in progress and book debts were all effectively earmarked for one section of creditors &mdash; being the suppliers &mdash; or there was a risk that this was so, they would not be so ready to advance money in the first place.  Equally, when banks lend on the security of floating charges, they look to the cover provided by the assets within their security.  If, <Col N="673" /> again, a substantial portion of stocks, work in progress and book debts were the property of supply creditors, or there was a possibility that they were, banks would be even less inclined to lend on that basis.</P>
    <P>There is a further difficulty in that those concerned to facilitate the rehabilitation or reconstruction of companies in financial difficulties argued to the Cork committee that receivers would have difficulty in keeping businesses operating if stocks, work in progress and book debts, in whole or in part, belonged to or were claimed by supply creditors and could be seized by them.  The receiver would not have the means to keep a business in action while attempts were made to sell it as a going concern or to reorganise it.  While I would not want to enshrine something in the statute that would create difficulties of this kind for receivers, I would be even more worried about the effect it would have on the regime for company rescues, which we are coming to further on in this Bill, in Part IX, in which we are proposing some quite imaginative rescue schemes.</P>
    <P>The House will already be aware what that Part of the Bill is trying to do and, indeed, our proposals there have been fairly widely welcomed.  The amendment would, quite frankly, play ducks and drakes with the examiner under Part IX of the Bill.  The examiner would not &mdash; indeed he could not &mdash; know where he stood from one day to the next and I do not think that would be a desirable situation to leave our companies in.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, freedom of contract should not be curtailed by statute more than is absolutely necessary, given the many different trading circumstances that can arise.  The problems in this area, if they exist, would be better resolved by ordinary market forces rather than by a modification of the law, a modification which would have universal application. In these circumstances and because of the general effect it would have on companies in receivership and under the protection of the court, by virtue of the upcoming Part IX of the Bill, I could not accept amendment No. 147 and, indeed, <Col N="674" /> amendment No. 146, but amendment No. 146 in particular and consequentially No. 147.</P>
    <P>I want to say to Senators that I think they will agree that all of these matters are very closely tied together, and closely tied together to the matter we discussed yesterday, that is, preferential creditors. I indicated yesterday that I was prepared to give some consideration to the arguments raised by the Senators who favour the removal of preferential status and I want to reiterate it again today.  This I will do.  I cannot accept the amendments, as they are presently phrased, and I ask those who propose them to consider not proceeding with them until I have had an opportunity to examine the whole question of preferential status for them.  I am prepared to give an assurance to Senators again today that I will have the necessary examination carried out in time for a full discussion to take place on this whole subject on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 146, the Minister was gesturing with an olive branch of some description in relation to preferential status and if he is prepared to consider carefully the points we made yesterday and the points we have made today in relation to the position of unsecured creditors and the supply of goods to a firm that goes into liquidation, albeit of an unsecured nature, I will not proceed with amendment No. 146. However, on amendment No. 147, I am not at all happy that the Minister has grasped the reality of the situation in the market-place.  He is certainly a tremendous proponent of free market forces and that is the very reason we have so many small proprietors going into liquidation. It is very fine in theory to say that the market will dictate who survives and who does not in the market-place at the moment, but the reality is that there are people, rightly or wrongly, who have a preferential status over others and who find that they are one step ahead in their security of payment in relation to goods supplied, over and above others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding what the Minister said about section 17 of the Sale of Goods <Col N="675" /> Act, I do not accept that goods sold to a particular firm could not be held in trust for the benefit of the vendor in a liquidation. I can only say that the Minister is supporting planned liquidations &mdash; the reality is that there can be and is scope for planned liquidations &mdash; on the part of the secured creditors whereby, if there is a sufficient amount of goods supplied to the company, that will help to discharge the liabilities that are outstanding to the secured creditors.  Then there is a motive unfortunately built into this legislation that could help to even further secure the preferential status of some of the creditors in a company.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the suppliers of goods supplied in good faith to a company should be victimised in company law to such an extent that there is no recognition of the fact that those goods were supplied in the first place.  The retention of title is not clearly established in the supply of goods to firms and, in order to copperfasten this arrangement and to ensure that the bona fide supply of goods by a supplier to a purchaser is enshrined in legislation, in order to ensure that recognition is given to them and that compensation is given to them in the event of a liquidation we put down this amendment. Rather than playing ducks and drakes with the examiner, in the reconstruction of an ailing company, it just gives the examiner a further element and a further player in the game, as it were, to continue it, in so far as the examiner has to take cognisance of the fact and recongise that there are unsecured creditors involved in this liquidation as well as secured creditors.</P>
    <P>There are other ways in which the examiner's position will be difficult. Many of the cases of liquidation are brought about primarily by the failure of the company involved to tackle its problems early enough and the examiner will help in that regard.  This mainly and chiefly arises out of the failure of the company &mdash; and the Revenue Commissioners, perhaps, in many instances &mdash; to get involved with the company in <Col N="676" /> trouble with its financial arrangements with the Revenue Commissioners early enough to sort out the difficulties.  That role will now be taken on by the examiner in bringing the situation to the attention of the company to help to reconstruct the company if possible, if it is in an ailing position, by treating all the players as equals.  Unfortunately, the Minister has failed to recongnise that the unsecured creditors are entitled to equal treatment, the same as preferential creditors and secured creditors in the event of a liquidation, and the retention of title clause is certainly a major part of this process to ensure that payment is made to the supplier of goods in the event of a liquidation. I do not intend to withdraw amendment No. 147 for that reason.</P>

      <P>To comment on that quickly, amendments Nos, 144, 145 and 146 are all to do with the preferential creditor debate and how they rank in the order of the Revenue and so on.  Those three amendments are inextricably bound up and they have all been withdrawn on foot of my assurance to carry out an examination urgently as to what we can do further in that area.  We will look at that on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 147 is not one of the amendments at which I am undertaking to look again because the retention of title clause seems to me to be a cut and dried situation.  What the Senators are trying to do, in the retention of title clause, is to take the risk out of a commercial transaction.  If that was a standard item in every transaction, that everybody who was given goods did not own them and that the person who supplied them had an automatic right to have them returned in the event of liquidation, it would make a nonsense of the whole business of credit and would certainly turn the idea of doing business on its head completely.  The simple fact is that any creditor who feels this is necessary &mdash; there are different views as to whether it is healthy to take that line of business &mdash; all he has to do is enter on the invoice, contract of sale, or whatever arrangement is made to sell the goods, that he is reserving title to the goods.  The legal cases I have mentioned here indicate that this has been upheld.  Any creditor who wishes to retain title to his goods can simply enter a reservation of title clause in the sale contract and then he reserves title.  Why impose it on every single sale for the sake of some kind of neatness? That would be trying to take the risk out of business, which is something beyond the capacity of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly not trying to take the risk out of business.  There are always risks in business and there will continue to be.  I hope that we will always continue to have risk takers in order to create employment.  It is to protect the people who take the risk and to protect some of the people who are unsecured at <Col N="678" /> the moment in taking risks that we want to give them some recognition of the fact that they have supplied goods to a firm. I want to bring home to the Minister that a small amount of money can topple many small suppliers of goods.  We have many examples of people who have supplied goods to a particular company that goes into liquidation, and who failed to get any recognition of the fact that those goods were supplied in the first place.</P>
      <P>We can talk about free market forces, we can talk about the theory of the situation; but the practical realities are that people are not able to get any recognition or any compensation for the fact that those goods were supplied.  I reluctantly say that situations can be brought about where there are planned liquidations while there are sufficient amounts of goods in the possession of a purchaser. The financial institutions involved that are holding the security for that particular purchaser can bring about a situation where there are planned liquidations to the detriment of the unsecured creditor.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to think again about what we are trying to achieve.  We are trying to hold in trust the goods that were supplied to the particular company in order to ensure that compensation is given out of the liquidation to the unsecured creditors in order to ensure that we retain employment in the smaller firms that have been supplying goods and services to the company that has gone into liquidation.</P>

      <P>I said from the beginning that I considered the earlier amendments were lumped together and this one was separate.  That is why I found it strange that they were taken together.  I believe that an issue of major substance has been raised.  We have all grown up with the <i>caveat emptor</i> advice ringing in our ears.  Here we are talking about <i>caveat vendor</i> as well.  It is not just enough to say that they are protected by the existing legislation because they can tie into it a reservation of title clause.  It does not work that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree completely with Senator Hogan that there are planned receiverships. <Col N="679" /> There are people who quite cynically wait until property has amassed in the company's premises or has been received by the company, and then go into receivership at that point.  We are attempting here to take on board the fact that there are certain goods with high liquidity value.  Let us take the situation of a company which is trading this morning but people are aware that the company will not be trading this afternoon.  If a supplier supplies thousands of pounds worth of goods to that firm this morning and they are received by somebody, the Minister may say that sections 106 or 107 might interpret that as being fraudulent trading. But the fact of the matter is that somebody who has delivered to that company's premises perhaps £100,000 worth of goods is dependent on that money to keep his or her business running.  While the operation of section 106 might allow some satisfaction against the person who traded recklessly or fraudulently, it does not meet the cases that has been very correctly raised by Senator Hogan.  Perhaps not all cases can be dealt with.  It is almost like the lost property syndrome. It is between two people.  I intend supporting this amendment.  Perhaps the Minister would agree that there is a difficulty here which might be addressed, without implications for the other legislation dealing with the sale of goods, in particular the area of the liquidity of certain goods arriving late at the company's premises.</P>
    <P>I am seriously worried about the Minister's commitment to have a look at the earlier sections of the Principal Act, which I thought we had disposed of yesterday. I know that my colleagues in Fine Gael are pleased about it, but I am worried about it.  Like the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i>, I will defend the State to the end and I will be watching with an eagle eye to see what comes up with section 285 of the 1963 Act.  I like it the way it is.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, the instance that Senator O'Toole has just <Col N="680" /> given is that, if a company supply goods to another company and get a legal document or a contract in retaining title to the goods, even if the goods are sold to a third party the supplier still retains title to the goods.  It is a very complicated area to try to find out how the supplier can get paid for the goods when they pass on to the third party.  Are we confusing company law and contract law?  A contract can be entered into which will give the supplier protection on the title of goods. An astute supplier of goods has certain safeguards that he can avail of.</P>
      <P>For example, he can insist on a confirmed letter of credit which will guarantee him payment for the goods regardless of what happens to them after that or he can insist on a bill of exchange.  Failing that, if the person buying the goods will not enter into that type of contract there are further safeguards for the supplier. For instance, he can take out insurance on the goods.  There are safeguards for an astute supplier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I think we are approaching this from different perspectives.  The example given by Senator Mulroy is not really one of the areas looked at in this one.  A supplier could be supplying blocks to a builder and the astute supplier can have all the reservation of title clauses built into it and a week later the blocks might be a house.  In that case the Senator is saying he could still insist on payment through the terms of it.</P>
      <P>This amendment talks about goods which are actually on the premises of the company, which have a liquidity value like the blocks in a house which are no longer blocks but are part of a house. We are talking about a very specific area here.  We are talking about property in the possession of a company.  I am not taking from the points being made by Senator Mulroy.  I want to make the distinction that there are two separate issues here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>

If that is the case there is no need for this amendment.</P>

      <P>The retention of title thing is still very clear from our point of view in that there is no real case for putting it into statute in the way it has been suggested.  The example Senator O'Toole gave was about someone dumping £100,000 worth of materials in the morning and then the company going bust in the afternoon.  There are two things about that.  First of all, if that company are doing that level of business they probably have a retention of title clause in their standard terms of sale, in which case they could get the stuff back as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Companies doing business at that level should consider a retention of title clause. That is not the very heavy legal instrument which it might sound like.  It means that the company have standard terms of sale, which include a reservation of title clause, and ensuring, of course, that the person they are dealing with knows that that clause is there.  There is no question of sitting down and signing major documents to get the thing together between the supplier and the receiver of goods. Companies, financial controllers, legal advisers, and so on, should certainly consider that.</P>
      <P>It is arguable whether it is healthy in trading terms overall.  I would not be encouraging it all over the place because it interferes unduly with trade.  Nevertheless, if a company feel they want that protection they certainly can get it quite easily and quite simply.  In the example the Senator gave I assume the management of that company supplying the goods would have considered that option and could have taken it quite simply and quite easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second point, the Senator quite <Col N="682" /> rightly did part of my job for me in saying that section 106 and section 107 would, of course, come into play.  If the company deliberately received the goods knowing that the company were closing down in the afternoon in the example the Senator gave, there is now both criminal and civil redress.  There is criminal redress under section 106 and civil redress under 107. There is quite an amount of law ready to protect the person who supplies the goods.  All we are asking is that they should keep their heads about them also and not expect the State to protect them totally and to underwrite their business activity, which was unreasonable.  People in business do not expect that.</P>
    <P>There was the case of the recent supermarket situation mentioned by a number of Senators earlier.  In that liquidation I understand many of the suppliers had a reservation of title clause.  The picture of all these small suppliers left hanging &mdash; I use that term advisedly &mdash; is not totally accurate.  There was a reservation of title clause with many of them.  It seems to me that there is no need to go down this road and doing this could interfere unduly with normal risk taking and normal trading practices.  Any creditor who wants to protect himself can also look for a floating charge on the assets of the company overall. There are manys ways a creditor can protect himself, short of putting into company law a retention of title clause to be automatic in every single supply of goods.</P>
    <P>That is an unreasonable incursion into normal trading practice and it is totally unnecessary.  I cannot really proceed on the basis that suppliers of goods will not look at how they can protect themselves. If you proceeded on that basis, you would have to rewrite a lot of law.  You have got to proceed on the basis that people doing business will look at what options they have and behave reasonably sensibly.</P>

      <P>In page 91, to delete lines 18 to 27 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;286.&mdash;(1)  Subject to the provisions of this section, any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other act relating to property made or done by or against a company which is unable to pay its debts as they become due in favour of any creditor, or of any person on trust for any creditor, with a view to giving such creditor, or any surety or guarantor for the debt due to such creditor, a preference over the other creditors, shall, if a winding-up of the company commences within 6 months of the making or doing the same and the company is at the time of the commencement of the winding-up unable to pay its debts (taking into account the contingent and prospective liabilities), be deemed a fraudulent preference of its creditors and be invalid accordingly.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>These two related amendments, Government amendments Nos. 148 and 151, look quite complicated but the reason for them is fairly straightforward. It has been strongly represented to me that the company law treatment of fraudulent preference is unnecessarily convoluted, involving cross-references to bankruptcy law, the Eleventh Schedule to the 1963 Act, and so on, and that it would be very useful and desirable to consolidate the statutory provisions involved in the Companies <Col N="685" /> Acts.  Having looked at the law involved, I have to agree.  The purpose of amendment No. 148, therefore, is to consolidate company law relating to fraudulent preference into one section.  This is a very significant advance in tidying up company law on fraudulent preference.  Basically, we are tidying up procedures.</P>
      <P>At present, under the 1963 Act, fraudulent preference is defined in the context of bankruptcy law.  The relevant provisions contained in section 53 of the Bankruptcy Ireland (Amendment) Act, 1872, was amended by the Eleventh Schedule to the Companies Act, 1963. Section 104 of this Bill, as presently drafted, re-enacts section 286 (1) without change and the present amendment proposes to incorporate into the body of section 286, with necessary modification, the relevant provisions of section 53 of the 1872 bankruptcy Act.  Basically, amendments Nos. 148 and 151 are there to tidy up and consolidate existing law in the area of fraudulent preference.</P>

      <P>In page 91, line 36, to delete &ldquo;(i)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;(a)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People get a certain view of structures.  I am a highly structured and disciplined person and I find it easy on my eye that there is a certain set model for outlining the sections of the legislation.  There are examples of this in the Companies (No. 2) Bill, as initiated.  For instance, in section 55, Senators will see the normal run.  Normally we use the bold numbering for a section; the faded numbering for <Col N="686" /> the subsection; a lower case letter for a paragraph and lower case Roman numerals for the sub-paragraph.  If Senators look at section 55 they will see the normal run, the heavy type 55, the light type (1), the lower case (a) and (b) beneath that, and after that the numbers (i), (ii) and (iii).  In another example, on page 47, it is even easier to see.  This convention goes right through the legislation as it is presented nowadays.  One can see immediately whether it is a section, a subsection, a paragraph, or a sub-paragraph.</P>
    <P>I recognise that we are looking at legislation which was drafted in 1963.  Perhaps that convention was not operative at that time in all cases.  In order to have a certain consistency &mdash; I would not always attempt to find refuge in consistency as an argument &mdash; we should replace the numerals by letters; paragraph (i) with (a) and paragraph (ii) with (b).  I hope the Minister will be able to take this on board without doing any serious damage to the legislation.</P>

      <Col N="688" /> The ordinary person in the street, if such exists, would respond to these amendments. Public response to descriptions and illustrations, radio and television programmes on companies going out of business and the directors fraudulently trading or otherwise, really capture the imagination.</P>
    <P>I know it is not appropriate to raise a question on the section but I would like to hear the Minister give a fairly detailed run-down of the term &ldquo;fraudulent trading&rdquo;. He referred to the Cork report time and again.  I know the Cork report used the term &ldquo;wrongful trading&rdquo;.  On three occasions in the past two days the Minister has referred to the interpretation of similar legislation in the British courts. That is a good thing.  We all know, no matter what we may say to the contrary, that both systems of justice grew together along the way.  One of the great regrets must be that much of the legislation went in different directions in the past 20 or 30 years.  We are now going to be in a situation where the British courts will interpret &ldquo;wrongful trading&rdquo; and the Irish courts will interpret &ldquo;fraudulent trading&rdquo;.  It is important that we should hear the reasons for the different terms. I have no doubt there is a good reason but I would like to have it explained.</P>
    <P>Regarding the two amendments, almost all our discussion on protection applies to this section.  We could repeat the debate and everything would be relevant to section 106.  Everything Senator Hogan and other Senators said this morning about protecting the small supplier is relevant to this section.  When I first read the Bill, I put down these two amendments. The section, as it is written at present, allows the person who is found guilty of an offence of fraudulent trading to be either imprisoned or fined.  I disagree with that.  I think it should be imprisonment.  I have many reasons for saying that.  I noted the Minister's comments yesterday when we were discussing the Revenue Commissioners attempting to collect for the State their due entitlement. The Minister used very careful language and referred to sheriffs threatening jail.  I noted the words very carefully <Col N="689" /> because they are the traditional words of Governments in this area.  In all fairness, nobody to my knowledge has ever been imprisoned in this State for the non-payment of income tax due even though the power is there in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I want to put this case in context.  The Minister has proposed a fine and imprisonment with, perhaps, the best will in the world and in the Government amendment it is proposed to increase the fine from £10,000 to £50,000.  May I ask a simple question that deserves a straight answer?  If the Guinness affair were to happen in Ireland and in one aspect of fraudulent trading, one decision on one day could fraudulently dispose of £7 million &mdash; this is the kind of thing that can happen; I know it is not a direct analogy; I know it happened in a different set of circumstances and it did not apply to company law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us say a major brewery.  Where is the point in taking somebody who has defrauded somebody else of £7 million and fining him or her £10,000 or £50,000?  It becomes irrelevant. If we do an inversion of the economies of scale, it does not make any sense at all.  Let us take the example of a company which ran up debts of £? million. They did it quite fraudulently.  Everybody was quite aware of the fact.  They shut down shop in County Dublin putting a large number of people out of work and leaving debts of £? million.  Under existing legislation they set up again the following week in Tyrone in the same concrete supply business and were supplying the same people in the South.  The reason I refer to that case is that the workers staged a sit-in in order to try to emphasise their right to work and they finished up in jail for contempt of court while, at the same time, the directors were in the Grey Door restaurant celebrating their coup of £? million.  That is a true story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> That is the reason this legislation is before us.  I know the Minister would be as concerened about that as I would be. The legislation seeks to stop that kind of thing happening.  We have the example where somebody fraudulently traded a company into £? million debt, and we are now saying the maximum fine is £50,000.  I know the Minister can come back to me and say: &ldquo;It is imprisonment or a fine of £50,000, or both,&rdquo; I do not think that is appropriate.  I also think that it should be criminal liability rather than civil liability.  Money in this area lets people off the hook.  It should be a mandatory jail sentence for somebody who is found guilty under this section.</P>
    <P>I looked very carefully at my own amendments and I think that my first amendment No. 152 which arises on summary conviction is wrong.  I hereby withdraw amendment No. 152.</P>

      <P>I see the case for having something like that here.  Amendment No. 153 deals with the case where somebody has been indicted and convicted of this kind of fraudulent activity. I think he deserves a jail sentence.  We know that a mandatory jail sentence does not mean that somebody has to go to jail. There are all sorts of ways of getting round the legal system but I think it lacks proportion to have simply a fine of up to £50,000 for offences which could cost millions of pounds.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add to the remarks that I made on the last occasion on which we had the opportunity to discuss this very important group of motions, especially the Cecchini report.  There is a need to make additional information on past benefits and the future development of the Community available to every member of the public and I believe it is essential that our people should be fully informed of the many benefits which have accrued from our membership of the European Community. We are now accelerating towards further European integration and the completion of the internal market.  No one can doubt that there is a great deal of will right across the Community today. The recent French presidential election and general election were fought mainly on the question of their preparedness for the 1992 deadline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one can doubt that there is a great deal of will today in all the countries of the Community.  In Great Britain, Lord Young, the Minister with the responsibility to do so, launched their campaign <Col N="692" /> some time around the middle of April. They adopted the very appropriate slogan: &ldquo;Europe, open for business&rdquo;.  On the same occasion, the President of the Commission make a very interesting contribution. He said, and this in the main would also apply to this country, that &ldquo;everyone should benefit from the large market&rdquo;, and &ldquo;it would be wrong to think that 1992 is only for business.  It should also be thus for the world at large, since the new coherence of the Community adds to our already strong political role in the world where the Community is increasingly a force for peace&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to receive yesterday an invitation from the Taoiseach to attend the launch of our country's programme on 4 July in the Concert Hall which is intended to create an awareness of and to prepare our society to participate in and benefit from the completed market after 1992.  While we must be one of the last countries to get our programme under way, I am confident that the Government and the Departments concerned will have a successful launch.  I wish the campaign well and I hope it will receive the support not just of business people which the UK has stressed is needed, but of all those who have influence in the areas of politics, administration and in the economy.  If we are really serious about providing a better standard of living and opportunities for our population in an effort to stem the flow of emigration, we must be prepared to take the opportunities which will be presented.  On the other hand, we could sit back and be swamped by the overproduction of the other 11 member states.  It is one of the most serious problems that we, as a country, have had to face in a long time and I hope everyone concerned will do their bit and take this matter quite seriously.  I do not know what our slogan will be but the English slogan &ldquo;Europe, open for business&rdquo; is one that will give us some food for thought.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the media for this but most of the vibes coming from Europe seem to be negative.  People are inclined to look on Europe in terms of what they <Col N="693" /> do not get and what they expect.  Let me give a breakdown of some of the benefits we received during the 15 years of our membership of the Community.  There was a very interesting series of debates earlier this year in the European Parliament on the consequences of not completing the internal market.  I am sure the reports of those debates are available in the House but it is a pity that we do not have an opportunity to consider them more fully.  I hope the Committee on Procedure and Privileges can devise a system which will enable us to have at least monthly debates on this subject so that we can have an input in creating public awareness of what exactly is at stake.</P>
    <P>When Ireland joined the European Community in January 1973, an additional clause was provided in the Treaty of Accession which recognised our relative economic under-development and the need to bridge the gap with other member states.  Since then we have been a major beneficiary of Community financing, receiving grants and subsidies amounting to approximately £9,000 million over that period.  Last year alone &mdash; and perhaps the Minister would confirm this &mdash; we received just over £900 million in total from all sources.  The economic importance for Ireland of Community membership is certainly indisputable, even though many people still cannot see this and are inclined to blame the Community for so many things.</P>
    <P>The financial benefits Ireland receives at present from the European Community far outstrip those for the other member states.  For example, the net transfers per head of population for 1986 were as follows: France, £6; the United Kingdom, £18; Greece, £75; and Ireland, £200.  It is estimated that, in the absence of these transfers, VAT rates and income tax levels would have to be increased by up to 25 per cent in order to make up the necessary revenue.  On average, since 1973 for every £1 we contributed to the European Community budget, we have received £5.18 by way of grants and subsidies. In addition, the European Investment Bank also lends moneys to provide <Col N="694" /> loans to assist investment in infrastructure, energy and industry.  We have drawn loans worth £1.9 billion from community sources.</P>
    <P>The main instruments of funding, which we are all sick of hearing, from the European Communities are known as the structural funds.  The major funds are the European Agriculture Guidance Fund, the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund which was established back in 1975, I am glad to say during my own Presidency of that Commission.  Lord Thompson of Dundee put in tremendous work in the establishment of that fund which was on and off for many years previously.  It was a great break-through.  The early years of Ireland's membership are completely understated.</P>
    <P>Dr. Hillery, our distinguished President, who was Irish Commissioner at that time put a lot of work into the development of the Social Fund, which was tailor-made to suit conditions prevailing in this country.  Many areas of social activity have benefited to a great degree from the Social Fund.  Prior to the implementation of Dr. Hillery's social action programme it was not possible for funds to be expended on any area of activity from which an economic return could not be expected.  As a result of the changes brought about we have in every county well organised schools and day care centres to cater for physically and mildly mentally retarded persons, and this again, relates back to the social action programme which Dr. Hillery introduced.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy is better known in Ireland as the Guarantee and Guidance Fund.  Our agricultural industry has benefited enormously from our membership of the Community which has brought guaranteed prices, development grants and access to a huge market of 320 million people.  The Community now accounts for four-fifths of our agricultural exports and up to the end of 1986 we had received more than £5,000 million in price supports from the Common Agricultural Policy as well as <Col N="695" /> almost £500 million in farm modernisation and development grants for the development of food processing and better marketing and distribution.  Prosperity in the farming sector has also had a spin-off in the Irish economy as a whole, by creating additional jobs not only in the food area but also in the agri-processing and the agriculture input sectors.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy is divided into two sections of expenditure. The guarantee section has financed expenditure on the reorganisation of markets and exports to non-member countries and the cost of intervention to stabilise the markets.  This has been of great benefit to this country, to those involved in all sectors of the industry.  My one fear is that people will become too reliant and over-dependent on these compensatory amounts which have meant so much to our economy.  I was glad to read recently that Ireland received over £800 million from the guarantee section alone in 1986.</P>
    <P>The FEOGA guidance section subsidises measures to improve agricultural structures, such as farm modernisation, vocational training, headage grants in the disadvantaged areas, herd conversion schemes, disease eradication, drainage and food marketing and processing.  This section also provides aid for the restructuring, modernisation and development of fisheries and aquaculture.  This aid has given a marvellous boost to our economy. The way in which the Government operate and administer these schemes leaves considerable food for thought.  Let us take the western development scheme which I think is a great scheme.  Under the western package farmers residing on the west bank of the River Shannon receive significant grants whereas the majority of those residing on the east side of the river, in the counties of Offaly and Tipperary, for example do not.  Some of the more devastated valleys have been included under the latest redrawing of the boundaries of disadvantaged areas but until last year, or the year before, they were not considered to be deserving of any aid, even though the river floods <Col N="696" /> on both sides to about four or five feet of water, for four or five months of each year.  That is something that our civil servants, especially the senior officials in the Department of Agriculture and Food, have nothing to feel proud about. That problem should have been addressed back in 1974, 1975 or 1976 whenever that scheme was introduced.  It is unfortunate that this problem has been allowed to drag on, given that these are important aids to the agricultural sector and the fact that Counties Laois and Offaly have the lowest density of population in the entire 32 Counties.  These problems have not been addressed for whatever reason, by any Administration.</P>
    <P>There is a growing recognition of the need to develop our food industry, that is to market farm produce in acceptable processed and packaged form, and further recognition of the potential for the creation of jobs and national wealth in the food industry.  This has stimulated a lot of activity among existing food companies which are expanding and improving their facilities and has also inspired some completely new enterprises.  A good deal of investment is required and this is helped; again, by grants from the Guidance and Guarantee Fund.</P>
    <P>We have been slow in encouraging the value-added aspect of high quality produce and I hope the Government will continue to encourage it, especially over the next five years.  There is no doubt, with our environment being a plus, that it would be of tremendous benefit if we were able to sell wholesome Irish food, packaged and presented in the appropriate way.  For example, in December of last year, Ireland was allocated aid amounting to almost £10 million for 24 agricultural projects.  This aid from the Community hardly receives any notice in this country.</P>
    <P>Let me outline the spread of activities in the Leinster area: the provision of beef processing facilities in Athy; the modernisation of existing lifestock marketing facilities in Granard; the modernisation of potato processing facilities in Ashbourne; the provision of a centralised pig slaughtering facility at Grannagh, <Col N="697" /> County Kilkenny; the provision of beef processing facilities in Kilbeggan, which are going very well; the provision of additional barley storage facilities in Tullamore; the provision of pigmeat and sheepmeat processing facilities in Hacketstown; the modernisation of poultry processing facilities in Glenealy; and the provision of facilities for three salmon rearing projects in Carlingford.</P>
    <P>Altogether £3,500,000 was spent on those nine projects which provided a significant number of jobs in each of those small areas.  It is amazing that a considerable amount of grant-aid can be made available through the Community without receiving any notice and without a word of thanks.  Our public do not recognise the value of the Community and do not appreciate the contribution that it makes.  I have not outlined the actual amounts that each of those firms received but in most cases they are in six figures.  It would be unfair to put the names of the businesses concerned on the record.  I wish each and every one of those nine businesses continuous success.</P>
    <P>The Regional Fund, which as I mentioned earlier, was set up by Lord Thompson during his term as Commissioner, has proved to be of tremendous benefit to this country.  The Fund was set up some time around 1975 with the objective, outlined in the Treaty of Rome, of correcting the imbalances between the wealthier nations and the poorer nations.  I do not think that even a doubling of the Regional Fund after 1992 would compensate for the magnetic attraction of the original golden triangle, even though I am sure it will be of help. The idea behind the fund which is, again, outlined in the original Treaty of Rome is that the fund will be used as an instrument to transfer resources from the richer to the less developed regions, which tend to be on the periphery.</P>
    <P>The entire country is classified as an area qualifying for the maximum level of aid.  Since the establishment of the fund it has contributed in excess of £700 million for infrastructure development such as, the building of roads, harbours, water <Col N="698" /> and sewerage works, support for initiatives in the tourist industry and industrial development, such as a series of measures in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry, craft, tourist and service sectors.  The funds rules were revised a few years ago.  Under the Single European Act direct access to the Fund was given for the first time, from my reading of it, to very many people and organisations, such as local authorities. Indeed, during the debate on that Act in this House the Minister confirmed that. I attended the annual meeting of the General Council of County Councils held in Athlone last weekend.</P>

      <P>It was very interesting and very well organised and I would like to compliment Roscommon County Council and our two colleagues from that area, Senator Mullooly and Senator Seán Fallon, both of whom presided over sessions. In one of the earlier sessions the main speaker was an assistant secretary from my favourite Department, the Department of Finance, who was upset at the inconvenience that some Irish local authorities were causing the Commission by asking to go out to see what was going on.  As if the Single European Act was not an Act of the Oireachtas, he said that it was the Department of Finance who would decide what projects would be included in the applications for grant-aid under the Regional Development Fund. This usurpation of power is typical of the Department of Finance.  The Single European Act is quite explicit; it is there in black and white.  Either the Department of Finance implement the Acts of the Oireachtas or we are nothing.  Under the Single European Act local authorities have direct access to the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The week after Easter, a delegation from the joint committee travelled out for an entire week and held protracted discussions with the Commission, the European Investment Bank and the Court of Auditors.  Not only can local authorities apply directly for grant-aid <Col N="699" /> under any of those funds, but the European Investment Bank also welcome applications for funding from local authorities, the one criteria being that the application should be of a certain size, either £1 million or £3 million, I am not too sure which.  In preparing an application of that magnitude they pointed out that there would be nothing to stop a group of local authorities putting a package together to suit their needs.  In addition, it would be possible for the local authorities and the bank to organise Regional Development Fund assistance to subsidise the repayments of interest.</P>
    <P>Listening to the assistant secretary of the Department of Finance, with a complete story of their own, one began to wonder if we are really wasting our time here, does legislation mean anything and whether the policies latest being espoused by the Commission mean anything as far as Irish administration is concerned. I would like the Minister when replying to this debate to let us know exactly where we stand in so far as access to central European funds is concerned. I do not want to widen the debate, but will local authorities have an opportunity to draw up their own list of priorities for the development and maintenance of the infrastructures in every county in this country?  I am not making a political point but I want to know exactly what the position is and why the administration of the Single European Act is completely different from that outlined in the Act?  Is this being done by way of regulation?  I would like a straightforward explanation.</P>
    <P>That being said, I am very happy that the Leinster area has received over £103 million from the Regional Fund since it was set up.  My only regret is that my own county of Laois seems to have come off worst in that Carlow received £11.9 million; Kildare, £11.9 million; Kilkenny, £9.8 million; Longford, £5.5 million; Louth, £11.9 million; Meath, £6.6 million; Offaly, £4.8 million; Westmeath, £13.3 million; Wexford, £9.3 million, and Wicklow, £13.4 million while Laois <Col N="700" /> received only £4.8 million, with an additional £9.2 million for various crosscountry schemes such as the scheme for the main national primary route from the port of Rosslare to the midlands.  Many other grants were made available which facilitated the development of very important infrastructural works in each one of the counties mentioned.  For instance these include the extension, expansion and production of high quality work-wear in Tullamore, the construction of a raw sewage scheme in Blessington, a manufacturing plant in Dunshaughlin, the manufacture of moulding tools in Bray, a water supply scheme in Kilmacoo in Wicklow, and a factory in Dundalk.  The list goes on with every county in the region benefiting substantially. In addition, the Minister for the Environment told us in the House recently that £194 million of Regional Development Fund grant-aid for road development has been put to very good use.  The only thing I have to say about this funding is that in the allocation of funding it was not very clear where it was being spent.  I have a very strong suspicion that no additional funds were made available.  I think that some of those European Regional Development Funds substituted for funds made available by the Department of the Environment.  I do not think additional funds were provided and I think this is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>Back in the seventies we advocated that each local authority should put up a sign saying that a project was being developed with European Regional Development fund assistance.  That was great.  After great hassle, in my own council area in respect of a sewerage scheme on the main road from Dublin to Kilkenny and Waterford we eventually got a sign erected.  That was five years ago and it has not even started yet.  It is an embarrassment at this stage and should be taken down.  While the money was sanctioned in all good faith, it fell foul to either cutbacks, a re-arrangement of priorities, or whatever.  I think that annoys the local inhabitants to an extraordinary degree.</P>

      <P>I am not blaming the Minister.  The point I am making is that funding from Europe should not always be regarded negatively.  It should be seen in a better light.  When they put up the sign they should have done the work, especially when they said they got their money.  If they did not get the money, they should not have put up the sign.</P>
      <P>The finance that has come from Europe has made a tremendous contribution in upgrading living and working standards.  I am confident that the Minister will launch the proposals and projects on 4 July.  I hope we will be able to order the business of this House so that every month the Minister will at least have an opportunity to talk to us on some aspect of the programme to try to keep the pressure on.</P>
      <P>As I said on the last occasion, I regret that we are discussing these eight motions together.  They are of considerable significance but, because they have been grouped together this does not give the House an opportunity to deal at length with any one of them.  This is a pity.  Some of them are quite obscure but all of them received tremendous thought and study by the joint committee.  It is a pity that they should get short shrift here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cecchini report gave people throughout the Community an opportunity to consider what the Community would be like without the co-operation and effort being put into it.  It is important to put on the record the fact that, while we have benefited considerably in financial terms we must not forget the input Irish personnel have put into the evolvement of the Community over the past 15 years.  I can say without fear or favour that the quality, input and dedication, especially of civil servants who commute back and forth to Brussels every week, have been significant and of a very high standard.  They have taken with them to Europe their impeccable status and professionalism in their approach to the day to day problems of the Community <Col N="702" /> and that great honest, &ldquo;ungetatable&rdquo; dimension for which the Irish public service are famous.  I have always been impressed by the dedication shown by the civil servants who are engaged in our European activities.  If one gets a brief from them they seem to have a knowledge on a par with an encyclopaedia about even the most obscure work.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of the day, Deputy Peter Barry, and the Government on the very painstaking and careful way they got around the problem of our policy of neutrality.  That leaves the door open for countries like Sweden and Austria, and perhaps Switzerland, to fill the gaps in Europe.  The bigger the Community, the greater peace and freedom that will be guaranteed.  I hope the Government, the Tánaiste and his Ministers of State will take a very positive view on the application for the accession of Turkey to the Community.  It is a huge country which has held a 2,000 mile frontier with the Soviet Union for the past 40 years.  That country's economy is very clearly on the move.  It has, by some extraordinary method, combined very high technology with a high manpower input.  I do not know how it has achieved that and I would dearly love to see it in operation here.  It has achieved this new modern mix while at the same time employing a high percentage of people in its new and modern technology sector.  I hope our Department and Ministers will support their application because the accession of that country would guarantee peace in that region.  The desire of the founding fathers of the Community was to ensure that there would not be a third World War.  The underlying reason for their getting together three or four years after the end of World War II was to ensure that that would not happen again and to save future generations from the holocausts, ravages, hardships, pain and suffering of war.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister, the Tánaiste and the Government well in the launch of their programme to create an awareness of the problems we need to surmount so that they will not impinge on our progress and that we will be in a position to benefit <Col N="703" /> 100 per cent from the new market after 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the studies which were conducted by the Cecchini Commission was to estimate the likely impact of the completion of the internal market on the economy of the Community as a whole.  The documentation produced by the studies runs to some 6,000 pages, but the digest of the report by Paolo Cecchini, entitled <i>The European Challenge 1992 &mdash; The Benefits of a Single Market</i>, contains the main conclusions of the studies.  The commission set about their task, first, by endeavouring to identify and quantify the huge cost to the Community of existing barriers to trade and then by proceeding to assess the potential benefits which will accrue to the Community as a whole from the completion of the internal market.</P>
      <P>The completion of the internal market has been an objective of the Community since its establishment in 1957.  The opening lines of the Treaty of Rome spelled out this goal in specific terms, and I quote:</P>
      <P>The Community shall have as its task, by establishing a common market and progressively approximating the economic policies of Member States, to promote throughout the Community a harmonious development of economic activities, a continuous and balanced expansion, an increase in stability, an accelerated raising of the standard of living and closer relations between the States belonging to it.</P>
      <P>The Treaty clearly envisaged that the Community's prosperity and, in turn, its political and economic unity would depend on a single integrated market.  In order to bring this about it set out specific provisions for the free movement of goods, services, people and capital.  It also foresaw that these provisions would need to be backed up by other action, such as establishing freedom of competition and developing common legislation where necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the clear terms set out in the <Col N="704" /> Treaty, many of the orginal barriers to the internal market still remain and some new ones have sprung up over the years. Among the barriers to trade are the varying national technical specifications, health and safety standards, environmental regulations, quality controls and the differences in indirect taxation which exist throughout the Community.  In addition, there are still very real obstacles to the free movement of people.  Consequently, the member states have largely remained 12 separate markets and as a result the Community has lost ground to its main competitors, namely, the United States and Japan.  On their own the member states simply cannot compete effectively with the giant resources of Japan and the United States.  Only a single European market of 320 million which allows business to flourish on a large scale, both in terms of manufacturing research and innovation, can provide the base and the environment to meet this challenge.</P>
    <P>The added costs which arise from the currently fragmented situation make many European products uncompetitive on the world market since they all add to what the consumer has to pay for the finished article.  Among the major costs which result from this fragmentation are the high administrative costs incurred in dealing with different national bureaucratic requirements, higher transport costs, the increased costs which result from having to apply different national standards and the duplication of costs involved in separate research and development.  The studies carried out by the Cecchini Commission conclude that the various non-tariff barriers to which I have referred result in an additional cost burden to industry of approximately 3½ per cent of the value of the goods produced. The report states that in some industries, such as road and air transport and financial services, the additional costs involved are much higher and could be of the order of between 10 per cent and 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The report also estimates that the potential economic gain from the completion of the internal market for the <Col N="705" /> Community as a whole is of the order of 200 billion ECUs, which would add almost 5 per cent to the Community's gross domestic product in the short term. The report predicts that the completion of the internal market will also have a price reducing effect which could be of the order of 6 per cent.  This, combined with a possible 7 per cent growth in Community gross domestic product in the longer term, could lead to the creation of up to five million additional new jobs in the Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Obviously, therefore, the potential gains for the Community from the completion of the internal market are very considerable.  However, it goes without saying that the likelihood is that these gains will not be spread evenly over all the 12 member states of the Community. This fact was acknowledged by the member states when they drew up the Single European Act which enshrines the completion of the internal market by 1992.  They recognised that the larger and more developed economies of the EC stood to gain most from the process and that the more disadvantaged areas of the Community would have to be assisted if disparities between the richer and poorer regions were not to be exacerbated.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, there is a commitment to pursue the objective of economic and social cohesion in conjunction with the completion of the internal market.  The mechanisms by which this will be done were put in place at the summit meeting in February of this year.  The expansion of the budget which was agreed at that meeting will be accompanied by a significant rise in the Community's structural funds.  These are the principal vehicles through which the Community assists economic development and they are to be gradually increased in size up to 1992 when they will be approximately 80 per cent higher than at present.  For the less developed regions, of which Ireland is one, there will be a doubling of the level of aid from the structural funds by 1992.  This increased assistance to the less prosperous regions of the Community will enable them to achieve a level <Col N="706" /> of economic and infrastructural development which will ensure that they will be able to compete fully in the new market and benefit from the opportunities which the barrier-free internal market will offer.</P>
    <P>In the implementation of the structural fund reforms we have been told that there will be new rules and procedures in relation to the submission and processing of applications and that there will be a move away from assistance for projects to the funding of integrated regional programmes. In this regard the Government should endeavour to spell out as soon as possible how the new programme approach to the structural funds will operate so that the maximum benefits will accrue to the country from the increased funds which will be available.  I hope &mdash; and Senator McDonald referred to this &mdash; that it will be possible for local authorities to submit schemes directly for aid from the structural funds.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms levelled at the Cecchini report is that it does not attempt to analyse the regional distribution of the projected gains and losses.  It deals in the main with the industrial sector and does not address the regional implications of the completion of the market.  The analysis contained in the report is based mainly on research which was done almost entirely in some of the more developed of the 12 member states.  These are the states which stand to gain most from the single market.  The likely beneficial effects on the peripheral and lesser developed states, of which Ireland is one, have not been analysed or quantified in the report and neither have the problems which are likely to arise for these regions been identified.  It is important, therefore, that we should endeavour to analyse the likely impact of the completion of the internal market on our economy and the problems which it will present for us.</P>
    <P>One area in which this has already been done in some detail is in relation to the harmonisation of indirect taxes.  The harmonisation programme in question incorporates a series of proposals to apply similar excise duties on a wide range of products and to bring value-added tax <Col N="707" /> bands in the member states into line.  The direct impact of bringing Irish indirect taxes into line with the rest of the Community would reduce consumer prices in this country by about 3 per cent.  This would result in a significant improvement in the competitiveness of our economy and in the opportunities for job creation. Loss of business due to the distortion of competition would be eliminated with consequent beneficial effects for the Border towns.  The Minister for Finance has pointed out that the gross cost to the Irish Exchequer in the first year would be approximately £470 million and £350 million annually thereafter.  It is in the interest of Ireland to participate fully in the process of harmonising indirect taxes. However, I recognise that in view of the revenue implications which are involved, assistance will have to be obtained from EC sources if harmonisation by 1992 is to become a reality for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that a derogation from the process of harmonisation of indirect taxes would be in Ireland's interests, even if it were possible to obtain such a derogation. The result would be that Irish industry would be forced to incur unnecessary Border clearance charges and distribution costs; Border customs clearance delays would remain; imported material costs would be adversely affected; distortions of competition would continue to obtain; investment in Ireland would be inhibited and Ireland's attractiveness as a location for extra Community projects would be reduced. Therefore, I believe it is essential that a solution to the revenue difficulties which the harmonisation proposals will create for Ireland should be found at a Community level.</P>
    <P>The potential gains for this country are so great that we cannot afford to risk missing out on the opportunities which will be available to us.  However, we must also recognise that improved access and the greater opportunities which will result from the completion of the internal market will also be available to our EC partners.  Inevitably, the result will be a more competitive market.  It is of vital <Col N="708" /> importance, therefore, for industry in Ireland, first to figure out where the new competition will come from and, second, where the new markets will be so that they can make the necessary preparations to take on the first and obtain the maximum benefits from the second.  It should also be recognised that only the most efficient, competitive and quality conscious industries will flourish in the new environment.  Now is the time to plan in terms of production, distribution and marketing to meet the challenges that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as a major food producer, stands to benefit greatly from the removal of the plethora of non-tariff barriers relating to the food industry.  The introduction of a single specification and labelling system will be of immense benefit to Irish food exporters.  It is imperative that we capitalise on the clean image our nation has and build up a reputation in new markets as a producer and exporter of quality food.  If we do this our products will command premium prices and great opportunities will be available to Irish processors in markets which were heretofore not accessible to us.  In this context, I believe the time has come to commence marketing Irish beef under a brand name which will be synonmous with quality and purity and recognisable throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>Some speakers referred to the lack of linguistic skills among Irish people.  It is regrettable that so few Irish people are able to speak a foreign language as compared with their European counterparts. It has been suggested that this will adversely affect our ability to take full advantage of the opportunities which will be available in the new integrated market.  While this may be the case with regard to some job opportunities which will inevitably come on stream in the various members states, I doubt that it will prevent our exporters from maximising the benefits and the opportunities the single European market will present. However, the teaching of European languages needs to be addressed urgently in our educational system and I sincerely hope that every effort will be made to <Col N="709" /> ensure that the position will improve significantly in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I welcome the news that the Government are about to launch a national campaign to increase awareness among the public and, in particular, among industry of the implications of 1992.  The degree to which we will benefit from the huge barrier-free market which will be opened up to us will depend on how well we are prepared to meet the challenges and the opportunities with which we will be faced.  No sector of the economy can afford to be complacent.  We must not repeat the mistakes which were made in the run up to our joining the Community in 1973.  Complacency on the part of certain sectors at that time meant that we did not exploit fully the opportunities which membership of the Community created for us.  Failure to prepare adequately to meet the challenges of the new more competitive environment which was created at that time meant that certain industries went to the wall.  I believe this would not have happened to the same extent if there had been a greater willingness beforehand on the part of these industries to face up to the problems and the difficulties with which they would inevitably be faced.  This must be avoided at all costs on this occasion. If the Goverment's awareness programme is successful and if all sectors are adequately prepared by the time 1992 comes around, the benefits which will accrue to Ireland in the integrated European market will be very considerable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The reports before us this evening are very broad-ranging.  The Cecchini report deals mainly with the industrial side of the European Community and the decline in job creation in Europe.  Since we joined the Community in 1973, it has produced somewhere in the region of one million new jobs whereas during the same period some 20 million jobs were created in the United States. This happened despite the fact that the Community has something like 22 per cent of world trade compared to 15 per cent for the United States and 7 per cent for Japan.  The fundamental question <Col N="710" /> arises as to why the Community which has such a large proportion of world trade has not done better in the creation of employment.  The single market, which will allow the free movement of goods, is bound to do a good deal for the Community. The Cecchini report says that the overall effect of this will be something like a 5 per cent increase in gross domestic product.  I welcome that aspect of the single market.</P>
      <P>The other important aspect that emerges relates to standardisation.  For instance, 12 different standards were set down in the Community for mobile telephones which are being used more nowadays, and it was only possible to standardise these recently.  In the United States one basic model of mobile telephone can be sold throughout the country. Because problems still remain in relation to electrical appliances and the different plugs and sockets used in member states the question of standardisation is very important.  This is long overdue and has been an obstacle to industrial growth and the growth of trade in the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of the new development which worries me in the local Irish context is the whole business of the changes that are coming about in the structural funds.  It is proposed that the structural funds are to be doubled by 1992 but it is in the area of the Regional Fund where Ireland is one single region that I have most concern.  If there is a further breaking down of the country into other regions I would suggest, as has been suggested by John Hume as a member of the European Parliament, that nine regions would be appropriate.  Work is being done at present by a steering committee in Dublin.  Some work is being done in the Cork area and for the west in order to gear up for the changes that are coming about in the structural funds.  A very retrograde step taken by the Government was the abolition of the regional development organisations.  The South Eastern Regional Development Organisation which operated in the area from which I <Col N="711" /> come was finally disbanded on Tuesday of this week.</P>
    <P>The Buchanan report which is the only real study that has been done of the regions in this country was commissioned in 1962 and the basis of it was that each region would be built around a capital and this strategy &mdash; I will relate it to my own area here, the south eastern region &mdash; was constructed around Waterford city as its capital.  I believe that the regional development organisation played a very meaningful role and could have continued to play a very meaningful role and a much more meaningful role as we moved towards 1992 and the changes in the structural funds.  It provided a forum for public representatives to meet and to discuss areas of common interest. For instance, the South Eastern Regional Development Organisation had developed a water management plan for the south eastern region and, in general, these regional development organisations broadened the horizons of public representatives and in that way geared us up for this new structure.  There will be a Government plan for the whole country made up of programmes from regions and that programme will, at the end of the day, contain projects which will be carried out in the various counties.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in regional airports.  I am chairman of the south eastern regional airport committee in Waterford and one of the criticisms I would have of the Community is that there are very grandiose documents regarding the development of local and regional airports but there have been no funds to back them up.  I was pleased to hear the Minister for the Environment say in Athlone last weekend at the annual general meeting of the General Council of County Councils that the new approach in the structural fund would relate in terms of roads to national primary roads, to regional roads and to access roads to ports and to airports.  At present, at Waterford Regional Airport where we have a very successful scheduled flight operating between Waterford City and Luton, there is a major problem with the <Col N="712" /> access road.  Waterford County Council and Waterford Corporation are undertaking a survey in order to agree on the optimum route.  At the moment there is no regional forum to which that project can be referred.  What will happen is that Waterford County Council and Waterford Corporation jointly will make the approach to Government.</P>
    <P>Taking the Shannon region, the facilities are there for regional development. They have been highly successful down through the years and they are to be absolutely commended on the enterprise that has created jobs and created a lot of important economic activity.  I still worry, not alone about the south eastern region from which I come but also about all the other regions throughout the country outside of the western region, Cork, Dublin and the mid-western part which includes Shannon.  The whole preparation for 1992 is happening a little bit too quickly for us and we are not coming to grips with it.  Mr. Michael Tutty from the Department of Finance, speaking in Athlone last weekend, spoke of steering committees being set up in the various regions, that would be the sub-divisions of the country.  One worrying aspect of that for me was that he seemed to be discounting any meaningful presence of local public representatives on these steering committees.  He spoke possibly of one to represent a region.  It would be a very retrograde step if these steering committees did not have strong representation from local public representatives because the public representatives have a feel for their areas.  They hear a lot more and know a lot more about their areas &mdash; quite often more than officials know &mdash; and any steering committees that are set up without strong public representation as against the official side in my view will not be effective in terms of preparing worthwhile plans and worthwhile directions.  I would hope the Government would get their act together in setting up meaningful bodies in the various regions so that they can prepare their priorities and extract maximum benefit from the changes in the structural fund.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> The Labour Party had reservations about the Single European Act and possibly the largest reservation we had was on the matter of neutrality, Indeed, we also had reservations about bringing taxation into harmony because this country depends to a very large extent on indirect taxation to fund the Exchequer and our rates of VAT, for instance, tend to be high in comparison with our European neighbours.  Our direct taxation is also very high and all of us would like in theory, or on the face of it anyway, to have our taxation in line there, but obviously the money has to come from somewhere to run the country.  We would see this aspiration towards tax harmonisation at this point in time as being a pious aspiration.  Obviously, every Member of the Oireachtas is committed to and wants to see direct taxation lowered as quickly as possible.  We are not terribly happy about indirect taxation either.</P>
    <P>We get down then to the basic problem beyond that, neutrality.  This is of major concern to us.  Throughout the Second World War we maintained our neutrality. We stayed out of the terrible war in Europe, even though many Irish people became involved voluntarily in the war and many of them died.  That is a very large reservation we have in the Labour Party.  Certainly we see that, at the end of the day, it would be to the benefit of the country if the barriers between member states were removed.</P>
    <P>We have much gearing-up to do.  This is very true in the region I come from. For instance, take one industry which is based on an indigenous product, the leather industry.  The leather industry, prior to our joining the Common Market in 1973, employed 1,200 people in four plants, one in Gorey, County Wexford, two in County Waterford &mdash; Portlaw and Dungarvan &mdash; and one in Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary.  One of the aspects of the Common Agricultural Policy is that the only part of the beast which is not subsidised is the hide.  The hides come from the slaughterhouses and are passed on at virtually no cost.  These in turn are sent on to the Manchester market where Irish Leathers had to buy these hides at <Col N="714" /> the world price.  You could have a swing from £15 to £42 in the price of the hides. The hides had to be purchased some three months in advance at the price that obtained at the time.  That industry is virtually gone in the south-eastern region.</P>
    <P>There is a prospering export of hides business going on but it is sad to go to the town of Portlaw, County Waterford &mdash; a town which employed well over 400 people in the tannery when we joined the EC &mdash; and to visit the boardroom in Mayfield House.  There are glass cases around the walls there which have examples of the products that Irish Leathers could produce.  For instance, it was conceded that Irish Leathers in Portlaw produced the best wet-look patent leather in the world.  They had many other products which won European awards.  Here we are with an industry for which the raw material is freely available, the skills are still there but, because of problems within the Community, we have not been able to allow this industry to prosper.  Representations were made through the Labour Party in the early eighties to the European Parliament regarding dumping which was going on from countries outside the Community. For instance, Brazil and Argentina were able to send in finished leather at a price which was, at times, identical with the price Irish Leathers had to pay for the hides.  The protocol which applied to dumping stated that a significant part of the industry &mdash; not necessarily 50 per cent &mdash; would have to object to dumping. The Irish leather industry would be a small part of the European industry.</P>
    <P>We have not really got our act together in the whole area of indigenous industries, of the added-value products of our agricultural produce, our fish and timber. There are vast markets in Europe for upmarket products.  I know the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food is actively involved in this.  We in the Labour Party wish him every success and are very supportive of the work he is doing.  We have the raw material; it is renewable raw material and the markets are there.  The fact that we will be <Col N="715" /> able to move our products into the European Continent more quickly and freely after 1992 can only be for the best.</P>
    <P>This is a very wide subject.  There are other areas where I would have negative comments to make.  We are here now; 1992 is coming.  We must get our act together and to exploit this opportunity to the best of our ability.  We have to use it to create more employment, to stop the outflow of our young people, to stop emigration.  The opportunity is there.  It is a great challenge.  Whatever Government are there in 1992, it is incumbent on all Members of the Oireachtas to push in the same direction to extract the maximum benefit from the changes that are coming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I thank all the Senators who have spoken in the debate for their very thoughful and constructive contributions on the issues which were raised in the Cecchini report?  There is clearly a consensus that these are very important issues for Ireland.  The fact that we are completing the second of two debates in both Houses of the Oireachtas on the report is a clear signal to the key economic operators of the importance we attach to the 1992 process.  It is also a clear signal to the Commission of the attention we are paying to its work in this area.  I am sure our Community partners will note carefully what has been said in our debates here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to reply to the comments made by Senators under two main headings: preparations for the risks and opportunities of completion of the internal market and the development of cohesion.  Before I do that I must refer to the fact that a number of Senators, Senators O'Toole, Haughey, Mullooly and McDonald, mentioned the importance of languages and spoke about education. Unfortunately, there is no mention <i>per se</i> in the Cecchini report. However, a report by the Commission last year pointed to the dangers of the brain drain from outlying areas to the centre.  I assure the Seanad that the <Col N="716" /> Government will encourage any effort made by the Community and within the Community to ensure that those going elsewhere in Europe are well equipped to cope.  The Education Council of Ministers are examining a programme to promote a sense of Europe in all the member states.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and Senator Mullooly spoke about the whole question of languages. I accept that there is a great need to expand our teaching of European languages, but I recall that a number of years ago that same cry went out in relation to our need to expand our teaching of science subjects.  This was done. While having no expertise in the area, I feel that, if we looked at our language teaching on the basis of a non-examination subject, we would make much more progress.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald and Senator Mullooly made special mention of the tremendous potential that is in our food market.  The importance of our food market was recognised by the Government and by the Taoiseach when he appointed a Minister of State with specific responsibility and renamed the Department of Agriculture the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The sentiments expressed by all the Senators have been well taken into account by the Government who recognise the importance &mdash; as the Senators obviously do &mdash; of our food and the high quality of our food and the importance that it will have in future markets.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald laid special emphasis on the tremendous advantage to Ireland of our membership of the Community. He quite rightly said &mdash; and this point was mentioned by a number of Senators &mdash; that these benefits have been somewhat understated.  It is sometimes suggested, as mentioned by Senator Manning, that Ireland has the begging bowl in its hand, that we have no belief in ourselves.  This is untrue.  I am firmly convinced that we have a very clear idea of where we are going and what our objectives are.</P>
    <P>May I also thank the Seanad for their good wishes to the Tánaiste?  As probably <Col N="717" /> most Members know, he has been around the House in the past day or so and is making a very full and, hopefully, complete and early recovery.  I shall certainly pass on to him the good wishes of the Senators who spoke about his good health.</P>
    <P>A point was made by Senator McDonald and Senator Mullooly in relation to a seminar in Athlone recently.  The position at present is that the Community regulations on the Regional Fund require that all applications go through national authorities.  The Government try to set priorities in the national interest as to what projects get funding.  Otherwise, I think Senators would agree, there could be competition between local auhtorities and also between national schemes. However, Senators, particularly those who are members of local authorities, will know that the local authorities are involved and will be involved in the preparation of and applications for schemes. For example, there is the involvement of the local authorities in the Dublin scheme steering group.</P>
    <P>As one who comes from the west of Ireland I was very interested to hear Senator McDonald talk about the £103 million that has gone to the east.  Those of us from the west will be glad to hear that because the myth that everything that came from Europe went to the west has been finally laid to rest.</P>
    <P>Senators spoke about the Government's awareness campaign and the implications of the single market for the Irish economy.  The Government have not been slow in getting preparations under way.  There is, of course, a widespread awareness in this country of what is involved in the completion of the internal market and the process of removing the remaining barriers to trade because of the referendum campaign last year. Senator Mullooly gave some examples of problems that arise from the existing barriers which still remain before the completion of the internal market.  Preparations for a campaign to inform economic operators of the implications of 1992 are at an advanced stage.  The campaign will be launched by the Taoiseach <Col N="718" /> at the National Concert Hall on the morning of 4 July, as referred to by Senator McDonald.  It will be addressed by eminent speakers from Europe and from home.  The speakers will represent business and trade unions interests.  A large number of guests have been invited to the launch representing business, trade union, agriculture, education and other interests.</P>
    <P>The sectoral interests are directly involved in this campaign through the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> machinery.  As the Taoiseach indicated in the Dáil last month, we see the campaign as a task which has to be undertaken with the complete involvement and commitment of the sectors themselves.  I am glad to be able to inform the Seanad that they are gearing up to the task in close co-operation with Government Departments and agencies.</P>
    <P>By targeting our efforts sector by sector, the Government expect to make the maximum impact.  A diffuse, nonspecific approach may give the apprearances of creating awareness.  It will not necessarily inspire the key economic opeators to take the measures that need to be taken to prepare their firms for the completion of the internal market.  It will not necessarily achieve the intended results, which are to ensure that the Irish economy is able to face the demands of a free internal market.</P>
    <P>Senators Manning, Haughey and O'Toole referred rightly to cohesion in the course of the debate.  Article 130 of the Single Act gives a formal position of cohesion in the Community's basic Treaties. As I already mentioned, we are disappointed that, despite the substantial resources devoted to the Cecchini report, the Commission did not attempt an analysis of the potential regional gains and losses on the completion of the internal market.  While we are in no doubt as to the benefits which the internal market will bring, we are also aware from our own historical experiences of the potential adverse effects of economic integration.</P>
    <P>The need to counter these adverse effects was recognised when we joined <Col N="719" /> the Community, in Protocol No. 30 on Ireland, annexed to our Treaty of Accession.  During the debates on the Single European Act in the Dáil and Seanad in 1985, Fianna Fáil speakers recalled the need to ensure that the internal market was completed in the spirit of Protocol 30.  When we came, last year, to ratify the Single European Act, the Government made a declaration to this effect at the time of ratification.  We intend, as the Taoiseach said in the Dáil last month, to ensure that it is acted upon at Community level.  The outcome of the Brussels European Council has given the green light for the application of a programmed approach to the structural fund.  Here again the Government have taken the necessary steps to give practical effect to that approach which has for so long been the aim of the EC Commisison.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned when I opened the debate, the first steps towards the implementation of the programmed approach have been taken and it will gradually extend to the rest of the country. We have demonstrated our alertness to the need to ensure that this country continues to draw the maximum benefit from the funds which are such an important instrument in national development. The Cecchini report makes ambitious claims for the success of the completion of the internal market.  We hope those claims will be met.  The boost which the further freeing of trade will give to the Community's economy is bound to be to Ireland's benefit.  We send nearly three-quarters of our exports to the Community market.  The Government's targets for economic recovery are based on, among other objectives, the further substantial development of exports and the completion of the internal market is bound to be of major benefit to developing exports.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on a matter raised by Senator Fitzsimons in relation to the Report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  He argued for the use of primary legislation rather than secondary legislation in relation to the <Col N="720" /> implementation of European Community directives.  This issue has been raised in the past in both Houses.  I would remind Senators that the decision to use secondary legislation for the most part in implementing directives was taken only after careful consideration.  Directives must be fully applied to member states. The text of the directives is very important in this regard.  If it was not adhered to, departures from the obligations imposed by directives and, therefore, infringements of the directives and of the Treaty of Rome, would be likely to arise. Moreover, the legislative supremacy of the Oireachtas is reflected in the fact that the statutory regulations in question are invariably made pursuant to powers conferred on Ministers by Acts of the Oireachtas, in particular the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald made a similar point in relation to the implementation of the EC Directive on Product Liability, which is covered by the first report of the Joint Committee, and which was also referred to by Senator Fitzsimons.  I understand that the Minister for Industry and Commerce proposes to implement the directive by primary legislation chiefly for the reason that the directive represents a significant new measure in Irish civil law and merits being dealt with by way of primary legislation.  The joint committee in their report strongly recommend this approach so that the substantive issues raised by this directive can be fully considered, a view which is shared by most member states who are also proceeding by way of primary legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons also referred to the first report on the Directive on Product Liability and appeared to have some difficulty in understanding the following statement in the joint committee's report.</P>
    <P>Indeed, depending on the nature of the damage, there would be nothing to stop claims in respect of the same offence being made under each of the laws.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> However, as I understand it, this statement means that, in relation to a a particular offence, a plaintiff could claim under (1), product liability (2), tort law and (3), contract law.  This could arise, for example, in a situation where a plaintiff was claiming damage caused by (a), personal injury or death (b), pain and suffering and (c), damage to the defective product.</P>
    <P>While a claim can be made under product liability for personal injury or death, it cannot be made for pain and suffering or for damage to the defective product itself.  However, under tort law a plaintiff can make a claim for damage caused by pain and suffering and under contract law if a defective product was purchased by the injured person, he or she can claim for damage to the defective product itself. Therefore, three different types of damage can be claimed in respect of the same offence under each of the laws.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDonald also raised a point in relation to report No. 4 of the fifth committee which dealt with the Community Trade Mark.  He said the committee were concerned that the draft regulations on the Community trade mark make no provision for an official search of its registry by the Community trade marks office for prior conflicting registration.  The committee recommended that every effort should be made to secure that at least a search is made and that the new application is notified to owners of appropriate prior registration. I can confirm to the Senator that the current draft of the regulation in question contains such a provision.</P>
    <P>We see the Cecchini report as contributing to the mix of Community policies over the next few years.  It will underline the importance of taking decisions on the proposals on the internal market put forward by the Commission. By itself, the Cecchini report in its findings represents part of the full picture of Community policies albeit a very important part.  The reinforcement of cohesion brought about by the Single Act and the decisions of the February European Council are equally important.  It is the intention of the Government to continue <Col N="722" /> to monitor the implementation of cohesion policies while, of course, fully encouraging the implementation of the integral market.  Again I thank all Senators for their contributions and hope that the debate has been of value.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise the question of the criteria which are used for ensuring that vessels which visit our ports do not carry nuclear weapons. There is a feeling that, at long last, the world is coming to its senses about nuclear weapons.  The Minister and everyone in this House have spent all our adult lives in the shadow of nuclear destruction.</P>
      <P>Many of the great artists of this part of the 20th century, the post Second World War 20th century and, indeed, some people who would be closer to medicine than they are to art in many ways, have written and speculated about the effect on the human psyche of this threat of mass destruction.  Many people have written at length about the fact that humanity's vision of its future must almost inevitably be melancholic because of the threat of mass destruction.</P>
      <P>We have had so many images of what nuclear war and nuclear weapons can do that it is almost pointless now to reiterate them.  We have heard about the nuclear winter.  We have heard about the unborn generations who will show the consequences of nuclear war in horrible and tragic genetic mutations.  We have seen the consequences of Hiroshima.  Anybody who has seen the pictures drawn by the children of Hiroshima of what Hiroshima was like after the bomb must ask a few fundamental questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most fundamental question of all is the question of the possession of nuclear weapons because humanity has rationalised nuclear weapons far too easily for itself.  It has rationalised them in terms of deterrents and in terms of the appropriately abbreviated mutual assured destruction which abbreviates to MAD, which is a particularly appropriate abbreviation.  That word MAD and the associated word, madness, is a less than <Col N="725" /> adequate description for humanity's willingness to even contemplate the use of nuclear weapons.  There is no point in talking about deterrents if they do not involve the consideration and acceptance of the willingness to use nuclear weapons. It is one of the great moral failures of the late 20th century, which has characterised virtually all the Christian Churches, that Churches which are able to give specific moral guidance on issues of far less destructive capability, have never been able to offer ordinary people moral guidelines about the inherent morality or otherwise of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter in the context of what nuclear weapons represent, both in terms of a physical threat and also psychological threat, in the context of our continuing and quite justifiable concern about the British nuclear industry not far away from where we stand, about the obvious indifference of that industry to our welfare and our concerns, about the proposal to build yet another nuclear power station, about the fact that Sellafield is not as we all know in this country and recognise, simply a civilian plant but is, in fact, inherently a nuclear weapons grid production plant which manages to minimise the cost of that nuclear weapons grid plutonium production by becoming a service to civil powers.  It is inherently and fundamentally a military project.  It is, if your like, the breeding ground, to coin a phrase, of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>We are quite rightly concerned not just any more about the danger to the Irish Sea of discharges but of the inherent instability of Sellafield.  This is where something of a professional interest of mine could do with being elaborated on. The problem with Sellafield is not that it is a limited threat but that it is an infinite threat.  We do not know what the limits of the destruction to our environment would be following a serious incident in Sellafield.  We still do not know, and will not know for generations, the intensity of the damage to the environment, and indeed, to future generations from the Chernobyl accident.</P>
    <P>The problem about nuclear power and about nuclear weapons is that there can <Col N="726" /> be no acceptable risk when you are dealing with nuclear weapons.  My other profession deals in assessing risk and in determining what is acceptable and what is not acceptable.  The fundamental question is that the benefit to humanity must be proportional the risk involved.  The risk from nuclear weapons, is, in my view, infinite and, therefore, there can be no proportional benefits and they can never be justified.</P>
    <P>I am not really arguing that because we all agree on this.  Every member of every party in both Houses of the Oireachtas is against nuclear weapons.  In many ways we have attempted to give specific expression in our national policies to that position.  I must pay tribute to the Taoiseach who has frequently been extremely specific about his view on nuclear weapons particularly on any part of this island.  We would all feel that any attempt, for instance, to station nuclear weapons within that part of this country which is under United Kingdom jurisdiction would be taken very seriously and regarded very gravely in this part of the island, and quite rightly.</P>
    <P>One very specific statement of our abhorrence of nuclear weapons has been our stated policy of not wishing vessels which carry nuclear weapons to visit our ports.  Of course, we all agree on that. Nobody really wants vessels which carry nuclear weapons visiting our harbours. The idea is upsetting, distressing, disturbing and also the fact of our revulsion against such weapons is well expressed by such a view.</P>
    <P>A difficulty has arisen consistently in this country with successive Governments. It is because we have had a change of Government that I am hoping for a more specific assurance than we have had in the past.  Nobody has ever been able to explain how the fact that we do not wish vessels which carry nuclear weapons to visit our ports has actually been conveyed to those vessels before they visit our ports.  We have quite enough problems without these instruments of death being stored close to the centres of all our major cities.  That is what happens when these courtesy visits take place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> In expressing our polite aspiration we do not do an awful lot to enforce what we want.  The fundamental fact of nuclear chess, if you want to call it that, is that no nuclear power in the world will ever confirm or deny whether a particular vessel does or does not carry nuclear weapons. Furthermore, as New Zealand &mdash; I mention New Zealand because it is, like ourselves, a small country and a very brave country &mdash; has discovered, insistence on a nuclear ban can cause great upset.  There have been few more offensive spectacles in recent years than the spectacle of the United States of America attempting to intimidate New Zealand into changing its policy on nuclear vessels visiting its ports.</P>
    <P>Quite simply, when you come to the nuclear powers, if you ask they will not tell and if you insist on asking and finding out, they simply will not come.  I do not think that would be a particular tragedy. We are not a member of a military alliance although, in the light of last year's referendum, I am not so sure how far we are away from one.  As of now, we are not a member of a nuclear alliance or of any military alliance.  I do not know why it would be such a tragedy if they would not come here.</P>
    <P>The truth is, of course, that they still keep on coming here.  We have had vessels with a nuclear capability &mdash; that, of course, is as much as we can be sure of &mdash; visiting Dublin and Cork in recent years, I would like to know about those vessels, particularly those that are publicly known to have a nuclear capability, has anybody asked about nuclear weapons. Has anybody told the commanding officer of each vessel of our nuclear free policy?  I doubt it, because of what I have just said.  No nuclear power will ever confirm or deny whether nuclear weapons are on board a particular vessel.  If they will not tell us what is there, how can we enforce our position?  We have not a clue about what is on board vessels which visit our ports.  The tragedy of it is that, in the regrettable tradition on matters like this where there is a difficuly, we will, of course, say all the right things <Col N="728" /> at home, keep silent abroad about enforcing our own policy, bury our heads in the sand and hope for the best.  All this underpins the farcical nature of our neutrality and of our anti-nuclear stance.</P>
    <P>While I said we all agree about the policy the Department of Foreign Affairs and successive Governments have been forced to choose.  The choice is between a nuclear free Ireland and standing up to the nuclear powers of whatever political persuasion.  This is not an issue of being either pro-west or pro-east; it is a question of being pro-life as against death. All of the nuclear powers possess the capacity to destroy us all.  Therefore, if we are against nuclear weapons, all of us who are must be against all forms of nuclear weapons irrespective of where we see the good boys or the bad boys, or the good girls or the bad girls.  The tragedy, of course, is that our leaders, up to now at least, it would appear, given their unwillingness to attempt in any way to either enforce or make known our policy on a specific vessel to vessel level, would prefer a shipload of death to harsh words from the US, USSR, France or any of the other countries that have a nuclear capabiliy.</P>
    <P>This is not a big international issue requiring all sorts of high level diplomatic activity.  We would simply have to inform the commanding officer of each vessel that we were nuclear free and request him not to offend that position.  I find it astonishing that a similar decision by the Danish Parliament produced a general election.  There is a peculiar lack of clarity of thought, a peculiar unwillingness to confront the horror of nuclear weapons and an attempt to dress it up in romantic talk about freedom or defence, two words which are denied by the very existence of nuclear weapons.  The one thing that nuclear weapons will do is destroy us all and, therefore, destroy our freedom. The one thing they will not do is defend us; they will destroy others.  They are not defensive weapons.  They are, by definition, offensive weapons.</P>
    <P>The Danes discovered that.  When they decided they wanted to tell people commanding vessels: &ldquo;We do not want <Col N="729" /> nuclear weapons in our ports and please do not come here if you carry nuclear weapons&rdquo;, it provoked a general election. We will not have a general election about it, unfortunately, because nobody will ever do that.  We will express here, particularly with an appreciative young anti-nuclear audience, our absolute commitment to being nuclear free.  We will tell the whole world that we want Sellafield closed down because that is not here; it is over there; it is fixed and it is invisible. We will not do the simple thing.  We will not say to the commanding officer of each vessel: &ldquo;You must simply read this letter; we request you not to offend our position and do not come near us if you carry nuclear weapons&rdquo;.  Nothing, could be simpler.</P>

      <P>I am glad Senator Ryan understands fully the Government's position and, in particular, the Taoiseach's position in relation to nuclear weapons.  Having said that, he can take it that we do not hide behind romantic talk and we have no intention of hiding behind romantic talk about freedom and defence.  I share and, indeed, the Government and every Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the people of Ireland share his abhorrence and, indeed, his fear of nuclear war and the terrible consequences that could result from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan has addressed an issue which has been the subject of discussion on several occasions during Question Time in the Dáil.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to set out for Members of this House the Government's policy regarding visits by foreign naval vessels to Irish ports.  The Government are in principle disposed to entertain requests for visits by such vessels as long as they comply with our policy in the matter. Visits by foreign naval vessels are a normal aspect of relations between friendly States.  Our policy with regard to visits by vessels carrying nuclear weapons is absolutely clear and has been conveyed <Col N="730" /> in equally clear terms to countries proposing visits by their naval vessels to Irish ports.</P>
    <P>Foreign naval vessels wishing to call at Irish ports are required to obtain the permission of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The granting of permission is dependent on certain conditions being satisfied.  The principal conditions are that (a), the visit does not constitute part of a naval exercise and (b), the vessel itself is not carrying nuclear weapons. Naturally, too, such vessels must comply with standing regulations relating, for instance, to safety of navigation.  Thus, we are open to requests for foreign naval vessels to visit Irish ports for the purposes of, for example, rest and relaxation, to participate in Irish celebrations, such as the Dublin Millennium or, where necessary, to take on supplies it being, of course, understood that the vessel is without nuclear arms and is calling independently of any naval exercise off our coasts.  The policy I have just stated has been the policy of successive Irish Governments and it is one which the current Government fully intend to maintain.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan spoke about last year's referendum in relation to our neutrality. He claims to be in some doubt about the implications of it.  I would like to reassure him.  The Government are in no doubt and it was made quite clear to the people that ratification of the Single European Act involved no military obligations, no military involvement of any kind.  That is the way it will be.</P>
    <P>It might be useful to outline briefly for Senators the procedures governing applications for visits by foreign naval vessels.  Applications are addressed in the first instance to the Department of Foreign Affairs by the country concerned through diplomatic channels.  On receipt of an application the Department have consultations with the appropriate Irish authorities to ensure that the conditions I have stated previously, which, as I have said, have been conveyed in clear terms to those countries which propose visits by their naval vessels to Irish ports, are respected, that is, that the proposed visit <Col N="731" /> is taking place outside the context of any naval manoeuvre and that the vessel in the particular case does not have nuclear weapons aboard.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that it is not the practice to disclose details of these consultations with the relevant Irish authorities or of the verification procedures employed in reaching decisions in individual cases.  I would, nevertheless, like to put on record that the Government are confident that existing arrangements are adequate to ensure that the conditions laid down are upheld.  Contrary, <Col N="732" /> therefore, to what has been suggested, we do not believe that there is any objective need to amend established procedures. Nor do we believe that there is any call for the introduction of specific legislation.  Applications for visits by naval vessels falling within the scope of the Adjournment motion can and are being satisfactorily handled through existing policies, procedures and legislation already in place.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.55 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 21 June 1988.</P>
