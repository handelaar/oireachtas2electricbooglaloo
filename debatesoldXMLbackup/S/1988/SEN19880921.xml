      <P>I have received a message from the President that the Supreme Court has decided that the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1987, is not repugnant to the Constitution or to any provision thereof and that, accordingly, he signed the said Bill on 26 July 1988.</P>

      <P>I wish to make an announcement for the information of the House.  I have received a report on the reconstruction work on the Seanad Chamber from the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works report that major structural repairs have now been virtually completed and that internal repairs and restoration work has now been undertaken.</P>
      <P>As the Seanad ceiling is of enormous interest to a great number of Senators &mdash; indeed to all Senators I would say &mdash; I would like to bring the House up to date on these repairs by quoting from the report:</P>
      <P>The work on the Senate Chamber ceiling has just commenced.  The first step will be to replace all missing sections of ceiling with new sections cast in plaster using moulds taken from the ceiling.  The replacement sections will therefore be true replicas of the original.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work to the ceiling will be undertaken by a group of highly skilled <Col N="3" /> craftsmen who will have to work painstakingly to ensure there is no further avoidable loss of areas of the existing ceiling and also to ensure that the newly cast sections are fitted so that the finished work will be a faithful restoration of the original ceiling.</P>
    <P>Plans for the final phase of the project, the refurbishing and the refitting of the Chamber, are currently being prepared by the Office of Public Works for consideration by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges within the next two weeks.  The committee then can draw up a timescale with the Office of Public Works for the resumption of sittings in the Chamber as early as possible next year.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Patrick McGowan that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The recent establishment of a national road authority.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Philip Hogan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to review the staffing levels at St. John's infants' national school, Kilkenny city, with the purpose of redesignating the school as disadvantaged for the purpose of staffing and to allocate additional staff accordingly.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators McGowan and Hogan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment of this House.  I have selected Senator McGowan's motion for today and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. Senator Hogan may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>It is intended to take Item No. 1 today, to break for tea from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and to conclude today's business at 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me welcome the slightly early recall of the Seanad.  I hope we are now back for the rest of the session until Christmas and not just for the Companies (No. 2) Bill, important as that is, but that we are back into the regular cycle.  To that end I would like to ask the Leader of the House the status of Private Members' time.  It is not ordered for today and I think it would be a very unwelcome departure if we were not going to have an opportunity to debate Private Members' business at least from next week onwards.  I ask the Leader of the House to clarify that point.</P>
      <P>I welcome the report the Cathaoirleach has just given us on the state of the Chamber. Certainly we all hope we will be back in the Chamber as early as possible in the New Year without hitches of any sort.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if any new legislation can be expected over the coming weeks.  Once the Companies (No. 2) Bill goes through there is no Government legislation whatsoever on the Order Paper to be cleared away.  Could he report to us, either today or tomorrow, if it is proposed to introduce new legislation in the coming weeks so that the relevant spokespersons can prepare for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to Item No. 2 on the Order Paper today.  This item has never been more relevant than at present and I ask the Leader of the House to arrange to have a debate on it either tomorrow or next week.  For over a year now we have not had an opportunity for a full-scale debate on Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations.  This is probably the most pressing problem we face coming up to the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement it is imperative that this House with its very diverse strands of opinion should be given the opportunity to review the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Therefore, I say to the Leader of the <Col N="5" /> House in a totally non-partisan way that it is important that there be a strong parliamentary input into the review, that it is not just Governments and civil servants. I ask him in that spirit to see if he could go ahead and have a debate on Item No. 2 at the earliest possible moment.  While saying that let me conclude on this.</P>
    <P>I would also ask him to turn his mind to the establishment of a parliamentary tier to the Anglo-Irish Agreement as envisaged under the agreement.  I believe all parties in this House would want to urge the Government to press ahead as quickly as possible with the establishment of the parliamentary tier of which this House would be part.  I know from contact with the House of Commons that there is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>Senator Manning, are you making a speech?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  I want to conclude by saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It sounds like it to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am sure there is a very real welcome for the establishing of the parliamentary tier on that side of the Irish Sea and I urge the Leader of the House to take that point on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Senator Manning has said in two of his references, first, the need to have a wide-ranging debate on Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations.  I would hope that could be a debate stretching over a fairly liberal span of time because there is much to be said, there are many ideas to be presented.  One of the troubles is that for far too long in both parts of this island we have stuck with stereotypes. We have our Chamber here where there is a certain amount of freedom to express individual ideas and I am quite certain that if these were put into the melting pot they could prove to be both helpful and constructive in regard to what must inevitably take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="6" /> Secondly, although my own attendance has been anything but good in the past year, I would welcome the idea of the further use of time for Private Members' business.  I have had a motion down here for four years, the lifetime of this Seanad and most of the previous Seanad.  I think it is a very important matter when one considers the problems of minorities in the context of majorities throughout the word.  It would be a pity not to think very seriously about the proposal the Senator has put to you, a Chathaoirligh, that we should try to use the time that is possible for us so that we can get through the large number of motions on the Order Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call Senator O'Toole, let me say to Senator Robb that Private Members' time has nothing to do with me as Cathaoirleach. It is the Whips, the parties, you, who decide.  I only preside.  I have nothing to do with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  As a very private Private Member I take your point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We also welcome the fact that the House has returned early to work on a programme of legislation.  We have heard some quite disconcerting rumours that the House is going to meet for only a week or a week-and-a-half and then go on some kind of a mid-term break at that point.  It certainly would not fit in with the programme of work which needs to be addressed and which the Leader of the House outlined to us at the beginning of the year.  I would like to refer to two issues.  First, I ask the Leader of the House to have at least some element of consulation with the other groups in the House about the programme of work which is to be undertaken before a session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disgraceful that only one item has been proposed by the Leader of the House today.  That is not good enough.  We need to know what the <Col N="7" /> programme of work is going to be for the next number of months.  We should address those issues which have been raised by many members on the Government side over the past year, the many motions which are on the Order Paper. We certainly hope that some attempt will be made to deal with and dispose of them over the next period of weeks.</P>
      <P>I want to refer also to the question of Private Members' time.  It is disgraceful that the Leader of the House has decided not to give time for Private Members' business today.  I would like the House to recall that on the week we adjourned we had this same discussion.  I was assured at that time by the Leader of the House that it was not possible to take Private Members' business that week because of pressing business.  It was outlined to us that there was an agreement where parliamentary or legislative business was pressing that Private Members' business would not be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole, I dislike interrupting you but as I said to Senator Robb, Private Members' time is really not for discussion on the Order of Business.  It is for agreement by all of you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the point that this is the only opportunity which I have had to discuss this matter in any formal way.  I quite understand that it is not a matter for you, a Chathaoirligh: I am addressing my questions through you to the Leader of the House on the Order of Business.  I propose that we take Private Members' time this evening at 6.30 p.m. as is normal.  It is on that issue that I address my remarks.  As important as Government business is, and nobody would take from it, and certainly as important as the Companies Bill is &mdash; indeed I proposed in July that we come back early to deal with it if it were not finished at that time &mdash; that is not the point.  The point is that we need to get through a lot of other business as well and the programme of work should be outlined for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> A Chathaoirligh, you know very well that more than any other institution of State, we are wide open to criticism, and are indeed criticised by many groups outside this House.  There is nothing we can do about that but I hope that the programme of work that will be taken over the next number of months will at least reflect the problems and the realities of Irish life and in a sense that the programme of work&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole, you are now making a speech on policy right across the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask will the Leader of the House place on the Order of Business those motions on the Order Paper today which will address the issues which are topical and relevant to the problems in Irish society to see if we can by the results of our deliberations silence those critics who will say that this House does not deal with topical or important matters.  First, I am proposing that time be given for Private Members' business today and I ask the Leader of the House to concede on that point.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader of the House to outline for us the legislative programme for the next couple of months, the motions that he intends to take in the near future and how he intends to dispose of all the business that is on three or four pages of an Order Paper which everybody has been giving out about for the past period of time.  I would ask that we approach our work with some sense of efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I need some information on procedure in the House.  A Member of this House went on the radio and claimed that he and his colleagues, the Independent Senators, were responsible for keeping the House here six <Col N="9" /> weeks longer than it would have otherwise sat.  He said that clearly and I heard him.  I do not believe that statement to be right and true.  I ask your assistance and I want it to be put on record whether that is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGowan the only thing I can say to you is that I cannot rule on it now but certainly if that has happened it is something that is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a couple of items on the Order of Business.  First, I wish to comment on your statement in connection with the work that is proceeding on the Seanad Chamber.  It is appropriate that the House should compliment the Office of Public Works on the progress they have made to date. Very important reconstruction work had to be done.  Those people are the subject of continuous public criticism in many areas and it is appropriate that this House should compliment them on the work they have done here.  We should at least put it on the record that we are pleased with the progress.  We look forward to our return to the Seanad Chamber proper.  We hope that, whether there is an election or not, all those present will have the privilege of sitting in that Chamber at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>We want to be fair to the Leader of the House.  When we went into recess for the summer he indicated that we would come back in September to deal with the Companies (No. 2) Bill and I understand that is what he has outlined today.  Perhaps he will address the question as to when we will have Private Members' time because it is important that that facility for Private Members should not be lost sight of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the point made by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Manning, when he referred to Item No. 2, I think all of us would concur on the urgency of that matter in view of the events that have taken place over the past number of months and the Leader of the House will share this concern.  I think all the groups in this House would want to <Col N="10" /> facilitate him in arriving at a mutually suitable time when we could have a structured debate on this subject because nobody wants to play political football with it.  It is a very serious subject and we would like the Government to be involved in the debate.</P>
    <P>I am certainly willing to sit down at any forum with the Leader of the House and with the other groups to decide on how we should approach Item No. 2.  We could do much damage if it is not dealt with in a structured debate.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Leader of the House, from past experience of dealing with Government legislation which has a primary role in the House, that the work of other committees, that dealing with EC legislation and otherwise, would be taken on Thursdays as a matter of course and that only urgent legislation would be taken on that day.  In that way Members will know that all of Wednesday, or indeed Tuesday, sittings would be devoted to legislation and Thursdays could be devoted to all these other items. They should not be continually listed here without any agreement about how we would meet the problem that has been outlined by Senator O'Toole and others. That is the way to go forward.  In the first sitting of this session we should be in agreement about how we should do this and not delay the Order of Business unnecessarily with arguments which we could settle outside this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call Senator Norris, what has me baffled is the debate that is going on.  The friendliness that seems to be here &mdash; maybe I am misreading it &mdash; should exist outside as well.  Members should fix up all those matters and then come in here and get the Order of Business cleared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Order of Business is occasionally the only opportunity people have to get a consensus on these issues.  It allows the Leader of the House the opportunity to respond to us with all due respects to you, and the friendliness you wish to have in <Col N="11" /> the debate.  This is one of the forums in which one can do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I would like first of all to welcome very much the report that you gave to the House with regard to progress in the Seanad Chamber. I would like to ask, arising from that, whether it is possible at some stage that Members of the Seanad could have an opportunity to actually physically see the work in progress, and I say this with some feeling because I, although elected for 18 months or nearly two years, have never actually been inside the Chamber.  I do not know what it is like, but a journalist acquaintance of mine recently said there is great work being done in there, that he had been in to see it.  This may or may not be correct but it placed me at something of a disadvantage.  I would very much appreciate the opportunity to see the work that is in hand and I welcome the fact that it appears to be very much up to date in its progress.</P>
      <P>I would like to support what a variety of Senators have said with regard to Private Members' time.  I do not wish to be contentious but I would have to agree with Senator O'Toole who pointed out that there was a similar difficulty at the end of last term.  It is particularly important that this matter should be addressed because it does bring the House into some degree of disrepute.  It does reduce the dignity and status of the Seanad and it is galling to people like myself and other Senators from all round the House who try to raise matters of importance and are then taunted by the Leader of the Opposition with the throw away remark, &ldquo;Why do you not bring it up in your own time?&rdquo;  Our time arrives under these kind of procedures about once a year, and if the Government do not use their time perhaps it would be courteous and gracious of them to make it available to people who have really got issues they want to bring to the attention of the House.  Perhaps that is something that might be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say with regard to what <Col N="12" /> Senator McGowan said that it is unfortunate that here on the first day we get into this rather cheap point-scoring exercise and as far as the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make the point that I take a rather dim view of the fact that these statements were made and require cheers of approval from the Government benches and I would be quite happy to reiterate the fact that the Independent Senators unquestionably were responsible for keeping the business of the House going at the last&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have certain items directly related so I think what you really intend to say to me, a Chathaoirligh, is that you wish me to stop on this point but you will be graciously prepared to listen to the substantive items on today's Order of Business.  I would like to ask with regard to that the Leader of the House to give some indication as to when Item No. 24 will be taken, that is, the item on the situation regarding the emigration of Jewish citizens of the Soviet Union.  I say this because I have been approached by various lobbying interests asking me when this matter will be taken.  I will simply remind the Leader of the House <Col N="13" /> that several times during the last term he gave an indication that this matter would be given some degree of priority.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask about two other items.  One is Item No. 49.  I would just ask the Leader of the House to consider the possibility of some kind of all-party motion on this.  I believe it to be totally uncontentious.  I refer to the question of conferring honorary citizenship upon Raoul Wallenberg who was a person universally admired in this country, throughout Europe and, indeed, throughout the world.</P>
      <P>My final point is with regard to Item No. 50.  It is not at all my intention to be obstructive but I would point out to the House that the tax amnesty actually ends in about nine days time.  If it remains at Item No. 50 and is not taken in the next day or two, it becomes absolutely redundant. Perhaps the Government would give some indication of whether they are prepared to make room for this important discussion or whether it will be necessary for me to move a Standing Order 29 motion today on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a certain amount of competition amongst Members on the Independent benches to take credit for the accusation levelled at us by Senator McGowan.  I felt that it was I who said it.  Senator Norris has jumped up and taken credit for it.  I am prepared to concede the statement to Senator Norris but I want to put it on the record that I, for one, am fully behind what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing seems to have changed on the Order of Business since the summer. Apparently, we are here today to discuss the Companies (No. 2) Bill.  Senator O'Toole put his finger on it when he said it is insulting to this House that we have no programme for what will be discussed tomorrow.  We do not know whether we are meeting next week.  We have no programme beyond the Companies (No. 2) Bill.  It is significant, and it is ridiculous, that the Leader of the House informed us of two most important things in this order: that there be a tea break for an hour and that we will finish at 8 o'clock. <Col N="14" /> He did not tell us anything about what we will discuss between now and Christmas.

Taking into account the fact that we are all far better prepared now for the session until Christmas by knowing that we will have a tea break, I am asking the following question of the Leader of the House: what is the programme for the Companies (No. 2) Bill today, tomorrow and next week and what is the Government's plan for the Companies (No. 2) Bill?  We asked this question every week for the past year and got no answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask other questions on the Order of Business.  I have three more questions to ask and they are all relevant. The second question I have on the Order of Business is: when will we be allowed to have a debate on Northern Ireland?  It seems appropriate to take Item No. 2 now and for the Taoiseach come into the House to take that debate.  The Taoiseach is not sitting in the Dáil.  He could come to the Seanad and take a debate on Item No. 2.  The only reservation I have about asking for that is that we have been given a series of pledges about a debate on Northern Ireland which have been broken, and broken without excuse. Even if we get a promise today, we will have to look on it in that light.  Third I want to remind the House that we suffered a guillotine before the summer recess which completely upset everybody's calculations.  For some reason it suited the Government to guillotine a very important Bill.  I would also like to ask why we do not have Private Members' time today.  Is this some sort of a precedent or will the Leader of the House give us Private Members' time today?  I believe the Government will find that the Independents will not be disruptive but will oppose the Order of Business if this sort of creeping avoidance <Col N="15" /> comes into the business of the House.  It is very important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am asking a question on the Order of Business.  It may have been too long but it is all relevant.  It is lengthy but relevant.  I am asking the Leader of the House to give us a pledge that, if it is not taken today, Private Members' business be taken tomorrow so that we can get back to the system of taking it once a week.  Otherwise this House is being run badly and chaotically as it was last year simply and solely for the benefit of the Government.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I would like to raise a serious point of order.  I have been thinking about the charge made by Senator McGowan which you said should be dealt with by the CPP. I would like the Leader of the House to put it on the record of the House that the work of the House was greatly facilitated by the long hard hours put in by the Independent group in late June and early July.</P>

      <P>Before I call Senator Brendan Ryan, I take issue with that last remark.  Everybody in this House works quite hard.  We are all committed to the Seanad and the last thing we need is a remark from Senator Ross about how bad the last session of this House was.  I thought it was an excellent session, and I am here since 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach is entitled to that opinion and I am enlightened by it.  I am enlightened by it but I am on record as saying that in terms of the Order of Business it was a chaotic session and I stand by that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not the longest <Col N="16" /> serving Member of this House but I have a reasonable number of years behind me and I want to be fully associated with the remarks made by my Independent colleagues.  The last session was badly organised.  There was one particular day when we did not know what business we would be taking in two hours time.  I am sorry but I have to take issue with you, a Chathaoirligh.  You and I and indeed all of my Independent colleagues are committed to this House and have worked very hard in various ways to make this House work but it serves no purpose to pretend this House works better than it does.  This House was badly run during the last session.  It deserves better and the Members of this House deserve better and there is no point in avoiding the issue.</P>
      <P>I am astonished that there is no Private Members' business today.  I am even more astonished to discover that the Order of Business is being presented to us without consultation.  If that is not an indication of the level of chaos that prevails in the decisions in regard to the Order of Business, I do not know what is.  It was part of the order of this House that there would be consultation, formal and informal.  We had an impeccable record of working by agreement in regard to business.  That apparently has been supplanted.  I do not think it has been supplanted maliciously.  It has been supplanted because of the sort of chaotic and incompetent organisation of that seems to lie behind the way the Business of the House is being conducted now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many items on the Order Paper which deserve to be discussed today.  I want at this stage to formally propose that Item No. 36 be taken at 6.30 p.m.  Item No. 36 is a motion in the names of Senators O'Connell, Bohan, Byrne, Cassidy, Cullimore, Doherty, Fallon and all of the other Fianna Fáil members.  I understand that it is Fianna Fáil's turn for Private Members' time.  The motion which is most appropriate is the one to do with the lack of accountability of charities, a motion I would support enthusiastically.  Therefore, we ought to <Col N="17" /> carry on with our normal procedures and have the motion discussed.  I propose that Item No. 36 be taken at 6.30 p.m.  If the Members opposite are unwilling to propose it, I will quite happily propose it for them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, on the issue of what my colleagues are alleged to have said on the radio, I do not know what they said.  They are well able to defend themselves but I think the Members opposite ought to be extremely careful because I am sure I have heard almost every Member opposite say at one stage or another on radio, television or anywhere else they could get a hearing that they were opposed to extradition and they are now happily transferring people across the Border as if they never said it.</P>

      <P>I do not know where to start.  I will make a general statement first of all.  An attack has been made upon this House by Members, in particular, of the Independent group.  They seem to want everything their way.  They do not want to acknowledge that anybody else in this House does any work except themselves. The last session of this House of the Oireachtas did get chaotic at times due to the fact that there was a disruption caused each day on the Order of Business by certain Members of the Independent group.  We had an example of that here today when Senator O'Toole got up and berated us for not taking Private Members' motions today.  Yet, he was the one who said that if we did not take the Companies Bill on the first day and that if we did not bring it to a conclusion he would disrupt the Order of Business every day until that happened.  That is exactly what he has done.</P>

The record will show that on certain occasions I proposed to put the matter to a vote on a weekly basis.  That is what I have done. In order to facilitate the Leader of the House and the Government Whip, the previous week, I agreed with him that there was pressure on him and that it was difficult to take Private Members' time. There was no discussion whatsoever about this week and Private Members' time.  That is for the record.</P>

      <P>I take the points made by Senator Manning as regards new legislation and over the next two weeks, during which we will discuss the Companies Bill, the Whips can get together when they can find out exactly what Government legislation is coming through and we can get an order in terms of legislation.  I take the point which I think was made by Senator Ferris that we should go back to using Thursdays for Private Members' motions and for discussing reports from joint committees. That worked in the past.  Unfortunately, during the last session there was a large amount of Government business and it was not possible every week to do that. We will take a look at that and, again, we will have to list the motions in order of priority.  I take the points made in regard to Item No. 2 and I will discuss this matter with the Government.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned that he has heard disconcerting rumours about what is going to happen in this House. Facts about the Order of Business will only be given on the Order of Business.

The fact that a motion has been on the Order Paper for four or five years does not mean anything except that it is there; it might be taken or it might not be taken.</P>

The definition, &ldquo;best price reasonably obtainable&rdquo;, might have different meanings for secured and unsecured creditors.</P>

I recall returning from a fair in Dingle some years ago after selling some animals with my uncle and being asked by my grandfather what price we obtained for the animals. When we told him the price, he asked if it was the best price and we replied that we figured it was the best price we could get on the day.  We put forward our arguments but his reply was, &ldquo;I do not care about the arguments; I do not think it was the best price&rdquo;.  In my view the best price is that which is unattainable.</P>

Too often in practice that does not happen.  I accept it would be difficult to enshrine that in legislation but I do not think the section lays down the necessary guidelines for receivers to ensure that they get the best possible price for secured and unsecured creditors.</P>

      <P>At this stage I should like to make a brief comment on the Bill and, in particular, to refer to Part IX.  I should like to explain what the Government have in mind without pre-empting the House's consideration of that provision. Senators will be aware that the Government are putting forward in Part IX a new legal mechanism to help rescue companies in difficulty.  It deals with a type of intensive care period.  What is proposed is that the debts of a company in financial difficulty be frozen for a period to allow it be reconstructed with the help of an examiner so preventing liquidation or receivership.  This amounts to a major reform of company legislation. <Col N="25" /> It is the first time it will be on the Statute Book and it is somewhat similar to the American Chapter XI procedure.</P>
      <P>In my view we underestimate how radical and reforming is this proposal.  It is important that the House should focus on what the Government are trying to do.  We are trying to include in company legislation for the first time a period of intensive care for a company that is in difficulty so that it will not have to go into liquidation or receivership.  The debts of the company may be frozen for a period of three months, or perhaps four months, during which time nobody can take action against the company.  The company will have that breathing space to sort itself out.  I predict it will save hundreds of companies; indeed, had such a provision been in operation five years ago it would have saved hundreds of companies.  One case that comes to mind is the famous Texaco case.  That major multinational company ran into financial difficulties, went into this intensive care period and is now back out of it.  If this had been here five or ten years ago I have no doubt it would have saved hundreds of companies that were potentially viable but because some creditors did not have patience the thing was pushed over the brink.  I predict, without exaggerating the matter too much, that this will save hundreds of companies in this country in the years ahead.  That is why I am pleased to come to the Seanad today to deal with Part IX of the Bill which we will come to very shortly.</P>

He certainly will be ahead of his time if <Col N="26" /> he achieves that.  I hope the vehicle he is putting in place in relation to Part IX of the Bill will set out to achieve exactly what he has stated but there is widespread concern about certain aspects of the Bill. We have dealt with many of them up to now in relation to the position of a director in a company.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about one recent development in the context of the discussion on this Bill, that is, the takeover of Master Meats and the dealing that would have taken place on the Stock Exchange rather quickly over the weekend. A number of people are extremely concerned about the identification of the investors involved in this company, the implications for the agri-food industry and the implications for employment.  A Leas-Chathaoirligh, if the Minister has any up to date information, he should have the opportunity in this House, on a relevant issue such as this, to clear the air on a matter or extreme importance and public concern.

      <P>I welcome the Minister's introductory statement on Part IX of the Bill in relation to the proposed new facility for bringing companies under court protection.  Like a number of others I welcome the provision of this new mechanism and I think it is very important that we get the balance of it right. We will have to be concerned that it is not administratively top heavy.  The partial mechanisms that exist already under the existing Companies Acts have not been properly employed because they were regarded as being administratively too cumbersome and too difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now introducing what I would agree with the Minister is a radical new proposal.  It is very important that it is seen by those involved in seeking to rescue the company as being effective <Col N="27" /> machinery, not as being cumbersome and therefore involving too many time delays and court procedure that is too heavy, and so on.  As I look at it at the moment, I am concerned that the procedure is very cumbersome but that is something that we can work at obviously on Committee Stage and on Report Stage.  I am concerned on another front.  I have been waiting since the start of business today &mdash; an hour ago &mdash; for the debate on the Companies Bill because I am now about to go to a meeting of the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities to present a report but I hope to be back in time to resume the discussion on this important section.</P>

      <P>The matter in question is not something that really comes up today.  Now that the Senator has asked about it let me just say briefly that, as in the case of the mergers and takeovers legislation, the onus is on the company to notify the Minister if it falls within the threshold specified in the Act relating to assets, liabilities, turnovers and employers, etc.  The Minister has three months to consider the position.  He can refer it to the Fair Trade Commission for a report in relation to the various Schedules to the Act including, for example, the effects on competition but also employment and the common good. The Minister can refer it to the Fair Trade Commission.  Following receipt of the commission's report the Minister can decide to prohibit or to permit, subject to conditions, the actual proposed merger.  I should stress that, as far as I am aware, no such notification has come to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Until such time as such notification comes, we cannot comment on it further.  As of now I am not aware that the Minister has received such notification.</P>

      <P>It increases the penalties on directors who fail to provide a statement of affairs to a receiver.  There is an onus on the directors of a company to provide a statement of affairs when a receiver comes in.  Too many directors in the past have failed to produce that statement of affairs and the penalties have been rather low.  Quite simply all we are doing is increasing the penalties from whatever they were to the figures that are actually in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thought that was the area that was being covered.  I welcome, and certainly the trade union movement welcome, this attempt at tightening up the legislation.  It is long past the time when that type of legislation should have been put into operation.  In the Principal Act was there a provision for an imprisonment term or is that a completely new section?  In other words, is the fact that &ldquo;fraudulent&rdquo; or &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; company directors, who do not comply with the regulation are now liable for a prison term.  Is that new or was that also the case under the old Act?  I ask the question because I am not aware of any case where somebody served time for this type of breach.</P>

      <P>There was no provision for an imprisonment penalty in the original Act.  There was provision for a fine not exceeding £100, but that went up to £500 in 1982.  This Bill actually brings it to £1,000 or, on conviction on indictment, £5,000.  As Senators will see, we are putting in a term of imprisonment for a period not exceeding three years, or a <Col N="29" /> fine not exceeding £5,000, or both.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have resisted the temptation to spell out what that cause might be.  In the liquidation situation that is precisely the phrase that is used &mdash;&ldquo;on cause shown&rdquo;.  I think it is better to leave it to the court to decide in what circumstances it might fire a receiver.  I do not think it would be helpful to specify it in legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to get more clarification on the phrase &ldquo;on cause shown&rdquo; as asked by Senator O'Toole.  Most sections in the Bill are inclined to detail the events in which a certain course of action will be taken rather than dealing with exceptions to the rule, as contained in similar legislation in the UK.  That is probably the best way of dealing with it.  You are much better off to deal with the legislation on the basis of identifying the events that should not happen rather than detailing the events that should happen.  I would like the Minister to clarify the likely events in which a court would interpret &ldquo;on cause shown&rdquo;.  As the Minister is aware, the interpretation may vary from court to court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but the Senator is asking me to make a list of human failings which would take a long piece of legislation.  The type of thing could be &mdash; and I am only speculating here &mdash; perhaps incompetence, demonstrated incompetence; unduly favouring creditors over others; involvement in any kind of arrangements within the company which would be unduly favouring creditors and doing so in a reckless or almost dishonest way; being charged with a criminal offence of some sort or turning out to have been a member of some proscribed organisation; the list is quite endless. I think the court would be able to make up its own mind &ldquo;on cause shown&rdquo;. A receiver also could fall foul of the debenture holders who actually appointed him.  If the receiver failed to withdraw from his position, the debenture holders might have to apply to the courts to have him removed.  This section would enable them to do that.  It is wiser, perhaps, not to seek to make a list because in making that list you almost certainly leave our some cause which might be serious.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that a person takes the matter to the court and puts forward the arguments and gives the causes or the reasons or the case for the removal of the receiver and that the <Col N="31" /> court judges on the case presented whether the receiver should be removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, section 277 of the 1963 Act uses this phrase for liquidators, and it has worked reasonably well.  The wording &ldquo;on cause shown&rdquo; is also a well used and accepted legal phrase.  I would be happy to make a list of causes if that would help but I would be quite worried that when you start listing causes you almost certainly leave out something, which would be serious.  That is my main concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I see the value in not listing them because a list can be interpreted by a judge as giving a certain direction of thought when, in fact, it is nearly impossible to consider the variety of reasons that could lead to it. The Minister referred to personal failings; somebody could develop some kind of illness, overtiredness or whatever, all sorts of areas which could never be listed.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 140 provides that the liquidator will have certain powers over a receiver.  There is an indication that this will have serious implications for lending in so far as where a debenture holder or a financial institution has appointed a receiver to a company that the powers whereby the unsecured creditors in a liquidation would have over a receiver could have implications for people getting money from a bank.  I would like the Minister to clarify this section.  Perhaps he would indicate the powers of the liquidator over a receiver in a company in receivership and what implications that would have for debenture holders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to do here is to clear up something that is <Col N="32" /> already well covered in case law, that is, allowing the liquidator when he is appointed, to go to the court and seek to limit the scope of the receiver.  If the court thinks fit, it will grant the liquidator the authority to limit the receiver's role because the liquidator, in the case we envisage, obviously would come in afterwards. If the liquidator feels that the receiver is perhaps not being co-operative or not pulling the same way, the liquidator can go to court and seek to limit the receiver's scope and powers in the matter.  It is only for very rare cases; in 95 per cent of cases if there is a receiver in existence and a liquidator goes in they will want broadly to achieve the same results.  Both of them will want to maximise what revenue they can generate and they will both want to make sure that their various creditors are looked after as best as possible.  There would be a convergence of interest in the vast majority of cases, but this is a situation where the liquidator feels he needs to go to court to limit the power of the receiver who may envisage doing something which would not help the liquidator with his work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a debenture holder sends in a receiver into a company, and we have a new section in the Bill which allows for a liquidator to be appointed over and above the wishes of a debenture holder, that would have serious implications for lending institutions when lending money to a company if they feel that their powers of receivership are going to be interfered with by the successful application to a court by unsecured creditors.  In my opinion, in a liquidation the unsecured creditors' circumstances are taken into account much more than in a receivership.  I would like to see both of them converging to the same view and the same objective, as the Minister stated, but in reality the practice is that liquidators and receivers can have diverse opinions about what should be the end result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make this clear this is not enabling a liquidator to <Col N="33" /> be appointed on top of a receiver.  That could always be done.  There is nothing new about that.  What I am trying to do here is to ensure that we get that convergence, and ensure that if a liquidator goes in that the receiver cannot be unco-operative.  If a receiver is in on foot of a fixed charge, for example, there is no incentive or no scope for him or her to be that unco-operative because they are there for a fixed charge to look after a particular asset, perhaps for a bank.  It is only where the receiver would be there on foot of a floating charge, where they would be looking to the general assets of the company to get their liability looked after and it is in that context that I want to make sure that the liquidator is able to prevent the receiver doing anything that would impair the work of the liquidator at that time.  In a general sense if your aim is to look after unsecured creditors &mdash; and I appreciate the Senator's interest in making this point, which he made very well &mdash; it is perhaps better that we give the liquidator a little edge, because at the end of the day he, rather than the receiver is the person who will look after the unsecured creditors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most exciting and interesting part of the legislation in that it is the positive thrust of the Bill which prevents companies who get into financial difficulty from having to go into liquidation or receivership in the first instance.  I am setting up an intensive care period of three or four months so that the company's debts can be frozen.  This is a major and radical reform of company legislation.  We have never done this before and I honestly say that had we done it before it would have made a major difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 144 allows a company which is in financial difficulties, or other interested parties, for example shareholders or creditors, to go to court to have an examiner appointed.  Under section 145 the effect of such an appointment would be to freeze the debts of the company completely and place the company under the protection of the court for a period of three months from the date of the petition to the court. The effect of this would be, among other things, that no receiver or liquidator could be appointed or debts executed. Furthermore, if a receiver is in place he must stand aside.  It is a very radical piece of legislation which, in effect, freezes the debts of a company and does not permit anybody to sue it on foot of those debts or in any way to pressurise the company <Col N="35" /> legally during the period while the examiner working with the company seeks to sort it out and rebuild it.</P>
    <P>It is a daring rescue mechanism and only time will tell whether it will work fully.  I predict that it will be a major contributor to the development of successful companies over the decades ahead.  That is why I am excited and confident about this new mechanism which we are putting in place.  Many hundreds of companies have gone into liquidation over the years and if somebody had been able to step in and freeze everything for a three-month period with the help of an outsider who could have done deals with the creditors, made arrangements and compromises and written a plan to put the company back into shape, I have no doubt that the vast majority of those companies which were potentially viable could have been refloated given that kind of breathing space under the protection of the court for that limited period.</P>
    <P>This Bill has very many good parts which deal with insider trading, duties of directors and so on but I believe this is the real, positive part of the Bill which could do a lot to develop our economy over the next decade or so.  I look forward to hearing Senators' comments and opinions on this section.  It is a major initiative and I look forward to dealing with it with the Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with Part IX of the Bill I should like to welcome this new concept of reconstruction in the companies legislation in the form of an examiner. As the Minister has rightly stated, the potential benefits to the Irish economy will be enormous but he should not over-simplify the difficulties a system like this can have in practice.  Irish industrial culture has been to allow a problem to go to such an extent that it is almost impossible to reconstruct a company.  An air of depression sets into the management of a particular company when they believe that the finances of their company have gone wrong and, because of pride, on occasions they wrongly fail <Col N="36" /> to face the reality of the difficulties they have in their company.  They fail to face up to them in time in order to bring about some salvation for a limited amount of the company in operation, in particular for the management, shareholders and employees.  Hundreds of jobs could have been saved if management in this country had faced up to the difficulties in their companies at an earlier stage.</P>
      <P>I hope that the introduction of the new concept of the examiner will provide a half-way house for many companies and that rather than facing the road of receivership or liquidation that the examiner status will provide them with an opportunity of facing up to their problems much earlier and thus save their companies in the process.  Anything which prevents a potentially viable company from going to the wall, going into receivership or liquidation, is a welcome departure for Irish industrial life.  This concept, enshrined in Chapter XI has worked very well in the United States.  If properly utilised here, there is no reason it could not do the same for many ailing companies in Ireland.</P>
      <P>If our company law is not operable to the extent that a balance is maintained between weeding out the cowboy operators and the fraudulent traders in companies in Ireland while, at the same time, maintaining a balance in favour of risk-takers we must realise that companies can invest and set up their plants and facilities in the UK.  In the UK they are keen to ensure that companies do not have any inhibitions placed on them.</P>
      <P>We have to be always careful about that balance.  The concept which we are introducing under court protection, the examiner concept, is, probably the most positive element in the Bill.  This positive concept in the legislation which can protect employment and protect companies is to be welcomed.  I hope it will have enormous benefits for many industrial jobs and firms here and that it will be utilised to the maximum in order to give a great bonanza to many of our industrial enterprises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly and very generally, I should like to echo the words of the last two speakers.  The Bill so far has attracted a great deal of interest on the grounds that it has dealt with negative items like insider trading, rogue directors and the abuses which go on in companies. It is very definitely a highly imaginative and very positive step by the Government to put this into the Bill.  I do not know &mdash; and I do not think anybody in this House, anybody who drafted this Bill or anybody who has given submissions on this Bill knows exactly &mdash; how it is going to work or whether it is going to work.  Certainly the idea behind it is an extremely encouraging and very clever one.  I can think of several companies which went into receivership and liquidation which might have been saved if this procedure had been adopted in the past.  I do not know whether they would have been saved but they would have been given the opportunity.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I am not sure whether the balance is right.  I am not sure that it will not be possible for unscrupulous directors of a company, to exploit this section of the Bill knowing that if they take a reckless &mdash; that is an unfortunate word in the context of this Bill &mdash; an irresponsible trading decision, they will still be able to call an examiner in.  In the sense that it has a definite thrust for aiding genuine short term ailing industries I congratulate the Minister and wish him the best of luck.  I do not know whether it will work but we will see in years to come.</P>

      <P>It is good really that we are all agreed on this point.  It is an imaginative and a fairly major step forward. I think it will work.  There will be difficulties.  There will always be difficulties in cases like this.  In any sphere or walk of life in trying to resolve any problem and to give some leeway to some people, there will be people who will try to exploit it and turn it to their own self interest which may not be the interest of the company.  I welcome the inclusion of this part of the Bill.  I believe that, which ever perspective one takes on it the idea of ensuring that a company in financial <Col N="38" /> difficulties addresses its problems at an early stage to allow for a realistic examination of the prospects of the company's survival can only be a good thing.</P>
      <P>I have no reservation in terms of the approach or the movement but I suspect I will not surprise the Minister by what I will be putting forward in an amendment shortly, that is, the whole question of who should initiate that.  I know I have failed to convince the Minister on this point although he has been very accommodating. I will take the view of the risk taker again.  Both previous speakers referred to the need to protect the risk taker and said that the risk taker will at least at the end of the day have some protection in regard to getting out of it what he or she put into it.  I put it to the Minister that, in times of very high unemployment, a person who invests a totality of everything he or she has in a company also deserves protection in the terms that that is taking a risk.  I hope the Minister will take on board when it comes to the specific &mdash; I am not jumping ahead here &mdash; that in terms of interested parties the employees and the workers in a company have to be seen as interested parties.</P>
      <P>At times, for instance, it could reasonably be argued against me &mdash; although I did not agree &mdash; that giving workers certian rights could be used in some way to obstruct the workings of the legislation. This is a case when clearly the workers would have concerns absolutely identical to those of other interested parties in the company.  I hope to impress on the Minister that there should be a clearly identified role in the process, an involvement in the process right from the outset. I know the Minister's view is that this is not an industrial relations Bill but all legislation that seems to govern the interaction of people in whatever walk of life is, in effect, legislating for relations, in this case industrial relations.  We need to keep all those areas in mind as we go along.  In other words in looking at this grand new direction we should move forward here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister described this as an imaginative approach towards dealing <Col N="39" /> with the problem.  I go along with that. It is an imaginative approach and I congratulate him, his Department and the people who drafted this.  Unfortunately, it will not get much publicity but it is the sort of workpersonlike approach we have come to expect from the drafters in this Department.  I welcome it.  I hope the Minister will take on board the remarks I have made and respond to them when it comes to the details of the amendment.</P>
    <P>In general terms we have looked here at a problem.  We are discussing it from the point of view of different people who are dependent on a resolution of it.  They are the owners of the company, the suppliers, the people involved in the marketing area and they must also be the workers.  We should look at it from that point of view as we go along.</P>

In that context that drafting amendment is on the floor at the moment.  I thank the Senators for their comments with regard to the section overall.  It is an intensive care mechanism, a rescue mechanism, and as a rescue and intensive care mechanism I look forward to it working.

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 205:</P>
      <P>In page 113, between lines 31 and 32, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) a trade union representing employees of the company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am sorry that I am about to repeat myself but just for the record I am not going to push it.  We have been through it all previously but in each case I hope I have at least brought the Minister some way along.  I ask him to accept that I am not suggesting that a Companies Bill should attempt to regulate industrial relations.  I am saying we must look at this issue as a totality.  A company is an entity with various different groups involved, first of all in the workings of the company, and on the periphery those people who are dependent on the company for everything.  They might be the suppliers, the people selling the produce, people working in transport or people who have rented the property.  They could be a number of various &ldquo;odd bods&rdquo;. Surely in the middle of all that, the position of the employee in the company is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This in a sense is a generality because we are defining now for the purposes of the section what an interested party means.  We are saying certain people can take certain action basically to initiate the procedures governed by this section, in other words, to start off the process by which a company could be examined to assess whether its survival is possible, whether it should be given this period of <Col N="41" /> intensive care and be cocooned from the big bad world for a short time.  We are saying that certain people can do it, that a creditor of the company can do it.  Fair enough, the arguments stand up.  Nobody can argue against that.  Somebody who is owed money will certainly have a very clear interest and a clear commitment to it and should be able to initiate the type of action and process envisaged by Part IX of the Companies (No. 2) Bill.</P>
    <P>Similarly a member of the company who, again because he has an investment in the company, is part of the company is another person who without doubt should have the opportunity to make this legislation move.  &ldquo;Where the company has received financial assistance from Fóir Teoranta, that company...&rdquo;.  I put it to the Minister that employees of the company or &mdash; dare I say it? &mdash; the representatives of the employees of the company would have similar rights and would not be misplaced.  The reasons are quite simple.  A worker cannot at any time liquidate his or her assets in the company. The owner of a company can sell whatever the assets are and take whatever is left over, the &ldquo;owner&rdquo; there meaning all the people who own it whether it is public, private, self-owned or whatever type of company it happens to be.  The owners, or let us say the proprietors, can take their profits, sell it, move out or whatever.</P>
    <P>The creditors can actually sell what they are owed.  People will buy their debts from them at certain times.  The members of the company can also cut from the company at various times, liquidate their assets and see what they can take out of it but the worker cannot do that.  The worker more than anybody else has a complete commitment to the company in that for his or her total lifestyle, whether it is for his or her mortgage repayments, for the cost of education, a house or a holiday, the money comes from the wage or the salary at the end of the week, month or year.  There is no way workers would jeopardise that position.  I do not think there is any way they would be frivolous about the use of this power.</P>
    <P>Let us grasp the nettle on this point. <Col N="42" /> Let us put it to workers that they are part of the company.  Gone are the days when representatives of employees could sit around the table with management and say: &ldquo;We want this level of wage increase and even if it puts the company to the wall we are still demanding it&rdquo;.  Those days are gone.  Nowadays trade union representatives have to know as much about the workings and the running of a company as the management on the other side of the table.  The trade union people, in that sense, are merely representing the employees or the workers.  They have a legitimate interest in the company.  More than anybody else they are committed to making that company continue in operation.</P>
    <P>For those two reasons alone, despite what we would say about the need to protect employment which we would all be agreed on, there is no argument on these issues.  The only argument is that we grasp the nettle.  I suggest to the Minister that that is reasonable.  Forget about where I stand on the political spectrum as such.  It is not a matter of right wing or left wing, or one side or the other. We are talking about a very deliberate approach, a pragmatic approach.</P>

I am saying that the employees or the representatives of employees could quite legitimately be included in this section.  I am proposing that &ldquo;a trade union representing employees of the company&rdquo; should be added.  I know the Minister might not like to have the trade union representative included, as he has indicated already but at this stage I am testing the waters to see how far this can be taken with the Minister.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Hogan I find it very difficult to forget where Senator O'Toole stands on the political spectrum especially when he is making speeches about trades unions.  I also find myself in a peculiar position of not standing very far to the left on the political spectrum, not quite as far left as Senator O'Toole anyway, and agreeing wholeheartedly with his amendment.  It seems that it is unreasonable in this day and age to exclude the employees or the trades unions from being interested parties.  I should remind the House, and it is not irrelevant, of a debate which we had here just before the recess when one of the great arguments on the side of those who supported Irish Distillers in their takeover battle was the interests of the employees and obviously, by implication, of the trades unions.  It seems ridiculous that you should include the shareholders but that you should deny, in a definition of interested parties, those who work day and night for the company in question.  If anybody should have priority as interested parties it is the employees because it is their livelihoods which depend upon this company.</P>
      <P>All we are asking for, as I understand it, in Senator O'Toole's amendment is that the trades unions or someone representing the employees should be allowed to petition the court.  We are not suggesting that the trades unions can actually call in an examiner themselves.  We are only saying they should have the right to petition the court and that the court should then decide.  It seems unreasonable to give the court this role and then to deny to those whose vital interests and whose livelihoods depend upon the company the right simply to ask the court to call in the examiner.  It does not give any vitally interested parties the actual right to call in the examiner.  It gives them the right to ask the court.  If ever there was a case for the trades unions, who are reasonable people, to intervene this is it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the amendment wholeheartedly because I can think of cases in <Col N="44" /> which trades unions can see that management is behaving in an irresponsible way with the company, or where trades unions can see that the interests of the company and the employees, which coincide in many cases, are not being looked after by the management, that they are behaving in a manner which is irresponsible and which threatens the livelihoods of those who work in the factory. As a result of that, it is only reasonably to say: &ldquo;Yes, they have a case to put to the court for the calling in of an examiner to keep the company going&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is surprising that in the legislation as it is drafted no permission is given to directors of a company to bring a petition to court.  Perhaps I would not go as far as what Senator O'Toole is proposing but in companies where there are worker directors they should have an opportunity to bring a petition to court. The Cork Committee report referred to the fact that it is of fundamental importance that the directors can apply for the position of administrator.  That procedure is adopted in the UK and I do not see why it should not be adopted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about section 143 which deals with interested parties.  I noticed Senator O'Toole's main interest here which is: who can initiate a move to the court to have an examiner appointed?  His concern will probably be met by a new amendment which I am bringing in today, amendment No. 207. I am speaking here about the amendment which introduces a new section 145 on who and who may not present a petition. Subsection (1) (b) of that new section will for the first time introduce a new concept. It will now allow contingent and prospective creditors to apply to the court for a protection order for the company. The Senator will recall that we mentioned this aspect when we were discussing the actual status of employees in other sections of the Bill.  While I had previously been happy that the term &ldquo;creditor&rdquo; would normally cover employees &mdash;<Col N="45" /> in perhaps 95 per cent of cases of companies in this situation the term &ldquo;creditor&rdquo; would include employees &mdash; I am happy at this stage to take a further step by putting in the phrase &ldquo;contingent and prospective creditors&rdquo; as parties who may make an application to the court for a protection order.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole knows my view on the issue of mixing trade union legislation with company law legislation and trying to do too much together.  For that reason I am resisting the idea of his amendment from the point of view of giving a trade union a role in the specific area of company legislation.  A prospective creditor or a contingent creditor can go to the court and seek to have an examiner appointed.  An employee would, by any stretch of the imagination, be a prospective creditor of a company.  Therefore, as far as I am concerned, an employee can go to court and seek to have an examiner appointed under the new section 145 which is being introduced here in amendment No. 207.</P>
      <P>In section 143 &ldquo;interested parties&rdquo; is a phrase that runs right through the section.  It differs quite a bit from just who may initiate it.  Section 143 is not a list of those who may initiate it.  It is a list of interested parties for the general purposes of the section.  Section 145 is where we seek to bring in this list of who may initiate it and that is really what is important.  As far as I am concerned an employee may, under the heading of prospective creditor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a mixed response to what the Minister has said. We are back to where we left off in July on the previous part where we had a similar discussion.  Do I take it that what the Minister is saying here is that any interpretation of &ldquo;contingent or prospective creditor&rdquo; would have to include employees?  I can certainly see the logic in that.  I do not have any difficulty in seeing that somebody who has worked for a company would be a contingent or prospective creditor.  I can certainly see that the Minister has come down that road to meet the legitimate problems <Col N="46" /> which I raised when we discussed the last section and I welcome that and I am appreciative.</P>
      <P>I would be prepared to withdraw the amendment if I felt that there was in some way an interpretation of &ldquo;contingent or prospective creditor&rdquo; to include or to indicate that it could include employees of the company.  Then we would have the thing, in a sense, wrapped up.  I know the Minister cannot attempt to give a definition of a creditor, etc.  I know it can be all sorts of things and there are all sorts of ways to approach it.  Could we have an indication somewhere in the legislation that the phrase &ldquo;contingent or prospective creditor&rdquo; would be deemed to include an employee?  That really is the point.</P>
      <P>Were that to be included then that would answer my arguments not in the way that I would prefer them to be answered but at least it would resolve the problems which I have raised.  I would put that to the Minister.  Perhaps he could indicate that it has been done already.  I have not gone completely through all the new proposals.</P>

      <P>Since the summer we have not been lying on beaches in foreign parts but have been working very hard on this legislation.  We have taken on board many of the Senators' proposals and suggestions.  In response to what the Senators have been coming up with, we are introducing a whole series of new sections and amendments which we will come to in the days ahead.  This is the start of that process.  We have all these new sections because of the points raised by the Seanad and submissions which have been made to us to improve the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several changes which we think we should make to section 144 but rather than make them piecemeal I have taken the approach here of replacing the entire section with two new sections.  The first of these concerns itself with the basic <Col N="52" /> power of the court to appoint the examiner and with giving the court some guidance as to when this might be appropriate.  The second new section is essentially concerned with the actual mechanics of the petition itself.  The first part deals with the power to appoint the examiner; the second one deals with the mechanics of appointing that person. That is why I split section 144 into two.</P>
    <P>I can, if Senators wish, explain the many changes of detail we are proposing here.  The general idea, however, as with most of the amendments I am proposing to Part IX of the Bill which is the part we are on, is to make a more workable system of salvaging companies which is the total objective of this part, to rescue companies, to salvage companies, to put them into intensive care so that they can live again.  That is exactly what we are at here.  That is why I split this section into two.  I am splitting it into two, one dealing with the general power of the court to appoint an examiner and the other outlining how an examiner is to be appointed and who should be appointed.  That is the basic thrust of section 144.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the inclusion of these new sections.  I put a question earlier to the Minister and I expressed surprise that there was no reference to directors on the list of those who would be able to bring a petition to the court.  I am very pleased to see that a reference to directors has been included in this new section.  The list of people who have been referred to who would and would not be able to bring a petition to the court is fairly detailed and wide-ranging.  There will be ample opportunities for people to bring petitions to the court and ample opportunities for people to make sure that a company does not go into receivership or liquidation.  If all of those people together watch the affairs of the company as astutely as they should, we should have no company failures.  We should have a lot of activity in the court for the examiner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the inclusion of the new sections but I would just like <Col N="53" /> to ask one or two questions.  I am not sure from reading the section &mdash; perhaps the Minister of State can let me know &mdash; how long it would take to appoint an examiner.  If an examiner is appointed by the court &mdash; I would just like to make sure &mdash; would the examiner go immediately into operation and how long would the court have for this?  Does it mean that the examiner from the day he is appointed by the court goes straight in and he is an examiner as and from that day?  I am not trying to make a pedantic point but I do not see it there and I do not know whether that is normal or not. That may be normal court procedure.</P>
      <P>The second thing I would like to ask the Minister about is whether he has thought to any extent about whether the examiner should be someone who is acceptable to creditors?  It is absolutely no secret that the CII have been interested in this question, whether it is relevant or not or whether it should be left absolutely up to the court.  In other words, should there be any consultation between the court and the creditors or between the court and whoever is petitioning about whether the examiner is someone who is acceptable, whether it is a member, a trade union or a creditor? Should it be included in the Bill and is it a good or a bad thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, should it be included in the Bill as well that once a petition has been proposed that all interested parties should be informed?  It seems that if one interested party comes to the court with a petition there would be several other interested parties who should, by right and by all commercial sense, be entitled to know that the petition is being presented to the court.  I do not see anything in this amendment or any particular section in this Bill which allows for that. In other words, a particular creditor, an employee or a member could possibly steal a march by petitioning the court and telling nobody else who is interested.  I do not see any procedure laid down for the court to actually inform the other interested parties, who I think would probably have something relevant to <Col N="54" /> offer if they are creditors or if they fall into the categories already referred to.</P>
    <P>I am just saying that there should be a procedure of consultation so that the court would be in possession of all the relevant information, of the feelings of all the creditors and all the other people who cannot actually petition the court.  I see a danger in this Bill, and I see a danger which is not covered by this amendment, of one particular category or one person in one particular category actually stealing such a march on the others and I would like to hear the Minister's comments on this.</P>
    <P>The final question I would like to ask relates to the definition, and it is a definition which I think the Minister will have come across before, of when a company is unable to pay its debts.  I do not think this is splitting hairs; I think it is important that we should know exactly what that means.  Does it mean &mdash; and several companies have made some sort of representations on this &mdash; for instance, that when a company looks for significant extensions of credit from various suppliers that means it is unable to pay its debts and that if it is granted these extensions it is working commercially?  Does it mean, for instance, that when a company has not been able to pay its VAT returns or is not able to pay the Revenue, it is unable to pay its debts and there is a case for bringing in the examiner or is that just a normal commercial decision made by the company and made by those who are creditors?  Finally, would an extension, a roll-over bank credit, mean that a company is unable to pay its debts?  Unable to pay its debts is a very broad term in this Bill which could be interpreted in the narrowest possible terms.  In other words, extension of credit by any creditor at all could be interpreted as the company being unable to pay its debts at a time when the company was possibly working in a commercial fashion.  I would just like to see that rather more narrowly defined and to hear the Minister comments on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are very good points, Senator, and I will try to deal with <Col N="55" /> them quickly.  The Senator's first question was when would the examiner start to act.  My response to that would be from the actual moment of the examiner's appointment, which would be case in the case of liquidators and receivers.  From the very moment of their appointment they take up action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Minister for a moment?  That was one of the questions I asked and I think I may not have asked a second one which was, is there any prescribed time between the date of the petition and the appointment?  It seems that we may have in both cases a delay.  Should there not be some defined time in the Bill whereby there would be some limit between the date of the petition and the appointment?  Otherwise it could go on for months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot tackle that issue in this legislation because we are dealing with the rules of the court and the <i>modus operandi</i> of the court itself which really are outside this legislation. One would present a petition to the court with all the papers and documentation and the court then, as soon as it could, would deal with the matter.  In this legislation I cannot lay any time limit on the court.  I can insert time limits for lodging petitions but I cannot put a time limit on when the court must deal with something. I am acting here on the basis that the High Court or the court involved would act on a petition and make a decision on a petition as quickly as possible and that the court would use their injunction-type rules and this is strictly outside this area, to make a quick decision on a petition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have thought about this but I cannot see a way whereby I can insist on the court dealing with something on the day. I think the Senator is aware, particularly if we look at recent events, of how quickly courts can actually sit and come up with a judgment when some interest is threatened or something might be diluted if they do not act.  The courts have been able to sit, act and give a decision.  They certainly do so in the case of liquidations <Col N="56" /> when people can make their submission and have it heard in court very quickly. There is no time limit between the date of the petition and the decision on the petition.  It will have to fall within the ordinary rules of the court: I would not expect any delay of any great significance but then again that would depend on the volume of business the courts would have to deal with in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand exactly what the Minister is saying and I think this is a difficult area.  I am envisaging a situation whereby the court is petitioned and possibly the company involved does not want an examiner called in under any circumstances and produces a mass of documentation in opposition to this particular petition with the case going on for weeks and weeks.  Meantime, simultaneously, the company continues to trade, in an irresponsible manner &mdash; I do not want to use the word &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; again &mdash; to the detriment of everybody involved.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister can produce rules whereby this would be brought to the court under its special injunction procedure but I can see a situation where one goes to the court and the case literally drags on for three or four months.  The examiner then becomes irrelevant because he is not appointed as there is opposition to it.  I do not see that covered in the Bill.  We are talking about companies which in some cases are being run irresponsibly and in some cases get into trouble for perfectly genuine reasons.  I can see this being used as a device by the company to delay the appointment of the examiner with consequent disaster for the people involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Senator is getting at and I know the use that a clever commercial group could make of a situation like this.  In section 145 we talk of the protection of the court applying from the date of the petition. Generally, as in liquidations, the case will be heard immediately, and I hope that that will be the position.  The protection of the court commences from the date of the petition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="57" />
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>But the appointment of the examiner does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It applies from the date of the petition.  Once the petition is lodged with the court the protection of the court will mean that people cannot move against the company.  This does not apply to the date of the appointment of the examiner but to the date when the petition is lodged but those two dates should not be far apart, a matter of hours rather than days.  I am speculating about that area because I do not know what the future pressure on courts might be but this legislation gives protection from the date of the petition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it possible to give the company too much protection and that in that case the company is protected from its creditors?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The company is under no pressure from the other side to trade in any particular commercial way.  Because there is a gap between the appointment of the examiner an the protection of the court, the company gets the protection from its creditors while it can carry on doing what it likes without the interference of the examiner.  That period is very much weighted in favour of the company and it may be to the detriment of the shareholders, the workers and everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if that potential exists.  Those presenting the petition would highlight that possibility and the necessity for an immediate decision because, as the Senator says, once a company is frozen, the Company might feel that they can take their time with the next step.  The ball is in the court of the courts at that stage because they will have the petition which will state the urgency and give all the information about the company.  I could not see a court waiting while a situation deteriorated in a company if they had an urgent <Col N="58" /> petition in front of them.  I would expect the case to be dealt with immediately.  I will certainly give some thought to the Senator's point as it is an interesting one and I can see where there would be some scope for difficulties.  I am operating here in good faith on the basis that the court will deal with the case quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not anticipate how long a case of this sort might last.  This is really a new area.  However, it is better to err on the side of caution.  One cannot anticipate the workings of the courts.  It could happen that they would say they have to hear all the evidence and, as a result, these cases could go on for days or months.  That is the only thing I am worried about if that gap remains that the company itself will suffer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to try to find a solution to this because the Senator is right in that there is a problem to be solved.  One suggestion is that we could run the protection from the date of the appointment of the examiner.  However, if I do that I would be in trouble because then once the town gets to know that a petition is in and a decision awaited, people will run for liquidators in the meantime.  That would negate the whole purpose of this rescue mechanism.  The protection has to run from the moment the petition is in.  It would be meaningless to run it from the date of the appointment of the examiner.  I will look at this to see if in the legal maze we can find a way to make sure there is not a gap that is detrimental.  I am not making any promises because I am not sure we can do that. I am not sure we can tell the courts when to sit and how soon they shall consider an application.  As the Senator knows, the courts operate under court rules. However, I will explore that area and I will say a few words on it on Report Stage, given the opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross asked a few other questions to which I would like to reply.  One question referred to how we would ensure that the examiner would be acceptable to the creditors.  It is worth reflecting on the fact that the petition will be put forward by a group of people.  If the creditors put forward a petition they will name in the petition the person whom they wish to be appointed examiner.  That will ensure that the creditors are happy. If the petition comes from some other source, for instance, the directors of the company, they will name a person in their petition.  The petitioners put forward the name of their nominee in their petition and that ensures that those petitioners are pleased with the person they get. It is practical that the petitioner should suggest an examiner.  That is the way it works in liquidations when people are going to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to informing interested parties.  If the creditors dash to the court for an examiner, Senator, Ross wanted to know if all the other people, the members and so on would be notified.  That does not happen when a liquidator has been appointed.  The party who feel they must act get the evidence together and go to the court and the court can decide.  To that extent, at that moment the court is playing a role in looking after the interests of the other parties and has to take into account the fact that this is a one-sided application coming from a particular person.  The alternative would be too cumbersome. We would end up with a whole committee in court debating the whole future of the company rather than a single issue, that is, that a single interested party feels that a liquidator or an examiner should be appointed.  All I have done here is to <Col N="60" /> copy the liquidation rules which seem to work.  In liquidations one does not have to notify all the various bodies.  One just goes into court and gets the liquidator.</P>
    <P>The Senator's fourth point was about a company being unable to pay its debts. The phrase is the best I can come up with. It is defined in the Companies Act, 1963 as follows: &ldquo;a company shall be deemed to be unable to pay its debts&rdquo;.  It is also in the new section 144 as follows:</P>
    <P>a company is or is likely to be unable to pay its debts (within the meaning of section 214 of the Principal Act).</P>
    <P>The Principal Act has three sections which deal with when a company is unable to pay its debts and so on.  If the Senator wishes I will go through it, but it is all in section 214 of the 1963 Act which lays out the measures by which one is deemed to be unable to pay one's debts. All I have done is to refer to the 1963 Act which has been tried and tested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit I have not read the 1963 Act so I can hardly comment on that yet.  I should like to return to the point about all interested parties being informed when a petition is brought to the courts.  While I understand the Minister's points about liquidations, it seems to me that we have a problem here in that if one small creditor, or a contingent or prospective creditor, or a director or a member of the company, petitions the court the court, obviously, when deciding whether to send in an examiner will have to consider more than the position of the creditor who submits the petition.  The court will have to tell that creditor that it will have to see if there are larger creditors, what the balance sheet looks like, what the trading position of the company looks like and what the annual accounts look like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is doing that he is answering, to a certain extent, my point about all interested parties being informed but he will be creating serious difficulties about the gap we referred to because a court will have to make many inquiries into the state of a company.  If all interested parties are to be informed it <Col N="61" /> seems to me that that type of consultation process will delay the appointment of the examiner.  We cannot have one without the other.  There is a real difficulty here. I am asking the Minister on which side he thinks this should fall because I do not think the two are necessarily reconciled. In other words, if he informs all interested parties of the difficulties and the petition, or if he makes efforts to inform some of them, he will widen this gap between the petition being produced and the examiner being appointed.  One way or another we will have serious difficulties. In equity the Minister should make every effort &mdash; I am not worried about the liquidation rules; I think there is a fault there &mdash; to inform all interested parties if the court is to be able to make a balanced and sensible decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are practical difficulties involved.  Amendment No. 219, which I will be recommending to the Seanad at a later stage, lays down that within three days after the examiner's appointment he or she will advertise that fact in at least two daily newspapers circulating in the district, in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> and notify the registrar of companies who shall publish it in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i>.  Therefore, within three days of the appointment of the examiner the formal notices will be in public circulation to the effect that an examiner has been appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may not meet the Senator's point in that he may be anxious that all interested parties should get a hearing before the decision is made to appoint an examiner but I would have two difficulties in regard to that suggestion.  The first is that we do not adopt such a procedure with liquidations.  To do so would be a slow and cumbersome procedure which would result in delays.  In effect, there almost would be a trial because interested parties would have to be heard.  My second problem is that the ultimate concern of the court is not the good of the individual parties but the good of the company as a unit.  When a court hears from one party to the company &mdash; the creditor, a director, or a member &mdash; its job is not to take into account how the <Col N="62" /> matter will affect individual parties but how it will affect the survival of the company. Therefore, clean surgery is better in this case with the individual party applying for the appointment of the examiner to do the job.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that there might be a case for accepting the Senator's point if we were dealing with liquidations but we are not discussing them.  The role of the examiner is to try to save the company and put it back on the road.  It is unlikely that there would be an aggrieved party at the time of the appointment of the examiner although there may be an aggrieved party when the examiner has finished his or her job. The worst that could happen would be that the examiner would fail to save the company.  It is important to remember that an examiner will be appointed when the company is in serious difficulty.  The Senator's sentiments about consulting those involved are admirable and, in general, I would share them if they related to liquidations but in regard to this matter it would be better to have clean surgery.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to focus the court's mind on its key role, that it must consider the overall good of the company and not go through a check-list of the parties involved to see who agrees.  That may not be entirely satisfactory but it is the best way forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision to give the companies a right to appeal to the courts for the appointment of an examiner.  It will save many small companies who are experiencing short-term cash problems, changes in market trends or unforeseen liquidations of companies that are customers of the troubled company. A great deal of the success in determining the concept of an examiner will depend on the interpretation by the courts.  There is an onus on the courts to get the right balance.  The courts must come up with the necessary ingredients to ensure an acceptable and effective role for the examiner.  To be effective the examiner must be able to integrate with existing management as smoothly as possible.  At the same time the examiner <Col N="63" /> must have sufficient clout to carry out the duties in a business like manner.  The judgment of the courts in this delicate area is vital to the success of the concept of an examiner.  The courts must be able to judge each case on its own merits and arrive at the best possible solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept, as the Minister said, that there are real difficulties in inserting an advertisement when a petition is presented.  I agree that the advertisement should be inserted after the examiner has been appointed and that interested parties should be informed in that way and at that time.  There is a conflict here and it is only right to admit it.  It may be that some of the things I said were in contradiction with each other but that was deliberate.  We have a conflict between the urgency of getting something done and the difficulty about consulting people at the same time because consultation means delay.  The Minister appears to have come down, probably rightly, on the side of urgency in the interests of companies but, having done that, he should consider the points I made about the delay between the making of the petition and the appointment.  Having said that urgency is the criterion here, which I think it is, he should try to think of something between now and Report Stage which will fit in.</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to insert a new section in Part IX which deals with the rescuing of a company which is a member of a group of companies.  In such a case the standard practice may well develop of multiple petitions to the court and simultaneous appointment of the examiner to more than one or, indeed, all of the companies in the group concerned.  It might be convenient if we short-circuited this need by giving the court some flexibility at the outset where a company the subject of a petition is a member of a group.  That is the basic purpose of the amendment.  If it is a group situation an examiner can be appointed to related companies to obviate the need for individual examiners to be appointed to the individual companies within the group.</P>

Section 109, on page 95 of the Bill, deals with the question of related companies.  &ldquo;For the purposes of this Act, a company is related to another company if (a) that other company is its holding company or subsidiary; (b) or more than half in nominal value of its equity share capital is held by the other company&rdquo; and so on.  There are six different definitions of what a related company is.  It is within the meaning of that definition that we talk about a related company here.</P>

      <P>It has been put to me by many people &mdash; including many Senators on the Second Stage debate here &mdash; that this time limit of three months for the protection of the court under Part IX is too short.  Of course our basic position was that the time should be short.  That is quite deliberate, not simply to concentrate minds as it were but also in consideration of the position of creditors, particularly those with security, who would have their debts effectively frozen. You have got to be very careful about how long you can freeze the debts of a company and freeze creditors <i>in situ</i>.  At the same time I will probably have to acknowledge that &mdash; particularly with larger companies &mdash; a time span of three months may be too short when you get down to dealing with cases actually and that some mechanism will have to be found to enable this to be extended where warranted.  Thus, we could with some reluctance agree that provision should be made for extensions in special cases. However, we would be anxious to ensure <Col N="66" /> that extensions do not become the norm in rescue cases.</P>
      <P>I have tried to frame amendment No. 229 in such a way as to make it clear that extensions are to be the exception and that the court will have to be convinced that if it gave the extension, the examiner's report would be delivered in good time thereafter.  The related amendment No. 219 to section 145 (1) is intended as a signpost to section 154 to make it clear that the period of three months mentioned in section 145 is not immutable.  I have given a lot of thought to extending it to three months.  We have given quite an amount of time to discussing and debating the pros and cons of that aspect of it.  It would seem that what we have come up with here is to stick with the three months and allow the examiner, if he or she feels it is necessary, to go back to court and get another month.  That is what we are proposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there has been intense lobbying especially from the accountancy profession on this particular issue and, indeed, from many companies and pressure groups as well.  It is a very difficult one.  I would come out against the Minister's amendment in the end because if the three months limit is not enough &mdash; which it may well not be &mdash; I am not sure that another 30 days is going to be enough either.  We are actually quibbling about time here and I would prefer to see the three months limit stay but to give the court discretion to extend it for longer in special circumstances &mdash; not just 30 days.  My understanding of this amendment is that it can be extended for 30 days and that is it.  I would have thought that possibly what should be done here is that the Minister should allow the examiner to come back to the court after three months and for the court to respond by saying: &ldquo;Yes, you have another 30 days and only another 30 days&rdquo;, but he could be granted another extension after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the urgency of all this and I understand the problems which creditors will come across but accountants I have talked to about this matter assure <Col N="67" /> me that in the case of larger companies the three months limit is totally inadequate and that possibly another 30 days would be inadequate as well.  The answer is that it is impossible to come up with a definite deadline on this issue but that, while keeping pressure on the examiner, it would be absurd to allow him only 30 days extra when he cannot complete the report and when material is still coming into him and has not been collected.  I ask the Minister to consider keeping the three month rule, giving him another 30 days but also &mdash; and we have to trust our courts, they are very sensible people, they will be looking at this objectively with the interests of the company and the creditors in mind &mdash; to consider giving him an extension of another 30 days and another 30 days but only at the discretion of the court.  To give it just four months &mdash; which is the effect of this amendment &mdash; may mean that a proper report is not produced.</P>
    <P>I do not see how you can actually put a time limit on this sort of thing as we do not know the size of the company that will be looking for an examiner.  It is possible that a very large company with worldwide interests could come under this category.  God forbid, but it is possible and we have got to include this as a possibility under this Bill.  In that situation, the three month rule will be inappropriate. It just will not work.  The information will not be collected and a proper report will not be produced. Whereas I think the pressure should be kept going, I can envisage a situation in which this is totally impractical.  You have four months &mdash; three months plus one &mdash; and the examiner then has to come to the court with a totally incomplete report. That could really happen and the Minister should think about it.  The pressure should be kept on him and make him come back to court time after time for an extension.  Certainly do not give him the sort of time rule which means that he produces a report which is inadequate and on which it is impossible to make any sensible decisions.</P>

      <P>I do not follow the logic of what the Senator is saying.  He started off by saying one thing and then said &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; or &ldquo;if&rdquo; or &ldquo;at&rdquo; or &ldquo;this&rdquo;. If we do not stick to a three months limit, the pressure will not be kept on to force the accounts to be produced.  If it could be extended by 30 days each time &mdash; even if they had to go to the court to get that done &mdash; it could drag on on an unending basis.  There has to be a definite time within which the matter is finalised.</P>

Perhaps the Minister will say that that is protecting themselves before the Bill comes in, and that is a possibility.  They are the best opinions I have on this and I respect them.

      <P>The Minister should have some set time because I would be very worried about having an extension month after month.  What happens then is that the creditors might have nothing to get and we know it is very expensive to go to court.  Those people are highly paid professionals and there would be a grave danger that they they would not worry about trying to push it to a finish because they could get another 30 days.  I would see it as a very dangerous thing to put in. It should be either three, four, five or six months.  There should be a very definite date and that is it.  If they have a deadline to work to, they will have to finish at that time.  I would see it as very dangerous to leave it open-ended.</P>

They will keep going on and in the end they will have everything that is going and the poor creditors will have sweet all to get.  I would see it as being very dangerous.  I have a little experience of dealing with this type of thing: &ldquo;Man to man thou art just, but you do not know what man to trust.&rdquo;  I forget who wrote that.  I would appeal to the Minister to have a very positive deadline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel strongly about the question of finality.  I understand Senator Ross' concern, but I think people in business &mdash; bankers, creditors, directors, members of companies &mdash; appreciate deadlines.  I will just refer the Senator, for example, to the recent Irish Distillers saga that we have been having in the newspapers and he will see the number of decisions and reports they were able to produce overnight and the &ldquo;war cabinets&rdquo; they were able to put together an all sides.  The Stock Exchange is a place that is riddled with deadlines, perhaps correctly, but one thing that is very definite about trying to take over a company is that there are terrific deadlines. They are all there, you can make an offer by such a date; you can only increase it by such a date; by such a date you must do this, that and the other.  That kind of finality means everyone knows the rules.  It is like playing in the All-Ireland, when the time is up the time is up and that is that.  I think to say that we did not really get the wind on that one, that we would like to play another 15 minutes, is unfair.  At the end of the day the finality of it is important.  I am totally confident, from what I have seen in commercial life recently, of the speed at which that machine can move when it has to.  If we give the business community six months, they will take six months to write a report.  I know the consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to make really is that it is not a question of you giving it to them, or of our giving it to them.  It is leaving it to the discretion <Col N="70" /> of the court in each case.  The point I am making is that the court whom we should trust, and whom I think we do trust, would judge each case on its merits and will say, &ldquo;No, you have got no more time; this is it.&rdquo;  Or in certain cases for certain reasons, the court can say &ldquo;Yes, it is only reasonable there is more time given&rdquo;.  I do not think the court is likely to give extra time where it is not due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Senator, but we are writing the company legislation, not the courts.  The Oireachtas is writing the legislation and we have to give guidelines to the court.  The Government's intention here is to say,&rdquo; Look, you have three months, you can buy another month and that is it&rdquo;.  The game is over at that stage. You have to be conscious of what the examiner has to do.  He does not manage the company and travel around the globe looking for orders.  He goes in and tries to make arrangements and deals.</P>
      <P>Most good examiners will have this job done in a very short time, in a matter of weeks.  If the expectation was built up in the company that they had got a good chance in court of getting a further extension, it could become the norm.  I really think the time limit is important here, just like the Stock Exchange rules; I am not being smart when I am referring the Senator to that, I honestly believe the analogy is correct.  The deadline is there and people have to meet it and business people are very strong on the point about finality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have come across some criticisms about Chapter XI in the United States about their system which can drag on and on and can go on much longer than we would envisage.  It is something we can look at I suppose in future years when we see how the system is working.  We are talking about a rescue, an emergency, drastic action where creditors perhaps will get frightened by the amount of moneys they are owed and a scheme has to be put together and adopted by the court.  You need to capture that atmosphere and knock heads together to get the agreement at the time.  If it becomes a normal part of trading instead of a kind <Col N="71" /> of crisis situation, I do not think people will concentrate as urgently and they will not be in the mood to do the deals perhaps that they should do for the company if it drags on.  I think that is important.</P>
    <P>If you are a banker or a creditor and the company owes you money and you are not agreeing and you know there is a deadline, you have to make a quick decision whether to go with the company going into liquidation or to come on board because you have got to go to court in three days time.  If we do not put in a definite deadline I am worried about that. I know the Senator said the court could decide that in view of the facts, but I think it is better off if the examiner knows when he starts that the deadline is there and is not going to move &mdash; a bit like the tax amnesty perhaps.  It is important that we put down a marker.</P>
    <P>I honestly think that if a company is worth saving and if it is in intensive care it is worth staying up all night to save it and it is worth rolling up the sleeves and getting in there and sorting it out quickly. I have seen companies doing that and I think it works very much.  We are talking about intensive care here and in intensive care people do not keep office hours. They do not come in at nine and go home at 5 o'clock.  When a patient is in intensive care it works around the clock.  It has got a deadline to meet.  It has got to save the situation.  It cannot hang around.  Three or four months is certainly adequate to come up with a report.  It is not being asked to turn the company around in that period.  It is being asked to write a report and I know many good potential examiners who would write that report overnight, if they had to.</P>

      <P>This is a technical drafting amendment.  It is intended to clear up an apparent ambiguity in section 145 (2) (b) of the Bill.  The basic idea in that paragraph is that following the presentation of a petition under section 144, no receiver can be appointed to the company concerned.  That is all right so far but, however, the provision goes on to say that no receiver if so appointed shall subject to section 146 be able to act, what we mean here is a receiver who is appointed before the petition was presented.  The current wording seems to suggest that a receiver could somehow be validly appointed after the presentation of the petition.  I am just really improving the wording of the section here to get the intention clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are moving here to the powers of the examiner and the examiner's role once he is appointed.  I am putting in a section which allows the examiner to go to court if he wishes to take over the running of a company.  The reason I hesitated, A Chathaoirligh, is that I was just wondering whether I would go through the various sections or just give a pen-picture.  I think I will do the latter first and see whether the Senators wish me to go into more detail.</P>
      <P>Basically, what I am providing in this section is that if an examiner, once he or she is in place, feels that he or she wants to take over to himself or herself the full powers of the directors of the company, the examiner must go back to court to get that done and if the court agrees, can have vested in the examiner the full powers of the directors of the company. I want to be clear on this.  When the examiner goes in first he does not have that power but he has the option of going to court to get that power as quickly as possible.  That is the broad picture.  There are a number of other details in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present policy of Part IX is that the examiner is, in effect, a sort of a company doctor who basically analyses the company in difficulties, prescribes remedies and gets the parties concerned to try to agree.  It has been very strongly put to us by a number of interested parties that it is essential that the examiner should be in a position to actually run the company in certain cases if there is to be any hope of a successful rescue.  These parties are not happy that the current <Col N="76" /> powers of the examiner in this respect as they presently appear in section 147 (6) and (7) are the proper solution.</P>
    <P>I have considered this in some depth and the two amendments I have put forward today are the result of this.  In framing the amendments I was reluctant to go the whole way and give the examiner an unfettered right from day one to run the business in this way.  For one thing a right like this might very well discourage companies and their boards from seeking protection in the first place.  Much of the initiative will come from the company and the directors themselves to seek the appointment of an examiner so it is important that we encourage them to do that.  Company managements could be reluctant to seek court protection if they saw that the automatic consequence of this would be their removal from office, even temporarily, and the stripping of their powers.  This kind of attitude would be understandable and would of course be the opposite to what I want to achieve.</P>
    <P>I found a very sensible middle ground here which I think is unique in legislation and it certainly differs from other regimes.  This middle ground would ensure that the directors would stay in possession to begin with but that the examiner could ask the court, at any time, to give him or her full management powers if he or she could demonstrate that this was necessary.  That is a very central and important part of this mechanism.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 215 is related to amendment No. 216 and since I am proposing, by the introduction of the new section, to give the examiner more powers in certain cases it follows that he or she will no longer need the powers in section 147 (7) of the Bill.  Related amendment No. 215 simply deletes subsection (7) of section 147.  To summarise, I have listened very carefully to rescue specialists and rescue experts, not just accountants but the people who have specialised in company rescue, including our own State agency in that area, and also in the private sector.  Indeed some Senators have spoken about the examiner's role.  I have accepted all that <Col N="77" /> advice.  With regard to giving him the power to run the business from day one, some people suggested that this could be a way of running the business more effectively with benefits all around but this middle course is perhaps the correct route to go forward, that is, putting the examiner in and then leaving it to the examiner to decide whether he needs the power of the directors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>For the examiner to get the full powers of the directors in the first instance he must go to the court but I think the examiner should be given the power to run the company.  In other words, if he is to keep a company viable for a rescue or take-over or to keep a company running, the examiner must be given the full powers to run the company in the meantime.  If he has to go to court in the first instance to obtain the powers of the directors, should he not be given the power to run the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>To be clear, when the examiner goes in he does not have the full powers of the directors at that point, but if he decides he needs those powers when he sees the company in the small print he can go back to the court and get the powers.  That will greatly encourage the directors to co-operate with the examiner because they will know that the examiner can go back to court and get full powers if he can explain why he needs them.  In the meantime, the examiner has very substantial powers.  He presides at meetings, attends board meetings and generally has authority to order the affairs of the company but does not have the full powers of the directors unless he seeks them.  I am happy that the Senator envisages a situation where the court appoints an examiner who perhaps has not been suggested by the company but the Senator must also remember that, by and large, it will be the company that goes to court to seek the appointment of the examiner.  If we want to encourage them to do that, we do not want to frighten them to the extent that they will not go to court to get an examiner appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will probably be the directors of the <Col N="78" /> company who will see a situation developing where they will need help.  If they see a liquidation staring them in the face they will seek to get an examiner brought in to assist them.  I hope that the normal situation will be that, when the examiner comes in, he will be able to work through the managing director and the board and effectively call all the shots.  That would be effectively what he would do.  It would be a very sensible management who would co-operate with him.  If the management do not co-operate then the examiner can say: &ldquo;I am off to court to seek the powers of the directors and when I come back from the court I will be in a position to direct things fully&rdquo;.  This is a nice mixture because if I tried to do it any other way I would be worried about scaring off the people I need to make this work and very often these are the directors of the company themselves.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 216:</P>
      <P>In page 117, before section 148, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;(1)  Where it appears to the court, on the application of the examiner, that, having regard to the matters referred to in subsection (2), it is just and equitable to do so, it may make an order that all or any of the functions or powers which are vested in or exercisable by the directors (whether by virtue of the memorandum or articles of association of the company or by law of otherwise) shall be performable or exercisable only by the examiner.</P>

    <P>(2)  The liabilities referred to in subsection (1) are those certified by the examiner at the time they are incurred, to have been incurred in circumstances where, in the opinion of the examiner, the survival of the company as a going concern during the protection period would otherwise be seriously prejudiced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether this is the appropriate section on which to raise this matter but perhaps the Chair will guide me on it.  How does the Minister envisage a situation whereby the examiner, who is taking over the role of chief executive of the company or something similar to that, decides that he needs a rapid and major injection of capital into the company, in other words what is referred to as liabilities in this amendment? How would that come about?  The answer may be that it is just a normal commercial decision for him to actually go and look for credit elsewhere in order to get capital for the company.  Would the Minister consider that he should have <Col N="82" /> some special relationship perhaps with Fóir Teoranta or some bank of that sort? I am trying to visualise in a situation where the examiner having made a decision and having seen that the company may be rescued in certain circumstances and needs short term funds and capital, or just needs a cash injection, where he would go for that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>He would behave commercially.  I do not think a special arrangement with a particular bank or Fóir Teoranta would be wise at this stage. It is better that he is free to make his own arrangements.  If the examiner required a cash injection he would obviously have to talk to individual banks or would-be investors if he chose to do that.  It is important that we get this clear.  At first his only power is that of veto.  He is there to prepare the report, assess the situation, preside at meetings and guide the management.  He has powers under section 147 to take whatever steps are necessary to halt, prevent or rectify the effects of such act, omission, course of conduct, decision or contract.  In other words, he has a kind of veto at that stage. If he sees the directors doing something, he can stop it.  At that stage if cash is needed and the directors are not seeking it, I do not think it is impossible for him to instruct them as to what they have to do.  I am relying on the fact that the company would certainly co-operate with him, knowing that he can get the power if he wants it.  If he goes back to the court and takes the power of the directors he can arrange the necessary finance if he feels it is necessary to keep the company going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an almost universal view since the Bill was published that one of the main difficulties which would be faced by a company under protection, and by the examiner, would be the reluctance of ordinary trade creditors to continue to supply the company during the protection period.  Such a refusal might be based on the fear that the company might be wound up at a later time or, indeed, a receiver appointed after the company came out of protection and that <Col N="83" /> they would effectively just be throwing good money after bad.  For that reason we felt it necessary to give the examiner this role of certifying debts which would be paid as expenses.</P>
    <P>The Senator's point is whether the examiner can raise capital.  When he is carrying out the duties of the directors and has the full power of the directors he can do whatever the directors could have done under ordinary company legislation. Assuming that the directors could raise capital as directors, so too could the examiner.  He would not have that power while he was not exercising the role of the directors but he should almost certainly be able to ensure that the chief executive of the company at that time does so if that is what is needed.  If the chief executive fails to do so, the examiner can be appointed in his place.  I do not know if that clears up the point.  I certainly would envisage that the examiner, when he is exercising the duties of the directors, would be able to do whatever the directors could do, such as raise capital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point. It is an extension of the point he made about trade creditors being reluctant to give the examiner in this situation any more credit.  That is a very natural and normal commercial decision for trade creditors to take.  That should be extended to commercial banks and anybody who is likely to lend him money or to inject capital.  What I can see &mdash; and I am not even sure whether or not this is correct but I think it is &mdash; is a situation in which an examiner decides that the company is viable if its gets an injection of capital and if it is given further credit. If I was a bank to whom the company already owed money I would be very reluctant to lend any more money to that company even under pressure and recommendation from the examiner.  The examiner will certainly have a plan, a very coherent project, for getting the company back into profit and back on a stable footing but if he goes to a normal bank &mdash; and I am arguing to a certain <Col N="84" /> extent against my own philosophy &mdash; looking for more money, having a new plan and a new situation, he will find the bank, just as much as ordinary trade creditors very reluctant to forward any more money to the examiner, whatever and however credible his plan.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the solution to this problem is, but maybe some sort of special arrangement with Fóir Teoranta might help.  What we may come across here is the whole theory of the examiner being a very worthy and a very enterprising one but, in practice, when he is thrown into the rough commercial jungle, he finds that people are very reluctant to deal with him on normal commercial criteria because he is a new phenomenon and does not really bear the sort of credit worthiness necessary.  They would be frightened that the company would go under and that they would be, as the Minister said, in normal trade credit terms, throwing good money after bad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me explain briefly.  I may have misled the Senator and I assure him it was not deliberate.  It is envisaged that the procedure of certification of debts due will extend to bank loans or bank overdrafts or that type of credit which the examiner may need. What is meant by this procedure is that the examiner could certify the debt as being one he requires.  That would automatically rank it as an expense of the examiner and as such it would under, section 165 (3) of the Bill, be paid before any other debts, even preferential ones. When a company is liquidated the first bill paid is the cost of liquidation, so this will become a cost of examining, as it were, and therefore rank as the first payment in the event of the company subsequently being wound up or a receiver appointed.  When I talked about certifying debts earlier I meant to include bank overdrafts and borrowings or loans which the examiner may require to put in place.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister mean that it the examiner incurs any more debts on <Col N="85" /> behalf of the company then &mdash; and I cannot find this here &mdash; they will get some sort of preferential status?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes.  It is Government amendment No. 217, incurring of certain liabilities by the examiner.  The first subsection reads: &ldquo;Where an order is made under this Part for the winding up of the company or a receiver is appointed, any liabilities incurred by the company during the protection period which are referred to in subsection (2) shall be treated as expenses properly incurred, for the purpose of section 165, by the examiner.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I welcome very much the right of the examiner to guarantee payment to a creditor who continues to supply goods.  This is particularly important in an area where another company has a monopoly.  Often companies go into liquidation because of failure to get supplies from other companies who have a monopoly of the market.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 218:</P>
      <P>In page 117, before section 148, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;.&mdash;(1) Where, on an application by the examiner, the court is satisfied that the disposal (with or without other assets) of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) any property of the company subject to a security to which this section applies, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) any goods in the possession of <Col N="86" /> the company under a hire-purchase agreement,</P>
    <P>would be likely to facilitate the survival of the whole or any part of the company as a going concern, the court may by order authorise the examiner to dispose of the property as if it were not subject to the security or to dispose of the goods as if all rights of the owner under the hire-purchase agreement were vested in the company.</P>
    <P>(2) This section applies to any security other than a security which, as created, was a floating charge.</P>
    <P>(3) It shall be a condition of an order under subsection (1) that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the net proceeds of the disposal, and</P>
    <P>(b)  where those proceeds are less than such amount as may be determined by the court to be the net amount which would be realised on a sale of the property or goods in the open market by a willing vendor, such sums as may be required to make good the deficiency,</P>
    <P>shall be applied towards discharging the sums secured by the security or payable under the hire-purchase agreement.</P>
    <P>(4) Where a condition imposed in pursuance of subsection (3) relates to two or more securities, that condition requires the net proceeds of the disposal and, where paragraph (b) of that subsection applies, the sums mentioned in that paragraph to be applied towards the sums secured by those securities in the order of their priorities.</P>
    <P>(5) An office copy of an order under subsection (1) in relation to a security shall, within 7 days after the making of the order, be delivered by the examiner to the registrar of companies.</P>
    <P>(6) If the examiner without reasonable excuse fails to comply with subsection (5), he shall be liable to a fine <Col N="87" /> not exceeding £1,000 and, for continued contravention, to a daily default fine not exceeding £50.</P>
    <P>(7) References in this section to a hire-purchase agreement include a conditional sale agreement, a retention of title agreement and an agreement for the bailment of goods which is capable of subsisting for more than 3 months.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section which tries to maintain an important element of balance in the Bill while, at the same time, ensuring that it will be as workable as possible.  It has been put to me that the company could be effectively hamstrung during the protection period if some of its assets, for example buildings incurring heavy overheads, were the subject of a fixed security.  This could clearly be a drain on the company's resources during the protection period and the suggestion was that the examiner should be able to dispose of such property whether or not he has been given power by the court actually to run the business.</P>
      <P>However, there is a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  The examiner should, the argument goes, be required to account to the security holder for the proceeds of any such disposal. Similar arguments have been put to us in cases where goods in the company's possession are the subject of retention of title agreements which the Senator mentioned.  Obviously if the supplier concerned could simply grab the goods, the company's position could very quickly become untenable.  The UK also faced this problem in their protection legislation. The amendment we have come up with to address this problem is similar to section 15 of the UK Insolvency Act, 1986.  What we are doing there is ensuring that the examiner can actually dispose of secured assets and provide that they are paid over to the body that secures them.</P>

      <P>If an examiner is appointed and a supplier supplies goods, does he lose his title to those goods?  Can he still retain title to the goods?  If that is <Col N="88" /> the situation, once an examiner is put in, suppliers would be very reluctant to supply goods if they cannot retain title to those goods.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated earlier that he was introducing an amendment to cover what we were referring to in relation to the retention of title and the status of goods supplied to a company under examination.  I want to know what status would those goods have in those circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a technical question here to which I would have to give further consideration.  Basically he can use the goods but would have to apply them towards discharging the sums secured by the security or payable under the hire purchase agreement.  If there was a hire purchase agreement in place, or something like that, he would have to discharge the sums due on foot of those contracts.  Is the Senator referring to the general ownership of goods supplied generally in the ordinary trade sense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In the ordinary trade sense if a supplier supplies goods to a company that is under examination, can the supplier retain title to those goods and, failing that, would he rank as a preferential creditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get this clear because there is some confusion about it. We are talking here about an ordinary creditor who supplies goods to an examiner. The query really is whether the person who supplies the goods to the examiner can retain the title.  The same situation applies there as if the goods are supplied to a company unless the examiner decides he wishes to certify the particular debt, in which case it will rank as an expense.  If you are supplying goods <Col N="89" /> to an examiner you are in the same position as if you are supplying goods to any other company, unless the examiner decides he wishes to certify the debt, in which case the debt will rank as an expense so you should get your money if the company goes into liquidation.</P>
      <P>On the question of title passing, title passes when the goods are paid for, and the same rules apply as in the ordinary course where you would have to have a retention of title clause before you could retain the title.  We have not built into this legislation any special retention of title other than for hire purchase and the like which is separate.  We have not built into the legislation any separate retention of title clause which allows someone who supplies goods to an examiner to retain the title.  I did not detect any particular demand to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that it will cause problems.  If suppliers of goods to a company under examination have a retention of title to those goods, they will demand a 100 per cent return on the supply of their finance or the return of their goods from that company.  It is an area where there could be great confusion if we do not clarify it now.  Is the examiner treating those goods as part of the assets of the company or not?  If they are not part of the assets of the company, they cannot be treated as part of the package which will bring about a reconstruction of the company.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 220:</P>
      <P>In page 117, before section 149, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>.&mdash;(1) An examiner may resign or, on cause shown, be removed by the court.</P>
      <P>(2) A vacancy in the office of examiner may be filled by the court.</P>
      <P>(3) An examiner shall be described by the style of &ldquo;the examiner&rdquo; of the particular company in respect of which he is appointed and not by his individual name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) The acts of an examiner shall be valid notwithstanding any defects that <Col N="92" /> may afterwards be discovered in his appointment or qualification.</P>
    <P>(5) An examiner shall be personally liable on any contract entered into by him in the performance of his functions (whether such contract is entered into by him in the name of such company or in his own name as examiner or otherwise) unless the contract provides that he is not to be personally liable on such contract, and he shall be entitled in respect of that liability to indemnity out of the assets; but nothing in this subsection shall be taken as limiting any right to indemnity which he would have apart from this subsection, or as limiting his liability on contracts entered into without authority or as conferring any right to indemnity in respect of that liability.</P>
    <P>(6) A company to which an examiner has been appointed or an interested party may apply to the court for the determination of any question arising out of the performance or otherwise by the examiner of his functions.</P>

      <P>This section relates to the resignation of an examiner and amendment No. 220 takes the convenient approach of replacing the whole of section 149 rather than making piecemeal changes.  We have also changed the note in the margin.  To begin with, the words in subsection (1) &ldquo;appointed under this Part&rdquo; appear to be unnecessary because the term &ldquo;examiner&rdquo; is already defined in section 143.  There is also a typographical error in line 30.  The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; should read &ldquo;on&rdquo;.  Subsection (2) is unchanged. Subsections (3) and (4) are new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has increasingly struck us, and this point has been made previously in the Seanad, that unlike the winding-up provisions of the Companies Act, Part IX of the Bill is somewhat short of procedural mechanics though some of the amendments we have already discussed include several which have been inspired by the liquidation procedures of the existing <Col N="93" /> Act.  Subsections (3) and (4) of amendment No. 220 are two further cases in point and are based on section 228 (b) and (g) respectively of the 1963 Act.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) is also new.  It has been put to us that it would be useful and desirable to have a provision dealing with the liability of the examiner in respect of acts done by him in the same way as applies to receivers under section 316 (2) of the 1963 Act, particularly since we are now proposing to give the examiner more power in relation to running the business. Subsection (5), therefore, is closely based on section 316 (2) of the 1963 Act.</P>
    <P>Finally, subsection (6) of the amendment is unchanged from section 149 (3) of the present text.  It is really a list of the general provisions as to the examiner and his office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a procedure which has also been adopted in relation to receivers and liquidators taking account of general provisions where the person carrying out the examination resigns.  The section fails to take account of an examiner wishing to retire rather than resign. An examiner may find himself in an awkward position in a company.  Having been appointed by various creditors or a group of creditors to carry out an examination, there might be an occasion when he or she might feel obliged to retire rather than to resign.  Perhaps there is a loophole here.  If an examiner finds something in the investigations he is not happy with, he could retire rather than be forced out by the court or forced to resign.  The word &ldquo;retire&rdquo; needs to be included in order to cover that eventuality.  Maybe I am overstating the case but it is worth discussing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between resigning and retiring is that an examiner, if he chooses to retire, could wait until a particular period of time has elapsed and drag his feet on the issue.  He might be appointed for a particular length of time to carry out the examination.  At the end <Col N="94" /> of that specific period of time he might choose to retire rather than issue a report. I can visualise this happening more in the case of receiverships rather than examinations but I am wondering whether this could happen in the case of examiners?</P>

      <P>We are talking here about a period of three months, possibly four.  I think the word &ldquo;retire&rdquo; is perhaps too polite.  It gives the impression that this is almost a lifetime's work, from which one would retire.  If you get out of this job in the middle of a three-month period, what you are doing is resigning. The 30-day period provides for an examiner to resign or be removed from office, which I suppose is not the correct word to use.</P>

      <P>If somebody resigns during the course of an examination, does that not smell particularly bad for the company involved?  It might prejudice the good standing of the directors who brought the petition.  Perhaps there are less glorious ways in which a course of action might be taken.  The examiner might choose to retire rather than to resign.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The safety valve is that one would have to go back to court to get another examiner appointed.  I imagine the court would want to know why a new examiner was required.  At that point the thing would emerge.  I do <Col N="95" /> not think we should lay it on an examiner who just wants to give up the job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, in day-to-day operations these things happen. Receivers might choose not to make a report in certain instances because they may find themselves being put in an awkward position.  They may prefer not to make a report rather than getting embroiled in something that they might not like to get involved in.  If a group of creditors decide to make a petition and appoint an examiner, there is no reason in the world why the people who appoint the examiner would not exercise their weight and judgment in order to get a particular result. The examiner finding himself under that particular type of pressure might choose to retire.  If the word &ldquo;resign&rdquo; is mentioned during any particular examination, it could generate a lot of ill-will towards the reconstruction of the company and there could be bad feeling.</P>

      <P>I see the Senator's worry.  The whole story about the company will come out in the examiner's report.  Perhaps it is better that it should come in that independent way.  Once the examiner wishes to resign, he can do so and we can get somebody else to do the job and then that person can go to court and present the reports and explain all that has to be explained about the company.  It is a different way of solving it.  It will take its course.</P>

      <P>When reading the amendments this morning I noticed that subsection (6) of amendment No. 220 says:</P>
      <P>A company to which an examiner has been appointed or an interested party may apply to the court for the determination of any question arising out of the performance or otherwise by the examiner of his functions.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How would the Minister of State reconcile that provision with the provisions of Section 147, as amended, relating to <Col N="96" /> the powers of the examiner to convene meetings of the boards of directors, or to be heard at meetings of the boards of directors?  How can the company take decisions independently of the examiner which would enable it to ask the court to resolve the dispute if the examiner has a large control over the decision making process of the company?  I cannot understand how the company can make a petition when it can no longer operate independently of the examiner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately the shareholders of the company would have the ultimate power in the matter.  The purpose of this clause is to ensure that if an examiner has a difficulty and cannot resolve it, or is not getting co-operation, he can go to the court.  The intention is &mdash; so that the examiner can do his job. The shareholders will still be the ultimate authority in the company in policy terms. The intention behind this is that the examiner will have access to the court in carrying out his duties under this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to be troublesome but I am fully aware of the intention of the subsection.  I am not clear on another issue.  There may well be no shareholders other than the directors of the company and it appears that section 147, as amended, effectively stymies the company from having the capacity to take independent decisions.  Can the Minister illustrate how a company which has an examiner involved with it could, independently of the examiner, petition the courts?  The powers of the examiner under section 147 are very extensive and it is difficult to see how the company could take an independent decision which he could not effectively over-rule, given that Section 147 (6) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an examiner becomes aware of any actual or proposed act, omission, course of conduct, decision or contract, he shall, subject to the rights of parties acquiring an interest in good faith and for value in such income, assets or liabilities, have full power to <Col N="97" /> take whatever steps are necessary to halt, prevent or rectify the effects of such act, omission, course of conduct, decision or contract.</P>
    <P>Given the power of the examiner I cannot see how a company could petition the courts independently.  If that is the intention it could be more precisely written so that the members of the company would be entitled to meet and take a decision separate from the examiner if they wanted to petition the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of the company are the shareholders.  They will still be in existence so they can take a decision to go to the court to have a matter determined.  There is nothing to prevent the members of the company from going to court to have a matter determined.  Whether or not the examiner agrees with them, the members are the shareholders and whether or not they are directors is a separate matter.  There is no question in this legislation of removing the shareholders.  Even if they are all directors, there is a provision here for the examiner to take over the powers of the directors, in other words, the running of the company, but the shareholders of the company are still in existence.  The shareholders would not have the authority to remove the examiner but as shareholders they would have a life of their own and could go to the courts to have a matter determined.  There are two distinct power centres both of which can go to court &mdash; the examiner and the shareholders whether or not they are directors.  That is the only workable structure I could come up with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not arguing about the principle.  What the Minister is saying is not clear in the Bill.  Section 147 (3) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding any provision of the Companies Acts relating to notice of general meetings, an examiner shall have power to convene, set the agenda for, and preside at meetings of the board of directors and general meetings of the company to which he is <Col N="98" /> appointed and to propose motions or resolutions and to give reports to such meetings.</P>
    <P>That is not affected by amendment No. 214 so it stands.  Subsection (4) reads:</P>
    <P>An examiner shall be entitled to reasonable notice of, to attend and be heard at all meetings of the board of directors of a company and all general meetings of the company to which he is appointed.</P>
    <P>The examiner will always be entitled to attend general meetings of shareholders or meetings of the directors.  Subsection (6) goes on:</P>
    <P>Where an examiner becomes aware of any actual or proposed act, omission, course of conduct, decision or contract, by or on behalf of the company to which he has been appointed, its officers, which in his opinion, is or is likely to be to the detriment of that company, or any interested party, he shall, subject to the rights of parties acquiring an interest in good faith, in such income, assets or liabilities, have full power to take whatever steps are necessary to halt, prevent or rectify the effects of such act...</P>
    <P>If the examiner does not want to allow the directors or the members of the company to petition the court under the provisions of section 149, he would be in a position to effectively veto such a petition because he would be able to overrule them if he saw fit.  That is the way it reads to me.  I do not want the Minister to go back over what we have already discussed, but I cannot see how either the members or the directors can act independently of the examiner and take the decision as a company to petition the court to resolve a dispute between themselves and the examiner.  That is what I am trying to get clarified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not envisage that the examiner will overrule the shareholders of a company who wish to go to court.  Under section 147 the examiner has a veto power to take whatever steps <Col N="99" /> are necessary to halt, prevent or rectify the effects of such acts, omission, course of conduct, decision or contract.  That is in the case of actions which are likely to be to the detriment of the company.  A decision by the shareholders to go to court would not, by any stretch of the imagination, be deemed to be an action likely to be to the detriment of the company. The examiner, therefore, would not have the power to overrule a decision by the shareholders of the company to go to court for the determination of any matter.  He can only overrule them where it is likely to be to the detriment of the company.  This is a difficult concept because the shareholders remain in existence and they have certain options, one of which is to go to court to seek the determination of a matter.  The examiner has such an option.  He can overrule many things but he certainly cannot overrule something that is not to the detriment of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment we are discussing deals with the power of a company to apply to a court.  Section 147 is one of the sections which determines the relationship between the examiner and the company.  The examiner's relationship with the company is fundamental to whether the company can take a decision to apply to the court for clarification.  I do not have any dispute with the principles involved but as things stand it is a matter for the opinion of the examiner, not something that he has to establish in court, whether something is to the detriment of the company.  The examiner may hold the view that a petition to the court would be to the detriment of the company and I cannot see anything in the legislation which would prevent him from doing that if he wishes.</P>

      <P>The directors of the <Col N="100" /> company are the people who run the company. If the examiner takes control he takes over the duties and functions of the directors but the shareholders, as a separate body of people, still retain ownership of the company.  In this procedure we are not removing ownership of the company; we are putting in a person to do a particular job.  The owners of the company will continue to exist.  What we are saying is that while the examiner is doing his or her job the owners of the company can go to court and the examiner cannot say, &ldquo;I hereby prevent the owners of the company from going to court&rdquo;.  I do not think I need to write that into the legislation because we are not removing the powers of the shareholders. I do not think there is a need to list what I am not doing.</P>

      <P>There is nothing to prevent the shareholders of a company meeting.  All they have to do under this provision is to notify the examiner.  If he <Col N="101" /> or she chooses not to attend, or to attend and preside, it will have to be borne in mind that other people own the company. I am sure they will be prepared to say, &ldquo;We do not care what the occupant of the chair says.  We are going to the court to have this matter determined; we have that right under the legislation and the examiner cannot veto that move because it is not detrimental to the company&rdquo;.  I cannot see the Senator's point.  We are talking about two separate blocs of people, the shareholders who own the company and who have access to the court, and the examiner who may have influence if he presides at the meeting.  I can assure the Senator that the shareholders will be aware that they own the company.  They also will be aware of their right under this legislation to approach the court.  It should be remembered that all we are talking about is giving them the right to approach the court and that is not exactly earth shattering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to get involved in a dispute with the Acting Chairman or the Minister on this because, ultimately, it will be resolved in the courts.  One of the reasons for this legislation is that there have been many abuses of company law by unscrupulous directors and owners who have used the privilege of limited liability in ways that were to the detriment of customers, employees and the general climate for enterprise and business here.  If an examiner decides that the owners are being malicious in petitioning the courts as a way of frustrating his or her activities then, in my view, the Bill gives the examiner the authority to overrule them on the basis that it was his or her opinion that it would be to the detriment of the company.  I do not think that uncertainty has been resolved but that is my last word on the issue; I will not pursue it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not the pushy type and <Col N="102" /> I should be allowed make my point now. The amendment is a good one but I should like to put a number of questions to the Minister in regard to it.  Senator Hogan was right in saying that there was a danger in copying in all these amendments the powers and provisions for liquidators and receivers without recognising that the examiner has a completely different role to play.  The examiner will not be called in unnecessarily by creditors. More often than not it will be the company that will be calling in the examiner. The amendment envisages the demise or the departure of an examiner and it is important that the Minister, in order to solve the problem raised by Senator Hogan in regard to resigning or retiring, outlines the circumstances in which he envisages an examiner resigning or being removed by a court.  Will it occur where there is a conflict of interest or where there is a question of dishonesty or fraud involved?  We must consider when the removal will be necessary.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) is very sloppy.  It states that a vacancy in the office of examiner may be filled by the court and it seems to me that in the circumstances envisaged in subsection (1), where an examiner may resign, or, on cause shown, be removed by the court, that it will be necessary that an examiner be appointed immediately because those circumstances would be sudden and unforeseen.  It will not be possible to anticipate them and they will not happen in the normal course of events.</P>
      <P>One cannot anticipate a resignation or a removal.  To follow subsection (1) with the sloppy sentence that a vacancy in the office of examiner may be filled by the court seems to me not to put any obligation on the court to fill it or not to specify any time limit within which the court should fill it.  In my view it is essential if subsection (2) follows directly from subsection (1) that we state in subsection (2) that the vacancy shall be filled by the court immediately.  Otherwise, there may be a long gap and it may be necessary to go through the same procedure as with a petition.  Will the Minister answer that point?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many circumstances under which an examiner may wish to resign.  That person may have too much work, may wish to branch into another area, may have discovered a conflict of interest which he or she was not aware of or may feel that it was time to quit the assignment on the basis that it was getting complicated.  They are legitimate reasons why one may wish to resign and they are ordinary, everyday reasons. We agreed earlier that we should not make a list of reasons why an examiner should be removed for fear of leaving out some human failing.  However, such matters as incompetence, dishonesty, being charged with a criminal offence, fraud and other areas could be causes for removing a person from office.  In any way conniving or planning with individual creditors would be dishonest as well. Those are the kind of areas in which I would envisage an examiner would be removed &mdash; I stress that that list is much longer than I have indicated.</P>
      <P>I take the Senator's point about the next sentence: &ldquo;A vacancy in the office of examiner may be filled by the court.&rdquo; My legal advice is that we are not permitted to say in this case &ldquo;shall be filled by the court&rdquo; on the basis of the theory of separation of powers whereby we do not tell the court what it does.  My legal advice is that &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this context is always interpreted as &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to believe the Minister about that.  I have no option and I do not for one moment question that. Even if that is the case, which undoubtedly it is, that sentence certainly needs tightening up because it gives the option to the court whether or not to fill the vacancy and it gives no timetable on the court.  Surely it is essential &mdash; we discussed it in the previous section &mdash; that we can give guidelines to the court.  We have done so in a previous amendment by the Minister today.  Unless this is tightened up and given guidelines on time, we are leaving ourselves open to two things.  We are leaving ourselves open to the court taking as long as it likes in the appointment of an examiner when one <Col N="104" /> resigns &mdash; which seems absolutely crazy &mdash; and we are presumably leaving it open to a new hearing of some sort which is very similar to a petition.  If that stays I want to go on to something else but if it is going to be tightened up I want to leave it.  This is quite important.  Even if we cannot tell the court to appoint an examiner &mdash; which I am sure the Minister is right about &mdash; we can certainly, as we have already done, give it very obvious guidelines and we have done it on previous sections.</P>

I am stuck with that legal position which I cannot budge from at the moment but I will see whether we can find a form of words which meets the Senator's requirements. My intention is clear, that is, that the court will appoint another examiner. That is the Government's clear intention. I want to put that on the record of the House.  I will see if I can find a form of words which will make that clearer but I have to deal with the legal situation as I described and I cannot do that now.

I am concerned that there is not a complete re-opening of the petition, a situation which was there before.  I anticipate that because of the way it is drafted that is exactly what will happen.  I have received submissions on this and it is no coincidence that this should be done, in the event of a resignation, in consultation with interested parties again.  Initially I thought that submission was fair but I would have thought it was absurd that it should be done in consultation with interested parties because then the whole urgency is gone. I would like the Minister to look at it to see if we can redraft it, so it is immediate and urgent.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment. I am pleased that the Minister has <Col N="105" /> seen fit to give the shareholders the opportunity to apply to the court and to question the decisions of an examiner because the running of a company can be very complex.  I wonder what qualifications these examiners will have because they may find it difficult to move in and take decisions and take over the role of directors.  I am pleased that the Minister has built in this safeguard.  It is possible that an examiner may take the wrong decisions which would have an adverse effect on the company.  I am pleased that the Minister has put down this amendment.  It gives the shareholders the opportunity to go to the court and to question the decisions of the examiner.</P>

      <P>In regard to the point raised by Senatory Ryan I must say that I tend to agree with the Minister, but I want to be sure that my interpretation is correct.  Senator Ryan was worried that a company could not go to the courts to question any action or decision of the examiner.  It is my view &mdash; and I am glad he is back to hear it &mdash; that under the previous section, which the Leas-Chathaoirleach does not want us to discuss, he can exercise that power only when he considers that what the company is trying to do is likely to be to the detriment of the company.  When he has considered that, if the examiner still wants to halt the company he will, in the words of the other amendment, &ldquo;take whatever steps are necessary to halt them&rdquo;.  The only steps he could take would be legal steps.  He would have to go to a court to seek an injunction to stop the company seeking the other court to question the examiner.  Therefore, their case would have to be made at that point. It seems to me that there would be access to the court by both the examiner and the company and that a court would decide, if the examiner tried to halt the company by way of an injunction.  He would have to prove that it was &ldquo;subject to the detriment of the company&rdquo;.  It is hard to see how the questioning of the examiner's work by the company could be seen to be to the detriment of the company. <Col N="106" /> Therefore, it seems to me that it concludes and covers the whole situation.  I am satisfied that the fear raised by Senator Ryan is covered by the legislation as it stands.</P>

      <P>In page 117, before section 150, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;(1)  The directors of a company to which an examiner has been appointed shall, within 7 days of the appointment, cause to be made out, verified by affidavit and submitted to the examiner a statement in accordance with this section as to the affairs of the company.</P>
      <P>(2)  The statement shall, in so far as is reasonably possible to do so, show as at the date of the examiner's appointment particulars of the company's assets, debts and liabilities, the names and addresses of its creditors, the securities held by them respectively, the dates when the securities were respectively given and such further information as may be prescribed or as the court may direct.</P>

      <P>I am glad this amendment is proposed because it gives a definite <Col N="107" /> time limit to directors to supply specific information to examiners.  Three months is a very short time if you are talking about the reconstruction of a company. If an examiner has undue delay in getting all the information he or she requires from directors or the people involved in the company, it can have very serious consequences for the viability of the company at the end of the day.  For that reason I think that putting a limit on the time directors have to furnish details of their affairs is not unreasonable in this instance.</P>

      <P>I think it is unnecessary to split the examiners report under section 150, which is in the existing Bill, into two parts.  Indeed, the current division of the matters to be reported on in the current sections 151 and 152 is somewhat arbitrary in some cases and leads to much repetition in others.  For example, it seems to me to be unnecessary to require the name of the company to be specified.  There is too much detail in that.  In addition, there are several <Col N="108" /> refinements that we think need to be made to the various matters listed in the two sections.</P>
      <P>Finally, we are conscious of the need to ensure that the examiner's report and the task of preparing it should not be made too difficult or get in the way of its primary function of recommending ways and means to save the company.  I will just stress again that the role of the examiner is it recommend ways and means of saving the economy.  We must keep that focus in mind all the time.  Overall, sections 151 and 152 should now be combined in one section and amendment No. 224 would &mdash; as well as doing this &mdash; make several amendments along the way. Again, I can give the House full details of those if we need to go through them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 223 would restrict the circulation of the examiner's report under the section.  The report which the examiner prepares will probably contain a considerable amount of sensitive information about the affairs of the company and there seems to be no good reason why this should be made available to the public at large, as it will be, if it is filed in the Companies Registration Office under the present subsection (3).  Indeed, in many situations, publication of this information could have quite disastrous consequences for the company.  While the revised subsection (4) would still allow any interested party to get the report, we think that for the same reasons of confidentiality the courts should be able to abridge the copies of the report going to such parties.</P>
      <P>The amendment would, therefore, do a number of things; first, it would delete the requirement to send the report to the Registrar of Companies; secondly, the company would automatically get a copy without having to apply for it or indeed having to pay for it.  Finally, the court could direct that any copies being sent to interested parties should have certain sensitive information omitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little taken aback as I read the amendment and listen to the Minister.  The section as it stands would require the examiner to send a copy of his report to the Registrar of Companies. Does that automatically mean that it would become public knowledge to all and sundry, in which case I think one can accept that provision without too much difficulty?  The second part of the amendment means that as it stands the Bill proposes that the examiner should supply a copy of his report to the company and any interested party.  &ldquo;Interested party&rdquo;&mdash; as I understand it &mdash; involves creditors, members of the company and employees, under an amendment which I understand the Minister accepted or undertook to <Col N="110" /> insert when I was not here.  That is hardly the whole world and it appears to me that all of those interested parties have a right to know the examiner's views since their own financial, and indeed in the case of employees employment, interests are fundamentally linked up with it, and none of those interested parties, in my view, will have an interest in damaging or harming the company.</P>
      <P>The reason they will have sought this procedure to have this remedy of an examiner introduced is to protect their interests.  That is why they are listed as interested parties because they are worried that their interests will be undermined. It seems to me, therefore, that it is being excessively protective because it could well be that the information that is vital to the interests of some of these interested parties could be deleted.</P>
      <P>I think it is a pity that the courts would have no guidance as to what should be left in or left out.  What would be left out if the employees as an interested party seek a copy of the report?  Will that be different from what the creditor or the banks would seek as an interested party? What would be the criteria the courts would use?  It seems to me that it leaves the courts with an enormous difficulty and also leaves perhaps some of the interested parties, and particularly employees, considerably at risk of getting a less than complete picture of the company on which perhaps their own future depend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is perfectly right in restricting information of this sensitive nature.  I think that the definition of interested party is sufficient to cover the number of people who will get the report in this instance.  The fact that he is removing the obligation to deliver the examiner's report to the Registrar of Companies is a welcome development.  After all, if a company is under examination and various financial details of the company are being examined by an examiner and if it is in the interests of everybody, management, employees, financial institutions etc. that the company is reconstructed and saved, <Col N="111" /> then all that information should be at the discretion of the people directly involved in the company and nobody else.  I do not think it is anybody else's business.  I think the terms of the amendment as proposed here are sufficient to cover it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree on that particular point.  I take Senator Ryan's point about the need for access to this information by the interested parties, but I could foresee a situation, for instance, that one of those listed or interested parties would be the creditors of a company.  Very often people in the same industry or area of work are enmeshed in deals together.  A creditor of a company could be a competitor of the company as well.  If, let us say, the examiner's report contained a detailed breakdown of the company on those aspects of the company's operation which were profitable and those assets which might be stripped to leave it on a narrow base would give, say, a unit cost breakdown which would be of enormous value to a creditor who could also be a competitor, I could certainly see a lot of sense in not having that type of information available to a competitor.</P>
      <P>I would certainly accept that just because a party is an interested party that they should have access to the examiner. The interested parties are in conflict.  The interested party could be the company directors or the company employees. Their main thrust would be to keep this company is operation.  From the employees point of view, it would be to keep all the jobs secure and from the directors point of view, to keep it as profitable as possible.  The creditor's &mdash; also an interested party &mdash; interests in this is to get what he or she is owed &mdash; and if they happen to be a competitor, to bury the company at the same time.  I would certainly see the value in discretionary editing or censorship being allowed.  I certainly believe that we need something like that.  I welcome the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what the Minister has said and disagree with <Col N="112" /> my colleague.  The reason is quite simple. This examiner's report is issued with one simple motive, that is, to save and rescue the company.  I would have thought that any information which is going to leak out and damage or has the potential of damaging that company should be stopped one way or the other.  I am all in favour of free information on all sorts of basis except in this case where if you are a competitor of that company you will want to get hold of that information and you will want to use it in order to once and for all kill the company dead which is already on a fairly rocky basis.</P>
      <P>Obviously the examiner's report is going to contain some highly sensitive information which is confidential, which is presumably about the future trading strategies of the company and which would be invaluable to its competitors.  It is really no good saying we could send it to the creditors or these people because they will not leak it to anybody else.  The answer is, they will.  If we are serious about saving a company as far as I am concerned that sort of information should be restricted to a very limited number of people and only those whose vital interests require that they have it.</P>

      <P>An example strikes me of where this type of thing could lead to insider trading.  I recall that Fóir Teoranta were involved in a public company which was based in the Limerick area some years back and in this sense it is the same operation as an examiner.  They looked at the operation of the company and put forward certain proposals on it. When Fóir Teoranta moved out of that company it was operating successfully, which is an unusual thing at the best of times.  They had put forward a certain set of proposals which meant the liquidation of many of the assets of the company, had redirected it in a different way and get involved in new activities, all of which led to the shares in the company moving from 17p up to something like 285p in seven or eight months.  In effect that is the same operation as insider trading in many ways.  The kind of information that <Col N="113" /> was there would not have done the company any good had it been available to the creditors who were the competitors in this case.  I am happy with the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me pursue my own argument a little bit further for a moment.  I do not want to keep the Minister too long.  The logic and thrust of what my two colleagues have said &mdash; and I understand the Minister agrees &mdash; would end up with the examiner not being able to publish his report at all.  If one begins to worry about the possible damage to the company, the truth is that fundamental damage would be done to the company when it became known that an examiner had been put in.</P>
      <P>I heard over the monitor &mdash; and I do not want to go back over this &mdash; a discussion in which Senator Hogan was concerned that people would not extend credit to the company or would be unlikely to do business with the company if they knew an examiner would be put in because of the risks that would be involved.  The truth is that an examiner is put in because people, either creditors, members of the company, Fóir Teoranta or the employees, are concerned about the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the very least the amendment should have contained a reference to the omission of such parts of the report as the court thinks might or would be damaging to the interests of the company.  It is an extraordinary wide phrase as it stands and it will be very much in the capacity of very persuasive lawyers to persuade the courts that most if not all of a report ought not to be supplied to some people. <Col N="114" /> What are the rights of access of employees if the company have a policy of telling their employees very little about the state of the company?  Is that going to be used to deprive the employees of most of what is in the examiner's report?</P>
    <P>I am not persuaded that it is necessary but if we are going to allow a fairly dramatic retreat from the principle enshrined in the Bill as drafted about publishing the examiner's report, the criteria under which the court should operate ought to be clearly spelled out and if the criterion &mdash; the one that seems to be accepted universally and one that I would not dispute &mdash; is in the interests of the company, a specific reference should be introduced into the Bill to say that &ldquo;where the courts believe that the publication of that information would damage the interests of the company&rdquo;. As it stands it seems that if the courts think that something is not fit to be published for a variety of reasons a lot of legal precedents could be established which could end up effectively restricting the amount of information available to the interested parties.  I do not propose to pursue the matter any further but I ask the Minister to think about it.  It is not something that I would want to make a big issue out of.</P>

      <P>To be frank, this subsection should not have been included in section 153 in its present form since it merely seems to complicate matters unnecessarily.  As currently worded, subsection (6) has the undesirable effect of rendering invalid and ineffectual any of the actions taken by the examiner or any disposition of the company's property <Col N="117" /> undertaken by him under, for example, section 147.  On reflection I think that this approach is somewhat unrealistic since many things may have happened during the protection period before the examiner reports back to the court whether or not his view is that the company can subsequently be saved.  The amendment would, therefore, delete the present section 153 (6) and replace it with a new subsection which would provide that whenever the court made a winding-up order under this Part of the Bill, in other words whether under section 153 or some other section, the winding-up would be deemed to commence on the making of the order and not before, unless the court orders otherwise.  That, perhaps, is a more satisfactory way of dealing with it. It is basically a technical amendment which clarifies and simplifies the date on which winding-up starts.</P>

      <P>This amendment is about notice of meetings and is a technical amendment.  Amendment No. 228 is intended to ensure that the examiner will not in the exercise of his functions be restricted by the Companies Acts provisions about minimum notice of general meetings.  It would obviously be undesirable if, having regard to the very tight time limits within which he has to operate under Part IX, he had to give the usual 21 days notice of general meetings for the purpose of the consideration by shareholders and so on of his rescue proposals. This amendment very much loosens up the time scale and time schedules that would apply in the normal course.</P>

      <P>I have a difficulty with this subsection.  I always worry about taking away support structures or protective structures.  Any of us who have been involved in any kind of organisation of any description knows that nothing causes as much aggravation at an AGM as a person who got his or her notice too late.  There is not one of us here who has not been through that at some time.  Over the years there is plenty of case law to indicate that the courts have declared the decisions of AGMs null and void because the requirements of the by-laws, the rules, the regulations, the Act or whichever it happens to be for calling the AGM have not been complied with.  We are trying to wipe out something which the law has protected over the years.</P>
      <P>If the amendment were to reduce it to some minimum period I would have no difficulty with that but it actually means that a meeting could be called at a day's notice.  That would be totally wrong and unacceptable.  I do not think it is right to remove the 21 days requirement and replace it with anything.  It is not a protection and it is open to abuse.  Maybe it is not open to abuse because that is possibly too strong.  I do not expect that it would be abused but it shows a scant lack of respect for the other people.  It also means that people might get different periods of notice for the meeting and that would be quite acceptable.  I do not believe that it is right to take away the minimum number of days and replace it with nothing.  It is not acceptable.  I have a grave objection to it.</P>

      <P>If the Senator feels strongly about it I will be happy to put in a short number of days which should meet his requirement.  I have no problem with that.  However, we must be clear on what we are trying to do here.  There is no question of giving 21 days' notice out of three months.  We cannot waste it.  It is the guts of a month.  I was proceeding on the basis that the examiner would be in a rescue mood and a rescue situation and would act reasonably.  Considering the number of times in this Bill that we have envisaged the examiner being in and out <Col N="119" /> of court and the number of people who can object ultimately to the report and so on, were the examiner to behave anyway unreasonably he would have the whole house of cards down on top of him.  My impression is that it is good the way it is because the court will not tolerate any sharp practice.  However, if the Senator feels strongly about it I will certainly consider a few days.</P>

      <P>It is very hard to decide the number of days.  The type of company would dictate a great deal.  I would like &ldquo;reasonable notice&rdquo;.  A judgment is made then and the courts decide if it was unreasonable and that means there is a protection in there and people have access to protection and a right to find a remedy.  It gives a remedy to people who have a grievance.  That means that if the court would interpret that a small company with all the people involved in a local area could be called at a day or two's notice, at the same time with a huge public company with shareholders maybe nationwide or worldwide, it would be totally unfair to do it at a day's notice.  I would say then &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole in the remarks he has just made.  A minimum amount of days should be inserted in the Bill.  &ldquo;Reasonable notice&rdquo; is very vague also.

I would be prepared to come back <Col N="120" /> with perhaps &ldquo;three days&rdquo; if that would be acceptable.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 230:</P>
      <P>In page 120, lines 41 to 46, to delete subsections (3) and (4), and substitute the following subsections:</P>
      <P>(3) The examiner shall deliver a copy of his report under this section&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> (a)  to the company on the same day as his delivery of such report to the court,</P>
    <P>(b)  to the registrar of companies within 3 days after such delivery, and</P>
    <P>(c)  to any interested party on written application, provided that such delivery under paragraph (b) or (c) may, if the court so directs, be subject to the omission of such parts of the report as the court thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(4) The court may, in particular, give a direction under subsection (3) if it considers that the inclusion of certain information in the report to be delivered under paragraph (b) or (c) of that subsection would be likely to prejudice the survival of the company, or the whole or any part of its undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 230 would replace subsections (3) and (4) of section 154 and make some changes along the way.  Section 154, as the House knows, deals basically with who gets the plan.  That is the broad picture and how it works.  We propose a definite time limit of three days in this case for delivery of the report to the Registrar of Companies as opposed to the present indefinite &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; phrase that is in legislation. Secondly, the company concerned should get the report on the same day as it is lodged with the court.  Further, the company should not have to apply to the examiner to get it.  Thirdly, the reference to &ldquo;without charge&rdquo; in the present subsection (4) is perhaps unnecessary.  Finally, it has been suggested to me that it is essential that information concerning the company's trading strategies or other confidential information which, if published, would give an unfair advantage to the company's competitors should not be disclosed in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For our part we think the examiner has to be free to include such sensitive matters in his report since to deny him <Col N="123" /> this might prevent him negotiating a rescue plan at all, so we are leaving that to the examiner.  I suggest in this amendment, therefore, as a sort of rider to subsection (3) that the court might be empowered to authorise the omission from the copies going to the registrar and to the interested parties of such matters as the court thinks fit.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have added a new subsection (4) which would effectively give guidance to the court as to when it might consider authorising the publication of an abridged report in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am intrigued by the difference in wording between amendment No. 223 which we discussed earlier and amendment No. 230 about the deletion of information.  I cannot understand the logic behind the differences.  I can understand, even if I do not agree with, the logic behind what was said on amendment No. 230 but we have, for instance, in amendment No. 230 specific reference to information that would be likely to prejudice the survival of the company or the whole or any part of its undertakings, but no such reference was contained in amendment No. 223.  Also, presumably substantial amounts of information about the company which would be contained in the examiner's report will be available through the Companies Office.  We were worried about that under amendment No. 223, so we deleted entirely the requirement to make a report to the Companies Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that if the examiner's report is going to contain more than a simple statement that &ldquo;in my opinion the company or the following sections of it can survive&rdquo; then the courts will have to delete a great deal of information, in which case the report will be meaningless, or what is effectively vital information that may not undermine the position of the company but might be useful to other people will be contained in the report to the Registrar of Companies. <Col N="124" /> Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that amendment No. 230 and amendment No. 223 seem to have similar objectives and ought to have similar wording to be consistent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ryan in that there is a contradiction with what was stated in the previous amendment in regard to the confidential nature of the report of the examiner.  If subsection (3) (b) were to be deleted then we might come near to the terms of the Minister's objective in relation to this amendment. The necessity for an abridged report or leaving out information to the Registrar of Companies is very open to interpretation. It can mean anything.  You could give a summary of the report or very little information to the Registrar of Companies.  Therefore, I do not see the need for it at all.  As Senator Ryan has pointed out, in order to be consistent with the objectives it would have to be similar to the wording in amendment No. 223 to section 150.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I told Senator Ryan that I would think about it.  I have done so and I think the Senator is probably right.  At the time I did not think it needed to be spelt out but it is so clearly put here that perhaps we should just add the same words.  I have no difficulty about that.  As regards leaving it to the court as it thought fit, I was quite happy that that meant that it would take into account the survival of the company as being the primary motive because the whole thrust of this section is the survival of the company.  If it helps to put it in, we will do so.  In other words we will put similar wording back into the section on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>As has been the case all through the discussion on this Bill, the Minister is being extremely reasonable and nobody is going to argue with him. As everybody has said frequently, he has been most forthcoming.  I suggest to him that perhaps the reference to the Registrar of Companies ought to be put in <Col N="125" /> separately and a separate report be made to the Registrar of Companies rather than an edited version of his report which is essentially a confidential report.  Presumably the intention ought to be that no more than a simple statement that in his opinion the company is potentially rescuable ought to be there rather than an edited version, leaving out bits, which could be illogical or which could have failures of logic in it simply because the court would delete certain information, there would be gaps in it and it might not make sense.  It might be better to put in an amendment saying that a separate report containing certain limited information should go to the registrar of companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to consider the option of removing the Registrar of Companies from the report altogether in the basis that that puts it in the public arena.  I may approach it on that basis.  The reason I left it here is that we are talking about the actual plan, whereas in the previous case we were talking about the first report which had many proposals in it.  That was too early a stage for it to get into the public arena. I was not very concerned about it getting into the public arena at the actual survival plan stage because it has been agreed by all parties at that stage.  On reflection I think it might be simpler to keep it away from the Registrar of Companies altogether and in that way it is being deliberately kept out of the public arena. Therefore I think I will do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody commented that this might be a publicity stunt.  I will leave the judgment on that to those I represent and to the House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the establishment of the National Roads Authority.  This is very timely legislation.  Coming from a rural area like Donegal I welcome very enthusiastically the establishment of this new Authority. It is important to get away from the go-stop programme of road development when the local authority are allocated funds annually to carry out road repairs. The spending of the allocation for roads started at the most suitable time of the year, the summertime.  The funds then ran out and the road programme lay abandoned until the following year. Many roads in rural areas have been under repair for five years and this it totally intolerable.  The National Roads Authority will draft a programme for development which will be much more economic, which will get better value for money spent and which will eliminate the go-stop development programme that has been in operation for a long time.  It is an opportune time for somebody who represents a rural area like Donegal to comment on the new development and to express the hope that the National Roads Authority will be national in practice as well as in name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of business people with wide business experience have been mentioned for appointment to the National Roads Authority.  We look forward to a programme that will not discriminate against rural areas.  This is very important. In the past it always has been difficult <Col N="127" /> to accept that there can be high standards of roads and dual carriageways in one part of the country and neglected roads, to the point where funding is not available to fill potholes, in another part. I hope the National Roads Authority will take a global view and take into consideration the difficulties in rural Ireland and upgrade many of our roads.  Roads are a very important infrastructure for tourist development and industrial development.  They are a basic infrastructure, are not a luxury.  If we are true Europeans, by 1992 we certainly hope that our roads will be of European standard. I am talking about all our roads, whether it is the road to Killybegs from which our fish lorries travel all over Europe or otherwise.  We hope that the standard of the road leading to Killybegs will be as good as that leading to Paris. That is not too much to expect.  I hope the establishment of this new National Roads Authority will lead to the development of our roads to an acceptable standard.</P>
    <P>For years people in rural areas have complained that much of the time of local authorities has been taken up discussing the road programme and road allocation. I do not think any local authority in rural Ireland ever received the funding they would like to have received in order to bring the road programme up to an acceptable standard.  Elected members have a very unsatisfactory role to play in so far as the people they represent have justification in complaining about the conditions of the roads and the local authority member has very little influence and very little input.  As everybody knows, the money is allocated from the central authority.  It is only right and proper that the National Roads Authority should be established and be seen to be administering from this centre.  The development of the total road programme will be welcomed by people living in rural Ireland.  The road going from here out past Donnybrook and Stillorgan and on down to Wicklow is carrying very heavy <Col N="128" /> traffic and we must accept that there is a need to have the road developed.  Priority must be given to it because of the amount of traffic on it.  It is very hard for a representative from rural Ireland to drive out that road and see Dublin Corporation or the Dublin County Council with their van planting flowers and drive back to his own county and see the standard of roads and the lack of funding.  That is the sort of feedback that has been coming from county councils and local authorities all over Ireland.  We are aware that there has been a difficulty with funding but hopefully this new National Roads Authority will be able to raise sufficient money by getting loans and EC assistance to solve our overall road problems.  Rural Ireland stands to gain most.  If we say that tourism is highly successful in Dublin and in the south of Ireland, we are told that the condition of the roads influences where the tourist travels.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of this new Authority.  I hope they will look at the national problem and ensure that no part of the country is left out.  The whole island should be looked at.  The opportunities are now great.  I hope the Minister will bring to the attention of the National Roads Authority the need for them to examine the total programme and to allocate a fair share of funding to rural Ireland, including my own county of Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the roads Authority. I have no doubt that they are very necessary.  As a rural councillor I am worried about some aspects.  I have no doubt that we will end up with better national primary routes, but there is a grave danger that we will end up with much poorer county roads.  The councils have been doing this job for quite some time.  Their biggest problem was not being able to continue because they get only so much money each year.  The same <Col N="129" /> set of machinery was used for both the county roads and the national primary routes.  Now with the roads Authority moving in, and I know the council will act as agents, there is a danger that this will go out to contract and that the council may not be able to maintain the machinery and, as a result, the county roads will suffer.  It may also mean that we will have fewer people employed by the council because they will be unable to keep on those people and our county roads will again suffer.</P>
      <P>We all know that the better the national primary roads are the heavier the traffic on them will be and that traffic eventually moves on to the county roads to finally deliver its load.  While I welcome better national primary routes, I would not like to see a situation in which our councils would suffer badly and where the county roads would suffer very badly.  I hope the Minister will take cognisance of this and ensure that the councils get sufficient funds to enable them to maintain and improve our county roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always felt that the moneys were not distributed fairly in rural areas.  The money should be given on the basis of mileage rather than density of population. We have so many miles of road and so few people living near them. Nevertheless, there is a huge amount of traffic on them and it is not easy to keep them repaired.  At present we have problems with roads in many parts of the country particularly in the west where the foundations of some of the county roads are not very powerful because they go through bogs and soggy land in many cases.  It is not easy to keep them maintained because heavy traffic vibrates them and breaks them up and causes great trouble.  We have the same thing in frosty weather and, because of the soggy nature of the land, our roads suffer.  The national primary road grant was a separate grant from that for the county roads.  Nevertheless, it helped to share the burden of the cost of employment and of machinery and in that way we <Col N="130" /> were able to do a reasonable job on our county roads.</P>
    <P>I note that the council will act as agents to acquire the land.  The roads Authority could move in and do a good job in acquiring land because, as we all know, at present the law is not strong enough. One farmer can hold the whole thing up to ransom and we have seen that happen around Ireland for many years.  The Minister should bring in some system whereby the roads Authority would have the right to go through and make the road and settle the problem afterwards by one process or another.  This is one of the things that has bedevilled county councils in trying to make roads.  They get so far and then someone says they want a stone wall or a block wall where it was already agreed to put a wire fence or a railing. All those things can cause a lot of hassle and the sad thing is they hold up the work.  The new roads Authority should come to grips with that problem.  That is one of the biggest hazards in making new roads.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Authority.  I am disappointed that there is no public representative on the new board.  They are all officials of one kind or another.  I know the chairman is a very able man.  I am glad to see that the road hauliers are represented as well but I would like to see some member of the local authority, or elected representative on it too.  We have a role to play and we have been by-passed.  I am disappointed that local authority members were by-passed and that they have no role to play.  Perhaps as time goes on there might be some way, through sub-committees or otherwise, in which they could play a role.  Many of those people have valuable experience and could contribute in a big way towards giving advice and assistance to the roads Authority rather than having the Authority aloof from the action.  I would like to see them represented on the Authority. Perhaps at some time the Minister might consider that because we are inclined to move away from giving local authority <Col N="131" /> members any say in anything.  We are inclined to think that if we put in plenty of bureaucrats and civil servants they will do a good job, but we must remember that our county councillors have stood the test of time and they should be recognised in a very practical manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am grateful to Senator McGowan for raising the recent establishment of the National Roads Authority on the Adjournment as it gives me an opportunity on behalf of the Government to outline to the Seanad the purpose and functions of the Authority.</P>
      <P>As Senators are aware, the National Roads Authority was established on 19 July last and will have responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of national roads and access roads to our principal ports and airports.  The national roads, and I think this is worth repeating, are the main links between our major towns, cities, ports and airports.  They are the backbone of our inland transport system.  They represent one-eighteenth of our total road mileage, but account for one-third of all travel on our roads.  Two-thirds of the traffic on national roads is work-related.  Industry, agriculture, tourism, mariculture, forestry and so on depend on them.  We simply need them to get raw materials from port to factory and to transport finished products to points of export.  In short, the national roads are a major part of our strategic national infrastructure along with water and sewerage, telecommunications, energy and so on.  They are just as important as those categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators do not need to be reminded that our national roads are seriously deficient.  You will be as aware as I am of the many bottlenecks, bad road surfaces, poor alignments and accident blackspots throughout the country.  The development of our national roads makes economic sense because it will contribute to a <Col N="132" /> significant reduction of transport costs, thereby improving the competitive position of Irish industry &mdash; a subject very close to my heart.</P>
    <P>The Authority faces a major challenge in both developing the national road network and in preserving the investment already made.  I shall stress that the Department of the Environment have estimated that we need to spend £2.2 billion on the improvement of our national roads, a further £300 million on improving strategic roads in major urban areas and an additional £800 million on the maintenance and renewal of the existing network of national roads.  That investment needs to be made over the next 20 years at the outside and ideally and preferably over the next ten to 15 years &mdash; as our financial circumstances permit &mdash; but we must make that investment and we will make that investment. Let me add that the Department's overall review of road needs across the entire network of national, regional, county and urban roads identified broad expenditure needs of £8.5 billion over a period of 20 years.</P>
    <P>The Authority will operate initially on a non-statutory basis.  Legislation will be required in due course to establish the National Roads Authority on a statutory footing.  However, the Authority will be able to operate effectively for a period without a specific legislative framework and it is, therefore, proposed to wait some months before commencing the detailed drafting of the necessary Bill. When the Authority has been operating for a while, we will all be in a better position and get a feel for it and, therefore, to draft the specified legislation required.</P>
    <P>I would like briefly to outline the main functions of the Authority which are fivefold.  First, it will do the future strategic planning for national roads.  The Authority will be asked to prepare regular medium-term plans for the development of this network.  Once each plan has been approved by the Minister, it will <Col N="133" /> provide the framework for the Authority's work over a period.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it will look after the expenditure of State funds for national roads. It will make recommendations each year as to the allocation of State road improvement and maintenance grants and once allocations have been approved by the Minister the National Roads Authority will administer and pay the grants.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it will make arrangements for the design of road improvement projects and for the placing of construction contracts.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, it will have an important role to play in promoting the case for EC funding of the development of the network of national roads, subject to coordination by the Departments of the Environment and Finance.</P>
    <P>The decisions taken by the European Council in February last on the implementation of the Single European Act and in particular the decision to double the resources of the Structural Funds by 1992 in the case of the least prosperous regions, including Ireland, and to increase the maximum rate of grant aid to 75 per cent will have a major impact on this country.  We simply have to do everything we can to maximise EC financial assistance for roads and we are doing that.  The ground work has already been done with the approval of £194 million in EC aid last December on foot of a national programme of community interest on road development for the period 1986 to 1990, which was prepared by the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, the Authority will promote private investment in roads and negotiate the best possible terms.  Borrowing by the Authority will be subject to ministerial consent.</P>
    <P>As its first and most urgent task, the Authority was asked for its views on the draft Blueprint for Road Development by 12 September.  I am pleased to be able to tell the Seanad that the Authority complied with that deadline and provided useful and constructive comments, which are now being assessed.  It is planned to <Col N="134" /> publish the blueprint before the end of the year and we will then have a comprehensive statement of Government roads policy which will provide a framework for the activities of local authorities and the Authority and the formal basis for maximising EC financial assistance.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to comment briefly on the role of local authorities now that the National Roads Authority has been set up.  This was referred to by Senator Farrell. Local authorities will continue to have an important role in the development of national roads.  They will continue to own, maintain and manage these roads and to acquire land by agreement and compulsorily.  They will normally act on behalf of the National Roads Authority in the design of improvement projects and in the supervision of contracts. Most importantly, local authorities will continue to have full responsibility for non-national roads, which account for 94 per cent of our total road mileage.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority has a wide-ranging membership with relevant expertise and experience drawn from Government Departments, the construction and haulage industry and the financial and legal professions.  I should say at this stage that I take on board Senator Farrell's constructive and well-meant criticism about the role of the public representative at local level and I certainly will make sure that the Minister for the Environment is made aware of the Senator's interest in that matter.  As I have said already, the National Roads Authority face a major task and I believe that they have the capacity to respond effectively to that challenge.</P>
    <P>Let me make one final comment.  The decision to establish the National Roads Authority is particularly timely given the gathering momentum towards the creation of a single market by 1992.  The Authority, through its work on the development of the national road network, can play a very significant part in improving industrial competitiveness in the 1992 context and is well placed to benefit from the increased levels of funding <Col N="135" /> which will become available from the EC Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, my sincere thanks to Senator McGowan for giving me, on behalf of the Government, the opportunity to spell out the role of the National Roads Authority this evening.  I think it is very timely and important that we <Col N="136" /> should spell it out just now and my thanks also to Senator Farrell for his very constructive criticisms which are taken very much in that fashion.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 22 September 1988.</P>
